25|$|<b>Haloclines,</b> or strong, {{vertical}} salinity gradients.

25|$|The {{stratification}} {{in a lake}} is {{not always}} the result of variation to density because of thermal gradients. Stratification within a lake can also be the result of differences in density resulting from gradients in salinity. In case of a difference in salinity, the hypolimnion and epilimnion are separated not by a thermocline but by a <b>halocline,</b> which is sometimes referred to as a chemocline.|$|E
25|$|A zone {{of rapid}} {{salinity}} increase with depth {{is called a}} <b>halocline.</b> The temperature of maximum density of seawater decreases as its salt content increases. Freezing temperature of water decreases with salinity, and boiling temperature of water increases with salinity. Typical seawater freezes at around −1.9nbsp&°C at atmospheric pressure. If precipitation exceeds evaporation, {{as is the case}} in polar and temperate regions, salinity will be lower. If evaporation exceeds precipitation, {{as is the case in}} tropical regions, salinity will be higher. Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions.|$|E

40|$|To {{extend the}} {{knowledge}} of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) habitats, bacterial communities were examined in two hypersaline sulphidic basins in Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The 2 m thick seawater-brine <b>haloclines</b> of the deep anoxic hypersaline basins Bannock and L'Atalante were sampled in intervals of 10 cm with increasing salinity. 15 N isotope pairing incubation experiments showed the production of 29 N 2 and 30 N 2 gases in the chemoclines, ranging from 6. 0 to 9. 2 % salinity of the L'Atalante basin. Potential anammox rates ranged from 2. 52 to 49. 65 nmol N 2 L- 1 day- 1 while denitrification was a major N 2 production pathway, accounting for more than 85. 5 % of total N 2 production. Anammox-related 16 S rRNA genes were detected along the L'Atalante and Bannock <b>haloclines</b> up to 24 % salinity, and the amplification of the hydrazine synthase genes (hzsA) further confirmed the presence of anammox bacteria in Bannock. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation and sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA genes identified representatives of the marine anammox genus 'Candidatus Scalindua' and putatively new operational taxonomic units closely affiliated to sequences retrieved in marine environments that have documented anammox activity. 'Scalindua brodae' like sequences constituted up to 84. 4 % of the sequences retrieved from Bannock. The anammox community in L'Atalante was different than in Bannock and was stratified according to salinity increase. This study putatively extends anammox bacterial habitats to extremely saline sulphidic ecosystems...|$|R

2500|$|In {{large parts}} of the Arctic Ocean, the top layer (about [...] ) is of lower {{salinity}} and lower temperature than the rest. It remains relatively stable, because the salinity effect on density is bigger than the temperature effect. It is fed by the freshwater input of the big Siberian and Canadian streams (Ob, Yenisei, Lena, Mackenzie), the water of which quasi floats on the saltier, denser, deeper ocean water. Between this lower salinity layer and the bulk of the ocean lies the so-called <b>halocline,</b> in which both salinity and temperature are rising with increasing depth.|$|E
2500|$|Water enters {{from both}} the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and {{can be divided into}} three unique water masses. The deepest water mass is called Arctic Bottom Water and begins around [...] depth. It is {{composed}} of the densest water in the World Ocean and has two main sources: Arctic shelf water and Greenland Sea Deep Water. Water in the shelf region that begins as inflow from the Pacific passes through the narrow Bering Strait at an average rate of 0.8 Sverdrups and reaches the Chukchi Sea. [...] During the winter, cold Alaskan winds blow over the Chukchi Sea, freezing the surface water and pushing this newly formed ice out to the Pacific. The speed of the ice drift is roughly 1–4cm/s. This process leaves dense, salty waters in the sea that sink over the continental shelf into the western Arctic Ocean and create a <b>halocline.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the depth}} range of [...] is a water mass {{referred}} to as Atlantic Water. Inflow from the North Atlantic Current enters through the Fram Strait, cooling and sinking to form the deepest layer of the <b>halocline,</b> where it circles the Arctic Basin counter-clockwise. [...] This is the highest volumetric inflow to the Arctic Ocean, equalling about 10 {{times that of the}} Pacific inflow, and it creates the Arctic Ocean Boundary Current. It flows slowly, at about 0.02m/s. Atlantic Water has the same salinity as Arctic Bottom Water but is much warmer (up to 3°C). In fact, this water mass is actually warmer than the surface water, and remains submerged only due to the role of salinity in density. [...] When water reaches the basin it is pushed by strong winds into a large circular current called the Beaufort Gyre. Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers.|$|E

Here, we present evidence suggesting that in certain oxygen-depleted marine water-column habitats, the majority of microbial eukaryotes are also associated with prokaryotic cells. Ciliates (protists) associated with bacteria were found to be the dominant eukaryotic morphotype in the <b>haloclines</b> of two different deep-sea hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. These findings are compared to associations between ciliates and bacteria documented from the permanently anoxic waters of the Cariaco Basin (Caribbean Sea).

In conjunction with the temperature, salinity and depth analysis, water mass properties were also investigated, and T-S diagrams were used to identify the water mass movement and formation.

40|$|Although hypersaline environments pose {{challenges}} to life {{because of the}} low water content (water activity), many such habitats appear to support eukaryotic microbes. This contribution presents brief reviews of our current knowledge on eukaryotes of water-column <b>haloclines</b> and brines from Deep Hypersaline Anoxic Basins (DHABs) of the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as shallow-water hypersaline microbial mats in solar salterns of Guerrero Negro, Mexico and benthic microbialite communities from Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Western Australia. New data on eukaryotic diversity from Shark Bay microbialites indicates eukaryotes are more diverse than previously reported. Although this comparison shows that eukaryotic communities in hypersaline habitats with varying physicochemical characteristics are unique, several groups are commonly found, including diverse alveolates, strameonopiles, and fungi, as well as radiolaria. Many eukaryote sequences (SSU) in both regions also have no close homologues in public databases, suggesting that these environments host unique microbial eukaryote assemblages {{with the potential to}} enhance our understanding of the capacity of eukaryotes to adapt to hypersaline conditions...|$|R

Short-term along-channel density structure was controlled by both tides and wind. Density stratification increased at the south end increased during flood tides, and at the north end and mid-channel during ebb tides. The depth and width of the pycnocline {{at the southern end of}} the channel were correlated to tidal height.

In 2007 zooplankton were collected at three sites and two depths over 5 non-consecutive months along the continental shelf and slope off Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Chaetognaths were identified to species, enumerated and the densities were compared to temperature and salinity data acquired during sampling events.

40|$|Data on {{the species}} {{compositions}} and the ages, sizes, reproductive biology, habitats and diets {{of the main}} species in the ichthyofaunas of seven estuaries in temperate southwestern Australia have been collated. Twenty-two species spawn in these estuaries, of which 21 complete their lifecycles in the estuary. The latter group, which includes several species of atherinids and gobies with short lifecycles, make far greater contributions to the total numbers of fish in the shallows of these estuaries than in those of holarctic estuaries, such as the Severn Estuary in the United Kingdom. This is presumably related in part to far less extreme tidal water movements {{and the maintenance of}} relatively high salinities during the dry summers, and thus to more favourable conditions for spawning and larval development. However, since estuaries in southwestern Australia have tended to become closed for periods, there would presumably also have been selection pressures in favour of any members of marine species that were able to spawn in an estuary when that estuary became landlocked. Furthermore, the deep saline waters, under the marked <b>haloclines</b> that form in certain regions during heavy freshwater discharge in winter, act as refugia for certain estuarine species. The contributions of estuarine-spawning species to total fish numbers in the shallows varied markedly from 33 or 34 % in two permanently open estuaries to ≥ 95 % in an intermittently open estuary, a seasonally closed estuary and a permanently open estuary on the south coast, in which recruitment of the 0 + age class of marine species was poor. The larger estuarine species can live for several years and reach total lengths of ~ 700 mm and some estuarine species move out into deeper waters as they increase in size. Several marine species use southwestern Australian estuaries as nursery areas for protracted periods. However, sudden, marked increases in freshwater discharge in winter and resultant precipitous declines in salinity in the shallows, and in other regions where <b>haloclines</b> are not formed, are frequently accompanied by rapid and pronounced changes in ichthyofaunal composition, partly due to the emigration of certain marine species. In contrast, the ichthyofaunal compositions of macrotidal holarctic estuaries undergo annual, cyclical changes, due largely to the sequential entry of the juveniles of different marine species for short periods. The ichthyofaunal compositions of the narrow entrance channels, wide basins and saline riverine reaches of large, permanently open southwestern Australian estuaries vary, reflecting the marked tendency for some species to be restricted mainly to one or two of these regions. Comparative data indicate that the characteristics determined for ichthyofaunas in southwestern Australian estuaries apply in general to estuaries elsewhere in temperate Australia...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} Bannock basin has been studied in some detail 1, 2. We recently showed that unusual microbial populations, including a new division of Archaea (MSBL 1) 3, inhabit the NaCl-rich hypersaline brine. High salinities tend to reduce biodiversity 4, but when brines {{come into contact with}} fresher water the natural <b>haloclines</b> formed frequently contain gradients of other chemicals, including permutations of electron donors and acceptors, that may enhance microbial diversity, activity and biogeochemical cycling 5, 6. Here we report a 2. 5 -m-thick chemocline with a steep NaCl gradient at 3. 3 km within the water column betweeen Bannock anoxic hypersaline brine 7 and overlying sea water. The chemocline supports some of the most biomass-rich and active microbial communities in the deep sea, dominated by Bacteria rather than Archaea, and including four major new divisions of Bacteria. Significantly higher metabolic activities were measured in the chemocline than in the overlying sea water and underlying brine; functional analyses indicate that a range of biological processes is likely to occur in the chemocline. Many prokaryotic taxa, including the phylogenetically new groups, were confined to defined salinities, and collectively formed a diverse, sharply stratified, deep-sea ecosystem with sufficient biomass to potentially contribute to organic geological deposits. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations {{of oxygen}} (O 2 ) and other {{dissolved}} {{gases in the}} oceanic mixed layer are often used to calculate air-sea gas exchange fluxes. The mixed layer depth (zmix) may be defined using criteria based on temperature or density differences to a reference depth near the ocean surface. However, temperature criteria fail in regions with strong <b>haloclines</b> such as the Southern Ocean where heat, freshwater and momentum fluxes interact to establish mixed layers. Moreover, the time scales of air-sea exchange differ for gases and heat, so that zmix defined using oxygen may be different than zmix defined using temperature or density. Here, we propose to define an O 2 -based mixed layer depth, zmix(O 2 ), as the depth where the relative difference between the O 2 concentration and a reference value at a depth equivalent to 10 dbar equals 0. 5 %. This definition was established by analysis of O 2 profiles from the Bellingshausen Sea (west of the Antarctic Peninsula) and corroborated by visual inspection. Comparisons of zmix(O 2 ) with zmix based on potential temperature differences, i. e., zmix(0. 2 °C) and zmix(0. 5 °C), and potential density differences, i. e., zmix(0. 03 kg m&minus; 3 ) and zmix(0. 125 kg m&minus; 3 ), showed that zmix(O 2 ) closely follows zmix(0. 03 kg m&minus; 3 ). Further comparisons with published zmix climatologies and zmix derived from World Ocean Atlas 2005 data were also performed. To establish zmix for use with biological production estimates {{in the absence of}} O 2 profiles, we suggest using zmix(0. 03 kg m&minus; 3 ), which is also the basis for the climatology by de Boyer Montégut et al.

40|$|Deoxygenation events {{within the}} Swan-Canning Estuary are a severe and {{potentially}} lethal {{threat to the}} resident aquatic fauna and an ongoing concern for management. Hypoxic conditions develop in the upper estuary following heavy rainfall events that deliver an influx of freshwater into the system, stratifying the water column. When tidally driven seawater and freshwater discharge meet, <b>haloclines</b> are formed, creating a barrier to vertical mixing. Organisms living within the stratified bottom waters can rapidly deplete oxygen reserves, eventually causing the lower layers to become hypoxic. The frequency and severity of these events are projected to increase due to climate change as associated reductions in surface runoff reduce river flow (a remediate of hypoxia) and allow deeper penetration of the marine salt wedge, causing prolonged and more intense stratification of the system. In response to this threat, artificial oxygenation plants have been installed in two regions of the upper estuary known to experience hypoxic conditions most frequently {{in an attempt to}} maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations appropriate for fauna. Using acoustic telemetry, we tracked fifty-five Acanthopagrus butcheri over a 116 -day period between autumn and winter with the aim to relate the patterns of movement (including residency, habitat use and movements on daily and seasonal scales) to a suite of environmental variables commonly associated with the movement of fishes in estuaries, and determine whether the spatial residency of this species is influenced by the operation of the artificial oxygenation plants.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Water column characteristics of three coastal cave systems in Quintana Roo, Mexico on the Yucatan Peninsula were profiled from January 1996 to July 1997. A Hydrolab Data Sonde 3 Multiprobe Logger was used to acquire in situ water column data on temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH of the caves. Water columns were divided into three zones, brackish, transition, and saline, and a new method was employed to define these boundaries by using "best it" calculations and subsequent regression coefficients for comparisons. Profiled Hydrolab data displayed the striking and perennially stratified nature of these cave systems while statistical analyses revealed their highly dynamic character. Temperature profiles remained stable and persistent throughout the study. In these systems the presence of a thermal discontinuity or thermocline, is the norm. Salinity profiles exhibited sharp density gradients, or <b>haloclines,</b> one to three meters in thickness. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were consistently low and revealed negative heterograde oxygen curves, otherwise known as oxygen minima, residing at the transition zone. Hydrogen ion concentrations (pH) varied and also displayed a marked decrease at the transition zone. Transition zone thickness changed considerably over time and from system to system.

40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{instability}} of the thermohaline circulation has been widely observed in numerical ocean models, theoretical advances have been hindered by the nonlinearity of heat and salt transports, a circulation governed by lateral temperature, and salinity gradients. Because {{the instability}} occurs initially in polar waters through the formation of <b>haloclines</b> and the halt of convection, any explanatory model must {{have at least a}} surface and a deep layer. The model proposed here (two surface boxes above a deep one) reduces to a 2 degrees-of-freedom dynamical system when convection is active and 3 degrees when it is interrupted. The instability that is induced by a negative freshwater perturbation in polar waters has three stages. The first stage is a rapid 5 -yr adjustment to a transient thermal attractor that results from an approximate balance between heat advection and air–sea heat fluxes. The second stage is a slow evolution that self-organizes near this attractor, which preconditions the instability, as it can be shown that the circulation becomes more sensitive to changes in salinity gradients than in temperature gradients. The slow O(100 yr) growth of salinity in the subtropics is the critical precursor of the instability {{while at the same time}} the subpolar salinity rises against the initial perturbation to stabilize the system by increasing the overturning and restoring convection. When the overturning becomes smaller than the value at the unstable fixed point, the third stage occurs, which is when the subpolar salinity decreases at last on a fast O(10 yr) time scale, precipitating the fall of the overturning. During the last two stages of the instability, the horizontal thermal gradient increases, but its stabilizing effect is just barely unable to prevent the outcome. The return to stability occurs frequently through a regime of multidecadal oscillations with intermittent convection. The hypothesis of mixed boundary conditions has been relaxed by coupling the ocean box model to an atmospheric energy balance model to show that the coupling increases the stability of the oceanic circulation; however, the precursors of the instability are unchanged...|$|R
