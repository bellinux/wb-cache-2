A diaphragm on the plate applies a lateral force to the soil materials and measures the strain induced for various levels of applied stress at the desired depth interval.|$|E
25|$|At rest lateral earth pressure, {{represented}} as K0, is the in situ lateral pressure. It {{can be measured}} directly by a <b>dilatometer</b> test (DMT) or a borehole pressuremeter test (PMT). As these are rather expensive tests, empirical relations have been created in order to predict at rest pressure with less involved soil testing, and relate to the angle of shearing resistance. Two of the more commonly used are presented below.|$|E
50|$|An optical <b>dilatometer</b> is a {{non-contact}} device able {{to measure}} thermal expansions or sintering kinetics {{of any kind}} of materials, unlike traditional push rod <b>dilatometer,</b> it can push up to the dilatometric softening of the specimen. It is a device for measuring changes in the dimensions of a specimen, optically, the achieved resolution can result in greater values than those of a conventional pushrod <b>dilatometer.</b> A monochromatic light source, such as a laser, illuminates the specimen. Some of the light is reflected by the specimen and interferes with the incoming light, creating optical interference fringes. As the specimen contracts or expands, there is a proportional movement of the interference fringes, which can be measured using a camera system. The measurement resolution is determined by the wavelength of the light, and is typically 0.5 μm for blue light. Optical dilatometers are used to measure thermal expansion. The optical <b>dilatometer</b> is in fact complementary to the traditional higher resolution push rod <b>dilatometer</b> when it comes to measure dimensional changes of materials, as a function of temperature, and no contact between specimen and instrument is required.|$|E
50|$|Optical <b>dilatometers</b> {{are used}} along {{traditional}} <b>dilatometers</b> in ceramics for non-destructive testing of a sample's behavior during a thermal treatment. Optical <b>dilatometers</b> {{are used for}} thermal analysis of various types of materials, such as incoherent materials (expansion and contraction of an incoherent granular frit, as applied, for example, on raw tiles) and polymers (behaviour above the glass transition temperature, where the surface tension starts pulling the edges and making the sample shrink), {{as well as for}} analysis of various processes in materials manufacturing, for example, sintering kinetics, thermal expansion and sintering behaviour of thin glaze layer or polymer thin films.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] <b>dilatometer</b> [...] is a {{scientific}} instrument that measures volume changes {{caused by a}} physical or chemical process. A familiar application of a <b>dilatometer</b> is the mercury-in-glass thermometer, in which the change in volume of the liquid column is read from a graduated scale.

5000|$|Capacitance <b>dilatometers</b> {{possess a}} {{parallel}} plate capacitor with a one stationary plate, and one moveable plate. When the sample length changes, it moves the moveable plate, which changes {{the gap between}} the plates. The capacitance is inversely proportional to the gap.

40|$|Volume {{relaxation}} of amorphous selenium (a-Se) was studied by mercury dilatometry. Two differently constructed <b>dilatometers</b> (different sensitivity of sample volume change and different values of characteristics time constants of the <b>dilatometers)</b> {{were used to}} study the influence of experimental setting on the relaxation measurements. Temperature of glass transition and thermal expansion coefficients in glassy and undercooled liquid state were determined from nonisothermal experiments. Four sets of isothermal experiments including temperature down-jump, up-jump and combined experiments were performed to study the volume relaxation. The Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan model was applied to describe the relaxation behavior of a-Se. All four sets of isothermal experiments were described using one set of TNM parameters. The combined experiments {{were considered to be}} most suitable for studying the structural relaxation because of the minimum of the information lost {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. The reaction of a-Se and mercury was found not ot be influencing the results of volume relaxation measurements...|$|R

The final product after sintering at 1050 degrees C, characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray dispersive energy, indicates the presence of a vitreous phase containing phosphorus, which explains the good sintering properties of the studied calcined sludge, as shown from its HMTA dimensional change curve...|$|R
30|$|The {{autogenous}} deformation {{was measured}} by a special measuring technique developed by Jensen and Hansen (Jensen and Hansen 1995). Linear measurements of autogenous deformation with digital <b>dilatometers</b> were performed. The dilatometric technique has been tested during years of research work on binder phases of HPC (Jensen and Hansen 2002; Jensen and Hansen 1995; Jensen and Hansen 1993; Jensen and Hansen 1999). A particular characteristic of this measuring technique is the encapsulation of the hardening cement-based material in a specially designed, corrugated polyethylene mould; this effectively prevents moisture loss and ensures insignificant restraint during the hardening of the specimen. The employed technique is computer-controlled, and allows measurements immediately after casting, but its use is limited to aggregates with maximum size of 2.5  mm. For this reason mortar specimens were used in this work.|$|R

Previous research has demonstrated that subtle ground deformation occurs prior to the eruptions of some volcanoes, as has been observed using vault-housed extensometers at Sakurajima in Japan (e.g., Kamo and Ishihara, 1986; Ishihara, 1990; Iguchi et al., 2008) and Piton de la Fournaise in the Réunion Islands (Peltier et al., 2007), and by high-precision tiltmeters and <b>dilatometers</b> at the Soufrière Hills volcano on Montserrat (Voight et al., 1998, 1999, 2010; Druitt et al., 2002; Chardot et al., 2010; Linde et al., 2010). Measuring and studying such deformations are clearly important if we are to understand the eruption processes of volcanoes.|$|R
