5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically <b>envisions</b> <b>a</b> dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E

This change is a result of the capabilities of word processing, which allows for the swift and simple revision of text, and the digital networking, which enables linking, reader commentary, and version control. By releasing text to be read and commented upon online authorship becomes ongoing, process-oriented work taking place in a community of interested readers.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 2002, {{in celebration}} of the City of Klaipėda's 750th anniversary, a museum was opened at the castle. The museum {{is located in the}} Prince Fredric chamber under the bastion, where {{artillery}} was stored in the 17th century. Visitors may familiarize themselves with the excavated findings, view the authentic remaining sections of the castle, and follow its historical development. The City of Klaipėda, in partnership with the European Network of National Heritage Organisations, <b>envisions</b> <b>a</b> re-integration of the castle and its surroundings with the Old Town and the Curonian Lagoon. The castle's site has since become one of Klaipėda's most popular tourist attractions. The annual Klaipėda Castle Jazz Festival is held on the grounds.|$|E

500|$|Wilde was {{concerned}} about the effect of moralising on art, he believed in art's redemptive, developmental powers: [...] "Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man {{to the level of a}} machine." [...] In his only political text, The Soul of Man Under Socialism, he argued political conditions should establish this primacy, and concluded that the government most amenable to artists was no government at all. Wilde <b>envisions</b> <b>a</b> society where mechanisation has freed human effort from the burden of necessity, effort which can instead be expended on artistic creation. George Orwell summarised, [...] "In effect, the world will be populated by artists, each striving after perfection in the way that seems best to him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{religious}} studies scholar Jeffrey Kaplan stated that McNallen's politics [...] "fit comfortably {{into the right}} wing of the political spectrum", although added that in the Heathen community McNallen [...] "suddenly becomes very much the man of the centre [...] and is thus a legitimate target for both sides." [...] The historian of religion Mattias Gardell characterized McNallen as a libertarian. McNallen rejects the descriptor [...] "conservative", expressing the view that there is little in modern Western society worthy of conserving. McNallen <b>envisions</b> <b>a</b> future stateless American confederacy based on ecologically sustainable, decentralized tribal groups. He has also expressed support for all ethnic separatist movements across the world, including those of the Tibetan, Igbo, Karen, and Afrikaner people. This has attracted criticism from the racial extremist wing of the Heathen community, who have claimed that it detracts from the focus on the white or Aryan struggle against other racial groups. According to Katja Lane, co-founder of the extreme racialist Wotansvolk, McNallen is [...] "promoting everything BUT the Aryan cause." [...] However, in writings and YouTube videos, Stephen McNallen has spoken favorably of Wotanism and the Fourteen Words, networking with Red Ice TV, a social media outlet of the Alt Right. In early 2017, the Asatru Folk Assembly updated its Declaration of Purpose. The primary change in the document was [...] "Northern European Folk" [...] being changed to [...] "Ethnic European Folk" [...] with an indication in text of that meaning white people.|$|E
