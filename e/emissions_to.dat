The system also reduces carbon dioxide <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> zero; UNIT requested the Doctor's help because {{the technology is}} not contemporary and might be alien.

5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
5|$|The field {{selected}} for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It {{had to be at}} a high galactic latitude, because dust and obscuring matter in the plane of the Milky Way's disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of visible light (such as foreground stars), and infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray <b>emissions,</b> <b>to</b> facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background infrared 'cirrus', the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas (H I regions).|$|E
5|$|The second {{presentation}} {{was given by}} a representative of Scout Moor Wind Farm, who argued the need for Britain to produce clean green power without harmful <b>emissions,</b> <b>to</b> counter the increasing dangers of global warming. He {{went on to say}} that the UK has fewer wind farms than other major industrial countries in Europe, even though it is a windier country, and that North West England has a particularly poor record, with only 1.3% of electricity generated from renewable energy. Following this meeting the campaign to oppose the proposal gathered momentum, and in November 2003 a protest was held on the moor, led by environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy.|$|E
40|$|An {{inventory}} of chromium emission {{into the atmosphere}} and water from anthropogenic activities in China was compiled for 1990 through to 2009. We estimate that the total <b>emission</b> of chromium <b>to</b> the atmosphere is about 1. 92 × 10 ⁵ t. Coal and oil combustion were the two leading sources of chromium <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> the atmosphere in China, while the contribution of them showed opposite annual growth trend. In total, nearly 1. 34 × 10 ⁴ t of chromium was discharged to water, mainly from six industrial categories in 20 years. Among them, the metal fabrication industry and the leather tanning sector were the dominant sources of chromium emissions, accounting for approximately 68. 0 % and 20. 0 % of the total emissions and representing increases of 15. 6 % and 10. 3 % annually, respectively. The spatial trends of Cr emissions show significant variation based on <b>emissions</b> from 2005 <b>to</b> 2009. The <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> the atmosphere was heaviest in Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Shanxi, whose annual emissions reached more than 1000 t for {{the high level of}} coal and oil consumption. In terms of <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> water, the largest contributors were Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong and Zhejiang, where most of the leather production and metal manufacturing occur and these four regions accounted for nearly 47. 4 % of the total <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> water...|$|R
