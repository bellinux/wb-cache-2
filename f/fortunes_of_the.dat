5|$|While many of {{the moves}} made by Grand Met were {{successful}} in generating additional sales and growth, the company continued to experience problems. While Fortune Magazine named CEO Gibbons as its Turnaround Champion for his success in reversing the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, several news outlets claimed that the changes he introduced were problematic because they deprived the company of valuable assets.|$|E
5|$|In Bulgaria, the {{two decades}} {{following}} the end of the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the Second Empire. The reigns of George Terter I (r. 1280–1292) and his successor Smilets (r. 1292–1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates. Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions. The <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country changed for the better under George Terter I's son, Theordore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1321), when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity.|$|E

5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} {{took place}} in the Lower or Middle town area following a fire in 1791. In that year a Carrara marble statue of Queen Anne, sculpted by Francis Bird was presented to the town by Sir Jacob Bancks, who served as the local Member of Parliament from 1698 to 1715. It originally stood in the parish church but was moved to Wellington Square in 1893, when the marble pedestal and canopy by H. Dare Bryan were added. Lower town and the quay area were rebuilt and the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town revived with the growth in sea bathing, and by 1851 was becoming a retirement centre.|$|E
5|$|Manning was {{selected}} by the Indianapolis Colts as the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft. From 1998 to 2010, he improved the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> struggling Colts franchise and helped transform them into consistent playoff contenders. During his tenure as starting quarterback, Manning led the team to eight division championships, two AFC championships, and one Super Bowl title, the franchise's first in over three decades, {{as well as their}} first since relocating to Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|Sulla, who had {{observed}} the violent results of radical populare reforms (in particular those under Marius and Cinna), was naturally conservative, {{and so his}} conservatism was more reactionary than it was visionary. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the senate. After being appointed Roman Dictator in 82 BC, he enacted a series of constitutional reforms. He resigned the Dictatorship in 80 BC, retired in 79 BC, and died a year later. While he {{thought that he had}} firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weaknesses in the constitution. Ultimately, it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state.|$|E

5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, {{was much}} {{longer and more}} serious for both the Romans and Samnites. The <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two sides fluctuated {{throughout}} its course. But the Romans won the Battle of Bovianum, and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC, the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.|$|E
5|$|Within {{four years}} of the Battle of Hastings, England had been {{completely}} subjugated by the Normans. William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors along the Welsh border, the boundaries fixed only to the east. This frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie, the Welsh Marches, in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law. The area of the March varied as the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. The March of Wales, which existed for over 450 years, was abolished under the Acts of Union in 1536.|$|E
5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town. When the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of}} a branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E

50|$|Edward Walpole (1560-1637), alias Rich, was an English Roman Catholic convert, {{who became}} known as a Jesuit missioner and preacher. He passed up {{substantial}} estates that subsequently became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Walpole political family.|$|R
5|$|Belton House {{remained}} relatively untouched during this period, largely {{owing to the}} failing <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brownlow family. The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived {{for only a few}} months of the year at Belton, where they came for the fox-hunting, and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and Ashridge, another country house in Hertfordshire. Ashridge, a huge Gothic revival pile, had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the Egerton family. It was sold, with its art collection and furnishings, to pay the death duties arising on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1921. Hence Belton became the Brownlows' sole country home. Further death duties were incurred in 1927 on the death of the 3rd Earl's successor, his second cousin Adelbert Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1917, {{divisions}} {{had begun}} appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other. Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation. The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation {{in the war in}} 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly. Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded.|$|E
5|$|His father Goronwy ab Ednyfed (d. 1268) was seneschal to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also {{known as}} Llywelyn the Last), the King of Gwynedd by 1258, {{continuing}} {{in the role}} until his death on 12 October 1268. In that role, Goronwy had followed {{in the footsteps of}} his father, Ednyfed Fychan, and by doing so had tied the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early House of Tudor to those of Llywelyn. Goronwy led Llywelyn's military forces, and in February 1263 he took them as far south as Gwent in action against the Marcher Lords. Tudur ap Goronwy was one of three sons of Goronwy ab Ednyfed, alongside Goronwy ap Goronwy (also known as Goronwy the Younger or Goronwy Fychan) and Hywel ap Goronwy. Tudur Hen was not the first member of the family to be named Tudur: he was preceded by his uncle, Tudur ab Ednyfed, {{who had been in the}} service of the previous Prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Llywelyn.|$|E
50|$|Anti-partisan {{operations}} during World War II were counter-insurgency {{operations against}} the various partisan resistance movements.

5|$|In the 1250s, the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a {{turn for}} the worse. A Muslim army {{estimated}} to number 10,000men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252 after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268 Master Hugh Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.|$|E
5|$|Only {{recently}} {{promoted to}} {{general manager of}} the New Jersey system, Stanley had been reluctant to take the position in London and took it for one year only, provided he would be free to return to America {{at the end of the}} year. He told the company's senior managers that the company was almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months. Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and public relations, he was quickly able to turn the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company around, while the company's chairman, Sir Edgar Speyer, renegotiated the debt repayments. In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the managing director.|$|E
5|$|R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a {{reported}} $80million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), {{rumored to be}} the largest recording contract in history at that point. The group's 1996 album New Adventures in Hi-Fi debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK. The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous five years. Time writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole. That same year, R.E.M. parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against him {{by a member of the}} band's home office in Athens. The group's lawyer Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties.|$|E

5|$|Randolph is a rural unincorporated {{community}} in Tipton County, Tennessee, United States, {{located on the}} banks of the Mississippi River. Randolph was founded in the 1820s and in 1827, the Randolph post office was established. In the 1830s, the town became an early center of river commerce in West Tennessee. Randolph shipped more cotton annually than Memphis until 1840. In 1834, the first pastor of the Methodist congregation was appointed. The <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community began to decline in the late 1840s due to failed railroad development, an unfavorable mail route and other factors. The first Confederate States Army fort in Tennessee was built at Randolph early in the Civil War in 1861, a second fortification at Randolph was constructed later that same year. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice by Union Army forces.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos {{tried to}} exploit this {{situation}} to his favour and intervened in Bulgaria. He sent Ivan Asen III, {{son of the}} former Emperor Mitso Asen, to claim the Bulgarian throne {{at the head of}} a large Byzantine army. Simultaneously, Michael VIII incited the Mongols to attack from the north, forcing Ivaylo to fight on two fronts. Ivaylo was defeated by the Mongols and besieged in important fortress of Drastar. In his absence the nobility in Tarnovo opened the gates to Ivan Asen III. However, Ivaylo managed to break the siege and Ivan Asen III fled back to the Byzantine Empire. Michael VIII sent two large armies in an attempt to turn the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, but they were both defeated by the Bulgarian rebels in the Balkan mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Chester Canal was an English canal {{linking the}} south Cheshire town of Nantwich with the River Dee at Chester. It was {{intended}} to link Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich, but the Trent and Mersey Canal were unco-operative about a junction at Middlewich, and so the route to Nantwich was opened in 1779. There were also difficulties negotiating with the River Dee Company, and with no possibility of through traffic, the canal was uneconomic. Part of it was closed in 1787, when Beeston staircase locks collapsed, {{and there was no}} money to fund repairs. When the Ellesmere Canal was proposed in 1790, the company saw it as a ray of hope, and somehow managed to keep the struggling canal open. The Ellesmere Canal provided a link to the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port from 1797, and the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chester Canal began to improve.|$|E
