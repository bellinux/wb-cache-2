Among them was a cover to Batgirl #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke. The cover depicts the Joker {{standing next to a}} tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other <b>hand,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> gesturing to shoot her.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Baroš {{was accused}} of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian {{opponent}} Stéphane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his nose in front of Mbia and waved his <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to waft away an unpleasant smell. In the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture {{was not intended to}} be racist in any way, and he was only trying to tell Mbia to get out of his face and leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E
5|$|The {{year after}} he left office as mayor, Armstrong began work with the Edmonton post office. After being {{recommended}} for the position by city notables, he was named postmaster of the city on November 12, 1913. In the same year he oversaw {{the construction of a}} new building on Namayo Avenue, the Fairbairn Block, mainly for use by his business but with additional space for offices and housing in the upper levels. In 1920, Armstrong was involved in a legal case involving his office as postmaster when he was accused in the 1919 disappearance of a sum of $50,000 from the post office. Although exonerated in 1920, he would again be arrested in 1923 and charged with theft. During the trial, it was testified that a witness had seen Armstrong on the day of the robbery, with only a paper in his <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were heading out. Armstrong, who had proclaimed his innocence, and provided evidence for the trial was eventually acquitted and found not guilty of the charges in a decision made on May 29, which was followed by an eruption of applause. Later in 1923, Armstrong was appointed postmaster of the Strathcona (south side) Post Office. He remained with the post office until he retired in January 1937. At the time of his retirement he was serving as postmaster of the south post office. In his years with the post office, he served a total of 14 years as postmaster. The Armstrong Drug Store would later go through multiple owners until its closing on December 10, 1993.|$|E

25|$|If I had {{not heard}} long ago from other people {{that you were a}} fool, I might now have known it of myself, since you thought I was sitting in an empty jug, and went to cover it up with your <b>hand,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you had me caught. I don't think you worth the trouble, or I would have given you, long since, such a lesson, that you should {{remember}} me long enough. But before long you will get a slight ducking.|$|E
25|$|The dialogue, {{somewhat}} unusually, {{does not}} set {{itself as a}} re-telling of the day's events. The dialogue is given unmediated, in the direct words of Socrates and Phaedrus, without other interlocutors to introduce the story or give it to us; it comes first <b>hand,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we are witnessing the events themselves. This {{is in contrast to}} such dialogues as the Symposium, in which Plato sets up multiple layers between the day's events and our hearing of it, explicitly giving us an incomplete, fifth-hand account.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} before Caiaphas. Jesus is guarded by two soldiers. Caiaphas' servant has {{one hand on}} Jesus' shoulder and raises the other <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to hit him. A third soldier wears a turban {{and seems to be}} in charge of the other two. According to the Gospel of John (the event is not mentioned in other accounts) Jesus was first brought before Annas and after a brief questioning of him (John 18:19-23) was sent to the home of Caiaphas where some members of the Sanhedrin were gathered and the first trial of Jesus took place (Matt. 26:57-68).|$|E

25|$|Cutolo openly {{supported}} the young inmates, who were confronted with abuse, brutality, physical aggression and rape. He {{provided them with}} advice and protection from the brutalities of other inmates. At {{the same time they}} learned how to behave as a good picciotto, the lowest entry level into the Camorra. Cutolo challenged the old Camorra bosses and gave the youngsters a structure to belong to: “The new Camorra must have a statute, a structure, an oath, a complete ceremony, a ritual that must excite people {{to the point that they}} would risk their lives for this organization.” Cutolo was revered by his soldiers. They called him Prince and kissed his left <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were a bishop.|$|E

The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, [...] "My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled." ...|$|E
500|$|Midway {{through the}} first period, with Montreal already down 2–0, Campbell arrived with three {{secretaries}} from his office (one of whom he would later marry). The 15,000 spectators immediately started booing Campbell. Some fans began pelting him and his group with eggs, vegetables, and various debris for six straight minutes. At {{the end of the}} first period, Detroit had taken a 4–1 lead, and the barrage began again. Despite police and ushers' attempts to keep fans away from Campbell, one fan, pretending to be a friend of Campbell's, managed to elude security. As he approached, the fan extended his <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to shake Campbell's. When Campbell reached out to shake his hand, the fan slapped him. As Campbell reeled from the attack, the fan reached back and delivered a punch. Police dragged the attacker away while he attempted to kick the NHL president. Shortly after the fan attack, a tear gas bomb was set off inside the Forum, not far from Campbell's seat. Montreal Fire Chief Armand Pare mandated that the game be suspended for [...] "the protection of the fans", and the Forum was evacuated. Following the evacuation, Campbell took refuge in the Forum clinic, where he met with Canadiens general manager Frank Selke. The two wrote a note to Adams declaring the Red Wings the winner of the game due to the Forum's ordered closure.|$|E

2500|$|The Central Illinois Regional Airport near Bloomington has a {{whimsical}} statue of Stevenson, {{sitting on a}} bench with his feet propped on his briefcase and his head in one <b>hand,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> waiting for his flight. He is depicted wearing shoes that had a hole in the sole, from having walked many miles during his election campaign. [...] The shoe had become a symbol of his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|They {{were walking}} along the {{promenade}} when the 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them, attempting to peer underneath the empress's parasol. According to Sztáray, as the ship's bell announced the departure, Lucheni seemed to stumble and made a movement with his <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to maintain his balance. In reality, {{in an act of}} [...] "propaganda of the deed", he had stabbed Elisabeth with a sharpened needle file that was [...] long (used to file the eyes of industrial needles) that he had inserted into a wooden handle.|$|E
