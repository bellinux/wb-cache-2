5|$|Team Razer faced Firestorm3 {{in their}} first battle of the series grand final, in a rematch from the All-Stars semi-final from earlier that year. Whilst victory in that battle had been {{relatively}} straightforward, Firestorm3 had increased the thickness of its armour for this battle {{to make it harder}} for Razer to inflict major damage. This tactic almost worked: Razer was unable to completely immobilise the robot. The fight ended in a close judges' decision—in Razer's favour. Victory handed Razer a place in the series five grand final against Bigger Brother, rebuilt after being heavily damaged by Hypno-Disc in its previous battle. Razer gripped Bigger Brother early in the battle, causing damage to its opponent's <b>drive</b> <b>chain</b> from which Bigger Brother never recovered. The final ended in a stalemate and went to the judges; their decision came back in favour of Razer. Along with the UK Championship, Razer also took home a third Best Design award.|$|E

25|$|Assisted by Luciano Zen, {{and after}} hours of running the normal {{agricultural}} business, Francesco had started in 1947 to design a small motorcycle. Word has it, that some engine parts were cast in Francesco's kitchen, confirming that at least initially, the project was not regarded as a serious business proposition.

25|$|The company {{developed}} and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle {{with the engine}} in the centre and 'springer' front forks which was ahead of its time. This first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, bottom-bracket engine and mechanically operated valves. With a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904. The following year, however, Rover stopped motorcycle production to concentrate on their 'safety bicycle' but in 1910 designer John Greenwood was commissioned {{to develop a new}} 3.5hp 500cc engine with spring-loaded tappets, a Bosch magneto and an innovative inverted tooth <b>drive</b> <b>chain.</b> It had a Brown and Barlow carburettor and Druid spring forks. This new model was launched at the 1910 Olympia show and over 500 were sold.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOff-line robot dynamic {{identification}} methods use the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), which calculates {{the motor}} torques that are linear {{in relation to}} the dynamic parameters of both links and <b>drive</b> <b>chains,</b> and use linear least squares technique (IDIM-LS technique). For most robots, the only available data are the motor position and the motor torques which are calculated as the product of the known current reference signal by the joint drive gains. Then the accuracy of links parameters may be limited by noise and error modeling in the <b>drive</b> <b>chains.</b> The Kuka LWR robot (industrial version IIWA: Intelligent Industrial Work Assistant) gives the possibility for an industrial robot to investigate this problem using the joint torque sensors data, measured at the output of the harmonic <b>drive</b> geared <b>drive</b> <b>chains,</b> to identify only the links inertial parameters without the errors coming from the <b>drive</b> <b>chains.</b> This paper focuses on the comparison of the accuracy of the identification of the dynamic parameters of the rigid model of the LWR 4 + version, which is very popular in robotics research, using measures of the motor positions and the motor currents, or the torque sensors measurements or both side data. This paper is giving a first complete and reliable identified rigid dynamic model of the LWR 4 +, publicly available for the robotics community. Moreover, this work shows {{for the first time the}} strong result that motor torques calculated from motor currents can identify the links inertial parameters with the same accuracy than using joint torque sensors at the output of the joint <b>drive</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{most common}} tandem {{crankset}} {{is a set}} of four cranks. [...] Both left cranks have spiders and chainrings to be connected by a timing chain, and only one of the right cranks has a spider for the <b>drive</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned trochoid pump. Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final <b>drive</b> <b>chain.</b> A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the <b>drive</b> <b>chain</b> behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple blanking plug at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|E

500|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>drive,</b> endless power-transmitting: The Greek Philon of Byzantium (3rd or 2nd century BC) {{described}} a <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> and windlass {{used in the}} operation of a polybolos (a repeating ballista), [...] "but the <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> did not continuously transmit power from shaft to shaft and hence they were not in the direct line of ancestry of the chain-drive proper". A continuously <b>driven</b> <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> first appeared in 11th century China. Perhaps inspired by chain pumps which had been known in China since at least the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) when they were mentioned by the Chinese philosopher Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD), the endless power-transmitting <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> was first used in the gearing of the clock tower built at Kaifeng in 1090 by the Song Chinese politician, mathematician and astronomer Su Song (1020–1101).|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{analytically}} that pulse solitary waves {{in a chain}} with Lennard-Jones type nearest neighbor interaction are strongly localized and marginally stable in the high energy limit. In a damped and periodically <b>driven</b> <b>chain</b> we obtain numerically families of states whose behavior {{is similar to that}} of equally many oscillators. We observe a period doubling sequence in a one-solitary wave family and bifurcation to (quasi-) periodic motion in a family of two solitary waves. We conclude that the damped and <b>driven</b> <b>chain</b> admits asymptotically stable states living on a low-dimensional manifold in phase space. These results depend sensitively on the shape of the driving term...|$|R
2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the <b>drive</b> <b>chain</b> and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on stub axles, and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{unlike other}} Harley-Davidson engines, the unit {{construction}} {{left and right}} engine cases split vertically, and formed four cavities: a center front crankcase, a center rear gearbox, a right side cavity gearcase [...] for the timing train, where the four camshafts are housed, and a left cavity for the three row primary <b>drive</b> <b>chain.</b> A row of four camshafts had also been used on the KR racers, inherited from the sidevalve Model WL, and even earlier Model D of 1929. While the single camshaft of other Harley-Davidson designs was cheaper to manufacture, and quieter, four cams allowed better performance, such as greater flexibility in adjusting the cam timing, and the short single camshafts are durable, and give the pushrods a straighter path to the rocker arms.|$|E
