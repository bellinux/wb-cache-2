The detection of such inflammatory lesions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important in the consideration of the diagnosis and differential diagnoses of MS, {{as well as in the}} monitoring of disease activity and predicting treatment efficacy. Although there is strong evidence supporting the use of MRI for both the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity, there is a lack of evidence regarding which MRI protocols to use, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>examinations,</b> and in what clinical situations to consider MRI examination. A national workshop to discuss these issues was held in Stockholm, Sweden, in August 2015, which resulted in a Swedish consensus statement regarding the use of MRI in the care of individuals with MS. The aim of this consensus statement is to provide practical advice for the use of MRI in this setting. The recommendations are based on a review of relevant literature and the clinical experience of workshop attendees. It is our hope that these recommendations will benefit individuals with MS and guide healthcare professionals responsible for their care.

40|$|In {{population}} {{surveys of}} the exposure to medical X-rays both the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>examinations</b> and the effective dose per examination are required. The use of the Swiss medical tariffication system (TARMED) for establishing the frequency of X-ray medical examinations was explored. The method was tested for radiography examinations performed in 2008 at the Lausanne University Hospital. The annual numbers of radiographies determined from the "TARMED" database are in good agreement with the figures extracted from the local RIS (Radiology Information System). The "TARMED" is a reliable and fast method for establishing the frequency of radiography examination, if we respect {{the context in which}} the "TARMED" code is used. In addition, this billing context provides most valuable information on the average number of radiographs per examination as well as the age and sex distributions. Radiographies represent the major part of X-ray examinations and are performed by about 4, 000 practices and hospitals in Switzerland. Therefore this method has the potential to drastically simplify the organisation of nationwide surveys. There are still some difficulties to overcome if the method is to be used to assess the frequency of computed tomography or fluoroscopy examinations; procedures that deliver most of the radiation dose to the population. This is due to the poor specificity of "TARMED" codes concerning these modalities. However, the use of CT and fluoroscopy installations is easier to monitor using conventional survey methods since there are fewer centres. Ways to overcome the "TARMED" limitations for these two modalities are still being explored...|$|E

40|$|Background/Objective: Coronary {{angiography}} is {{a commonly}} performed diagnostic procedure with life saving {{benefits for the}} patient. However, because of its potential to deliver a high radiation dose, caution is required. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the average effective dose of patients undergoing coronary angiography and to estimate the associated radiation risk in terms of fatal malignancy. "nPatients and Methods: Radiation doses received by 103 patients who underwent coronary angiography (CA) at one hospital of Yazd province in Iran were measured in terms of Kerma Area Product (KAP). KAP values were then used to determine the effective dose and the organ doses using the NRPB-S 262 conversion factors and to estimate the radiation cancer risk based on the population averaged probability coefficients given in ICRP- 60 and BEIR-VII report. "nResults: Mean KAP values were found to be 29. 15 &plusmn; 16. 97 Gy. cm 2 and the estimated mean values of effective dose was 5. 0 &plusmn; 3. 18 mSv. The dose of lung, esophagus, bone marrow, skin, stomach and female breast were 24. 99 &plusmn; 14. 93 mSv, 14. 01 &plusmn; 9. 47 mSv, 3. 72 &plusmn; 2. 61 mSv, 2. 9 &plusmn; 1. 8 mSv, 2. 17 &plusmn; 1. 62 mSv 1. 46 &plusmn; 0. 32 mSv, respectively. The estimated total annual collective dose and caput dose were 17. 52 man-Sv and 0. 018 mSv, respectively. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>examinations</b> per 1000 Yazd people was 3. 5 which is lower than UK and the health care level I countries.

Based on initial analysis and positive student comments, for the 2012 cohort (n = 148), we expanded this to incorporate four 1 -h in-class exams every 3 wk plus a short final integrative exam. Average scores from exams and questionnaires (student evaluations of learning and teaching, 10 questions) were compared among 2010, 2011, and 2012 cohorts. We also compared scores in the practical component of the course, which had a constant format for all cohorts. Data are given as means ± SD; statistical analyses were done with unpaired two-way Students t-tests. From 2010 to 2012, there was a significant improvement in total exam scores (59. 7 ± 15. 8 vs. 68. 6 ± 14. 2, P < 0. 001) but no significant change in total practical scores (72. 3 ± 9. 0 vs. 74. 4 ± 10. 2, P = 0. 05), indicating that the rise in exam score was not due to higher academic abilities of the 2012 cohort.

The thesis is introduced with a brief anatomical and physiological summary of urinary system. The next paragraph deals with the issue of urolithiasis, classification of urinary stones and factors contributing to formation of urolithiasis. Undoubtedly, {{one of the most important}} passages in the theoretical part of the thesis is a detailed description of individual imaging methods used in urology. Every medical examination includes procedure, preparation of a patient, indication, contraindication, benefits and drawbacks typical for implementation of imaging methods. The last part of the theoretical section covers a comparison of particular medical srceenings according to the negative radiation effects on the patient and according to the financial point of view. The second part of the thesis focuses on hypothesis and description of the research methodology. The aim of the thesis is seen in a comparison as well as in a research of frequency of individual imaging methods used in renal illnesses causing renal colic. The research was focused on this aim and all useful data in connection with description of methodology were applied. Another goal of the research was verification of hypothesis which is based on the belief that methods without using contrastive substances are more frequently applied. Methodology used in the bachelor thesis describes collecting of data, processing and comparison of patients´ files who underwent treatment of renal colic in the urology ward in the hospital in Havlíčkův Brod. The research was mainly oriented on imaging methods using contrasting substances as well as non-contrasting methods. Amongst these imaging screenings belong ultrasonography, plain radiograph of kidneys, intravenous excretory urography, computed tomography with low-dose technique and CT with application of contrastive substance. The data was collected from the hospital information system service known as NIS in Havlíčkův Brod. The first data collection method was aimed at group of patients with renal colic diagnosis who have experienced radiodiagnostic examination methods in the hostital in Havlíčkův Brod in 2012. The group consisted of one hundred patients. In the first place, frequency of occurrence of urolithiasis and its frequency of particular examination of both sexes was examined. It was followed by the research of the frequency imaging methods for the entire year 2012. The final research was focused on the number of condactive examinations using contrastive substance. In the end, it was compared to the number of realized screenings without contrasing substance. The second data collection included the number of conducted screenings in last fifteen years. Out of this data <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>examinations</b> in the years 1999 and 2013 were compared and represented.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} subjective well-being of school pupils and considers the associated factors which either promote or inhibit their well-being at school. The significance of well-being at school particularly {{comes to the}} fore where schools {{face the challenge of}} developing lasting and measurable knowledge and skills in pupils with the aim of preparing them for the tasks of later life. Well-being at school can also play a key role inasmuch as the pupils’ acquisition of skills is supported by their positive feelings and attitudes towards school because these emotions and mindsets provide a stabilising and trusting basis for learning and development (cf. e. g. Hascher, Hagenauer & Schaffer, 2011). The identification of influential variables is called for, particularly for the purposes of providing targeted support for well-being at school and preventing unwanted regressions – which have, however, been empirically demonstrated in pupils in later school years (cf. Czerwenka et al, 1990). This study therefore explores which factors at the school/school administration level, the lesson level and the individual level are significant to the subjective well-being at school {{from the perspective of the}} secondary school pupils that were surveyed, and whether differences between boys and girls can be established in these respects. The response to the research questions is based on a methodologically qualitative approach. Male and female secondary-level pupils (year 8) from schools in the Swiss Canton of Bern were asked questions in 16 single-sex group discussions. Their comments and opinions were evaluated using the qualitative content analysis method set out by Mayring (2010). In this regard, the following main conclusions were drawn as an overview: At the school/school administration level, both boys and girls find that the high <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>examinations</b> and the poor scheduling of the examinations that they are required to pass put a strain on them. According to their comments, the generally long school days and the amount of homework, exam preparation and apprenticeship applications that they are required to do at the same time also lead to stress and a feeling among the pupils of being overloaded. At the lesson level, well-being among pupils is promoted by lessons that are not boring (in terms of subject matter) and are sufficiently varied in their methodological format. With regard to a teacher’s character and personality traits, both sexes feel that a teacher has a positive impact on their well-being at school when he or she is sociable, close to the pupils, kind, and self-critical with an open, relaxed and humorous manner around the pupils. It is striking, however, that the groups of boys cite the aspect of the teacher’s character and personality traits and the quality of the relationship between the teacher and the pupils as a factor relevant to their level of well-being much more frequently and in more detail than the girls. At the individual level, girls link their well-being at school to a high degree to their learning-related emotions and motivational orientation. In contrast to the boys, the girls emphasise the importance of achieving good grades much more frequently, which also plays a crucial role in girls experiencing positive emotions. The micro-social environment of pupils – their peers and their parents – is also a relevant factor governing their well-being. Whereas boys see their peers as an important motivator in coming to school and as a significant factor in their enjoyment of school, girls emphasise the importance of their peers as an important emotional crutch for problems (at school) and failures at school (e. g. bad grades). Both boys and girls see their parents as an important and reliable source of support for learning which also contributes to their sense of well-being at school...|$|E

The findings in this study indicate that: radiological coverage of the population is inadequate; simple radiological <b>examinations</b> <b>of</b> the limbs and the chest constitute the bulk of the radiological workload; and some trained radiological staff may be underutilized. These results may have general implications for strategies on the expansion of radiological services in other developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is {{an essential}} tool in modern medicine and is frequently used to diagnose {{a wide range of}} conditions, particularly in industrial countries, such as Japan and Germany. However, markedly higher doses of ionizing radiation are delivered during CT imaging than during conventional X-ray examinations. To assess pediatric CT practice patterns, data from three university hospital databases (two in Japan and one in Germany) were analyzed. Anonymized data for patients aged 0 to 14 years who had undergone CT examinations between 2008 and 2010 were extracted. To assess CT practice, an interdisciplinary classification scheme for CT indications, which incorporated the most common examination types and radiosensitive tissues, was developed. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> CT <b>examinations</b> was determined according to sex, age at examination, and indications. A total <b>of</b> 5182 CT <b>examinations</b> were performed in 2955 children. Overall, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> CT <b>examinations</b> at the Japanese university hospitals did not differ significantly from that at the German hospital. However, differences were detected in the age distribution of the patients who underwent CT <b>examinations</b> (the proportion <b>of</b> patients ≥ 5 years of age was significantly higher in Japan than in Germany) and in the indications for CT. Substantial practice differences regarding the use of CT in pediatric health care were detected between the three hospitals. The results of this study point towards a need for approaches such as clinical guidelines to reduce unwarranted medical radiation exposures, particularly abdominal and head CT, in the Japanese health system...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} studies {{conducted}} {{over the past}} two decades were used to elaborate EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); the updated recommendations have recently been published. In accordance with these recommendations, the tactics in management of each patient is determined by the disease activity. This indicator determines the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> for the patient, selection of an anti-rheumatic drug, and the need for therapy correction. Methotrexate is recommended to patients with active RA (high or moderate activity) naÏve to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Another DMARD can be used for patients with lower activity of RA. Therapy effectiveness is evaluated as soon as 3 months after its prescription. Clinical improvement (decrease in RA activity from high to moderate) needs to be achieved by this time. However, the aim of therapy is to achieve low disease activity or remission (that needs to be achieved earlier than 6 month after the therapy was started) rather than clinical improvement only. If the maximum dose of a drug results neither in clinical improvement after 3 months nor in low activity after 6 months, the therapy should be corrected. EULAR experts recommend using the overall score that includes joint score indices (DAS 28, SDAI or CDAI) to assess the level of RA activity.   </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> post-mortem <b>examinations</b> {{was conducted}} in the paediatric age group. Among the factors found to influence necropsy rates were (i) age at death, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> necropsy decreasing with age; (ii) cause <b>of</b> death, necropsy <b>frequency</b> varying with major diagnostic groups; (iii) investigation conducted before death, necropsy frequency decreasing when the clinical picture was ill-defined; and (iv) place of death, necropsy being less frequent when death occurred outside hospital. These findings imply (a) that necropsy practices may be governed by habit and convenience {{as well as by}} desire to complete the clinical picture, and (b) that more equitable balances in such practices should be sought {{if there is to be}} improvement in the quality of mortality data...|$|R
40|$|MR imaging, using modern {{equipment}} and a rigorous technical approach, can offer detailed morphologic information and functional {{data on the}} small bowel. The optimal study technique is debatable, although the oral administration of contrast material as a first-line approach is less expensive, faster, easier to perform, and better tolerated by patients. MR enteroclysis might be reserved for selected cases as a second-line study. The major clinical indication is the evaluation of patients who have suspected or known Crohn's disease. The absence of ionizing radiation, considering the young age {{of most of the}} patients and the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>examinations,</b> is an important advantage over other techniques (radiograph and CT enteroclysis) ...|$|R
30|$|US-guided CVC was {{the main}} {{indication}} of POCUS, representing 49.4 % of indications, followed by bedside echocardiography (33.9 %). Pleuropulmonary and abdominal ultrasonographic examinations were infrequently reported (8.5 and 8.2 %, respectively). According to 59 % of the respondents, chest x-rays are performed {{on a daily basis}} in more than 50 % of the patients. This was negatively associated with the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> lung ultrasound <b>examination</b> (p[*]= 0.028).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{evaluate}} integrated {{care for}} diabetes in clinical, psychosocial, and economic terms. DESIGN [...] Pragmatic randomised trial. SETTING [...] Hospital diabetic clinic and three general practice groups in Grampian. PATIENTS [...] 274 adult diabetic patients attending a hospital clinic and registered {{with one of}} three general practices. INTERVENTION [...] Random allocation to conventional hospital clinic care or integrated care. Integrated care patients seen in general practice {{every three or four}} months and in the hospital clinic annually. General practitioners were given written guidelines for integrated care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Metabolic control, psychosocial status, knowledge of diabetes, beliefs about control of diabetes, satisfaction with treatment, disruption of normal activities, numbers of consultations and admissions, <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> metabolic monitoring, costs to patients and NHS. RESULTS [...] A higher proportion of patients defaulted from conventional care (14 (10 %)) than from integrated care (4 (3 %), 95 % confidence interval of difference 2 % to 13 %). After two years {{no significant differences were found}} between the groups in metabolic control, psychosocial status, knowledge, beliefs about control, satisfaction with treatment, unscheduled admissions, or disruption of normal activities. Integrated care was as effective for insulin dependent as non-insulin dependent patients. Patients in integrated care had more visits and higher <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination.</b> Costs to patients were lower in integrated care (mean 1. 70 pounds) than in conventional care (8 pounds). 88 % of patients who experienced integrated care wished to continue with it. CONCLUSIONS [...] This model of integrated care for diabetes was at least as effective as conventional hospital clinic care...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} capsule endoscopy {{in terms}} <b>of</b> incomplete <b>examinations</b> and capsule retentions {{and to find}} risk factors for these events. Material and Methods. This retrospective and consecutive study includes data from 2300 capsule enteroscopy examinations, performed at four different hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden from 2003 to 2009. Results. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> incomplete <b>examinations</b> was 20 %. Older age, male gender, suspected, and known Crohn's disease were risk factors for an incomplete examination. The PillCam capsule had the highest rate <b>of</b> completed <b>examinations.</b> Capsule retention occurred in 1. 3 % (= 31). Risk factors for capsule retention were known Crohn's disease and suspected tumor. Complications of capsule retention were acute obstructive symptoms in six patients and one death related to complications after acute surgical capsule retrieval. Conclusion: Capsule endoscopy is considered a safe procedure, although obstructive symptoms and serious complications due to capsule retention {{can be found in}} a large series of patients...|$|R
