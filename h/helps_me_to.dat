Of his own practice of Transcendental Meditation, in 2014 Lennon said: [...] "for me, it's like a scientific method to calm my brain down and making my frontal lobe more active.

2500|$|In 1880, {{the site}} of the Le Rosey campus was chosen by the school's founder, Paul-Emile Carnal, [...] "a lover of nature, history and the countryside". The Le Rosey campus at Rolle is {{situated}} adjacent to the famous Lake Geneva. In 1911, the founder passed the ownership of Le Rosey to his son, Henri-Paul Carnal. In 1917, the school began to go to Gstaad in the German-speaking Canton of Berne for the winter months to escape the dense fog that settles in on Lake Geneva. In 1947, the third generation of directors, Louis Johannot and Helen Schaub, assumed ownership of Le Rosey. Under the same ownership, in 1967, Le Rosey admitted girls {{for the first time and}} opened a separate girls' campus. In 1980, the current owners, Philippe and Anne Gudin de la Sablonnière, became the fourth generation of Directors at Le Rosey. Louis Johannot, in an interview with Life Magazine in 1965, made a comment that received considerable attention: [...] "The only reason I always try to meet and know the parents better is because it <b>helps</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> forgive their children." ...|$|E
