5000|$|At the Rainhill Trials, Sans Pareil was {{excluded}} from the prize because it was slightly over the maximum permitted weight. Nevertheless, it performed very well but had a strange rolling gait due to its vertical cylinders. The 'blast' from the blastpipe was, in Hackworth's trademark style, very strong, {{so most of the}} coke was expelled out of the chimney unburnt; and it was this more than its antiquated design that caused its abysmal fuel economy [...] It was pulled out of the competition because of a cracked cylinder: the <b>design</b> <b>thickness</b> for the cylinder walls was some 1+3/4 in, but at the point of failure, it was found to be a mere 5/8 in. Hackworth's supporters cried 'foul!', but as he had had over twenty cylinders cast, choosing the best two for the locomotive, skulduggery {{on the part of the}} Stephensons whose firm cast the cylinders, and who were direct competitors at Rainhill, is unlikely. After the trials, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway bought Sans Pareil as well as Rocket. It was subsequently leased to the Bolton and Leigh Railway where it ran until 1844. It was then used as a stationary boiler at the Coppull Colliery, Chorley until 1863, thereafter Sans Pareil was restored and presented to the Patent Office Museum (what became the Science Museum) in 1864 by John Hick. The engine now resides at the Shildon Locomotion Museum on static display.|$|E

This research project explores the application of FRPs for retrofit of damaged circular columns. A decision tree for the emergency repair of damaged columns is presented. The decision tree aids field engineers first in assessing the extent of damage to a column from a seismic event, impact or any other source of damage. Once the level of damage is specified, the decision tree can be used to determine the feasibility of FRP retrofitting. If an FRP jacket is a viable option, suggested simplified design guidelines can be used to determine the <b>design</b> <b>thickness</b> and type of required FRP jacket that should be used for the emergency repair of the column.
