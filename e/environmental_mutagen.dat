5000|$|Mutagenesis {{may occur}} endogenously, for example, through {{spontaneous}} hydrolysis, or through normal cellular processes that can generate {{reactive oxygen species}} and DNA adducts, or through error in replication and repair. [...] Mutagenesis may also arise {{as a result of}} the presence of <b>environmental</b> <b>mutagens</b> that induce changes to the DNA. The mechanism by which mutation arises varies according to the causative agent, the mutagen, involved. Most mutagens act either directly, or indirectly via mutagenic metabolites, on the DNA producing lesions. Some, however, may affect the replication or chromosomal partition mechanism, and other cellular processes.|$|R

50|$|Freese's {{research}} also included microbial differentiation and molecular neurobiology. He studied {{the effect of}} lipophilic acids on the growth and differentiation of bacteria. Freese's laboratory worked on the metabolic control of sporulation and germination of Bacillus subtilis bacteria. He identified the key metabolite for ignition of sporulation: a decrease of GTP. Freese was cofounder of the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Mutagen</b> Society and served as its president for two years. In 1971, he organized the first comprehensive conference focused on the prospects of gene therapy through the John E. Fogarty International Center. His laboratory identified certain compounds as mutagenic and he was instrumental in banning the use of certain pesticides and food additives. Later in his career, as a NIH administrator, he provided the initial support to J. Craig Venter to initiate his program to sequence the human genome. His laboratory first sequenced GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and helped to elucidate its role in neural structure and development. Throughout his career, he trained dozens of postdoctoral research fellows. He received the Alexander von Humboldt Prize in 1983.|$|E

40|$|Germ cell risk is an {{essential}} component of estimating the deleterious results of <b>environmental</b> <b>mutagens.</b> The present set of in vivo model systems appears to have limited ability to measure germ cell risk from all types of genetic lesions. The assays most practical for use in genetic testing measure the induction of chromosome alterations but not specific locus gene mutations. Quantitative estimation of germ cell risk based on such available assays is difficult to make and may lead to incorrect assumptions of risk. Better assessment of germ cell genetic damage will require expansion of present procedures to increase sensitivity and the development of improved assay systems...|$|R
