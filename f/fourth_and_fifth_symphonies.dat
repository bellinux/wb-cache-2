500|$|In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not {{wished to}} go on the tour because flying hurt his ears, and long land {{journeys}} hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in Leningrad. [...] Boult's assistant conductors were Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst. Boult's four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams's <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies,</b> Holst's The Planets, Walton's Violin Concerto (with Alfredo Campoli as soloist), and Schubert's Great C major Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the Bolshoi Opera and were guests at the composer Dmitri Shostakovich's 50th birthday party.|$|E
500|$|A mix of enthusiasm, consternation and {{critical}} contempt became the normal response to new Mahler symphonies, although the songs were better received. After his <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies</b> failed to gain general public approval, Mahler {{was convinced that}} his Sixth would finally succeed. However, its reception was dominated by satirical comments on Mahler's unconventional percussion effects—the use of a wooden mallet, birch rods and a huge square bass drum. Viennese critic Heinrich Reinhardt dismissed the symphony as [...] "Brass, lots of brass, incredibly much brass! Even more brass, nothing but brass!" [...] The one unalloyed performance triumph within Mahler's lifetime was the premiere of the Eighth Symphony in Munich, on 12 September 1910, advertised by its promoters as the [...] "Symphony of a Thousand." [...] At its conclusion, applause and celebrations reportedly lasted for half an hour.|$|E
50|$|His Third Symphony (1971) {{appeared}} 23 {{years after}} his second and signalled his return to composition; he had written only a few works during the 1960s. There soon followed his <b>Fourth</b> (1976) <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies</b> (1977) <b>and</b> the Concerto for Twelve Cellos (1981).|$|R

5|$|The {{strain of}} dual careers and {{constant}} separation {{from his wife}} led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in Gothenburg. The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his <b>Fourth</b> (1914–16) <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>symphonies</b> (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication {{of many of his}} major works, including Aladdin and Pan and Syrinx.|$|R
500|$|Taruskin writes, [...] "A {{sense of}} what Tchaikovsky meant to Glazunov may be gained by {{comparing}} the latter's Second Symphony, on which he {{was working at the}} time of Tchaikovsky's visit... and the Third, which he completed after a long gestation in 1890—and which he dedicated to Tchaikovsky." [...] Taruskin calls the Second Symphony [...] "a veritable summa of latterday kuchkism", with a number of stylistic fingerprints taken from Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. With the Third Symphony, Glazunov attempted to reach beyond the nationalist style to reflect what he felt were universal forms, moods and themes. Tchaikovsky's influence is clear in the work's lyrical episodes, in its themes and key relations, reminiscent of Tchaikovsky's <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies,</b> and in its orchestration, full of [...] "dark doublings" [...] and subtle instrumental effects hearkening to Tchaikovsky's style.|$|E
500|$|Neville Cardus said of Sargent's Beethoven, [...] "I {{have heard}} {{performances}} which critics would have raved about had some conductor from Russia {{been responsible for}} them conducting them half as well and truthfully." [...] Sargent recorded Beethoven's <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies</b> for Decca with Sidney Beer's National Symphony Orchestra. His 1940s accompaniments for Artur Schnabel in the piano concertos have been admired. A 1961 stereo recording of the Eroica Symphony has been reissued on CD. Sargent was an enthusiastic champion of Sibelius's music, even recording it with the Vienna Philharmonic when it {{was not part of}} their repertory. Their recordings of Finlandia, En saga, The Swan of Tuonela and the Karelia Suite were issued in 1963 and reissued on CD in 1993. Sargent and the BBC recorded the first, second and fifth Symphonies in 1956 and 1958 respectively, reissued on CD in 1989, as well as Pohjola's Daughter in 1959. He also recorded the Valse triste with the RLPO.|$|E
2500|$|Madetoja was [...] "scarcely aware" [...] of Sibelius's private musings to his diary, {{and for his}} part, he {{continued}} as a critic and writer to champion actively his former teacher. In July 1914, for example, Madetoja praised Sibelius's tone poem, The Oceanides, writing in Uusi Suometar that rather than [...] "repeat endlessly" [...] the style of his previous works, Sibelius had yet again shown his penchant for [...] "renewing himself musically … It is the sign of life … always forward, striving for new aims." [...] He also had kind words for Tapiola, describing it as [...] "a beautiful work", and among others, Sibelius's Third, <b>Fourth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>symphonies.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, Schnittke's music {{began to}} become more widely known abroad, {{thanks in part to}} the work of émigré Soviet artists such as the violinists Gidon Kremer and Mark Lubotsky. Despite {{constant}} illness, he produced a large amount of music, including important works such as the Second (1980) and Third (1983) String Quartets and the String Trio (1985); the Faust Cantata (1983), which he later incorporated in his opera Historia von D. Johann Fausten; the ballet Peer Gynt (1985-1987); the Third (1981), <b>Fourth</b> (1984) <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> (1988) <b>Symphonies</b> (the last of which is also known as the <b>Fourth</b> Concerto Grosso) <b>and</b> the Viola (1985) and First Cello (1985-1986) concertos.|$|R

2500|$|Tchaikovsky wrote four orchestral suites in {{the period}} between his <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies.</b> The first three are {{original}} music, while the fourth, subtitled Mozartiana, consists of arrangements of music by Mozart. According to Dutch musicologist Francis Maes, Tchaikovsky valued the freedom the suites gave him to experiment and saw them as a genre for unrestricted musical fantasy. To this Russian musicologist and critic Daniel Zhitomirsky agrees and adds that through them, the composer solved a number of challenges in orchestral tonality, thematic development and form. Wiley comments that they contain music {{in a number of}} stylesscholarly counterpoint, salon style, folk music, bizarre scherzos, character piecesin an overall vein that Russians call prelest, which means [...] "charming" [...] or [...] "pleasing".|$|E
2500|$|With {{the last}} three {{numbered}} symphonies and his program symphony Manfred, Tchaikovsky {{became one of the}} few composers in the late 19th century who could impose his personality upon the symphony to give the form new life. Brown calls the Fourth Symphony a breakthrough work in terms of emotional depth and complexity, particularly in its very large opening movement. The Fifth Symphony is a more regular work, though perhaps not a more conventional one. The Sixth Symphony, generally interpreted as a declaration of despair, is a work of prodigious originality and power; to Brown, it is perhaps one of Tchaikovsky's most consistent and perfectly composed works. These symphonies are recognized as highly original examples of symphonic form and are frequently performed. Manfred, written between the <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies,</b> is also a major piece, as well as a demanding one. The music is often very tough, the first movement completely original in form, while the second movement proves diaphanous and seemingly unsubstantial but absolutely right for the program it illustrates.|$|E

5000|$|The Manfred Symphony in B minor, Op. 58, is a {{programmatic}} symphony {{composed by}} Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky between May and September 1885.

It {{is the only one of}} Tchaikovskys symphonies he completed that is not numbered (the Symphony in E flat is a conjectural work left unfinished by the composer) and was written between the <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies.</b>|$|E
50|$|Music {{which appears}} to demand an interpretation, but is {{abstract}} enough to warrant objectivity (e.g. Tchaikovsky’s 6th Symphony), is what Lydia Goehr refers to as ‘double-sided autonomy.’ This happens when the formalist properties of music became attractive to composers because, having ‘no meaning to speak of’, music {{could be used to}} envision an alternative cultural and/or political order, while escaping the scrutiny of the censor (particularly common in Shostakovich, most notably the <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies).</b>|$|E

50|$|Sibelius {{enjoyed a}} highly {{successful}} trip to England in early 1921 conducting several concerts around the country which included the <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>symphonies,</b> The Oceanides and the ever-popular Finlandia and Valse triste. Immediately afterwards, he conducted the Second Symphony and Valse triste in Norway. Although {{he was beginning to}} suffer from exhaustion, the critics were still very positive. On his return to Finland in April, he presented Lemminkäinen's Return and the Fifth Symphony at the Nordic Music Days.|$|E
5000|$|Although he {{labeled the}} work as the Third Symphony, Penderecki stated that [...] "my <b>Fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Symphonies</b> came before it, chronologically." [...] Like his other symphonies, the Third Symphony harkens back to Romantic {{conventions}} of movement designation and layout, but as scholar Tadeusz Zielinski notes, the associations with the Romantic symphony are only skeletal, as Penderecki's symphonies are [...] "something entirely different from a reconstruction of a model from the past." [...] Charles Dutoit labeled it a neo-Romantic work, stating [...] "it shows Penderecki's love for Bruckner and Mahler and late 19th-century German music." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1894, Sibelius had the {{character}} of Luonnotar in mind when writing sketches for an opera. The early drafts of his orchestral tone poem Pohjola's Daughter were called Luonnotar.
