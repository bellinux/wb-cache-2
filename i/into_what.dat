5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear <b>into</b> <b>what</b> became the new design.

The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
