5000|$|The {{common name}} of this species refers to the {{supposed}} shapes of the bold dark stigmata on the usually pale forewings. In this species all the stigmata have a rounded shape, contrasting with the elongated claviform stigmata of the much commoner <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart.</b> The hindwings are grey, usually much darker than in <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> <b>and</b> turnip <b>moth.</b> The wingspan is 35-40 mm. The moth flies at night in June and July [...] and is attracted to light and sugar.|$|R

25|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field: A {{number of}} moths use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate, as {{a study of}} the stray <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> suggests. Another study, this time of the migratory behaviour of the silver Y, showed that this species, even at high altitudes, can correct its course with changing winds, and prefers flying with favourable winds, which suggests a great sense of direction.

6000|$|The {{imagination}} is alternately a cheat and a dupe; nay, more, {{it is the}} most subtle of cheats, for it cheats itself and becomes the dupe of its own delusions. It conjures up [...] "airy nothings," [...] gives to them a [...] "local habitation and a name," [...] and then bows to their control as implicitly as though they were realities. Such was now my case. The good Numa could not more thoroughly have persuaded himself that the nymph Egeria hovered about her sacred fountain and communed with him in spirit than I had deceived myself into a kind of visionary intercourse with the airy phantom fabricated in my brain. I constructed a rustic seat {{at the foot of the}} tree where I had discovered the footsteps. I made a kind of bower there, where I used to pass my mornings reading poetry and romances. I carved <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> on the tree, and hung it with garlands. My heart was full to overflowing, and wanted some faithful bosom into which it might relieve itself. What is a lover without a confidante? I thought at once of my sister Sophy, my early playmate, the sister of my affections. She was so reasonable, too, and of such correct feelings, always listening to my words as oracular sayings, and admiring my scraps of poetry as the very inspirations of the muse. From such a devoted, such a rational being, what secrets could I have? ...|$|R

40|$|Metal {{complexes}} of Fe(III) such as Fe(III) {{ethylene diamine}} tetraacetic acid (FeETDA) {{have been observed}} to be effective molluscicides. The mechanism of toxicity of FeEDTA complex on molluscs is not clear {{and it is also}} not known if Fe(III) in the form FeEDTA is absorbed more effectively by snails than simple iron salts. Snails were fed with molluscicide pellets containing the FeEDTA complex and also with pellets containing FePO 4 after 3 - 4 days the <b>hearts,</b> kidneys <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> sacs removed <b>and</b> analysed for Fe(III) content. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with Fourier transform electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (FT-ESIMS) was used to analyse the sample extracts. The method had a very wide linear range from 2 to 10, 000 ng mL− 1, intra- and inter-day precisions of ca. ± 0. 5 % were observed for the analysis of extracts from snail tissues spiked with Fe(III). The limit of detection was of 0. 5 ng mL− 1 for a 20 μL injection. The levels of Fe(III) in tissues from snails fed Fe EDTA pellets were 10 - 100 times higher than the levels in snails fed FePO 4 pellets. The analysis of Cu, Zn, Ca and Mn could also be carried out using the same analytical procedure...|$|R
