500|$|Gomez {{was out of}} {{the ring}} for almost a year {{following}} the Alvarez fight and was next due to fight Willie Limond for the WBU lightweight title, but turned down the opportunity for a chance to fight for an Irish title. Gomez then signed up to fight fellow English-based Irishman, Peter McDonagh, for the Irish lightweight title on the undercard of a Bernard Dunne fight on 28 January 2006 at the National Stadium, Dublin. After the fight was signed Gomez stated [...] "I just can't wait to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> on that Irish title because I've been desperate to fight in Ireland for years." ...|$|E

In 2011, Muhney signed a contract that would keep him in the role for an unspecified period. In April 2013, Muhney announced that he had signed a new contract that would expire in June 2015. In December, however, Muhney announced that he had been abruptly let go from the soap opera, with his last airdate on January 30, 2014.

Upon the news of his casting, the actor told TV Guide: [...] "I'm so pumped about joining Y — I watch it all the time and can't wait {{to get in there and}} <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> dirty!" [...] In 2016, {{it was announced}} that Hartley had been cast in a regular role on the NBC drama series This Is Us, which was picked up by the network, placing his future with The Young and the Restless into question.

500|$|Thematically, {{influences}} behind The Operative: No One Lives Forever {{were primarily}} 1960s spy-themed films, novels, television shows, {{as well as}} historical references. When {{it was decided that}} NOLF {{was going to be a}} 1960s spy game, lead designer Craig Hubbard started immersing himself in the subject matter, in order to [...] "develop some fluency" [...] in it. As he explained, he [...] "was a big fan of early Bond films, but didn't know a lot about the whole spy craze. So I watched the Derek Flint movies , Modesty Blaise, Matt Helm, , Avengers – anything I could <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> on." [...] Other influences included books, such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, TV shows like The Saint, The Pink Panther films, commando movies, such as The Guns of Navarone, as well as [...] "lots of historical references, encompassing everything from books and documentaries on the spy trade to fashion catalogs and interior-design books." [...] The basis for the biological explosives plot was the 1967 film Casino Royale. According to Hubbard, [...] "the idea was to create a game that would make you feel like a superspy, so we tried to come up with situations, characters, and settings to support that goal." [...] During the course of the game, the player can hear explicit popular culture references, including the TV series The Prisoner and The Fugitive, the Matt Helm films The Silencers and The Ambushers, and exotica musicians Les Baxter and Sondi Sodsai. Other conversations allude to major events of the time, such as the studio years of The Beatles, and the commercial failure of the Edsel automobile.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{my parents}} made a partial living weaving baskets, the two {{concepts}} of 'profession' and 'art' never {{came together in}} my mind until... college... I read everything I could <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> on about Michelangelo....He was the first artist I'd met through my studies who went to work everyday and was paid by his patrons [...] employers for making art. Obviously, I learned encyclopedias from the work, but the practical lesson was that art could be a profession {{as well as a}} passion.|$|E

6000|$|Anxiously {{we watched}} here, and {{carefully}} did I look to my rifle,--a double-barrelled breech-loading [...] "Soaper-Henry,"--to {{see that it}} was loaded and cocked, and frequently did I take aim at stump and stone to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> and eye well [...] "in," [...] and admiringly, with hope in every lineament, did Michael observe me.|$|R

2500|$|Moore {{said that}} he [...] "was in a rather unique position" [...] in the {{disinformation}} campaign: [...] "judging by {{the positions of the}} people I knew to be directly involved in it, [...] definitely {{had something to do with}} national security.

I would play the disinformation game, <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> dirty just often enough to lead those directing the process into believing I was doing what they wanted me to do, and all the while continuing to burrow my way into the matrix so as to learn as much as possible about who was directing it and why."(ibid., 164) ...|$|E
2500|$|Following a pitch {{invasion}} by fans after the 2009 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final, the GAA {{confirmed that the}} presentation of the Sam Maguire Cup would take place in Croke Park's Hogan Stand. The GAA insisted that it still remained worried about {{the health and safety of}} fans and expects an accident to happen [...] "one of these days". Kerry captain Darren O'Sullivan expressed his indifference about the location: [...] "If they give [...] out in the car park around the back, I just want to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> on it". During the presentation, Tadhg Kennelly did his dance which he previously did when he won the AFL Grand Final with the Sydney Swans in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pirozhkova, [...] "Before I met Babel, I {{used to read}} a great deal, though {{without any}} {{particular}} direction. I read whatever I could <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> on. Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try {{to make you a}} list of them.' And a few days later he brought me a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert." ...|$|E
5000|$|For me, {{having a}} {{background}} in art I think helped me immensely to become someone who really likes science because I started to approach {{it in a very}} MythBusters way. I really like just <b>getting</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> dirty, and that’s the kind of science that I like to do, and I never realized how much I was going to like science until I started approaching it like art.|$|R
