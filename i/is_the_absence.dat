5|$|A curious {{aspect of}} the {{official}} design <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of {{a segment of the}} Tropic of Capricorn, between the national shield and the ecliptic arc.|$|E
5|$|Gaga's {{wardrobe}} {{throughout the}} entire video primarily consists of only one outfit which was designed by Gianni Versace. The dress consists of a S-inspired outfit, with heavy gold jewelry, studs on the leather, and vibrant nail polish and lipstick. Notable in the video <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of back-up dancers, elaborate choreography, or a symbolic plot: components that have all been predominant in Gaga's other music videos. Aside from Gaga herself, Clemons is {{the only other person}} to appear in the video.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type (60%) of {{seizures}} are convulsive. Of these, one-third begin as generalized seizures from the start, affecting both hemispheres of the brain. Two-thirds begin as focal seizures (which affect one hemisphere of the brain) which may then progress to generalized seizures. The remaining 40% of seizures are non-convulsive. An example of this type <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> seizure, which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds.|$|E
30|$|Limitations <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of {{collection}} {{of the number of}} PoCUS by EP and <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> {{of collection}} of the delay between PoCUS and RRUS.|$|R
50|$|The general {{causes of}} <b>the</b> floods <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of {{drainage}} works, the urban development without environmental control and climate change.|$|R
30|$|Secondary {{outcomes}} <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> {{of adverse}} events and side-effects {{related to the}} hydrogel coating, as assessed by clinical, laboratory and radiographic examinations.|$|R
5|$|The {{nature of}} the European Parliament is better {{compared}} with the United States House of Representatives than with the national parliaments of the European Union. This is notable {{in terms of the}} committees being of greater size and power, political parties being very decentralised and it being separated from the executive branch (most national governments operate under a parliamentary system). A difference from all other parliaments <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of a Parliamentary legislative initiative. However, given that in most national parliaments initiatives not backed by the executive rarely succeed the value of this difference is in question. Equally, its independence and power means that the European Parliament has an unusually high success rate for its amendments in comparison to national parliaments; 80% average and 30% for controversial proposals.|$|E
5|$|While The Legend of Korra was {{produced}} in the United States and therefore not a work of Japanese animation ("anime") in the strict sense, The Escapist magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, romance, fear, and death) {{and the quality of}} its voice acting as well as the visual style {{are similar to those of}} leading anime series such as , Bleach or Trigun. A notable difference from such series <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to J-pop songs; to save broadcast time, The Legend of Korras openings and endings last only a few seconds. The series mostly abstains from using the visual tropes characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.|$|E
25|$|Notable <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of Yiddish in Hardal {{society and}} speech.|$|E
6000|$|Striking indeed now <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of any joking. Steele had {{showed his}} hand, and, as one gambler said: [...] "It's a hard hand to call." ...|$|R
50|$|At the end, Jessica V. and Livia <b>were</b> in <b>the</b> bottom two, and it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of a {{photo of}} Livia that made she be eliminated.|$|R
50|$|Midori was {{recommended}} by Lifehacker {{due to its}} simplicity. The major points for criticism <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of <b>the</b> process isolation, the low number of available extensions and occasional crashes.|$|R
25|$|Irreligion (adjective form: non-religious or irreligious) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence,</b> indifference, {{rejection}} of, or hostility towards religion.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{significant}} traffic in the waterway except for movement of country boats which carry local produce. The main reason for lack of IWT movement <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of other infrastructure facilities and coordinated effort for improvements.|$|E
25|$|SFC has a 17:1 student-teacher ratio. Another {{facet of}} the college, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of {{teaching}} assistants; all classes are taught by professors, of whom 89% have terminal degrees in their respective fields. There are 86 full-time professors and 273 part-time professors.|$|E
3000|$|... [1, 3 – 7]. One of {{the reasons}} for poor {{sensitivity}} of PCR <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of a particular genome in 20 % to 40 % isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|The PBA {{suffered}} in gate attendance, with lean crowds watching the games during the All-Filipino, among several factors <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of crowd-drawer Ginebra San Miguel from the semifinals, and the deteriorating venue.|$|R
30|$|There {{were a lot}} of {{language}} related episodes but as they moved to the end of <b>the</b> task there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> {{of language}} related epodes. Rather, there was more engagement at the level of discourse.|$|R
25|$|The most {{striking}} aspect <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of an entertainment infrastructure in the sub city. Currently {{there is no}} Multiplex or aesthetically appealing entertainment complex to cater to the present residing population. A city center has been planned, and construction is in final stages.|$|E
25|$|According to {{fisheries}} scientist Milo Adkison, the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of quality data. Fisheries management decisions are {{often based on}} population models, but the models need quality data to be effective. He asserts that scientists and fishery managers {{would be better served}} with simpler models and improved data.|$|E
25|$|Proxy {{data from}} one of the studied sites show rapid +8°C {{temperature}} rise, in accordance with existing regional records of marine and terrestrial environments. Notable <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of documented greater warming in polar regions. This implies a non existing ice-albedo feedback, hence suggest no sea or land ice was present in the late Paleocene.|$|E
50|$|In recent decades, Indian {{politics}} {{has become a}} dynastic affair. Possible reasons for this could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of party organizations, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for the parties, and centralized financing of elections.|$|R
50|$|There were 71 countries, {{territories and}} bodies {{competing}} at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The {{only difference between}} the 2006 games and <b>the</b> 2002 games <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of Zimbabwe, which withdrew from the Commonwealth of Nations.|$|R
50|$|Another {{complaint}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of <b>the</b> play-within-the-play. Though much {{is made of}} that play's immense impact, {{there is}} no evidence of what that play actually says, proclaims, describes, or portrays that would produce such an effect.|$|R
25|$|From 1961–1966, the American TV network NBC {{carried a}} karaoke-like series, Sing Along with Mitch, {{featuring}} host Mitch Miller and a chorus, which superimposed {{the lyrics to}} their songs {{near the bottom of}} the TV screen for home audience participation. The primary difference between Karaoke and sing-along songs <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of the lead vocalist.|$|E
25|$|The most {{striking}} {{of the legal}} differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.|$|E
25|$|The fire at Lord's {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} Thursday 28 July 1825. The pavilion burned down and many invaluable and irreplaceable records were lost. It is believed that these included unique scorecards of early matches. The main difficulty encountered by researchers <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of match details from before the Lord's fire, and there are numerous matches in the 18th century which are known about in name only, with no scores having survived.|$|E
50|$|This {{small fish}} {{reaches a maximum}} length of 4.2 cm SL. P. sanguijuela differs from P. cisternarum {{in a number of}} ways, but <b>the</b> main {{differences}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of eyes (which are present in P. cisternarum).|$|R
6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of any tone of satire {{that made}} this speech come home to Laura as it was meant. There was no grudging in the praise, and she answered, in a very low, broken voice,-- ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{inflammation}} <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of {{a locally}} visible cause.|$|R
25|$|One notable {{difference}} between a BBS or web forum and Usenet <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of a central server and dedicated administrator. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing conglomeration of servers that store and forward messages {{to one another in}} so-called news feeds. Individual users may read messages from and post messages to a local server operated by a commercial usenet provider, their Internet service provider, university, employer, or their own server.|$|E
25|$|Cryptorchidism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> {{of one or}} both testes {{from the}} scrotum. It {{is the most common}} birth defect of the male genital. About 3% of full-term and 30% of {{premature}} infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However, about 80% of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life (the majority within three months), making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1% overall. Cryptorchidism may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} {{leveled at}} NUS <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of direct democracy in electing national offices. Officers of NUS are elected at conferences by delegates chosen by affiliated unions of NUS. Critics, from {{both within and}} outside the student movement, have argued that consultation by unions with their members over who should represent the students' union at national conferences is often minimal, and some have argued in favour of changes to the NUS constitution that would result in a one-member-one-vote policy.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> main {{limitation}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> non-double-blind {{design of}} the trial protocol. Another pharmacologic limit <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of plasmatic dosages of colistin. These dosages could preferentially assert our clinical and biological results of the low systemic diffusion of the inhaled route.|$|R
50|$|Another notable first <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of five-time World Champion, Eric Bristow, as {{he missed}} the World Championship {{for the first time}} since its {{inception}} in 1978. This left John Lowe as the only remaining player with a 100% appearance record.|$|R
5000|$|Also the {{delineation}} of Vogtländisch against Upper Franconian {{seems to}} be rather troublesome, if tried within small-scale regional comparisons. One tendency seems to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of <b>the</b> [...] "rolled R" [...] in Vogtländisch, while distinctive exceptions may still occur.|$|R
