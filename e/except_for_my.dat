25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E
500|$|Religion was a {{paramount}} {{force in}} Romney's life. [...] In a 1959 essay for the Detroit Free Press he said, [...] "My religion is my most precious possession. ... <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> religion, I {{easily could have}} become excessively occupied with industry, social and recreational activities. Sharing personal responsibility for church work with my fellow members has been a vital counterbalance in my life." [...] Following LDS Church practices, he did not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages, smoke, or swear. [...] Romney and his wife tithed, and from 1955 to 1965, gave 19percent of their income {{to the church and}} another 4percent to charity.|$|E

I {{had this}} {{platinum}} record that {{showed up in the}} mail, and I had nothing <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> own talents. So at some point, I forced myself to play the guitar. I would force myself to write lyrics. I was playing people's demos. I was still into the band. It's just that I didn't have anything.|$|E

2500|$|Betza {{described}} {{his choice of}} pieces as [...] "a very basic and logical selection of the fundamental geometrical moves, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> idiosyncratic insistence on including the Rose in the lineup of pieces. These are largely the basic units of Chess, and anybody who designs a [...] game with 32 pieces is bound {{to come up with}} something reasonably similar, at least if they want it to be like Chess but a bit less tactical." [...] In fact, his original plan was to include FD along with the complementary WA (the phoenix from chu shogi), but this leaves the c- and n-pawns undefended in the initial position. His final assessment was that the game was [...] "rather chesslike".|$|E

60|$|What became {{subsequently}} of the Spanish War, we in vain inquire of History-Books. The War {{did not die}} {{for many}} years to come, but neither did it publicly live; it disappears at this point: a River Niger, seen once flowing broad enough; but issuing--Does it issue nowhere, then? Where does it issue? <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> Constitutional Historian, still unpublished, I should never have known where.--By the time these disastrous Carthagena tidings reached England, his Britannic Majesty was in Hanover; involved, he, and all his State doctors, English and Hanoverian, in awful contemplation on Pragmatic Sanction, Kaiserwahl, Celestial Balance, and the saving of Nature's Keystone, should this still prove possible to human effort and contrivance. In which Imminency of Doomsday itself, the small English-Spanish matter, which the Official people, and his Majesty as much as any, had bitterly disliked, was quite let go, and dropped out of view. Forgotten by Official people; left to the dumb English Nation, whose concern it was, to administer as IT could.|$|E
6000|$|Old Mother Nature nodded, and Peter, taking courage, continued. [...] "My {{hind legs}} are stout and strong, but my front ones are rather weak. I {{guess this is}} because I {{do not have a}} great deal of use <b>for</b> them, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> running. <b>My</b> coat is a sort of mixture of brown and gray, more brown in summer and more gray in winter. My ears are longer <b>for</b> <b>my</b> size than are those of most animals, but really not very long after all, not nearly as long <b>for</b> <b>my</b> size as my cousin Jumper's are <b>for</b> his size. <b>My</b> tail doesn't amount to much because it is so short that it is hardly worth calling a tail. It is so short I carry it {{straight}} up. It is white like a little bunch of cotton, and I suppose that that is why I am called a Cottontail Rabbit, though I have heard that some folks call me a Gray Rabbit and others a Bush Rabbit. I guess I'm called Bush Rabbit because I like bushy country in which to live." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{appeared}} in the original off-Broadway production of Godspell.
