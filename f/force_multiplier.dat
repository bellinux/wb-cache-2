5|$|The Model 1897 {{was used}} by American troops for {{purposes}} in World War I other than a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier.</b> American soldiers who were skilled at trap shooting were armed with these guns and stationed where they could fire at enemy hand grenades in midair. This would deflect the grenades from falling into the American trenches and therefore protect American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} operates five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, {{the first}} of which entered service in June 2011. Two more are due for delivery in 2018. The aircraft are crewed by pilots, refuelling operators and flight attendants. Air-to-air refuelling is considered a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier,</b> permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft. The ability to refuel in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance than they might otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Operation Barras {{was a factor}} in the {{decision}} to form the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG), a permanent unit whose role is to act as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> for British special forces on large or complex operations. The SFSG was formed in 2006 from an infantry battalion—originally 1 PARA, which was the first battalion to serve in the role—with supporting elements from the Royal Marines and Royal Air Force Regiment. The SFSG went on to support special forces operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} restored {{confidence in}} the British forces operating in Sierra Leone, which had been undermined by the capture of the Royal Irish patrol. After the operation, the British government increased its support of UNAMSIL and its efforts to bring the civil war to an end, both politically, through the United Nations Security Council, and through the provision of staff officers to support UNAMSIL. The successful use of 1 PARA in Operation Barras influenced {{the creation of the}} Special Forces Support Group—a permanent unit, initially built around 1 PARA, whose role is to act as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> for British special forces on large or complex operations.|$|E

30|$|It {{is known}} that the sound {{pressure}} spectrum due to a unit harmonic wheel–rail <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the actual wheel–rail force spectrum gives the actual sound pressure spectrum, and the sound power spectrum due to a unit harmonic wheel–rail <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the squared magnitude of actual wheel–rail force spectrum produces the actual sound power spectrum. Thus, to meet {{the purpose of this}} work, it is reasonable to consider a wheel subject to a unit vertical harmonic wheel–rail force at the wheel–rail contact point.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forces</b> can be <b>multiplied</b> {{using such}} a device. One newton input {{produces}} 50 newtons output. By further increasing {{the area of}} the larger piston (or reducing {{the area of the}} smaller piston), <b>forces</b> can be <b>multiplied,</b> in principle, by any amount. Pascal's principle underlies the operation of the hydraulic press. The hydraulic press does not violate energy conservation, because a decrease in distance moved compensates for the increase in force. When the small piston is moved downward 100 centimeters, the large piston will be raised only one-fiftieth of this, or 2 centimeters. The input <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the distance moved by the smaller piston is equal to the output <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the distance moved by the larger piston; this is one more example of a simple machine operating on the same principle as a mechanical lever.|$|R
50|$|Moments and torques are {{measured}} as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by a distance {{so they have}} as unit newton-metres (N·m), or pound-foot (lbf·ft). The concept of bending moment {{is very important in}} engineering (particularly in civil and mechanical engineering) and physics.|$|R
25|$|It {{is a major}} <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> in {{sustaining}} the navy's blue water operations. It can increase the range of a naval task force without tanker support from seven days and 2400 nautical miles to 50 days and 16,800 nautical miles.|$|E
25|$|The {{program was}} said to have {{originated}} as a solution to one Marine infantry battalion's problem of an expanding Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR).

25|$|Class 2: Resistance (or load) in the middle: {{the effort}} is applied {{on one side of}} the {{resistance}} and the fulcrum is located on the other side, for example, a wheelbarrow, a nutcracker, a bottle opener or the brake pedal of a car. Load arm is smaller than the effort arm. Mechanical advantage is always greater than 1. It is also called <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> lever.|$|E
50|$|The {{frictional}} force, Ff of {{the plane}} on the load acts parallel to the surface, and is always in a direction opposite to {{the motion of the}} object. It is equal to the normal <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the coefficient of static friction μ between the two surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Loads {{imposed on}} {{structures}} {{are supported by}} means of forces transmitted through structural elements. These forces can manifest themselves as tension (axial force), compression (axial force), shear, and bending, or flexure (a bending moment is a <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by a distance, or lever arm, hence producing a turning effect or torque).|$|R
50|$|The Rayleigh {{number is}} defined as the product of the Grashof number, which {{describes}} the relationship between buoyancy and viscosity within a fluid, and the Prandtl number, which describes the relationship between momentum diffusivity and thermal diffusivity.

25|$|The Vermont State Guard (VSG) is the all-volunteer state {{defense force}} {{of the state of}} Vermont. The Vermont State Guard serves {{parallel}} to the Vermont National Guard, acting as a reserve force for the State of Vermont Military Department. The Vermont State Guard is a reserve force composed of individuals living as civilians when not activated, but the force can be activated {{in the event of an}} attack or natural disaster to serve as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> for the National Guard, and is assigned to fulfill the state mission of the National Guard when the National Guard is deployed.|$|E
25|$|The {{print media}} in India and abroad was largely {{sympathetic}} to the Indian cause, with editorials in newspapers based {{in the west and}} other neutral countries observing that Pakistan was largely responsible for the conflict. Some analysts believe that Indian media, which was both larger in number and more credible, may have acted as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> for the Indian military operation in Kargil and served as a morale booster. As the fighting intensified, the Pakistani version of events found little backing on the world stage. This helped India gain valuable diplomatic recognition for its position.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force Network (AFNET), {{a robust}} digital {{information}} grid that enabled quick and accurate threat responses, {{was launched in}} 2010, helping the IAF become a truly network-centric air force. AFNET is a secure communication network linking command and control centres with offensive aircraft, sensor platforms and ground missile batteries. Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS), an automated system for Air Defence operations will ride the AFNet backbone integrating ground and airborne sensors, weapon systems and command and control nodes. Subsequent integration with civil radar and other networks shall provide an integrated Air Situation Picture, and reportedly acts as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> for intelligence analysis, mission control, and support activities like maintenance and logistics. The design features multiple layers of security measures, including encryption and intrusion prevention technologies, to hinder and deter espionage efforts.|$|E
2500|$|In physics, a {{force is}} said to do work if, when acting, there is a {{displacement}} of the point of application {{in the direction of}} the force. [...] For example, when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped, the work done on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball (a <b>force)</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the distance to the ground (a displacement).|$|R
50|$|The three red {{and gold}} lines with red arrow heads symbolize the squadron’s {{commitment}} to the ever vigilant forces at three missile wings: F.E. Warren, Malmstrom and Minot AFBs.

25|$|The Dowding {{system is}} {{considered}} {{key to the}} success of the RAF against the German air force (Luftwaffe) during the Battle of Britain. The combination of early detection and rapid dissemination of that information acted as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier,</b> allowing the fighter force to be used at extremely high rates of effectiveness. In the pre-war period, interception rates of 30% to 50% were considered excellent; that meant that over half the sorties sent out would return without having encountered the enemy. During the Battle, average rates were around 90%, and several raids were met with 100% success rates. Lacking their own direction system, Luftwaffe fighters had little information on the location of their RAF counterparts, and often returned to base having never seen them. When they did, the RAF fighters were almost always in an advantageous position.|$|E
25|$|Project Waterpump (alternately, Operation Waterpump, {{or simply}} Waterpump) was a secretive support {{operation}} by the U.S. Air Force {{to train and}} nurture into existence the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF). The United States had decided to covertly support the Kingdom of Laos in the Laotian Civil War as the Lao fended off a North Vietnamese invasion. The nascent RLAF {{was seen as a}} <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> but needed pilots and technicians. The 40-man Detachment 6, 1st Air Commando Wing, code named Waterpump, was forwarded to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base for this training duty in March 1964. They would remain on duty through the truce of 21 February 1973. Their first hasty assignment was transition training to the T-28 Trojan for American civilian pilots; the resulting A Team would exist through 1967. The Air Commandos also conducted final training for Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) mercenary pilots; the resultant B Team would serve until 1970. Besides putting a polish on graduate pilots, the Waterpump detachment trained Lao pilots from scratch. The RLAF's high pilot casualty rate made bringing the RLAF rosters up to strength a long grind.|$|E
500|$|HSD-II {{proposed}} building small Sprint bases {{close to}} Minuteman fields. Incoming warheads would be tracked {{until the last}} possible moment, decluttering them completely and generating highly accurate tracks. Since the warheads had to land within a short distance of a missile silo to damage it, any warheads {{that could be seen}} to be falling outside that area were simply ignored - only those entering the [...] "Site Protection Volume" [...] needed to be attacked. At the time, Soviet inertial navigation systems (INS) were not particularly accurate. This acted as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier,</b> allowing a few Sprints to defend against many ICBMs.|$|E
5000|$|Komar mass {{can also}} be defined by a flux integral. This {{is similar to the}} way that Gauss's law defines the charge {{enclosed}} by a surface as the normal electric <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the area. The flux integral used to define Komar mass is slightly different from that used to define the electric field, however - the normal force is not the actual force, but the [...] "force at infinity". See the main article for more detail.|$|R

500|$|Militarily, {{there was}} not {{much in the way of}} {{tactical}} or strategic innovation during the Persian invasion, one commentator suggesting it was something of [...] "a soldier's war" [...] (i.e., it was the soldiers rather than generals that won the war). Thermopylae is often used as a good example of the use of terrain as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier,</b> while Themistocles's ruse before Salamis is a good example of the use of deception in warfare. The major lesson of the invasion, reaffirming the events at the Battle of Marathon, was the superiority of the hoplite in close-quarters fighting over the more-lightly armed Persian infantry. Taking on this lesson, the Persian empire would later, after the Peloponnesian War, start recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries.|$|E
500|$|The rapidity {{with which}} forces were {{required}} to deploy to Sierra Leone emphasised {{the need for the}} United Kingdom to retain high-readiness forces. That need also vindicated concepts such as the ARG and the spearhead battalion (the capacity in which 1 PARA was serving when it deployed), and protected 1 PARA in the 2004 review of the infantry structure. The 2004 review reduced the total number of British Army battalions from 40 to 36 and created the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG), which was inspired by the success of 1 PARA in Operation Barras. The SFSG—initially formed around 1 PARA—provides specialist capabilities or acts as a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> for British special forces on large or complex operations. As the largest unilateral operation undertaken by the United Kingdom since their creation, the intervention in Sierra Leone was the first major test of the ORLT and joint task force concepts. Both were created {{as a result of the}} 1997 SDR and provide a headquarters staff at very high readiness to command an expeditionary operation at operational level. According to Richards, both were [...] "thoroughly validated" [...] and were vital in coordinating the large numbers of assets deployed at short notice and reporting back to the Permanent Joint Headquarters in Northwood.|$|E
2500|$|FID {{exists only}} within {{a context of}} host nation (HN) {{internal}} defense and development (IDAD), {{where it can be}} a <b>force</b> <b>multiplier</b> for regional commanders concerned with counterinsurgency. [...] Insurgencies today {{are more likely to be}} transnational than in the past.|$|E
30|$|The aims of {{strength}} training are development of muscular hypertrophy, maximal strength (force development), and/or power. An increase in hypertrophy improves {{the possibility of}} developing force. There {{seems to be a}} proportional relationship between hypertrophy and force. Power development is a product of <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the velocity of the motion. Hence, there is a correlation between force and power which is in line with Newton’s second law of motion which specifies that a greater force generates increased acceleration if the mass of the object is constant.

50|$|Pratapmalla {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} {{and forced to}} cede the Sambalpur-Sonepur-Bolangir tracts along with parts {{of what is now}} Chhattishgarh state to the Ganga kingdom. Later with the advise of his minister Vishnu, Anangabhima established a diplomatic and matrimonial alliance with the Kalachuris by offering the hand of his daughter Chandrika in marriage to the Kalachuri prince, Parmardi Dev. Once the alliance was secured, the Ganga <b>forces</b> <b>multiplied</b> in strength. This diplomatic decision was made keeping in eye the long term prospects of a major threat from the Muslim rulers of Bengal.|$|R
50|$|The machine {{consists}} of an impeller (rotor) which accelerates water outwards by its rotation. The water has its velocity changed by a stator which causes the water {{to be returned to}} the inner diameter of the rotor.For a given mass of water, this velocity change yields a corresponding momentum change - and the rate of change of momentum is proportional to a force. This force acting at some point within the rotor and stator is a distance from the shaft centerline, and a <b>force</b> <b>multiplied</b> by a distance produces torque.|$|R
