40|$|The {{introduction}} of the container revolutionised maritime trade and <b>shipping.</b> Since 1956 <b>container</b> vessels have evolved from converted tankers and cargo <b>ships,</b> via <b>full</b> cellular <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> that could navigate the Panama Canal, to post-Panamax vessels with a capacity of approx. 8500 TEU (Twenty foot Equivalent Unit).

However, current technical and physical constraints such as propulsion and port limitations pose restrictions to further growth. Moreover, the diminishing economies of scale in ship costs are offset by the increase of other costs involved (e. g. port fees, terminal handling charges). Nevertheless, empirical {{research shows that the}} concept of mega container vessels is appealing and that, if available, most shipping lines will deploy such ships. So, the next generation <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> will probably consist of Suez-max vessels (up to 12, 500 TEU) with twin propulsion systems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{framework}} for efficient irregular wave simulations using Higher Order Spectral method coupled with fully nonlinear viscous, two-phase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is presented. CFD model is based on solution decomposition via Spectral Wave Explicit Navier–Stokes Equation method, allowing efficient coupling with arbitrary potential flow solutions. Higher Order Spectrum is a pseudo-spectral, potential flow method for solving nonlinear free surface boundary conditions up to an arbitrary order of nonlinearity. It is capable of efficient long time nonlinear propagation of arbitrary input wave spectra, {{which can be used}} to obtain realistic extreme waves. To facilitate the coupling strategy, Higher Order Spectrum method is implemented in foam-extend alongside the CFD model. Validation of the Higher Order Spectrum method is performed on three test cases including monochromatic and irregular wave fields. Additionally, the coupling between Higher Order Spectrum and CFD is validated on three hour irregular wave propagation.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{critical}} {{to be able to}} estimate a ship׳s response to waves, since the resulting added resistance and loss of speed may cause delays or course alterations, with consequent financial repercussions. Slow steaming has recently become a popular approach for commercial vessels, as a way of reducing fuel consumption, and therefore operating costs, in the current economic and regulatory climate. Traditional methods for the study of ship motions are based on potential flow theory and cannot incorporate viscous effects. Fortunately, unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes computations are capable of incorporating both viscous and rotational effects in the flow and free surface waves. The key objective {{of this study is to}} perform a fully nonlinear unsteady RANS simulation to predict the ship motions and added resistance of a <b>full</b> scale KRISO <b>Container</b> <b>Ship</b> model, and to estimate the increase in effective power and fuel consumption due to its operation in waves. The analyses are performed at design and slow steaming speeds, covering a range of regular head waves, using a commercial RANS solver.

Measured throughput with <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> {{is up to}} seven times greater than with conventional Unix I/O. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> is an I/O data transfer mechanism composed of six system calls. Implemented {{as a supplement to}} or a replacement of a user-level I/O API, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> provides copy-free I/O through selective virtual memory remapping. Unlike related efforts, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> is not limited to one type of device, does not restrict access to data, and does not perform unnecessary memory mappings or copy-on-write operations. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> unconditionally eliminates copies by moving all data with virtual memory remapping. I/O data (in blocks of memory called Containers) is mapped in and out of process address spaces. Copy elimination provides a large reduction in latency and a corresponding improvement in throughput. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> also eliminates unnecessary memory mapping operations, by mapping data only as requested by a process, thereby providing additional latency and throughput gains.
