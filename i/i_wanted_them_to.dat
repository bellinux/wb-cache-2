The Turks nearly destroyed the crusaders’ army near {{the mountains of}} Paphlagonia at Mersivan. The land was well-suited to the Turks—dry and inhospitable for their enemy, it was open, with plenty of space for their cavalry units. The Turks had been troublesome to the Latins for some days, at last making certain that they went where Kilij Arslan <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be {{and making sure that}} they only found a small amount of supplies.|$|E

And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot.

I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation.

I would say definitely in the beginning when I started writing, it was pretty heavy, coming out of my past year of - life. It's changed since then, which is good because I think that the overall theme too - me, personally, I'm not this super heavy girl. You know? I'm one for the sunshine, so it's shifted a lot and it feels a lot better to me." [...] From the interview, it was also mentioned that a track titled [...] "This Heart' which was about her son, {{was going to be on}} the album and was also speculated as the title. The track however never made the final cut. Duff has said regarding the album's lyrical content, [...] "I definitely want people to feel like they're getting a glimpse into my life and what I'm made of. I am a normal girl who has had a not-so-normal life. I feel like my fans have stuck with me because they can relate <b>to</b> me and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> feel like we could go out and have a fun night together. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> know that my heart has been broken, but it's not the end of the world.

500|$|Certain musicians {{influenced}} Ranaldo's songwriting including Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen and Cat Power, {{which he}} referred to as [...] "a kind of older generation of songwriting." [...] He also mentioned Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde (1966) as a particular influence. Ranaldo stated that [...] "these songs were allowed to breathe because they weren't sent through the fan machine. When Sonic Youth writes music, we write everything in a very communal way. It doesn't matter who brought something in initially, it all gets transformed by the band. In this case, I was making decisions, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have {{a certain kind of}} simplicity. They ended up more personal for that reason." ...|$|E
500|$|Due {{to their}} lackluster 2013 performance, the Phillies had the seventh first-round {{pick in the}} June 5–7 MLB draft. They {{selected}} Aaron Nola, a starting pitcher from Louisiana State University predicted {{by many to be}} one of the first draft picks to reach the major leagues, for fast-tracking through the Phillies' minor-league system. In the second round, they selected another pitcher – lefthander Matt Imhof, who played college ball with the Cal Poly Mustangs – and selected Aaron Brown, a pitcher-outfielder from Pepperdine, in the third round. The Phillies changed their organizational draft philosophy from drafting unpolished players with potential to selecting players ready to contribute to the big-league club, picking only one high-school player in the first 28 rounds. Michael Baumann wrote on the Crashburn Alley blog, [...] "Given how high the Phillies drafted and how bad their farm system is at the top, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get back into the game with one swing. This draft won’t do that, but generally you want to get at least one good major league player out of every draft class, plus some odds and ends." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, Villa {{had become}} an {{integral}} part of Luis Aragonés' plans and ousted Raúl from the team. Proving vital in Spain's qualification for Euro 2008, he scored six goals, including a bicycle kick against Liechtenstein. He was subsequently called up for the tournament where he formed a striking relationship with Torres, with whom he would often celebrate his goals. He scored a hat-trick in Spain's 4–1 win over Russia, making him the first player to do so at a UEFA European Championship since Patrick Kluivert in 2000, and only the seventh overall. After the third goal, he went out of his way to meet Torres, who was on the bench at the time, to celebrate with him: [...] "I had just scored a hat-trick and I knew people would be talking about me, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see that I had benefited from Torres's work, just as he sometimes benefits from mine." [...] In the next match, he secured a 2–1 win against Sweden with a goal in the 92nd minute. Rested for the next match against Greece, he started once again in the quarter-finals, where Spain beat Italy 4–2 on penalties; Villa took the first penalty and scored.|$|E

500|$|In February 2010, Robyn {{announced}} {{in an interview}} with Swedish magazine [...] that she would release three albums during 2010. She noted that it had been five years since she released her last effort, Robyn (2005), and that she had not been in the studio [...] "properly" [...] since then. She explained that {{she did not want to}} wait until all the songs had been recorded; she rather wanted to split up the songs in three different releases. She chose to name the trilogy Body Talk after a gay club in London that a friend of hers owns, commenting that the title [...] "tickles [...] imagination". In June 2010, the first in the trilogy, Body Talk Pt. 1, was released, and was quickly followed by the announcement of Body Talk Pt. 2. The album's lead single, [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and the track [...] "Indestructible", were among the first songs to be recorded for the trilogy. Robyn said that [...] "we saved them for later because I knew they would be singles, or could be singles, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get that chance." [...] "Hang with Me" [...] was originally recorded in 2002, by Klas Åhlund's then-wife, Paola Bruna, for her album Stockcity Girl.|$|E
500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 April, Miss Marcella Sherwood, an English missionary, fearing for {{the safety}} of her pupils, {{was on her way to}} shut the schools and send the roughly 600 Indian {{children}} home. While cycling through a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan, she was caught by a mob, pulled to the ground by her hair, stripped naked, beaten, kicked, and left for dead. [...] She was rescued by some local Indians, including the father of one of her pupils, who hid her from the mob and then smuggled her to the safety of Gobindgarh fort. After visiting Sherwood on 19 April, the Raj's local commander, Colonel Dyer, issued an order requiring every Indian man using that street to crawl its length on his hands and knees. Colonel Dyer later explained to a British inspector: [...] "Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore they have to crawl in front of her, too." [...] He also authorised the indiscriminate, public whipping of locals who came within lathi length of British policemen. Miss Marcella Sherwood later defended Colonel Dyer, describing him [...] "as the 'saviour' of the Punjab".|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{original}} album's lukewarm sales and reception, Rowland re-entered recording studios to collect new songs for a reissue of Ms. Kelly, including production by Stargate, Jeff Dawson, CKB and Mark Feist. She was {{also expected to}} record with producer Danja, but deadline pressure prevented from happening; a new track by J. R. Rotem {{did not make the}} final cut. [...] "The sales weren't as good as <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be and to be honest, I did feel sad about that for a little while", Rowland stated in 2008, still blaming the final track listing for too many midtempos and ballads. [...] "I didn't realize it while I was recording it. After it was released [...] many fans said the songs would rock if they were more upbeat." [...] Branded with the title Ms. Kelly: Diva Deluxe, the United States re-release received a digital download release only on March 25, 2008, containing seven tracks — five new songs and two remixes of songs found from the standard edition of the album. The international edition of the Ms. Kelly re-release was released physically and digitally in May 2008, retitled as Ms. Kelly: Deluxe Edition. It removed eight tracks from {{the original}} release and replaced them with six of the seven Diva Deluxe tracks, as Rowland [...] "wanted to have another view on the record and close the Ms. Kelly chapter" [...] with the re-release. Previously unreleased song [...] "Daylight", a Bobby Womack cover and collaboration with Travie McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, served as the reissue's new lead single.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do.
