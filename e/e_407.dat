40|$|The protease-producing {{bacterium}} <b>E</b> <b>407</b> - 8 T {{was isolated}} from deep-sea sediment of the South China Sea {{and has been}} identified recently as representing a new species, Rheinheimera nanhaiensis. The draft genome of R. nanhaiensis <b>E</b> <b>407</b> - 8 T consists of 3, 987, 205 bp and contains 3, 730 predicated protein-coding genes, including 82 extracellular peptidase genes. Protease-producing bacteria {{are considered to be}} key players forthe degradation of organic nitrogen in marine environments (3, 11, 17). They secrete extracellular proteases with particular catalytic properties to effectively hydrolyze complex, high-molecular-weight organic substances (3, 15, 16), releasing smaller molecules available for bacterial utilization in response to their surroundings, which rep-resents the initial step of transformation of organic nitrogen in ma-rine ecosystem (1, 6, 11, 14, 17). A protease-producing marine bac-terium, designated strain <b>E</b> <b>407</b> - 8 T, was isolated (at a water depth of 1, 800 m) from deep-sea sediment of the South China Sea and was found to represent a new species: Rheinheimera nanhaiensis sp. nov.

40|$|Nitrite-dependent {{anaerobic}} methane oxidation (n-damo) {{process is}} unique in linking the microbial carbon and nitrogen cycles, but the presence of n-damo bacteria in marine ecosystem and the associated environmental factors are still poorly understood. In the present study, detection of n-damo bacteria using 16 S rRNA and pmoA gene-based PCR primers was successfully employed to reveal their diversity and distribution in the surface and subsurface sediments of the South China Sea (SCS). The widespread occurrence of n-damo bacteria in both the surface and subsurface sediments with high diversity has been confirmed in this study. The pmoA gene-amplified sequences clustered within three newly erected subclusters, namely SCS- 1, SCS- 2, and SCS- 3, suggesting the unique niche specificity of n-damo bacteria in the marine ecosystem. Results indicated the presence of n-damo bacteria in the west Pacific Ocean with a wide distribution from the continental shelf (E 201 S) to the deep abyss (<b>E</b> <b>407</b> S and <b>E</b> <b>407</b> B). Community structures of n-damo bacteria in SCS are clearly {{different from those of}} nonmarine ones known. It is also found that NOx− and NH 4 + affected the community structures and distribution of n-damo bacteria in the SCS sediments differently. Salinity is another important factor identified, shaping the n-damo communities in marine environments. The community based on pmoA gene-amplified sequences, and community richness and diversity based on 16 S rRNA gene-amplified sequences correlated with temperature. ...|$|E

40|$|Focal {{adhesion}} kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, displays phosphorylation-dependent localization in the seminiferous epithelium {{of adult}} rat testes. FAK is an integrated {{component of the}} blood-testis barrier (BTB) involved in regulating Sertoli cell adhesion via its effects on the occludin-zonula occludens- 1 complex. Herein, we report that p-FAK-Tyr 407 and p-FAK-Tyr 397 display restricted spatiotemporal and almost mutually exclusive localization in the epithelium, affecting BTB dynamics antagonistically, with the former promoting and the latter disrupting the Sertoli cell tight junction-permeability barrier function. Using primary cultured Sertoli cells as an in vitro model that mimics the BTB in vivo both functionally and ultrastructurally, effects of FAK phosphorylation on BTB function were studied by expressing nonphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic mutants, with tyrosine replaced by phenylalanine (F) and glutamate (E), respectively. Compared with WT FAK, Y <b>407</b> <b>E</b> and Y 397 F mutations each promoted barrier function, and the promoting effect of the Y <b>407</b> <b>E</b> mutant was abolished in the Y 397 E-Y <b>407</b> <b>E</b> double mutant, demonstrating antagonism between Tyr 407 and Tyr 397. Furthermore, Y <b>407</b> <b>E</b> mutation induced the recruitment of actin-related protein 3 to the Sertoli cell-cell interface, where it became more tightly associated with neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, promoting actin-related protein 2 / 3 complex activity. Conversely, Y 407 F mutation reduced the rate of actin polymerization at the Sertoli cell BTB. In summary, FAK-Tyr 407 phosphorylation promotes BTB integrity by strengthening the actin filament-based cytoskeleton. FAK serves as a bifunctional molecular "switch" to direct the cyclical disassembly and reassembly of the BTB during the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis, depending on its phosphorylation status, to facilitate the transit of preleptotene spermatocytes across the BTB. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Spot welding is {{a widely}} used in {{automotive}} manufacturing. A dissimilar spot welding is one of welding technology developments which can reduce the weight of vehicles. To join between aluminum and stainless steel, there is still difficult since they have different melting point. This {{research has been conducted}} by joining between aluminum with thickness 1, 2 mm and stainless steel with thickness 1 mm, and puts 0, 2 mm filler zinc in the middle of those parts. This study aims to describe the functions of a filler zinc in dissimilar spot welding. Firstly, chemical composition has been tested by using ASTM A 751 - 0 to know type of the materials, macro and micro structure with ASTM <b>E</b> <b>407</b> - 07 to know the physique. Then the parameters of welding are variety such current (6000, 7000, 8000 A) and weld time (0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4 s). Based on the chemical composition test, the type aluminum speciment is 6019 series, stainless steel is martensite ferrite 430 series, and zinc is ZA- 12 series. In the macro structure test, it shows that the increasing of diameter nuggets are related of amount current and weld timing. Beside that, welding using filler zinc have nugget more larger than non-filler, and also its aluminum looks bigger to stainless steel because different conductivity. In the micro structure test, HAZ area shows grain on alumunum becomes smaller, but on the stainless steel the grain become bigger. It happens because a cooling process on alumunum is faster than stainless steel. Meanwhile in the nugget, the grain of a filler zinc can be mixed only with alumunum grain.

40|$|Introduction: Necrotizing {{fasciitis}} (NF) {{is a rare}} {{soft tissue}} infection, usually polymicrobial, which causes necrosis of the fascia and subcutaneous tissue disorders not involving the skin 1, 2. It is characterized by rapid progression and destruction of the soft tissues of proportion to signs and clinical symptoms. The predisposing factors include diabetes mellitus, steroid therapy, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, obesity, cancer, hypothyroidism, atherosclerosis, alcoholism, drug abuse, age and state of malnutrition. 3, 4 The states of immunosuppression {{plays an important role}} in determining the initiation, progression, and disease outcomes. A prompt diagnosis and immediate aggressive surgical debridement of all compromised tissues are critical to reducing morbidity and mortality in this type of infection. 5 Materials and Methods: The study, unicentric and retrospective, was conducted at the Hospital "Santa Maria alle Scotte" in Siena (Italy). WE report patients'age, sex, medical status, origin of infection, bacteriology, surgical interventions, complications, survival, and other clinical parameters. Results and Conclusions: The treatment of NF may be challenging and the keys to successful management appear to provide for the early detection of infection, high doses of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and surgical intervention with radical debridement of necrotic tissue. Surgery remain the mainstay of treatment for NF. 6 1.

MÉTODOS: Coorte histórica de pacientes submetidos a cirurgia cardíaca valvar, sendo realizada análise de banco de dados por regressão logística. RESULTADOS: No período {{de janeiro}} de 1996 a dezembro de 2008, foram realizadas 1102 cirurgias cardíacas valvares: 718 (65, 2 %) na valva aórtica <b>e</b> <b>407</b> (36, 9 %) na valva mitral; destas, 190 (17, 2 %) cirurgias de revascularização miocárdica associadas à cirurgia valvar e 23 (2, 1 %) cirurgias valvares combinadas (aórtica+mitral). Cento e oitenta e sete (17 %) pacientes apresentaram quadro clínico e eletrocardiográfico de BAV durante o POCC valvar, necessitando de ECAT. Quatorze (7, 5 %) pacientes evoluíram para implante de marcapasso definitivo (1, 27 % do total da amostra).

OBJECTIVES: This {{study was designed}} to investigate the association between perioperative factors and atrio-ventricular block, the need for temporary cardiac artificial pacing and, if necessary, permanent pacemaker implantation after cardiac valve surgery. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the Cardiac Surgery Database - Hospital São Lucas/PUCRS. The data are collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Between January 1996 and December 2008 were included 1102 valve surgical procedures: 718 aortic valves (65. 2 %), 407 (36. 9 %) mitral valve and 190 (17. 2 %) coronar artery bypass grafting combined with valve repair and 23 (2. 1 %) aortic and mitral combined surgery. 187 patients (17 %) showed clinical and electrocardiographic pattern of atrio-ventricular block requiring artificial temporary pacing. Of these, 14 patients (7. 5 %) required permanent pacemaker implantation (1. 27 % of the total valve surgery patients). Multivariate analysis showed association of the incidence of atrio-ventricular block and temporary pacing with mitral valve surgery (OR 1, 76; CI 95 % 1. 08 - 2. 37; P= 0. 002), implantation of bioprosthetic devices (OR 1. 59; CI 95 % 1. 02 - 3. 91; P= 0, 039), age over 60 years (OR 1. 99; CI 95 % 1. 352. 85; P< 0. 001), prior use of anti-arrhythmic drugs (OR 1. 86; CI 95 % 1. 04 - 3. 14; P= 0. 026) and previous use of b-blocker (OR 1. 76; CI 95 % 1. 25 - 2. 54; P= 0. 002).

Classification of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms that may be potential producers of BMN, {{in terms of the}} location and properties of BMN using the methods of comparative genomics with the prospect of their subsequent use as the vectors for magnetically targeted delivery of drugs. This will make possible the use of the hyperthermia techniques for removal of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms that are capable of biomineralization BMN using for heating the cells directly intracellular BMN of these microorganisms. Methods of implementation. The methods of paired and multiple sequence alignment were applied using a free access program ?BLAST? of National Center for Biotechnology Information. Results. It was revealed that strains such as E. coli (541 - 15), K. pneumoniae 342, C. perfringens str. 13, P. fluorescens are potential producers of crystalline magnetite and bacteria: S. aureus RF 122, S. suis BM <b>407,</b> <b>E.</b> aerogenes KCTC 2190, K. pneumoniae RYC 492, P. aeruginosa M 18 can be producers of intracellular amorphous BMN.

These structures presumably reflect the resting state of AcrB, which can bind drugs. After ligand binding, a proton may bind to an acidic residue(s) in the transmembrane domain, i. <b>e.,</b> Asp <b>407</b> or Asp 408, within the putative network of electrostatically interacting residues, which also include Lys 940 and Thr 978, {{and this may}} initiate a series of conformational changes that result in drug expulsion. Herein we report the X-ray structures of four AcrB mutants, the D 407 A, D 408 A, K 940 A, and T 978 A mutants, in which the structure of this tight electrostatic network is expected to become disrupted. These mutant proteins revealed remarkably similar conformations, which show striking differences from the previously known conformations of the wild-type protein. For example, the loop containing Phe 386 and Phe 388, which {{play a major role}} in the initial binding of substrates in the central cavity, becomes prominently extended into the center of the cavity, such that binding of large substrate molecules may become difficult.

The first {{portion of the}} present study assesses laser shock peening effect at two pulse densities on three-dimensional (3 D) surface topography characteristics. In {{the second part of the}} study, the peening effect on surface texture orientation and micro-structure modification, i. e. the effect of surface craters due to plasma and shock waves, were investigated in both longitudinal (L) and transverse (T) directions of the laser-beam movement. In the final portion of the study, the changes of mechanical properties were evaluated with a residual stress profile and Vickers micro-hardness through depth variation in the near surface layer, whereas factorial design with a response surface methodology (RSM) was applied. The surface topographic and micro-structural effect of laser shock peening were characterised with optical microscopy, InfiniteFocus® microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Residual stress evaluation based on a hole-drilling integral method confirmed higher compression at the near surface layer (33 μm) in the transverse direction (σmin) of laser-beam movement, i. <b>e.</b> − <b>407</b> ± 81 MPa and − 346 ± 124 MPa, after 900 and 2500 pulses/cm 2, respectively.

One important aspect {{of this is the}} modulation of glycosylation as a strategy to improve efficacy. Here, we describe mutations of Y 407 in the CH 3 domain of IgG 1 and IgG 4 that significantly increase sialylation, galactosylation, and branching of the N-linked glycans in the CH 2 domain. These mutations also promote the formation of monomeric assemblies (one heavy-light chain pair). Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was used to probe conformational changes in IgG 1 -Y <b>407</b> <b>E,</b> revealing, as expected, a more exposed CH 3 -CH 3 dimerization interface. Additionally, allosteric structural effects in the CH 2 domain and in the CH 2 -CH 3 interface were identified, providing a possible explanation for the dramatic change in glycosylation. Thus, the mutation of Y 407 in the CH 3 domain remarkably affects both antibody conformation and glycosylation, which not only alters our understanding of antibody structure, but also reveals possibilities for obtaining recombinant IgG with glycosylation tailored for clinical applications...|$|R

On earliest observations, the emission line profiles of Nova Oph 2015 displayed a very narrow emission component (FWHM~ 60 km/s), recombining over a time scale of 5 days and showing constant low velocity (RV_sun= - 4. 5 km/s), that we interpret as coming from the wind of the secondary recombining after the ionization from the initial UV-flash of the nova. The underlying broad component underwent a marked reduction in both FWHM and width at zero intensity (the latter declining from 4000 to 2000 km/s in ten days) while increasing by 6 times in flux, that we believe {{is the result of}} the high velocity ejecta of the nova being slowed down while trying to expand within the surrounding wind of the companion.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{photoactivatable}} sterol probe [3 R- 3 H] 6 -Azi- 5 R-cholestan- 3 â-ol ([3 H]Azicholesterol) {{was used}} to identify domains in the Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that interact with cholesterol. [3 H]Azicholesterol partitioned into nAChR-enriched membranes very efficiently (> 98 %), photoincorporated into nAChR subunits on an equal molar basis, and neither the pattern nor the extent of labeling was affected {{by the presence of}} the agonist carbamylcholine, consistent with photoincorporation at the nAChR lipid-protein interface. Sites of [3 H]Azicholesterol incorporation in each nAChR subunit were initially mapped by Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease digestion to two relatively large homologous fragments that contain either the transmembrane segments M 1 -M 2 -M 3 (e. g., RV 8 - 20) or M 4 (e. g., RV 8 - 10). The distribution of [3 H]Azicholesterol labeling between these two fragments (e. g., RV 8 - 20, 29 %; RV 8 - 10, 71 %), suggests that the M 4 segment has the greatest interaction with membrane cholesterol. Photolabeled amino acid residues in each M 4 segment were identified by Edman degradation of isolated tryptic fragments and generally correspond to acidic residues located at either end of each transmembrane helix (<b>e.</b> g., RAsp- <b>407).</b> [3 H]Azicholesterol labeling was also mapped to peptides that contain either the M 3 or M 1 segment of each nAChR subunit. These results establish that cholesterol likely interacts with the M 4, M 3, and M 1 segments of each subunit, and therefore, the cholesterol binding domain fully overlap...|$|R
40|$|Silk fibroin (SF) is {{a natural}} {{biopolymer}} that has been extensively studied in various applications due to its impressive mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Recently, SF-based particles have been proposed as controlled drug delivery systems. A new and efficient method to prepare SF microemulsions (SF-MEs) was developed by oil-in-water emulsions using high-pressure homogenization to promote emulsification. During SF-ME production, the secondary structure of SF changed to a more stable conformation (from random coil to -sheets), thus allowing the formation of small and stable (140. 7 ± 1. 9 nm; polydispersity index, 0. 25) SF microparticles (SF-MPs). The efficiency of SF-MP formation was 60 %. Orange IV {{was used as a}} model compound for incorporation and release studies, although its incorporation into the SF-MEs significantly improved particle size and size distribution over at least 4 wk compared to traditional stabilizers (<b>e.</b> g., poloxamer <b>407,</b> transcutol, Tween 80, and SDS). This should be a call of attention when using dyes as model compounds since they can influence particle properties and lead to misinterpretation of the results. Orange IV showed an incorporation efficiency of 91 % and a controlled release over time. Stable SF-MP formulations, further enhanced by orange IV incorporation, provide an innovative method with potential application in pharmaceutical development due to its associated high biocompatibility and release profile.

40|$|Purpose This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a thermostatic chamber for the performance analysis of commercial vapor compression refrigerators. The thermostatic chamber and the refrigerators are equipped {{with a range of}} sensors to monitor respectively the temperature and humidity inside and outside the chamber and the thermodynamic conditions of the working fluid, i. e. temperature, pressure and mass flow rate, in the circuit critical points. The acquisition of sensor data and the refrigerator performance evaluation are provided thanks to a real-time and automatic interface developed adopting LabView© integrated development environment (IDE). The thermostatic chamber is adopted to compare the performance of refrigerants R 407 f and R 410 a as environmentally-friendly alternatives to the R 404 a, the current working fluid in the considered commercial refrigerator. Indeed, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of R 404 a is approximately twice the value of refrigerants R 407 f and R 410 a. The purpose of the experimental campaign is verify whether the R 407 f and R 410 a refrigerants allow comparable thermodynamic performances to R 404 a without requiring substantial component replacements.   Design/methodology/approach The paper focuses on the description of the developed thermostatic chamber and the system setup for the experimental campaign of a commercial vapor compression refrigerator. The chamber is composed by a 180 x 180 x 220 cm stainless steel climatic room with an internal volume of 5. 12 m 3, properly insulated by 100 mm of expanded polyurethane. The thermostatic chamber integrates the commercial vapor compression refrigerator, the refrigerant charging equipment and all the necessary sensors to monitor the environment conditions and evaluate the system performance. Originality/Value Global warming concerns have increased the efforts of the scientific community to identify alternative refrigerants in air conditioning systems with lower environmental impact and many results in the literature show their technical and economical feasibility. However, the introduction of these refrigerant alternatives in industrial products encounters some difficulties and, nowadays, several commercial refrigerators still adopt working fluids with a significant global warming potential. In this context, this paper presents the development and setup of a thermostatic chamber that can be adapted to real refrigerators to compare the thermodynamic performance of different refrigerants. An automatic control and data acquisition systems allow to test the thermostatic chamber in several technical configurations, i. e. ambient temperature and operating temperatures etc. The experimental campaign, applied to a commercial vapor compression refrigerator, compares the performance of environmentally-friendly refrigerants alternatives, i. <b>e.</b> R <b>407</b> f and R 410 a, to the currently adopted working fluid, i. e. R 404 a. The results may lead the company to launch onto the market a similar commercial refrigerator adopting a working fluid with a lower environmental impact...|$|R

The plants were cultivated in plastic pots filled with soil substratum and kept under greenhouse conditions. Glyphosate application was performed 20 days post emergence, at which time they presented four true leaves. Reduced rates of glyphosate, simulating drift, ranged from 270 and 540 g. A control was also used, without herbicide application to compare the effects. Weekly evaluations were accomplished up to 42 days after application (DAA). During this period, plant height was also measured. Visual symptoms began 3 DAA, with the appearance of yellow spots at the tips of the youngest leaves, followed by withering at the apex of the plants. At the rate of 270 g ha- 1, these symptoms showed low intensity but at the rate of 540 g ha- 1 the symptoms caused "worrisome" to "very high'' toxicity, in most of the cases.

The doses of 360 - 370 - 360 g / pot of NPK provide 95 % of the increased production of MST observed. There are squared effects of doses of N, at doses of 373, 407 and 317 of N mg/dm 3 for maximum production estimated MST, MSF and MSC, respectively. Using up the doses of 360 mg P and K/dm 3 of soil, returned to linear effect of doses of P for production of MST and MSF, however, there was no effect on production of MSC. Were obtained linear effects of doses of K on the production of MST, MSF and MSC. The doses of N and K linearly affected the levels of PBF, while P had no significant effect, and the levels of PCBs were not affected by doses of NPK. The levels of PBF were higher than levels found in stems. The phosphate fertilizer and foremost, the nitrogen, caused an increase in the accumulated amount of N, P and K. the increase of nitrogen reduced the level of P in the leaves...|$|R
40|$|O consumo de bebidas energéticas cresce a cada ano e atinge um grupo cada vez maior de adolescentes e adultos jovens, porém, o impacto destas bebidas no desenvolvimento e na saúde ainda não tem resultados concretos. Diante do aumento no consumo de bebidas energéticas, principalmente associadas ao álcool, e {{considerando que}} o impacto toxicológico deste consumo excessivo é desconhecido, este trabalho teve por objetivo fazer uma avaliação da neurotoxicidade induzida por bebida energética, e seus principais componentes, cafeína e taurina em ratos Wistar machos. Os animais (n= 5 /grupo) foram tratados em dose única para avaliação da toxicidade aguda (OECD 420) em dois experimentos. Experimento 1 : os animais foram tratados por via oral com soluções contendo: água, bebida energética nas doses de 5 mL/kg (ED 5), 7, 5 mL/kg (ED 7, 5) e 10 mL/kg (ED 10), cafeína 3, 2 mg/kg, taurina 40 mg/kg e associação de cafeína 3, 2 mg/kg e taurina 40 mg/kg. Foram observados comportamentos indicativos de atividade depressora ou estimulante do SNC e manifestações autonômicas. Durante 14 dias a variação de massa {{corporal}} e letalidade foram observadas. Ao fim deste período todos os animais foram anestesiados, eutanasiados e necropsiados, sendo determinada a massa relativa dos órgãos. Os resultados revelaram sinais de toxicidade pelo aumento da ambulação, taquipnéia e alguns comportamentos associados à ansiedade, principalmente nas doses intermediárias do energético (ED 7, 5). Experimento 2 : Os ratos foram tratados por via oral com soluções contendo: água, energético (ED 10), álcool 20 % (2 g/kg e álcool 20 % (2 g/kg) associado à energético (ED 10), cafeína 3, 2 mg/kg, taurina 40 mg/kg e associação de cafeína 3, 2 mg/kg mais taurina 40 mg/kg. A avaliação da toxicidade aguda foi realizada conforme descrito anteriormente. Entretanto, neste protocolo os animais foram anestesiados, eutanasiados, necropsiados 24 h após os tratamentos. A massa relativa dos órgãos foi determinada. Os resultados mostraram que quando o álcool foi associado ao energético ou a taurina e cafeína, os sinais de toxicidade observados foram mais intensos. Dando continuidade à avaliação da neurotoxicidade, procedeu-se a avaliação da toxicidade subcrônica dos energéticos e dos padrões(cafeína <b>e</b> taurina) (OECD <b>407).</b> Os animais (n= 10 /grupo) foram tratados por via oral durante 28 dias com ED 5, ED 7, 5, ED 10, cafeína 3, 2 mg/kg, taurina 40 mg/kg e a associação de cafeína 3, 2 mg/kg + taurina 40 mg/kg. Demonstrou-se que nos testes de memória (OX Maze e reconhecimentos de objetos) os grupos tratados com cafeína e taurina isoladamente ou em associação tiveram um melhor desempenho nos parâmetros avaliados. Estes resultados são independentes de alterações na atividade locomotora, avaliada através do teste de Rota Rod e atividade locomotora espontânea. No 290 dia após o início dos tratamentos os animais foram eutanasiados e medidos os biomarcadores do estresse oxidativo (atividade das enzimas antioxidantes superóxido dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutationa peroxidase (GPx) e a produção de espécies reativas através da medida de diclorofluoresceína (DCFH) e conteúdo de tióis) nas estruturas córtex pré-frontal, hipocampo e estriado. Os resultados obtidos com a associação de cafeína e taurina foram os mais relevantes demonstrando que houve diminuição da atividade de enzimas antioxidantes com consequências. Em todos os testes foi evidente que a associação de cafeína e taurina, mesmo nas concentrações presentes na maior dose de energético, diferiu dos efeitos da administração apenas do energético. Considerando que os efeitos dos energéticos são normalmente associados à presença de cafeína e taurina, sugere-se que os resultados podem estar relacionados com a presença de outros componentes nos energéticos, que interferem na modulação dos efeitos causados apenas pela associação de cafeína e taurina. Consumption of energy drinks is growing {{every year and}} reaches {{a growing number of}} teenagers and young adults, however, the impact of these drinks in the development and health does not have concrete results. Due to the increase in the consumption of energy drinks, mainly associated with alcohol, and considering that the toxicological impact of this excessive consumption is unknown, to aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the neurotoxicity induced by energy drink, and its main components, caffeine and taurine in male Wistar rats. The animals (n= 5 /group) were treated in a single dose for evaluation of acute toxicity (OECD 420) in two experiments. Experiment 1 : The animals were treated by oral route with water (control), energy drink in doses of 5 mL/kg (ED 5), 7. 5 mL/kg (ED 7, 5) and 10 mL/kg (ED 10), caffeine 3. 2 mg/kg, taurine 40 mg/kg and the combination of 3. 2 mg/kg caffeine and 40 mg/kg taurine. It were observed indicative behaviors of depressant or stimulant activity of the CNS and autonomic manifestations. During 14 days the body weight change and mortality were observed. At the end of this period all animals were anesthetized, euthanized and necropsied, and determined the relative organ weights. The results showed signs of toxicity by increased ambulation, tachypnea, and some behaviors associated with anxiety, especially in intermediate energy dose (ED 7. 5). Experiment 2 : The rats were orally treated with water (control), energy (ED 10), 20 % alcohol (2 g/kg) and ethanol 20 % (2 g/kg) associated with the energy drink (ED 10), caffeine 3. 2 mg/kg, taurine 40 mg/kg and the combination of 3. 2 mg/kg caffeine and 40 mg/kg taurine. The assessment of acute toxicity was performed as described above. However, in this protocol, the animals were anesthetized, euthanized, necropsied 24 after the treatments. The relative organ weights were determined. The results showed that when ethanol was associated to the energy drink or taurine and caffeine, the signs of toxicity were more intense. Continuing evaluation of neurotoxicity was carried out to evaluate subchronic toxicity of energy drink and components (caffeine and taurine) (OECD 407). The animals (n= 10 /group) were treated orally for 28 days with ED 5, ED 7, 5, ED 10, caffeine 3, 2 mg/kg, taurine 40 mg/kg, and the combination of caffeine 3, 2 mg/kg + taurine 40 mg/kg. It has been shown that in the memory tests (OX Maze and recognition of objects), the groups treated with caffeine and taurine alone or in combination had a best performance in the evaluated parameters. These results are independent of changes in locomotor activity as measured by Rota Rod test and spontaneous locomotor activity. In 29 th day after the start of treatment, the animals were euthanized and oxidative stress biomarkers such as the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), the total thiol content and the production of reactive species were measured in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. The results obtained with the combination of caffeine and taurine were the most relevant, demonstrating that there was decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes. In all tests it was evident that caffeine and taurine mixture, even at the same concentration present in the largest amount of energy drink, differed from the effects of the administration of energy drink only. Whereas the effects of energy are usually associated with the presence of caffeine and taurine, it is suggested that these results may be related to the presence of other components in energy drink, which interfere with the modulation of the effects caused by the combination of caffeine and taurine only...|$|R
