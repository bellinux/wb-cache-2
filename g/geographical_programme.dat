It explores the potential of distance education to support lifelong learners through courses or modules that operate across international boundaries and incorporate materials from local and global contexts. The authors argue that Internet-enabled distance education offers the potential to extend access to many prospective students who are unlikely or unable to participate in full-time residential courses, and that distance education can facilitate international collaboration among educators and educational institutions. A case is made for an internationalized programme of study for continuing adult education, as opposed to the primary, secondary and higher education sectors that are the focus of most existing <b>geographical</b> education <b>programmes.</b> Next, the authors document the ways in which recent commitments to internationalizing teaching and learning in geography have brought us to the point where professional development of lifelong learners is demonstrable, particularly in the fields of geographic information technologies and teacher professional development. They outline some of the main challenges that must be addressed if the potential of distance education as an enabling tool for professional development in geography is to be fulfilled: specifically, collaborative development and delivery of curricula and the articulation of quality assurance standards and certification agreements among participating institutions...|$|R

The current statistics show that about 89 % of total energy is consumed in residential sector is largely for cooking and heating purpose. The major sources of residential energy are fuel wood (86. 5 %), animal dung (6. 5 %) and agricultural residue (3. 7 %), which clearly indicates a huge demand for biomass as household energy in the country. Several studies have shown that particulate matter (PM) concentration on 10 cooking place was about 8000 µg/m against the national standard of 120 µg/m in 24 hours average time. 3 3 Similarly, the total suspended particle (TSP) was about 8, 800 µg/m against national standard of 230 µg/m, 3 3 21 ppm of carbon monoxide (CO) against national standard of 9 ppm in 8 hour average was found where biomass was used as fuel. Moreover, these studies have also shown that mortality and morbidity rates among children and women are extremely high due to acute respiratory infection (ARI) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This clearly indicates that the major cause behind it is indoor air pollution.

40|$|Greece {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} of the European Union to introduce a human. papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine in its national vaccination <b>programme.</b> <b>Geographical</b> variations in the prevalence of the different HPV types have been demonstrated. The aim of this preliminary case control study was to investigate HPV infection in women with low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) from two different geographical areas of Greece; Central Greece and Crete. Seventy-five cervical specimens were collected from women with SILs from Crete and Central Greece. HPV detection and typing were performed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. HPV- 18 was detected more frequently in Crete than in the Central Greece samples (29. 7 vs 13. 1 %). HPV- 16 was predominant in Central Greece (34. 2 %), while in Crete it was detected in 23 % of the studied women. Non- 16 /- 18 HPV types were detected in 45. 9 % of the women from Crete and 52. 6 % of the women from Central Greece. No relationship was observed between the geographical distribution of HPV and the presence of K-ras or B-raf point mutations in either group. Our pre-vaccination data indicate a high prevalence of HPV- 18 in Crete. A trend for difference was observed in the rates of non-HPV- 16 /- 18 women between the two areas. A large epidemiological study is required to investigate the prevalence of the different HPV types to further investigate the effectiveness of HPV vaccination in the Greek population...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{understand}} different outcomes of implementation of wind power deployment <b>programmes.</b> <b>Geographical</b> {{variables such as}} quantity of wind resources are in themselves insufficient to explain patterns of implementation of wind power. To enhance {{the review of the}} factors affecting wind power deployment we also made a systematic comparison of six country cases: Denmark, Spain, Germany, Scotland, the Netherlands, and England/Wales. The impact of four key institutional variables is examined and put into a scheme of a set of potential hypothesis about their inter-relationships. These are influenced by different national traditions: planning systems; financial support mechanisms; landscape protection organisations and patterns of ownership of wind power. (1) Planning systems, which favour wind power are essential, and in all cases national planning policies generally intend to support wind power development, but planning institutions show a wide variety with clear differences in implementation results. (2) Systems of financial support are also a sine qua non for development but they also vary in their effectiveness across country and time in the study. Robust and consistent support regimes in Denmark, Germany and Spain have speeded developments. (3) Landscape protection organisations vary in strength in a range between England/Wales (very strong and influential) to Spain (non-existent). Strong and effective opposition to wind developments is always primarily rooted in landscape values. (4) Local ownership patterns coincide with higher rates of wind power deployment than remote, corporate ownership. Local involvement recruits conditional support for projects and is related to traditions of energy activism. Such traditions are strongest in Denmark and Germany and weakest in Spain, England/Wales and Scotland. Resource Planning Local ownership Landscape Financial support...|$|R
40|$|Implementing health-promoting {{programmes}} for {{the most}} excluded and at-risk social groups forms {{a key part of}} any efforts to address underserved populations and reduce health inequalities in society. However, many at-risk children, particularly children in Deaf communities, are not reached, or are poorly served, by health-promoting programmes within the school setting. This is so because schools are effective as health-promoting environments for d/Deaf children {{only to the extent that}} they properly address their unique communication needs and ensure they are both able and enabled to learn in a communication-rich and supportive psycho-social environment. This article examines how the usually separate strands of school health promotion and d/Deaf education might be woven together and illustrates research with Deaf community members that involves them and gives their perspective. The primary objective of this study was to map Deaf pilot bilingual education programmes in Spain—one of the first countries to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations. (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Resolution A/RES/ 61 / 106.) —with particular attention to their compliance to the Convention’s article 24. Following pre-testing, 516 key informants were surveyed by mail (response rate: 42. 08 %) by using a snowball key-informant approach, within a Participatory Action Research framework, at a national, regional and local level. The results show that although some schools have achieved recommended standards, bilingual programmes are in various stages of formulation and implementation and are far from being equally distributed across the country, with only four regions concentrating more than 70 % of these practices. This uneven <b>geographical</b> distribution of <b>programmes</b> probably reflects more basic differences in the priority given by regions, provinces, and municipalities to the Deaf community’s needs and rights as an important policy objective and may reinforce or widen inequalities by favouring or discriminating rather than achieving access and equity for this noticeably overlooked community.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a <b>Geographical</b> Information System <b>programme</b> {{has been built}} to analyse and present the {{territorial}} impacts of P. A. TH. E (Patra-Athens-Thessalonica-Eyzonoi) international road {{in the area around}} it, in Greece, using social, economic and transport indicators. Using the Visual Basic programming and MapObjects components, an intelligent GIS programme is developed which everyone, with no knowledge to geodatabases, has the ability to use it. It has the capability to retrieve, interpret and render the statistical and cartographical features on the map, applying functions and provide suitable tools such as add layer (shapefile, grid, cad, image, coverage, etc.), zoom in, zoom out, pan, full extent, buffer, overlay, intersection, dot density patterns for polygons, calculation of statistics, identify, printing, copy and features classification. These tools are needed in order to generate specialized solutions for desktop mapping and spatial analysis. Moreover the application is enhanced with simple and useful interfaces to everyone who wants to correlate geographical and statistical information. The developed GIS has been used to study the territorial impacts in six hundred and four municipalities (ninety-three of them are crossed by the road) which are contained in twenty - three counties around the P. A. TH. E road. The administrative division NUTS V (municipality) has been selected as geographical level for the analysis. All the municipalities have been separated in three categories: 2 ̆ 022 the first contains the municipalities which the road crosses, 2 ̆ 022 the second includes the municipalities which are included in the same county with the municipalities in the first category but the road does not pass through them, 2 ̆ 022 in the third belongs municipalities that are in neighbour counties of the second. Nine indicators (total and by sex population changes, population density, employment and unemployment rates, net migration, mobility, road density and land use) in four different time periods (1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001) have been used to study the spatial impacts of P.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} for the Master of Science <b>programme</b> <b>Geographical</b> Information Management and Applications looks at the possibilities of completing the asset information life cycle at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Therefor an analysis {{was made of the}} current situation, after a literature research was conducted towards the subjects of data exchange and Building Information Modelling (BIM). The insights in data exchange principles are needed to understand the potential problems in completing the asset information life cycle. At the moment as-built information is delivered to SGIS, but not re-used in new projects. The most important problems are caused by systems that are not able {{to communicate with each other}} and data structures that are different by nature because of its native software. BIM is a topic that currently gets much attention in the world of design and construction. From their perspective BIM deals with another way of executing design and construction, where collaboration and integration are the key words. In practice BIM has a broader scope and can be defined as, being a process in which relevant actors collaborate on creating, analysing and managing multiple dimension data within a dynamic model representing one or more assets throughout its/their life cycle. For this thesis research the new data model for asset information at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Schiphol GIS or SGIS, was analysed. SGIS replaces four other systems that contained all asset information at Schiphol, but that also contained double and inconsistent information. With SGIS these problems must belong to the past. The data model mostly contains 2 D or 2 ½D data of all assets, including the most relevant information on the asset. SGIS also communicates, or will do so within two years, with three other systems that as a complex are the back bone of the asset management process at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. There are currently two problems with completing the asset information life cycle. The first problem is getting the information from the 3 D model to SGIS. To solve this problem a workflow is suggested. This workflow includes an export to the open standard IFC from the original 3 D AEC modelling software. A small addition to SGIS has to be made therefor, to be able to support the 3 D geometries that are coming from that software. The second problem is to get the information back from the operations and maintenance phase to a new design phase. Currently the most optimal solution seems to re-use the received IFC file and to add a DWG containing the changed geometries. Thereby it needs to be mentioned that the multi-patch objects from SGIS will be exploded to individual faces. The preferred solution would have been to work from one central (spatial) database, but that is technically not possible yet. The problems are caused by the fact that AEC (3 D modelling) software and GIS do not share a common geometric data model. Additionally it needs to be researched what the actual information demand is for the design phase. In the current situation information gets lost after the exchange from construction to operations and maintenance, because the information need in those phases is less detailed. With the suggested solutions and changes/additions to SGIS it is possible to complete the asset information life cycle for Schiphol and the relevant stakeholders and main-contractors. An inventory of the necessary resources to plan these changes still needs to be made. GIS TechnologyOTB Research Institute for the Built Environmen...|$|R
40|$|Background This {{discussion}} paper identifies and analyses {{a number of}} key governance issues that are relevant to ‘decentralisation’ as a concept in public sector reform. It explores, particularly within the context of contemporary Irish experience, some of the key opportunities and challenges for effective leadership and collegiality in a geographically decentralised Irish civil and public service: areas which may have been comparatively neglected, in both research and policy terms, in the past but which demand further attention for effective implementation of current initiatives. The research draws upon: · an extensive review of the national and international literature on civil/public service decentralisation, as well as effective leadership and positive collegiality in the commercial and non-commercial sectors; · in-depth discussions with those engaged, at a senior level, both in Ireland and elsewhere with developing and implementing decentralisation programmes; · in-depth discussions with the chief officers in a crosssection of Irish public bodies directly affected by the current programme, as well as senior trade union representatives and senior private sector managers; In this regard, it must be stressed that the <b>geographical</b> decentralisation <b>programme</b> currently in hand for the Irish public service will have a direct and/or indirect impact not just on those specific bodies identified for decentralisation under the current programme but will have an impact across the public service as well as in other sectors. Indeed the changes that are afoot are of a scale and character that should lead to a fundamental recasting of the Irish system of public administration. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Policy context Since 1994, the Irish public service has been engaged upon a long-term programme of public service modernisation, also known as the Strategic Management Initiative (SMI), broadly along New Public Management (NPM) lines. While Ireland’s efforts at geographical decentralisation long predate the SMI and have not, until now, had significant, explicit implications for the modernisation agenda, a considerable sense of urgency has now been injected into this gradually, self-modernising administrative system. For, into a previously consensual and gradualist policy environment, the Minister for Finance in December 2003 announced the Irish government 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to the voluntary decentralisation of over 10, 300 posts in civil service departments/offices and agencies to over fifty locations across twenty-five counties throughout the country. Of this total, over 3, 000 of the posts earmarked for relocation are in state agencies. Additionally, the government decided that, save in exceptional circumstances, any new agencies/bodies being established in the future should be located in areas compatible with this new programme. While decentralisation has not formed an explicit plank of either current or past Irish public service reform initiatives and while Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s experience to date has demonstrated little devolution of fiscal and other high-level decision-making functions from central to local levels, the spatial decentralisation of Dublin-based public service employment and functions to non-metropolitan locations has been a feature of Irish administrative reorganisation at least since the 1960 s. Broadly speaking, there have been two previous phases of geographical decentralisation in Ireland: (a) dispersal during the period 1967 to 1987; followed by (b) a complex period of dispersal, deconcentration and regionalisation (1988 - 2003). Thus, even before the new programme is implemented, previous national-level initiatives, together with the adoption of regional strategies by some departments/offices, have already resulted in a complex spatial mosaic of public service locations. Together with dispersed functional units, this complex mosaic includes regionalised and/or county-based offices supported by networks of branch, district and local offices. However, there is little doubt that, although it builds upon these earlier initiatives, the current decentralisation programme will present unprecedented management and operational challenges at the departmental/organisational and publicservice wide levels. It will also be important to learn from experiences in the past regarding leadership and collegiality in a geographically complex civil service in order to help plot the future. The current proposals will not only mean that the majority of civil service, as well as public service, posts will be based outside Dublin but no fewer than eight government departmental HQs will be located away from the capital, while the government itself and many other departments and stakeholder organisations will continue to operate from the centre. As a consequence, an entirely new approach to the governance of the service will be required and, in particular, new models of leadership and collegiality developed. This dramatic policy initiative, in the short-term, has not only reverberated throughout the administrative system, but, in the longer term, has the potential to present hitherto un-thought of opportunities for radical reform and improvements in the way the Irish public service operates. Learning from others A number of other countries have implemented decentralisation initiatives in the past number of decades. For example, in the Netherlands and UK up {{to the end of the}} 1980 s the decentralisation of public service employment away from the capital had been used as part of a regional development strategy to relieve long-term unemployment in declining industrial areas. More recently, evidence from secondary sources indicates international experience of relocation and decentralisation in a wide range of countries and/or other public administrations; e. g. France, Germany, Norway, Japan and Canada (British Colombia). Internationally, the geographical decentralisation of the civil and public service is seen as an opportunity to secure improved efficiency on the back of business process reengineering (BPR), new working practices and modernisation. However, this research found that, although some useful inferences can be drawn from a review of available international evidence, it is difficult to identify in other public administrations in OECD a direct comparator for the current programme of Irish decentralisation. This lack of a comparator relates to the scale of the current programme, its scope, timing and, above all, its inclusion of proposals to relocate entire organisations in locations away from the capital city and centre of political life. For example, the UK approach specifically excludes the movement of head offices of government departments away from London. Leadership and collegiality Available research evidence suggests that both effective leadership and positive collegiality are key features of good governance and the significance of both these qualities is at a premium within the context of a geographically complex, decentralised civil and public service. Such qualities of good governance as leadership, effectiveness, participation, coherence, programme delivery and effective stakeholder engagement are particularly relevant in the context of the decentralisation programme given the continuing location of the Oireachtas and a number of departments in central Dublin and the particular challenges posed by the geographical decentralisation of others. Indeed, it is important to note that, as early as March 2004, the Decentralisation Implementation Group was beginning to acknowledge the importance of these qualities in forming ‘a post-decentralised civil service’: ‘The geographic relocation and dispersal of staff may help to reinforce existing moves towards greater devolution of authority and responsibility to, and within, organisations. There will be an onus on management at organisational and suborganisational level to exercise greater de facto responsibility for HR, finance and other organisational matters. A more geographically dispersed civil service needs to be balanced by sufficiently strong common values and culture to support effective system-wide co-operation and decision-making. It will be necessary to reinforce, and invest more heavily in corporate culture and ethos’ (First Report of the Decentralisation Implementation Group to Minister for Finance p. 28). These opportunities and challenges are explored in this research at corporate/service-wide, interdepartmental and intradepartmental levels A review of the latest international literature and best practice management frameworks clearly highlights that not only is effective leadership the cornerstone upon which organisational excellence is built, it also: · gives strategic direction: it develops and communicates vision, mission and values; · achieves change and focuses efforts on customer service; · develops and implements a system for organisational management and performance review; · motivates and supports people, acting as a role model; · manages the relationships with politicians and other stakeholders, acting in a socially responsible manner. These qualities hold true across the public and private sectors. Effective and visible leadership is required to promote an emphasis on co-operation, consensus, persuasion and the like. A key quality of leadership is also the capacity to operate in a collegial manner and to support collegiality between and within organisations. Together with positive collegiality, these qualities of effective leadership apply at three levels: the corporate or service-wide; the inter- and the intra-departmental. The key research question for this study was to consider the extent to which these qualities of leadership and collegiality could be affected by the geographical dispersal of the public service organisations concerned and, specifically, to identify and discuss opportunities and challenges thus presented.
