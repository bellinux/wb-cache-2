5000|$|The M252 system weighs 91 lb (41 kg) {{completely}} {{assembled and}} {{is composed of}} the M253 Cannon (35 lb, 16 kg), M177 Mount (27 lb, 12 kg), M3A1 Baseplate (29 lb, 13 kg), and the M64A1 <b>Sight</b> <b>Unit</b> (2.5 lb, 1.1 kg). The mount consists of a base plate and a bipod, which is provided with screw type elevating and traversing mechanisms to elevate/traverse the mortar. The M64A1 <b>sight</b> <b>unit</b> (also used on the M224) {{is attached to the}} bipod mount. The M252 is a gravity-fired smoothbore system. Attached to the muzzle of the weapon is the Blast Attenuation Device (BAD), used to reduce the blast effects on the mortar crew. To increase cooling efficiency, the breech end is finned; though first-hand accounts attest that the level of cooling is negligible. [...] The cannon also has a crew-removable breech plug and firing pin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{training}} {{level of}} the operator is critical since, unlike infrared guided missiles, the operator has to track the target exactly with the <b>sighting</b> <b>unit</b> aimpoint (SACLOS). If the aircraft detects the targeting laser, it has the whole period of the missile flight time to engage in avoidance manoeuvres, which adds additional challenge to the missile operator's target-tracking task.|$|R

The commander has an independent thermal viewer and a new integrated <b>sight</b> <b>unit</b> called the Improved Bradley Acquisition System (IBAS), which allows automatic gun adjustments, automatic boresighting, and tracking of dual targets. The roof is reinforced with titanium armor. Many M3A3s were converted from M3A2s.|$|R
5000|$|... Produced under license by ARMSCOR. After a {{competition}} between the German G3 rifle, the Armalite AR-10, and the FN FAL, the South African Defence Force adopted three main variants of the FAL: a rifle with the designation R1, a [...] "lightweight" [...] variant of the FN FAL 50.64 with folding butt, fabricated locally under the designation R2, and a model designed for police use not capable of automatic fire under the designation R3. [...] ( [...] 200,000 were destroyed in UN-sponsored [...] "Operation Mouflon" [...] in 2001). A number of other variants of the R1 were built, the R1 HB, which had a heavy barrel and bipod, the R1 Sniper, which could be fitted with a scope and the R1 Para Carbine, which used a Single Point <b>IR</b> <b>sight</b> and had a shorter barrel. R1 was standard issue in the SADF until {{the introduction of the}} R4 in the early 1980s. Still used by the SANDF as a designated marksman rifle.|$|R
5|$|Developed in 1939, the Mk. XIV started {{replacing}} the First World War-era Course Setting Bomb Sight in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated {{version of the}} Course Setting sight, using a mechanical computer to update the sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV required only 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. More importantly, the Mk.

5000|$|Behind the {{two front}} seats was a three-seat bench, {{although}} {{this could be}} replaced with a four-seat bench when fitted with modified rear doors (see main photograph). It was used for general light work, including observation, liaison, training, and search and rescue. When fitted as a light attack helicopter, it carried either two, skid-mounted, forward-firing machine gun (L8A1 GPMG) packs or a single pintle-mounted machine gun in the rear cabin. The pintle mount was available in both port and starboard mountings. The gun-packs, which were both aimed at a pre-set convergence angle, carried 200 rounds of ammunition and were mounted on a tubular spar that was fixed between {{the front and rear}} undercarriage legs. In the anti-tank role, it could carry four guided missiles (the Nord SS.11). The <b>sighting</b> <b>unit</b> was the AF.120, the result of a joint venture between Avimo and Ferranti, had x2.5 and x10 magnification. The APX Bezu <b>sight</b> <b>unit</b> was also evaluated but rejected, although it was adopted for use on the Westland Wasp. Additional testing and trials were carried out with the Swingfire anti-tank guided missile. Initial firings were carried out in early 1972, to test the [...] "Hawkswing" [...] system for the Westland Lynx, the associated AF.530 gyro-stabilized sight was subsequently trialled in 1974. The Hawkswing system was cancelled in 1975 due to its manual control system (MCLOS) compared to the semi-automatic (SACLOS) system utilised by Milan. In the casualty evacuation role (CASEVAC), the Scout could carry two stretchers internally or two on externally mounted pods, the co-pilots seat could also be reversed to allow an attendant to face the casualties.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the effect of the line of <b>sight</b> <b>unit</b> vector (LOS) on the accuracy of the GPS and pseudolite navigation system. An analytic derivation shows that the error of LOS cannot lower the accuracy of CPS in first-order sense. We carried out numerical simulation to examine the effect of the higher-order terms of the LOS error on ranging accuracy. The effect of the LOS error on CPS accuracy is negligible. On the contrary, the accuracy of pseudolite navigation system can be quite sensitive to LOS error, unless the distance between user and pseudolite is quite large. However, if the distance between user and pseudolite is sufficiently large, the LOS error can be ignored in pseudolite navigation system...|$|R
