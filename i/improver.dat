Stanley worked in his father's {{unsuccessful}} building business, becoming adept at working with metal and wood, later to obtain employment as a plumber/drainage contractor and joiner in London. He joined his father in 1849 at an engineering works at Whitechapel, working as a Pattern Maker's <b>Improver</b> where he invented the steel wheel spider-spokes. His father discouraged him from seeking a patent for this invention. For the following five years, he was in partnership with his maternal uncle (a Mr Warren), a builder, at Buntingford.|$|E

25|$|Since 1989 {{there have}} also been ethanol engines based on the diesel {{principle}} operating in Sweden. They are used primarily in city buses, but also in distribution trucks and waste collectors. The engines, made by Scania, have a modified compression ratio, and the fuel (known as ED95) used is a mix of 93.6% ethanol and 3.6% ignition <b>improver,</b> and 2.8% denaturants. The ignition <b>improver</b> makes it possible for the fuel to ignite in the diesel combustion cycle. It is then also possible to use the energy efficiency of the diesel principle with ethanol. These engines have been used in the United Kingdom by Reading Buses but the use of bioethanol fuel is now being phased out.|$|E
25|$|Digestive proteases {{are part}} of many laundry {{detergents}} and are also used extensively in the bread industry in bread <b>improver.</b> A variety of proteases are used medically both for their native function (e.g. controlling blood clotting) or for completely artificial functions (e.g. for the targeted degradation of pathogenic proteins). Highly specific proteases such as TEV protease and thrombin are commonly used to cleave fusion proteins and affinity tags in a controlled fashion.|$|E
25|$|ED95 designates a {{blend of}} 95% ethanol and 5% {{ignition}} improver; it is used in modified diesel engines where high compression is used to ignite the fuel, {{as opposed to the}} operation of gasoline engines, where spark plugs are used. This fuel was developed by Swedish ethanol producer SEKAB. Because of the high ignition temperatures of pure ethanol, the addition of ignition <b>improver</b> is necessary for successful diesel engine operation. A diesel engine running on ethanol also has a higher compression ratio and an adapted fuel system.|$|E

25|$|Digestate {{typically}} contains elements, such as lignin, that {{cannot be}} broken down by the anaerobic microorganisms. Also, the digestate may contain ammonia that is phytotoxic, and may hamper the growth of plants if it {{is used as a}} soil-improving material. For these two reasons, a maturation or composting stage may be employed after digestion. Lignin and other materials are available for degradation by aerobic microorganisms, such as fungi, helping reduce the overall volume of the material for transport. During this maturation, the ammonia will be oxidized into nitrates, improving the fertility of the material and making it more suitable as a soil <b>improver.</b> Large composting stages are typically used by dry anaerobic digestion technologies.|$|E
25|$|Amylases {{are used}} in {{breadmaking}} and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This {{is the reason for}} long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of malted barley) into bread <b>improver,</b> thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} article investigates {{the effect of}} polymeric flow <b>improvers</b> (FI) as pour point depressants (PPD) and rheological property <b>improvers</b> of waxy crude oil in Langhnaj, North Gujarat (India), since application of FI is a more economically viable option for crude oil transportation. Three new comb-shaped copolymers of maleic anhydride and n-alkyl oleate were synthesized by free radical solution polymerization, which were consequently reacted with hexadecyl amine to get poly (hexyl oleate-co-hexadecyl maleimide-co-n-alkyl oleate). Synthesized polymers were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). These FIs were further evaluated for their pour point depression property and rheology modifier with and without additive using Fann Viscometer.

2500|$|PFOA {{contaminated}} {{waste was}} incorporated into soil <b>improver</b> and spread on agricultural land in Germany, leading to PFOA drinking water contamination of up to 0.519 parts per billion. The German Federal Environmental Agency issued guidelines for the sum of PFOA and PFOS concentrations in drinking water: 0.1 parts per billion for precaution and 0.3 parts per billion for a threshold. Residents {{were found to have}} a 6–8 factor increase of PFOA serum levels over unexposed Germans, with average PFOA concentrations in the 22–27 parts per billion range.

2500|$|The name [...] "Burnt Fen" [...] is {{believed}} to originate from the practice of levelling the land, which {{has been carried out}} since the mid 17th century. Large tufts of rushes, which made the land surface rough, were cut and dried. Once dried, they could be burnt, and the ashes used as fertiliser. This practice, known as paring and burning, was used widely in the Fens, and was advocated by Walter Blith in his book The English <b>Improver</b> Improved, published in 1652. He suggested that it should be used on the lowest levels of fen land which had been 'long drowned', and recorded details of the practical application of the process to an area of [...] in the Bedford Level.|$|E

He married Margaret Leslie, 8th Countess of Rothes, daughter of the Duke of Rothes, and lived mainly on his wife's estate. His son, the 6th Earl, took up residence at Tyninghame following his marriage around 1700. He found the estate in poor condition, and set about renovating and replanting.

2500|$|As a fuel, {{methanol}} and ethanol {{both have}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} over fuels such as petrol (gasoline) and diesel fuel. In spark ignition engines, both alcohols can run {{at a much higher}} exhaust gas recirculation rates and with higher compression ratios. [...] Both alcohols have a high octane rating, with ethanol at 109 RON (Research Octane Number), 90 MON (Motor Octane Number), (which equates to 99.5 AKI) and methanol at 109 RON, 89 MON (which equates to 99 AKI). Note that AKI refers to 'Anti-Knock Index' which averages the RON and MON ratings (RON+MON)/2, and is used on U.S. gas station pumps. [...] Ordinary European petrol is typically 95 RON, 85 MON, equal to 90 AKI. [...] As a compression ignition engine fuel, both alcohols create very little particulates, but their low cetane number means that an ignition <b>improver</b> like glycol must be mixed into the fuel with approx. 5%.|$|E
2500|$|The American scholar Alistair Duckworth {{noted that}} a {{recurring}} theme in Austen’s novels is {{the condition of the}} estates mirror those of their owners, with the fine condition of Pemberley being a testament to Mr. Darcy’s good character for example. In this regard, Duckworth noted the subject of improving the landscape keeps coming up in Mansfield Park with the landscape <b>improver</b> Humphry Repton being mocked for his theories, and Henry Crawford being a keen enthusiast for improving the landscape. Duckworth argued Austen took the motif of landscaping {{as a symbol of the}} human condition from Edmund Burke’s 1790 book The Reflections of the Revolution in France, where the condition of the estate is often a metaphor for society. Burke made a distinction between beneficial [...] "improvements" [...] to society, writing [...] "A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation", and malign [...] "innovations" [...] and [...] "alterations" [...] to society, which were to be abhorred as they meant the destruction of all that had come before. Austen believed that estates, like society were in need of improvements from time to time, but the sort of changes advocated by Repton were [...] "innovations" [...] and [...] "alterations" [...] that would destroy the [...] "whole original fabric" [...] of the estate as she has Price say, just as the French Revolution was in Austen’s view an entirely destructive force that sought to wipe out all that had come before. Austen's sister-in-law was Eliza de Feullide, a French aristocrat whose first husband, the Comte de Feullide, had been guillotined in Paris and who fled to Britain, where she married Henry Austen in 1797. The account of the execution of the Comte de Feullide as related by her sister-in-law left Austen with an intense dread and horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life. The run-down condition of Sotherton Court exposes the danger of atrophy as Rushworth had neglected his estate, leading Price to complain [...] "There is nothing awful here, nothing melancholy, nothing grand" [...] as there should be. Later, when Henry Crawford suggests destroying the grounds of Thornton Lacy to create something new, his plans are rejected by Edmund Bertram who insists the estate needs some improvements here and there, but he wishes to preserve in the main what has been created over the centuries. In Austen’s world, the true mark of a man worth marrying is a man who keeps his estate well maintained with a respect for tradition, and so Bertram’s reformist conservatism marks him out as a hero.|$|E
