40|$|This paper econometrically {{examines}} the factors determining {{the real estate}} price dynamics in Chile in the period 1990 - 2007. For such purpose, we use annual data of 419 homes located in the Metropolitan Area and acquired in that period. The results indicate that variables such as age and size are statistically significant determinants in the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> prices; access to the subway stations tends to capitalize in a non-linear manner; and both household income and aggregate income are statistically and economically significant. The price decomposition reveals that between 69 % and 71 % of the housing price level is explained by determinants related to attributes of the property, while about 70 % of the observed growth in housing prices between 1990 and 2007 {{is the result of}} macro-financial determinants. During 2006 and 2007, the trend in prices is not significantly different from that predicted by the model. These results tend to be similar using alternative estimates by housing type and different sample sub-periods. ...|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{roles of}} {{the public and private sectors}} to achieve {{sustainable}} economic growth depend on the level and distribution of risk across agents. In this paper, we build on the framework of general equilibrium to incorporate the role of risk in the determination of relative prices. Where risk is abnormally distributed by level across agents in time and space, market prices will deviate from a Pareto-optimal allocation. Whether this justifies public sector intervention depends not just on the specification of the level and distribution of risk, but also on the transactions costs of correction. We provide some preliminary evidence on the role of risk as it relates to property rights and economic growth to support the notion of growth as dependent on property rights and economic flexibility. In turn, we find that property rights depend on the level of judicial independence and the underlying degree of confiscation and contract repudiation risk. Economic reform in developing and emerging market economies thus depends ultimately on establishing civil society institutions that provide a consistent framework for the allocation of property rights. Where risk is explicitly considered in the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights, market prices will be closer to a Pareto-equivalent allocation of resources. - 3 -The Role of Risk in the Choice of Optimal State-Market Relation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{contributes}} to {{the outline of the}} origin of property rights set forth by Professor Krier, by more fully analyzing the role of evolutionary biology in the development of property rights. This article focuses on the pre-political <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> ownership and the initial formation of concepts of property and ownership. Expanding on Krier’s analysis, this article considers the implications of this evolutionary foundation on our modern property regime, particularly given the growing chasm between the wealthy {{on one side and the}} poor and middle-class on the other. Part II discusses the growing disparity of wealth in America and our property system’s failure to respond to this inequity. While current debates among property scholars have attempted to address concerns of inequality, Part III discusses how scholars have inadequately analyzed the origin of the rights that accompany ownership. Part IV explores the evolution of property rights in nature. The property rights displayed by animals in the wild mirror many of our common law property rules, and Part V argues that our common law property system is based on the same unconscious evolutionary strategy that causes the deference to ownership that is displayed in animal behavior. Part VI discusses what this evolutionary foundation to our default property rules means for our modern property regime...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights institutions, using the creation of property rights in the radio spectrum in the United States from 1899 to 1934 {{as a case study}} that sheds light on both economic theories of institutional change and current policy debates over spectrum allocation. I first develop a theoretical framework for understanding the creation of property rights, recognizing that property rights can take on diverse forms that distribute the costs and benefits associated with resource use in different ways. This diversity is constrained by five economic factors—resource characteristics, technology, product markets, existing institutions, and ideologies. My historical case study provides compelling empirical support for theories developed by Douglas North and other “New Institutional” economists that stress the importance of existing institutions and ideologies in shaping property rights, placing these factors on an equal level with the first three, which have been the basis of neoclassical property rights theory. I argue that serious consideration of the roles played by existing institutions and ideologies in shaping property rights logically points to the need to redefine current theoretical assumptions about individual economic actors and to incorporate concepts of power into economic analysis. The historical component of my dissertation is based on research at six historical archives. I focus on the economic history of spectrum property rights in the United States before World War I, choosing this time period for two reasons. First, as my research shows, the activities of early commercial wireless firms of this period were crucial in shaping a unique system of spectrum property rights in the United States. Second, the importance of this period in shaping the structure and allocation of spectrum rights has gone largely unrecognized both in the existing radio history literature and in the economic literature on property rights in the spectrum. In the concluding chapter I argue that economic analyses of spectrum property rights must incorporate the distinctive enforcement issues associated with resource characteristics of the radio spectrum, and the public goods attributes of spectrum product markets. Such considerations are important in efforts to preserve and extend public and other non-profit rights not only to the spectrum but also in other areas of telecommunications. ...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{characteristics}} of modified wood are {{studied in the}} paper. Application of this approach during the study of wooden materials allows forecasting the efficiency of modifiers for surface layer of wood. Phosphites, the efficient fire-retarders, were applied as modifiers. Using {{the example of a}} number of ethers with various alkoxy substituents of phosphorus atom, we have made an attempt to associate surface thermodynamic <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> modified wood and <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> for fire-, bio- and smoke protection. The dependence of change of energy characteristics and surface structure of wood on the nature of modifiers is determined. To study energy {{characteristics of}} wood, modified by various compounds, the following characteristics were used: σ surface tension and ΔG free enthalpy gradient. Easy Drop setting and the corresponding software were used to determine these values. According to the obtained data, the conclusion is made about the influence of modifiers on energy characteristics of wood. The high degree of modification (% P) causes bigger change of Gibbs energy, which determines <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> high-level fire-, bio- and smoke protection.

30|$|However, {{despite the}} undoubted {{progress}} {{in the analysis of}} possible mechanisms responsible for the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> nanofilled elastomers, there are still ambiguities to be clarified. An increase in strength and the appearance <b>of</b> anisotropic <b>properties</b> after the first deformation {{can be attributed to the}} existence of micro and nanostrands in its structure. Their existence is confirmed by experimental studies (Marckmann et al., 2016; Reichert et al., 1993; Le Cam et al., 2004; Watabe et al., 2005; Beurrot et al., 2010; Marco et al., 2010). In (Matos et al., 2012), based on the results of experimental studies of the carbon-filled rubber structure (using electron microtomography) and computer simulation, it was shown that the macrodeformation of about 15 % can cause significant microdeformation of the matrix of 100 and more percent in the zones between the agglomerates of carbon black particles. Investigations of the nanostructure of filled rubbers in a stretched (up to pre-rupture) state by the atomic force microscopy methods (AFM) demonstrate the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a fibrous texture between filler particles (Morozov et al., 2012).

It has been noted that most modern technological focus is the development of nitride heterostructures on silicon substrates. The basic problems of nitride compounds on silicon substrate and the ways of their solution have been discussed. Some results of GaN/Si heterostructures technology development in “Elma-Malachit” JSC have been presented. The AlGaN/GaN/Si heterostructures have been grown by MOCVD. We show that early process stages such as Si-surface treatment and Al pre-deposition are of great importance for the growth of crack-free structures with good structural and surface quality. Meanwhile the surface curvature of the grown structures is influenced mainly by the composition of the multilayered transition region between the AlN nucleation layer and the GaN layer.
