500|$|The {{energy density}} per unit volume of both liquid {{hydrogen}} and compressed hydrogen gas at any practicable pressure is {{significantly less than}} that of traditional fuel sources, although the energy density per unit fuel mass is higher. Nevertheless, elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy, as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy-wide scale.

Hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly, with some NOx emissions, but without carbon emissions. However, the infrastructure costs associated with <b>full</b> <b>conversion</b> to a hydrogen economy would be substantial.
