The weather during the Wednesday run was far from suitable, with a strong easterly wind, rain and poor visibility. Ben-my-Chree crossed the mark in excess of , employing lookouts on various vantage points on board, she kept her speed {{for a period of}} approximately 3 hours. By this time the <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> on the Skull Martin Lightship could be clearly heard, but with visibility reported to be down to less than a mile, it was proving impossible to make the required visual reference to calibrate the speed. The prevailing conditions coupled to the high density of shipping traffic in the area forced an abandonment of the trial. Speed was reduced to , the Ben-my-Chree was swung about, and made passage back to Greenock. The inclement weather lasted into the following day, leading {{to the rest of the}} trials to be held on Friday.|$|E
500|$|The Flat Holm project aims {{to develop}} the island as a {{showcase}} of sustainable technologies. [...] The original power supply consisted of several diesel generators at different properties and unconnected to each other. In 2006, underground cables were installed to form a ‘mini-grid’ between the farmhouse, workshops and the <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> keeper's cottage. This was powered with a (13.5kW) inverter/charger system located at the farmhouse with the farmhouse diesel generator as back-up.|$|E

5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} was operated {{and maintained}} by the keepers whose responsibility included operation of fog signals found located on {{the northern and southern}} tips of the island. The prison guards facilitated the keepers to blow the <b>fog</b> <b>horns</b> as they were in advantageous position stationed on the elevated watch towers; the guards who were in position to see [...] "a bank of fog started to roll through the Golden Gate", would inform notify the keepers so that the <b>fog</b> <b>horns</b> could be activated.|$|R
500|$|The North {{lighthouse}} is [...] tall, slightly {{taller than}} the south one, and has a focal plane of [...] It produces a quick white flash every 15 seconds, and was originally lit by a [...] petroleum vapour burner. Oil was lifted up from a small quay using a sled and winch, and then transported using a small railway (again winch-powered). The remains {{of this can be}} still seen, but it was abandoned in 1971 and the lighthouse now uses a discharge bulb fed from the island's main supply. The northern light was modernised in 1991 and converted to solar power, since when the light has been mounted on top of the old <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> building rather than in the tower.|$|E
500|$|Until 1961 the {{lighthouse}} was administered as a shore station, and subsequently (after the resident population of Stroma had left) {{as a rock}} station. An electric lamp with a maximum power of 1.1 million cp was installed in 1972, utilising a sealed beam optic mounted on a gearless revolving pedestal. By this time the keepers and their families {{were the only people}} living on Stroma. A helicopter pad was installed to enable supplies and personnel to be flown in. In 1997 the station was converted to automatic operation, utilising a 250 watt metal halide lamp which rotates on a gearless pedestal. A lens system from Sule Skerry lighthouse was refitted in the Stroma lighthouse. The old air-driven <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> was removed and replaced by an electric fog signal which is installed on the balcony of {{the lighthouse}}.

2500|$|The North Carr Lightship was {{launched}} in 1932 and created quite a stir in Edinburgh on account of her <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> being tested while lying ¾ mile off Granton, Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth. As the <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> had a range of approximately 10 miles, north Edinburgh could hear it loud and clear and the complaints were numerous - particularly as it was being sounded in clear weather. [...] "Hundreds of city dwellers have had no sleep over three consecutive nights" [...] and [...] "The most flagrant individual breach of the peace is as nothing compared with the ceaseless boom and consequent suffering {{of the past three}} nights" [...] were typical statements at the time.|$|E

50|$|A notable {{feature of}} the Vertigo score is the ominous two-note falling motif that opens the suite — it is a direct musical {{imitation}} of the two notes sounded by the <b>fog</b> <b>horns</b> located at {{either side of the}} Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco (as heard from the San Francisco side of the bridge). This motif has direct relevance to the film, since the horns can be clearly heard sounding in just this manner at Fort Point, the spot where a key incident occurs involving the character played by Kim Novak.|$|R
50|$|The foghorn {{has seen}} many changes over the years. When the {{lighthouse}} was first built, a single horn of a clay and iron pipe design, facing straight out to sea, was provided. This was replaced in 1873 {{by a pair}} of twin horns to the same design, angled to spread the noise up and down the coast. In turn these were superseded by twin Rayleigh trumpets in the 1920s, with the foghorn house remodelled at the seaward corners to accommodate them, then in 1953 these gave way to the present diaphone <b>fog</b> <b>horns.</b>|$|R
50|$|In January 1904, {{the steamer}} Clallam and 50 of her {{passengers}} were lost {{en route to}} Victoria crossing the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Clallam carried no distress rockets, which in those days before radio, might have saved {{some or all of}} her people. Steamship inspectors cracked down and fined a large number of steamers, including Athlon, $500 and more for operating without <b>fog</b> <b>horns,</b> signal flares or rockets, fire axes or proper life-saving equipment. Some measure of the severity of the fine can be judged {{by the fact that it}} was almost exactly 10% of the cost of Athlon’s construction.|$|R

Hufford, and Elmer Hufford) were fined $10 for not having an endorsement for change of master for the vessel, $100 for no <b>fog</b> <b>horn,</b> and $100 for having a defective fire extinguisher on board. [...] The occasion for the fines was the then recent (July24, 1915) disaster in Chicago to the steamship Eastland, The possible remission of fines following compliance was not ruled out by the inspectors.|$|E
2500|$|Fog signal building: the {{original}} fog signal building {{was destroyed in}} a storm in 1935. [...] The building was replaced with a brick structure in 1937. [...] It was used to house steam boilers, clock timing apparatus, radio equipment, diesel generators, and equipment to operate 3 large diaphone horns until 1982. [...] The Coast Guard replaced the diaphone horns with an electronic <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> in 1983 that sounded from the light tower. [...] The Coast Guard stopped fog signals from Whitefish Point in 1995. [...] The GLSHS abandoned their 1996 plans to demolish the fog signal building and started restoration of {{the exterior of the}} building in 2002. [...] The GLSHS uses the fog signal building as a ground maintenance facility not open to the public.|$|E
50|$|Lightship no. 2B Sydostbrottet {{was placed}} in the area as a warning in 1896. In 1912, no. 6 Svenska Björn came as replacement. Both lightships was painted with Almagrundet in white letters on the sides. In 1964 a modern remote {{controlled}} concrete caisson lighthouse replaced the ships and it stands to this day. It was fitted with 72 powerful sealbeam lights, electric cable (connected to the Revengegrundet light), diesel generators, <b>fog</b> <b>horns,</b> helipad, racon, and floodlighting. There was also a kitchenette and two sleeping berths. The lighthouse was constructed in the area of Jävre-Sandholmen, near Piteå and then transported by ship to the location.|$|R
2500|$|Similar {{conditions}} {{were found on}} the same day on the Prosper, and to a lesser degree on the Alice Gertude and the , although they were referred for special boiler inspections. The inspections and fines assessed on these four vessels were just part of a campaign by the inspectors to enforce the regulations on all steam craft operating in Puget Sound. [...] By February 17, 1904, 16 more vessels, including some well-known ones, had been inspected, found deficient, and fined for similar reasons, and in addition failure to maintain adequate <b>fog</b> <b>horns</b> and not providing sufficient written instructions to passengers as to the location of life preservers.

40|$|Because humans cannot {{know one}} another’s minds directly, {{every form of}} {{communication}} is {{a solution to the}} same basic problem: how can privately held information be made publicly accessible through manipulations of the physical environment? Language is by far the best studied response to this challenge. But there are a diversity of non-linguistic strategies for representation with external signs as well, from facial expressions and <b>fog</b> <b>horns</b> to chronological graphs and architectural renderings. The general thesis of this dissertation is that there is an impressively wide spectrum of conventional systems of representation, corresponding to the many ways that the problem of communication can be solved, and that these systems can be described and explained using the tools of contemporary mathematical semantics. As a partial corrective to the countervailing norm, this work concentrates on the class of sys-tems arguably most different from language — those governing the interpretation of pictorial images. Such representations dominate practical communication: witness the proliferation of maps, road signs, newspaper photographs, scientific illustrations, television shows, engineering drawings, and even the fleeting imagery of manual gesture. I argue that systems of depiction and languages embody a parallel technologies of communication. Both are based on semantics: systematic and conventiona...|$|R
50|$|Power {{boats are}} {{typically}} Fast electric or internal combustion, (ignition engine or glow plug R/C engine based) {{and some are}} steam powered (conventional type, and also flash steam). (At one time some boats used engines working on the compression ignition principle. These were not diesels in the true {{sense of the word}} but the modelling fraternity frequently referred to them as such. A few enthusiasts still operate such engines.) The power is commonly used to rotate a submerged propeller, aircraft propeller or jet which in turn provide the thrust to move the craft. Typically power boats have two controls, rudder, outboard motor or stern drive and throttle control. Powered scale boats will often have additional remote-controlled functions to improve realism, e.g. sounding <b>fog</b> <b>horns,</b> rotating radar antennae etc. Some of the more sophisticated powered racing boats may also have additional remote-controlled functions. These may include remote mixture control allowing the driver to optimise the fuel/air mixture during a race. Another function occasionally implemented for racing boats using a surface piercing propellor is remote control of depth or angle of thrust. There are three main types of power boat. RTR(ready-to-run), ARTR(almost-ready-to-run), and kit versions are available. All thoroughbred racing boats are made from kits and the builders add their own gear and radio.|$|R

40|$|August 21, 1970 A few sound[s] are {{embedded}} in the fog – a gull mewing, different far off <b>fog</b> <b>horns</b> – like unset polished stones laid out in cotton wool. Tuesday, March 5, 1985 At six AM the heavy gray burns a heavier blue. Rain, water drops clinging to the balcony. There is an ethical consideration in James Schuyler's Diary. While we {{have spent the last}} fifty years grappling with the aesthetic problems of how to represent the unrepresentable, how to present the unpresentable, and how to signify the significant, little time has been spent considering the status of representations of the unremarkable. There is a whole history in American poetry and literature of validating the everyday, making it special, but Schuyler never really does that. Are things special just because we say so, or rather because we note them down? Do we name things into being, at least linguistic or literary being? The Diary asks these questions and in doing so it broaches the kind of postmodern ethical questions that one finds in the recent work of Lyotard, Derrida, and Nancy. These questions are significant not in the normal sense of the reasons for such interrogations or the answers expected, but rather because they represent a desire on the part of Schuyler to ask after otherness, to try to elicit a response from the other while respecting that such a response may not be comprehensible even if it is forthcoming. I would like here to posit a desire to ask after the other first before one asks after oneself, to enquire without any hope of a satisfactory answer as such as the postmodern ethical position, and to suggest that the autobiographical slant of Schuyler's work is, paradoxically considering the nature of autobiography, just such a positioning of his self in relation to the world...|$|R
