5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Cold War, the {{psychological}} {{impact of a}} battleship was significant. In 1946, USS Missouri was dispatched to deliver {{the remains of the}} ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the Balkan region. In September 1983, when Druze militia in Lebanon's Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS New Jersey stopped the firing. Gunfire from New Jersey later killed militia leaders.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words (Lieder ohne Worte), eight cycles each {{containing}} six lyric pieces (two published posthumously), remain {{his most}} famous solo piano compositions. They became standard parlour recital items <b>even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> composer's lifetime, and their overwhelming popularity has itself caused many critics to underrate their musical value. Other composers who were inspired to produce similar pieces of their own, included Charles-Valentin Alkan (his five sets of Chants, each ending with a barcarole), Anton Rubinstein, Ignaz Moscheles, and Edvard Grieg.|$|E

5|$|The {{restoration}} of Tōdai-ji's Nandaimon gate in 1930 saw improved standards for preservation. An architect supervised the reconstruction works on-site.

During the 1930s, about 70–75% of restoration costs came from the national budget, which increased <b>even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E

5|$|A Zoroastrian astrologer named Mulla Gushtasp {{predicted}} {{the fall of}} the Zand dynasty to the Qajar army in Kerman. Because of Gushtasp's forecast, the Zoroastrians of Kerman were spared by the conquering army of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. Despite the aforementioned favorable incident, the Zoroastrians during the Qajar dynasty remained in agony and their population continued to decline. <b>Even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> rule of Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the dynasty, many Zoroastrians were killed and some were taken as captives to Azerbaijan. Zoroastrians regard the Qajar period as one of their worst.|$|E

5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, <b>even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent <b>even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent {{as it did in the}} rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E
5|$|In theory, the emperor's {{political}} power was absolute, but <b>even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Han dynasty, he shared executive powers with civilian officials and normally based his {{decisions on the}} advice and formal consensus of his ministers. During the Song dynasty, a national examination system (Civil Service Exam) managed by scholar-bureaucrats was used to recruit officials; those who passed the palace examination – the highest-level examination in the empire – were appointed directly by the emperor to the highest central government positions. Like commoners, these senior officials had to obey his edicts as law or be punished. However, senior officials not only challenged the emperor over policy, but restrained him by invoking the ideal Confucian mores {{and values of the}} literati gentry class from which they came.|$|E

5|$|Megalosaurus was, in 1824, {{the first}} genus of non-avian dinosaur to be validly named. The type species is Megalosaurus bucklandii, named in 1827. In 1842, Megalosaurus {{was one of}} three genera on which Richard Owen based his Dinosauria. On Owen's {{directions}} a model was made as one of the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, which greatly increased the public interest for prehistoric reptiles. Subsequently, over fifty other species would be classified under the genus, originally because dinosaurs were not well known, but <b>even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 20th century after many dinosaurs had been discovered. Today it is understood these additional species were not directly related to M. bucklandii, which is the only true Megalosaurus species. Because a complete skeleton of it has never been found, much is still unclear about its build.|$|E
5|$|Rejtan's {{dramatic}} {{attempt to}} prevent the partition earned him lasting recognition in Poland, one that began <b>even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> proceedings, as he was lauded by some other deputies. His action was also praised as patriotic and respectable by the Prussian and Russian military commanders in Warsaw, who offered him a military escort {{to protect him from}} some confederates (particularly Poniński was holding a grudge against him). Soon, brochures and newspaper articles spread the information about his patriotic gesture throughout Poland and abroad. During the Great Sejm of 1788–92, a decree was passed, commending Rejtan, and deputies discussed a project to put a plaque to his name in the Sejm Chambers. His gesture in the Sejm was less famously repeated by Jan Suchorzewski during that period.|$|E

The two engage in several arguments and bicker about their plans throughout the trip, while enjoying each other's company nonetheless. Sahil is irked by Jai's indifferent behaviour and finds it annoying that he works <b>even</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> trip. Jai too is not pleased with Sahil's continuous badgering. One night, the two get into a heated argument over their differences. Later, Jai embraces Sahil in his bed and tries to kiss him. The latter resists, and asks Jai to go to sleep as they have to get up early the next morning.|$|E
