25|$|Reversible addition-fragmentation chain {{transfer}} or RAFT polymerization {{is one of}} several kinds of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization. It makes use of a {{chain transfer}} agent {{in the form of a}} thiocarbonylthio compound (or similar, from here on referred to as a RAFT agent, see Figure 1) to afford control over the generated molecular weight and polydispersity during a free-radical polymerization. Discovered at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) of Australia in 1998, RAFT polymerization {{is one of several}} living or controlled radical polymerization techniques, others being atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), etc. RAFT polymerization uses thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, thiocarbamates, and xanthates, to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. As with other controlled radical polymerization techniques, RAFT polymerizations can be performed with conditions to favor low <b>dispersity</b> (molecular weight distribution) and a pre-chosen molecular weight. RAFT polymerization can be used to design polymers of complex architectures, such as linear block copolymers, comb-like, star, brush polymers, dendrimers and cross-linked networks.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the domain spacing of an ordered structure formed by polydisperse ARB-type triblock copolymers (triBCPs) with random middle R blocks consisting of A and B monomers. ARB-type triBCPs were synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, and the <b>dispersities</b> of all samples were controlled as narrow as similar to 1. 2. From the bulk and film morphologies, {{it was found}} that the domain swelling increases as the content of middle R blocks increases, which implies that the middle R block even with a small content plays a critical role in dilating the domain spacing. Since the random middle R blocks are energetically neutral, they can be segregated into either A or B blocks. The strong stretching theory (SST) suggests that the <b>dispersities</b> of the resulting constituent blocks are maximized to reduce the elastic energy associated with chain stretching, thereby leading to the dilation of domain spacing...|$|R
40|$|The {{controlled}} {{radical polymerization}} of methacrylates via Cu(0) -mediated RDRP is challenging {{in comparison to}} acrylates with most reports illustrating higher <b>dispersities,</b> lower monomer conversions and poorer end group fidelity relative to the acrylic analogues. Herein, we present the successful synthesis of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in DMSO by judicious selection of optimal reaction conditions. The effect of the initiator, ligand and temperature on the rate {{and control of the}} polymerization is investigated and discussed. Under carefully optimized conditions enhanced control over the molecular weight distributions is obtained furnishing methacrylic polymers with <b>dispersities</b> as low as 1. 10, even at very high conversions. A range of methacrylates were found to be tolerant to the optimized polymerization conditions including hydrophobic, hydrophilic and functional methacrylates including methyl and benzyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate. The control retained during the polymerization is further highlighted by in situ chain extensions yielding well-defined block polymethacrylates. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{effects of}} reactor type on <b>dispersity</b> depend {{largely on the}} {{relative}} timescales associated with the reactor, and with the polymerization type. In conventional bulk free radical polymerization, the <b>dispersity</b> is often controlled by the proportion of chains that terminate via combination or disproportionation. The rate of reaction for free radical polymerization is exceedingly quick, due to the reactivity of the radical intermediates. When these radicals react in any reactor, their lifetimes, and as a result, the time needed for reaction are much shorter than any reactor residence time. For FRPs that have a constant monomer and initiator concentration, such that the DPn is constant, the <b>dispersity</b> of the resulting monomer is between 1.5 and 2.0. As a result, reactor type does not affect <b>dispersity</b> for free radical polymerization reactions in any noticeable amount as long as conversion is low.|$|E
50|$|Step growth {{polymerization}} is {{most affected}} by reactor type. To achieve any high molecular weight polymer, the fractional conversion must exceed 0.99, and the <b>dispersity</b> of this reaction mechanism in a batch or PFR is 2.0. Running a step-growth polymerization in a CSTR will allow some polymer chains out of the reactor before achieving high molecular weight, while others stay in the reactor {{for a long time}} and continue to react. The result is a much more broad molecular weight distribution, which leads to much larger dispersities. For a homogeneous CSTR, the <b>dispersity</b> is proportional to the square root of the Damköhler number, but for a heterogeneous CSTR, <b>dispersity</b> is proportional to the natural log of the Damköhler number. Thus, for the similar reasons as anionic polymerization, the <b>dispersity</b> for heterogeneous CSTRs lies between that of a batch and a homogeneous CSTR.|$|E

50|$|For anionic polymerization, a form {{of living}} polymerization, the {{reactive}} anion intermediates {{have the ability to}} remain reactive for a very long time. In batch reactors or PFRs, well-controlled anionic polymerization can result in almost uniform polymer. When introduced into a CSTR however, the residence time distribution for reactants in the CSTR affects the <b>dispersity</b> of the anionic polymer due to the anion lifetime. For a homogeneous CSTR, the residence time distribution is the most probable distribution. Since the anionic polymerization <b>dispersity</b> for a batch reactor or PFR is basically uniform, the molecular weight distribution takes on the distribution of the CSTR residence times, resulting in a <b>dispersity</b> of 2. Heterogeneous CSTRs are similar to homogeneous CSTRs, but the mixing within the reactor is not as good as in a homogeneous CSTR. As a result, there are small sections within the reactor that act as smaller batch reactors within the CSTR and end up with different concentrations of reactants. As a result, the <b>dispersity</b> of the reactor lies between that of a batch and that of a homogeneous CSTR.|$|E

Selected experimental conditions {{led to the}} production of PNSS with variable molecular weights and low <b>dispersities</b> (D{stroke}≤ 1. 50). The controlled synthesis of poly(neopentyl p-styrene sulfonate) (PNSS) using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerisation has been studied under a wide range of experimental conditions. PNSS can be used as an organic-soluble, thermally labile precursor for industrially valuable poly(p-styrene sulfonate), widely employed in technologies such as ionic exchange membranes and organic electronics. The suitability of two different chain transfer agents, three solvents, three different monomer concentrations and two different temperatures for the polymerisation of neopentyl p-styrene sulfonate is discussed in terms of the kinetics of the process and characteristics of the final polymer. Production of PNSS with systematically variable molecular weights and low <b>dispersities</b> (D{stroke} ≤ 1. 50 in all cases) has been achieved using 2 -azidoethyl 2 -(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio) - 2 -methylpropionate in anisole at 75 °C, with an initial monomer concentration of 4. 0 molL- 1.

50|$|Also {{known as}} living radical polymerization, {{controlled}} radical polymerization, reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) relies on completely pure reactions, preventing termination caused by impurities.
