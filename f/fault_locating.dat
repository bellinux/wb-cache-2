40|$|With the {{development}} of power systems in recent years, {{the total amount of}} power cables in operation has increased greatly, and there are growing reports of cable failure. Cable failures may be due to various intrinsic or extrinsic factors and can lead to massive economic loss. With regard to high-voltage cables, such as 110 kV power cables, there are very few accurate reports on the actual fault observed. This article first analyses the possible causes of power cable outer sheath failure. It then introduces the bridge and step voltage methods, which are traditionally used for cable <b>fault</b> <b>locating,</b> and describes a new method for accurate <b>fault</b> <b>locating</b> in 110 kV cables, which uses the bridge method to pre-locate the fault and then the step voltage method to accurately determine the precise <b>fault</b> <b>locating.</b> Field testing confirms the applicability of the new method for accurate <b>fault</b> <b>locating</b> in 110 kV power cables.

40|$|Fault {{attack is}} an {{efficient}} cryptanalysis method against cipher implementations and {{has attracted a}} lot of attention in recent public cryptographic literatures. In this work we introduce a fault attack on the CAESAR candidate ACORN v 2. Our attack is done under the assumption of random fault injection into an initial state of ACORN v 2 and contains two main steps: <b>fault</b> <b>locating</b> and equation solving. At the first step, we first present a fundamental <b>fault</b> <b>locating</b> method, which uses 99 -bit output keystream to determine the fault injected location with probability 97. 08 %. And then several improvements are provided, which can further increase the probability of <b>fault</b> <b>locating</b> to almost 1. As for the system of equations retrieved at the first step, we give two solving methods at the second step, that is, linearization and guess-and-determine. The time complexity of our attack is not larger than c· 2179. 19 - 1. 76 N at worst, where N is the number of fault injections such that 31 ≤N≤ 88 and c is the time complexity of solving linear equations.

40|$|This paper investigates fault {{location}} techniques in high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission networks utilizing voltage source converters (VSCs).

However, the fast operation of HVDC protection has made fault localization more challenging as limited measurement data can be extracted.

40|$|As Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) wins {{more and}} more popularity, there is {{increasing}} interest in using aspects to implement crosscutting concerns in object-oriented software. During software evolution, source code editing and testing are interleaved activities to assure code quality. When regression tests fail unexpectedly after a long session of editing, {{it may be difficult}} for programmers to find out the failure causes. Moreover, due to the extensive use of subtyping and dynamic dispatch in object-oriented programming language and the inherent semantic intricacies in aspectoriented features, the nontrivial combination of those likely nonlocal changes would also affect other parts of program accidentally and that may indicate potential faults in the updated version. In this paper, we propose a new <b>fault</b> <b>locating</b> technique for AspectJ programs. At the core of our approach is the source level atomic change representation, which captures precisely the semantic differences between two program versions. If a test fails unexpectedly, a subset of affecting changes is identified and programmers are allowed to select (and apply) suspected atomic changes to the original program, constructing compliable intermediate versions. Then programmers can re-execute the failed test against these intermediate program versions to locate the exact failureinducing reasons by iteratively select, apply and narrow down the set of affecting changes. We implement our prototype Flota, a <b>fault</b> <b>locating</b> tool for AspectJ programs built on top Celadon 1. Our empirical study shows that Flota can help programmers effectively find a small set of failure-inducing changes and provide valuable debugging support for AspectJ programs...|$|E
