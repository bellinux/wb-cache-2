40|$|International audienceThe Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) {{crisis of}} the last two decades has shown that proper {{interaction}} of risk assessment, risk management and risk communication is essential. Mathematical models and risk assessments have been used as a basis for BSE risk management options and much of the legislation regarding the control and <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Much uncertainty regarding important input parameters remains a major constraint in risk assessment. Uncertainty {{is one of the most}} critical and most difficult aspects of communication of risks about Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs). Nevertheless, the decline in the BSE epidemic in the UK and most European countries demonstrates that management has been, for the most part, successful. Literature pertaining to the three inter-related facets of risk analysis: risk assessment, risk management and risk communication of TSEs of animal origin was reviewed and used to describe the state-of-the-art of risk analysis for TSEs...|$|E
40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) {{encompass}} subacute neurological degenerative diseases {{for which}} the prototypes are scrapie in sheep and some forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in man. The {{emergence of a new}} form of TSE in cattle in United Kingdom (UK) since 1986, namely bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), sharply increased the interest for these diseases, especially because of the epidemic nature of BSE in UK, its subsequent spread in continental Europe and the later discovery of its zoonotic character. The number of measures of veterinary public health taken to control the disease and to prevent its spread to animals and human beings increased in time and culminated by the total feed ban. Indeed, since the beginning of 2001, feed containing proteins of animal origin is prohibited for the feeding of production animals, including ruminants and monogastric species. The effect of this total ban of mammalian meat and bone meal needs to be evaluated. The incidence of BSE has a trend to decrease in UK and in most of the other European member states. However, as BSE is a rare event distributed in a large bovine population, it is difficult to state unambiguously whether this trend is significant. Furthermore, the evaluation of this measure will be only effective at least five years after its introduction, since this period is the mean incubation time of BSE. The main concern is currently the <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> in the infected countries. Additionally, the control of scrapie is also carried out due to the possible contamination of sheep with the BSE agent. These actions must take into account several new facts: the recent discovery of BSE cases in countries with a low geographical BSE risk level as Japan, Canada and the United States of America (USA); the growing incidence of chronic wasting disease, a spongiform encephalopathy observed in deer in USA; the characterization of a new pattern of bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy in Italy, atypical scrapie cases in sheep and atypical BSE cases in cattle in Europe and the efficacy of sheep selection based on scrapie resistant genotypes...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} the study was to {{determine}} the relationship of breast cancer prevention attitudes, level of body satisfaction, family history of breast cancer, and prior education about breast self-examination (BSE) to the performance <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> by undergraduate college females. The participants in the study were 356 female college students enrolled in HSC 160, Fundamentals of Human Health, at Ball State University during the spring semester of 2001. Using a cross-sectional data collection process, participants completed a survey instrument measuring the variables of the study. The data were analyzed using both univariate and bivariate statistics. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used to determine 1) the relationship between the level <b>of</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> among college females and their breast cancer prevention attitudes, 2) the relationship between college females' body dissatisfaction and their level <b>of</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>BSE,</b> 3) the association between the level <b>of</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and family history of breast cancer, and 4) the association between the performance <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and prior education concerning BSE. The results indicated that there was a significant association between the performance <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and having prior knowledge concerning BSE, and with having a positive or negative breast cancer prevention attitude.

40|$|Introduction: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer among women worldwide, and it can be {{detected}} at an early stage through self-examination which increases the chance of survival. This study aimed to assess knowledge and practice <b>of</b> breast self-examination (<b>BSE)</b> among females in a rural area of Trichy district. Methodology: This community-based, cross-sectional study was carried out among a total sample of 200 women in rural area of Trichy. The participants were interviewed using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to obtain information on their sociodemographic characteristics, awareness on breast cancer, and knowledge, attitude, practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Data were entered into MS Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 20. 0. Spearman correlation and Chi-square test were used to analyze the association between the variables. Results: The mean age of the study group was 36. 9 ± 8. 8 years. Eighty percent were literates. Most of the women 178 (89 %) were aware of breast cancer. Only 26 % of the women were aware <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Only 18 % of the females had ever checked their breast and 5 % practiced it regularly. Awareness <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> was found to be significantly associated with age and educational attainment. Conclusion: The level of knowledge and practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> among females are unacceptably low. Efforts should be made to increase level of knowledge and practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> through health education programs...|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} the Health Belief Model (HBM) to examine attitudes about breast health among {{women who had}} participated in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. More specifically, {{the purpose of this study}} was to {{identify}} the relationship between the HBM variables and the frequency <b>of</b> breast self-examination (<b>BSE).</b> A convenience sample of 80 women completed Champion’s (1993) HBM questionnaire. It was hypothesized that the HBM concepts would significantly correlate with the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> However, only two significant correlations were found: a positive correlation between the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and perceived benefits (r=. 37; p=. 000) and a negative correlation between the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and perceived barriers (r=-. 41; p=. 000). Therefore, this hypothesis was not supported. A second hypothesis addressed was whether the HBM concepts could differentiate between groups <b>of</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Using an analysis of variance, a significant difference was found between the HBM concept of barriers and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Women who perceived significant barriers to BSE performance were less likely to perform this procedure on a routine basis. These results indicate that there are women who are still not performing monthly BSE even though they have been deemed high risk for developing breast cancer. It is important for nurses to continue to identify the factors that hinder women from conducting monthly BSE and develop interventions to encourage this lifesaving procedure...|$|R

40|$|Background/Objectives: Screening {{for early}} {{detection}} and diagnosis of diseases and health conditions is an important public health principle. Breast Self Examination (BSE) is a process whereby women examine their breasts regularly to detect any abnormal swelling or lumps in order to seek prompt medical attention. The main aim {{of the study was}} to determine the level of knowledge and practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> among female secondary school teachers in the study area. Method: This descriptive cross sectional study to examine the knowledge, attitude and practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> among secondary school female teachers in Ilorin was carried out between June and September 2004 using a structured questionnaire designed by the researchers. Results: It was found out that most (95. 6 %) respondents were aware <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> The electronic media were the major sources of information while the health workers were the least. The attitude of teachers to health information on BSE was positive, with a fairly high degree of acceptability of the idea. Despite the positive attitude to BSE, its practice was low (54. 8 %). Conclusion: Awareness <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> was high but the practice was low. It is recommended that public awareness on the importance <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> be intensified using the mass media and that health workers should promote BSE during their contacts with female patients / clients...|$|R
