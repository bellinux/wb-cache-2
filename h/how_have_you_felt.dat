[2005]) {{was used}} to assess four {{dimensions}} of somatic symptoms: gastrointestinal problems (4 items; e.g. <b>How</b> often <b>have</b> <b>you</b> suffered from an upset stomach (indigestion)?), headaches (3 items; <b>How</b> often <b>have</b> <b>you</b> experienced headaches?), sleep disturbances (4 items; [...] "How often <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> difficulty getting to sleep at night?"), and respiratory illness (3 items; e.g. When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a bad cold or flu, how often does it last longer than it should?). Second, the 10 -item Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al. [1983]) {{was used to}} assess perception of stress (e.g. In the last month, <b>how</b> often <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> nervous and [...] "stressed"?). Third, coping was measured via the 16 -item Functional Dimensions of Coping Scale (Ferguson & Cox [1997]) which assesses four dimensions of coping; approach, avoidance, reappraisal, and emotional regulation. Fourth, the 25 -item Psychological Resilience Scale (Wagnild & Young [1993]) {{was used to assess}} resilience via the capacity to withstand stress and create meaning from challenges. Psychometrically there is evidence of a two factor structure to the scales, comprising Personal Competence (self-reliance, independence, determination, invincibility, mastery, resourcefulness and perseverance) and Acceptance of Self and Life (adaptability, balance, flexibility and a balanced perspective on life) (Portzky et al. [2010]; Wagnild & Young [1993]). For {{the purpose of this study}} we computed the two subscales of Personal Competence and Acceptance of Self and Life.

40|$|Self-reported {{tiredness}} and low energy, {{often called}} fatigue, {{are associated with}} poorer physical and mental health. Twin {{studies have indicated that}} this has a heritability between 6 and 50 %. In the UK Biobank sample (N= 108 [*] 976), we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of responses to the question, ‘Over the last two weeks, <b>how</b> often <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> tired or <b>had</b> little energy?’ Univariate GCTA-GREML found that the proportion of variance explained by all common single-nucleotide polymorphisms for this tiredness question was 8. 4 % (s. e. = 0. 6 %). GWAS identified one genome-wide significant hit (Affymetrix id 1 : 64178756 _C_T; P= 1. 36 × 10 − 11). Linkage disequilibrium score regression and polygenic profile score analyses were used to test for shared genetic aetiology between tiredness and up to 29 physical and mental health traits from GWAS consortia. Significant genetic correlations were identified between tiredness and body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, forced expiratory volume, grip strength, HbA 1 c, longevity, obesity, self-rated health, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, waist–hip ratio, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, neuroticism, schizophrenia and verbal-numerical reasoning (absolute rg effect sizes between 0. 02 and 0. 78). Significant associations were identified between tiredness phenotypic scores and polygenic profile scores for BMI, HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, coronary artery disease, C-reactive protein, HbA 1 c, height, obesity, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, waist–hip ratio, childhood cognitive ability, neuroticism, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia (standardised β’s had absolute values< 0. 03).

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the past}} 50 years, the average sleep {{duration}} for {{adults in the}} United States has decreased while the prevalence of obesity and associated outcomes has increased. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether perceived insufficient sleep was associated with body mass index (BMI) in a national sample. Methods We analyzed data from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey (N = 384, 541) in which respondents were asked, "During the past 30 days, for about <b>how</b> many days <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> <b>you</b> did not get enough rest or sleep?" We divided respondents into six BMI categories and used multivariable linear regression and logistic regression analyses to assess the association between BMI categories and days of insufficient sleep after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, smoking, physical activity, and frequent mental distress. Results Adjusted mean days of insufficient sleep ranged from 7. 9 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 7. 8, 8. 0) days for people of normal weight to 10. 5 (95 % CI: 10. 2, 10. 9) days for those in the highest weight category (BMI ≥ 40). Days of perceived insufficient sleep followed a linear trend across BMI categories. The likelihood of reporting ≥ 14 days of insufficient sleep in the previous 30 days was higher for respondents in the highest weight category than for those who were normal weight (34. 9 % vs. 25. 2 %; adjusted odds ratio = 1. 7 (95 % CI: 1. 5, 1. 8]). Conclusion Among U. S. adults, days of insufficient rest or sleep strongly correlated with BMI. Sleep sufficiency should be an important consideration in the assessment of the health of overweight and obese people and should be considered by developers of weight-reduction programs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mood {{disorders}} {{are a major}} public health problem in the United States as well as globally. Less information exists however, about the health burden resulting from subsyndromal levels of depressive symptomatology, such as feeling sad, blue or depressed, among the general U. S. population. Methods As part of an optional Quality of Life survey module added to the U. S. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, between 1995 – 2000 a total of 166, 564 BRFSS respondents answered the question, "During the past 30 days, for about <b>how</b> many days <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> sad, blue, or depressed?" Means and 95 % confidence intervals for sad, blue, depressed days (SBDD) and other health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures were calculated using SUDAAN {{to account for the}} BRFSS's complex sample survey design. Results Respondents reported a mean of 3. 0 (95 % CI = 2. 9 – 3. 1) SBDD in the previous 30 days. Women (M = 3. 5, 95 % CI = 3. 4 – 3. 6) reported a higher number of SBDD than did men (M = 2. 4, 95 % CI = 2. 2 – 2. 5). Young adults aged 18 – 24 years reported the highest number of SBDD, whereas older adults aged 60 – 84 reported the fewest number. The gap in mean SBDD between men and women decreased with increasing age. SBDD was associated with an increased prevalence of behaviors risky to health, extremes of body mass index, less access to health care, and worse self-rated health status. Mean SBDD increased with progressively higher levels of physically unhealthy days, mentally unhealthy days, unhealthy days, activity limitation days, anxiety days, pain days, and sleepless days. Conclusion Use of this measure of sad, blue or depressed days along with other valid mental health measures and community indicators can help to assess the burden of mental distress among the U. S. population, identify subgroups with unmet mental health needs, inform the development of targeted interventions, and monitor changes in population levels of mental distress over time. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} alcohol {{disorders in}} the general Canadian population, using as a standard indicator the CAGE questionnaire (<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> <b>you</b> needed {{to cut down on}} your drinking? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> annoyed by criticism of your drinking? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> guilty about drinking? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> <b>you</b> needed a drink {{first thing in the morning}} [eye-opener]?). DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from Canada's Alcohol and Other Drugs Survey (CADS), a national telephone survey conducted in 1994 of a representative sample of 12, 155 people aged 15 years or more. PARTICIPANTS: The CAGE questionnaire was administered to 5894 drinkers who had consumed alcohol in the 12 months before the CADS survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respondents with positive (2 or more affirmative responses) and negative results on the CAGE questionnaire were compared as to demographic characteristics, alcohol consumption and harmful consequences of their drinking. Independent predictors of a positive result were identified by means of logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 5. 8 % of CAGE-tested current drinkers had a positive result on the past-year CAGE in 1994. The proportion of respondents reporting alcohol-related problems in one or more areas of their life was 7 times greater among drinkers with a positive result on the CAGE questionnaire than among those with a negative result (66. 8 % v. 9. 5 %) (p < 0. 0001). When all demographic characteristics were controlled for simultaneously, male sex, residence in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec or the Prairies, single/never married or divorced/separated marital status, and low education level were found to be independent risk factors for a positive result on the CAGE questionnaire. About 85 % of the respondents with a positive result had not sought help for their drinking. Applying the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the CAGE questionnaire in detecting alcohol dependence, as per criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, in a general US population, the authors estimated that 4. 1 % of Canadians had an alcohol dependence in 1994. CONCLUSION: The large proportion of current drinkers with a positive result on the CAGE questionnaire who did not seek help for their drinking underscores the need for identification and brief interventions by physicians. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying reasons for regional differences in CAGE status...|$|R
