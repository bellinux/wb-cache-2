5|$|Ambulances are {{provided}} by the Yorkshire Ambulance Service, which itself is an NHS trust. Fire services in Sheffield {{are provided}} by South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service. For the purposes of <b>fire-fighting</b> and rescue, Sheffield is divided into East and West sub-divisions.|$|E
5|$|Inadequate {{and poorly}} {{maintained}} <b>fire-fighting</b> and rescue systems {{both on the}} vessel and on the jetty: Gulf and Total were held jointly to blame for this. A combination of human failings and financial constraints was the immediate cause.|$|E
5|$|A {{voluntary}} {{fire service}} operates on the island. Herm Fire Brigade operates a tractor-hauled fire tender with a hose-reel, a pump, a 2,000-litre water tank, and basic <b>fire-fighting</b> equipment which they use {{while waiting for}} assistance from the Guernsey Fire Brigade, who also provide the Herm volunteers with training and support.|$|E
5|$|Police, who {{normally}} {{are not known}} to carry fire extinguishers on duty, appeared to have used almost 25 pieces of <b>fire-fighting</b> equipment on hand {{on the day of}} the self-immolations. The nearest building is 10 minutes away and footage shows that only two police vehicles were at the scene. The flames were put out in less than a minute's time.|$|E
5|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a New Deal relief {{agency for}} young men, {{played a major}} role between 1933 and 1942 in {{developing}} Yellowstone facilities. CCC projects included reforestation, campground development of many of the park's trails and campgrounds, trail construction, fire hazard reduction, and <b>fire-fighting</b> work. The CCC built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads.|$|E
5|$|The TSB made nine {{recommendations}} {{relating to}} changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection, and maintenance), electrical systems, and flight data capture, as both flight recorders had stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact. General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and <b>fire-fighting</b> equipment and training. These recommendations have led to widespread changes in FAA standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} raised $40,000 in 2000 {{for emergency}} repairs, and {{was awarded a}} $230,000 grant by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for restoration work, including roof repair, but {{had not been able}} to raise the matching funds required to receive the grant. On December 6, 2001, a fire and subsequent <b>fire-fighting</b> efforts severely damaged the roof, ceiling, mural paintings and decorative plasterwork.|$|E
5|$|Jerome had a {{post office}} by 1883. It added a schoolhouse in 1884 and a public library in 1889. After four major fires between 1894 and 1898 {{destroyed}} much of the business district {{and half of the}} community's homes, Jerome was incorporated as a town in 1899. Incorporation made it possible to collect taxes to build a formal <b>fire-fighting</b> system and to establish building codes that prohibited tents and other fire hazards within the town limits. Local merchant and rancher William Munds was the first mayor.|$|E
5|$|London possessed {{advanced}} <b>fire-fighting</b> {{technology in}} the form of fire engines, which had been used in earlier large-scale fires. However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds. They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but no delivery hoses.|$|E
5|$|Monday {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the <b>fire-fighting,</b> but he had apparently left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events. In this state of emergency, Charles again overrode the City authorities and put his brother James, Duke of York in charge of operations.|$|E
5|$|Policing is {{provided}} by the Lincolnshire Police, and <b>fire-fighting</b> by the Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service. The police station is on Boston Road, although older premises on Kesteven Street were erected in 1845 and reconstructed in 1912. The fire station is on Church Lane although plans to move it to East Road by 2016 were approved in 2014. East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) operates from Kesteven Street. The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust provides services at three hospitals, Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Grantham and District Hospital, and Lincoln County Hospital, all of which have 24-hour accident and emergency departments as of January 2015.|$|E
5|$|Selfe {{came from}} a long line of inventors and engineers. Both sides of his family came from Kingston upon Thames in London, where one {{grandfather}} had owned a plumbing and engineering works. His father Henry was a plumber and inventor, whose high-pressure <b>fire-fighting</b> hose was displayed at The Great Exhibition in London's Crystal Palace in 1851. Selfe's cousin Edward Muggeridge grew up in the same town but moved to the United States in 1855, restyled himself Eadweard Muybridge, and achieved global fame as a pioneer in the new field of photography.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{spell of}} hot and dry weather through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane. Fanned by a strong easterly wind and fed by {{stockpiles}} of wood and fuel that had been prepared for the coming colder months, the fire eventually consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. Charles and his brother James joined and directed the <b>fire-fighting</b> effort. The public blamed Catholic conspirators for the fire, and one Frenchman, Robert Hubert, was hanged {{on the basis of a}} false confession even though he had no hand in starting the fire.|$|E
5|$|All {{the crew}} {{on board the}} ship {{at the time of}} the {{incident}} (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the bodies were found. In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer's wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by a lack of organization and poorly maintained <b>fire-fighting</b> equipment at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to take them onto the island. The terminal's own fire engine would not start. Firefighters had to break into the terminal's main depot to access materials and equipment (much of which did not work).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fire}} is quickly brought under control, Prescott is {{completely}} cut off. News of the events in Spoke City soon arrives on Tracy Island. Jeff dispatches Scott in Thunderbird 1, while Virgil and Alan take off in Thunderbird 2 equipped with newly commissioned <b>fire-fighting</b> apparatus. Lowered into the shaft in a protective cage fitted with diacetylene sprinklers, Virgil and Alan clamp the stricken lift and return to ground level, whereupon Prescott is arrested. Police Commissioner Garfield notes that classified documentation regarding criminal organisations, including the Erdman Gang, has been destroyed in the fire. Prescott's claims about the hitch-hiker are validated when the charred remnants of the bracelet are discovered.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a hostile}} ship is in range, the player {{will have the}} choice to either open fire or outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to {{withstand}} 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the fires are not contained quickly enough or if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order <b>fire-fighting</b> crews to contain the blaze, although it will cause the ship to disengage from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to change speed from slow to fast at any time.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{explored}} what {{he could}} of the western workings, before he {{and some of the}} survivors began tackling the fire. The water pipes from the surface in the Lancaster shaft were all fractured, and hand-extinguishers were used. Shaw returned to the surface at 9:30am to arrange for rescue and <b>fire-fighting</b> teams from neighbouring collieries. From 11:00am the specialist mines rescue teams began arriving at the colliery from the Rhymney and Rhondda Valleys, as did Red Cross workers and local ambulance services; a police detachment was sent from Cardiff in a special train. Members of the Inspectorate of Mines were quickly on the scene, and an inspector descended to view the mine the same morning.|$|E
5|$|The type was {{withdrawn}} from service in 1946; as of June that year the RAAF had 235 Vengeances on hand, but only required two. The aircraft were disposed of {{over the next}} six years, most being sold for scrap. Twelve Vengeance airframes were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy between 1948 and 1951 to be used for ground handling and <b>fire-fighting</b> training. Only a single complete RAAF Vengeance, the former A27-99, was preserved. As of 1986 this aircraft was on display at the Camden Museum of Aviation in the outskirts of Sydney. At this time, most parts of the airframe of the former A27-247 were also held by the Aviation Heritage Museum in Perth.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, <b>fire-fighting</b> continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During {{the course of the}} day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the <b>fire-fighting</b> was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E
25|$|Beriev {{developed}} unique <b>fire-fighting</b> {{equipment for}} the Be-200, allowing it to scoop water while skimming the water surface at 90-95% of takeoff speed. This system was developed using a specially modified Be-12P, coded '12 Yellow'. After installation of the <b>fire-fighting</b> system, the aircraft was registered RA-00046 and given the designation Be-12P-200. This modified Be-12 was used to develop both the <b>fire-fighting</b> system and methods of operation.|$|E
25|$|LA-8FF: <b>Fire-fighting</b> variant.|$|E
25|$|SCDF has a {{fleet of}} {{operational}} fire engines or Pump-Ladder deployed at every Fire Station. These vehicles are equipped with rescue equipment and <b>fire-fighting</b> accessories. The fire engine has a water tank that can store 2,400 litres of water used for <b>fire-fighting</b> operations and 1,200 litres of foam tank.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} emission sources are carpet and textile protection {{as well as}} <b>fire-fighting</b> foams.|$|E
25|$|Fire services, {{including}} {{rescue and}} <b>fire-fighting</b> {{services provided by}} the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Amongst {{the freight}} stock still in {{service is a}} bogie flat wagon {{converted}} into a <b>fire-fighting</b> wagon.|$|E
25|$|Many retired Trackers {{were sold}} to private owners for <b>fire-fighting</b> duties. Some were rebuilt and re-engined with {{turboprop}} engines.|$|E
25|$|The company {{manufactures}} and installs doors made to British <b>fire-fighting</b> {{standards and}} can resist fire {{for up to}} 120 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The airport has a 24-hour airport {{rescue and}} <b>fire-fighting</b> (ARFF) {{department}} (Index C), along with operations, facilities, engineering, security, and administrative personnel.|$|E
25|$|On May 17, 1890 the President of the league, Oscar Martínez Conill, {{was killed}} in a fire while serving in a {{volunteer}} <b>fire-fighting</b> brigade.|$|E
25|$|Outside London, new local {{government}} bodies created by late 19th century legislation (such as the Local Government Act 1894 took over responsibility for <b>fire-fighting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fire {{extinguishers}} {{are sometimes}} {{a target of}} vandalism in schools and other open spaces. Extinguishers are occasionally partially, or fully discharged by a vandal, impairing the extinguisher's actual <b>fire-fighting</b> abilities.|$|E
25|$|The Rotax 185 was {{designed}} as a <b>fire-fighting</b> pump, but the rights to the design were sold by Rotax to the Wildfire Group who use the engine in their Mark 3 High Pressure Centrifugal Fire Pump.|$|E
25|$|The Conair Firecat is a <b>fire-fighting</b> {{aircraft}} {{developed in}} Canada in the 1970s by modifying military surplus Grumman S-2 Trackers. The modifications {{were developed by}} the maintenance arm of the Conair Group, which became a separate company called Cascade Aerospace.|$|E
25|$|The DCT is {{deployed}} for {{all major}} incidents {{to support the}} <b>fire-fighting</b> crews with ventilation and water extraction operations. In the DCT are advanced equipment that can expediently blow or extract smoke from smoke-logged areas, or remove water from flooded areas.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{remaining}} {{years of the}} decade, elements of the 11th Marines participated in Operation Sea Angel in Bangladesh and in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. The regiment also assisted in <b>fire-fighting</b> efforts in the western United States {{during the summer of}} 1994.|$|E
