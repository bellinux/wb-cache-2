Camera systems show a wide view but on a small display and tend to be panoramically distorted. An augmented vision system, known as the transparent cockpit, uses retrore ective projection technology to let drivers virtually see through the car interior, but has not been designed as an aid for driving. Based on the transparent cockpit, the proposed system in this thesis combines the directly-observed view with a camera image of the rear blind zone, thereby expands the rearward view that drivers see when they physically look back. The nal design is a compact, attachable device that can be secured {{onto the back of}} the driver seat. Evaluation of the system involving reverse driving tasks shows ThroughView to be e ective as a visual aid in backing maneuvres and is intuitive to use...|$|E

The device is simple and inexpensive and provides data on soil freezing at least as accurate as direct observation by digging through frozen soil. Recent research reports about frost penetration in forest soils have relied on some admittedly unsatisfactory measurement techniques. Patric (I 967) used direct observation: holes dug through frozen to unfrozen soil, a method recognized as accurate but laborious and destructive to the sampl-ing site. Sartz (1967) tested three indirect measurement methods: elec-trical resistance blocks, a penetrometer, {{and a stack of}} buried water bottles.

40|$|Of {{interest}} to designers of future combat vehicles {{is the effect}} of <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> upon vehicle driving, and in particular the effect of the camera lens field of view (FOV). In a field study, driving performance was measured <b>for</b> natural and <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> with eight participants negotiating a road course in a military vehicle. The <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system was driven with fixed panoramic flat panel, liquid crystal displays in the cab and a forward viewing monocular camera array mounted on the front roof of the vehicle and tilted slightly downward.

40|$|The {{angiotensin}} {{sensitivity test}} (AST) {{was performed in}} a group of 40 high risk pregnant women before and after oral administration of low doses of aspirin (ASA) (100 mg).

After ASA administration there was a significant increase in EPD in AST+ patients (15. 00 ± 9. 54 ng/Kg/min, p< 0. 001). In AST- patients the mean EPD was significantly but non-homogeneously changed (18. 33 ± 8. 11 ng/Kg/min). Nineteen pregnant high risk patients also underwent AST between weeks 24 and 39 of gestation.

40|$|Accurate Stroke Volume (SV) {{monitoring}} {{is essential}} for patient with cardiovascular dysfunction patients. However, direct SV measurements are not clinically feasible due to the highly invasive nature of measurement <b>devices.</b> Current <b>devices</b> <b>for</b> <b>indirect</b> monitoring of SV are shown to be inaccurate during sudden hemodynamic changes. This paper presents a novel SV estimation using readily available aortic pressure measurements and aortic cross sectional area, using data from a porcine experiment where medical interventions such as fluid replacement, dobutamine infusions, and recruitment maneuvers induced SV changes in a pig with circulatory shock. Measurement of left ventricular volume, proximal aortic pressure, and descending aortic pressure waveforms were made simultaneously during the experiment. From measured data, proximal aortic pressure was separated into reservoir and excess pressures. Beat-to-beat aortic characteristic impedance values were calculated using both aortic pressure measurements and {{an estimate of the}} aortic cross sectional area. SV was estimated using the calculated aortic characteristic impedance and excess component of the proximal aorta. The median difference between directly measured SV and estimated SV was - 1. 4 ml with 95 % limit of agreement +/- 6. 6 ml. This method demonstrates that SV can be accurately captured beat-to-beat during sudden changes in hemodynamic state. This novel SV estimation could enable improved cardiac and circulatory treatment in the critical care environment by titrating treatment to the effect on SV...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{slurries}} contain useful {{amounts of}} plant nutrients. However, {{the quantity of}} these nutrients available in a particular slurry {{is not easy to}} quantify without laboratory facilities. Thus, when these slu-rries are applied to land, their fertilizer potential is often unknown. This has both agronomic and environ-mental implications. In order to achieve the goal of making better agronomic use of slurry and reducing pollution risks, con-venient methods and means are necessary to (1) quantify the nutrients in slurry and (2) spread them effi-ciently and accurately in accordance with codes of good agricultural practice. For these reasons, a <b>device</b> <b>for</b> <b>indirect</b> measurement of nutrient content of slurry has been developed. The prototype sensor that was developed has been tested on manure samples collected from farms with different livestock typologies. A comparison between measurements obtained with the sensor and with standard laboratory analyses has been carried out. The device is able to process the electrical signal of a probe inserted in the slurry in order to show indi-rectly the nutrient content of the manure. The results of tests carried out have shown the significance of the correlation between the nutrient content of slurry and its electrical properties measured by the device. Thus, the device developed seems to be a valid support for a better agronomic use of slurry by giving to farmers low cost and direct indications of nutrient content of the slurry...|$|R

This can be accomplished {{through the use of}} a conventional mirror-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system or by a camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the design factors surrounding the use of camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> systems, quantify the possible fuel savings which may be achieved through the use of such systems and to identify and quantify any secondary effects related to their use. The design factors were separated into human design considerations and equipment design considerations. The two categories of design factors were evaluated through a literature review of past similar studies as well as other pertinent journal articles and texts. The possible fuel savings which may be realized {{through the use of a}} camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system were quantified by performing full-scale component testing in a 2 m by 3 m wind tunnel. The results of the component testing were compared to previously performed full-scale vehicle testing in order to determine the overall reduction in the vehicle drag coefficient expected through the use of a camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system and, in turn, the possible fuel savings.

Full scale aerodynamic testing was performed in a 2 m by 3 m wind tunnel on a system component basis to quantify the possible fuel savings associated with the removal of the side mirrors. The mirrors on a Volvo VN 780 tractor were removed and replaced with a prototype camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system consisting of four cameras mounted in the front fender location; two cameras {{on either side of the}} vehicle. Four monitors mounted in the vehicle - two mounted on the right A-pillar and two mounted on the left A-pillar - provided <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> information to the vehicle operator. Four commercial drivers were asked to perform a series of tests simulating typical driving scenarios on a closed course test track. The tests included an object identification test, a blind spot comparison test, a coupling and uncoupling test, a quasi-static lane change test, a dynamic lane change test and an evasive manoeuvres test.
