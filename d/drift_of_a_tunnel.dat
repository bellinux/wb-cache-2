50|$|On July 14, 2010, in Moscow, {{a meeting}} {{was held to}} discuss {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> under the Lena river, instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bridge. Construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> would be quicker and cost less than that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bridge, as {{it would not be}} dependent on seasonal construction hampered by the river freezing over in autumn and breaking up in spring. The flooding situation of the river also makes the tunnel more attractive. However, the annual maintenance costs for <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> were estimated to be more than twice that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bridge. Construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> in permafrost also posed engineering challenges.|$|R

40|$|It is very {{important}} to know the underground structure of 20 to 30 meters below the surface. However these depths are difficult to know, for they are intermediate region in geophysical prospecting. Several methods were applied to the man-made tunnel (Tegatayama tunnel, Akita City) to know the effect of high resistivity structure in 20 to 30 meters. Only one point electric survey cannot reveal the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tunnel.</b> It is possible to know the influence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> if we use several electric survey data obtained in different positions. The VLF magnetotelluric survey is effective to reveal the structure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> at adepth <b>of</b> 20 to 30 meters.

40|$|International audiencePredicting {{transient}} inflow rates into <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> is <b>an</b> {{important issue}} faced by hydrogeologists. Most existing analytical solutions overestimate the initial discharge {{due to the}} assumption that drilling was instantaneous over the entire tunnel length. In addition, they assume a homogeneous system. An alternative model was recently developed for tunnels intersecting heterogeneous formations, but its application was reduced {{to the case of}} confined flow to deep tunnels in weakly diffusive aquifers. In this paper, we adapt existing analytical solutions for drainage systems to the specific case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> progressively drilled in a highly diffusive heterogeneous unconfined aquifer. The case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> overlying <b>an</b> impervious layer is analytically solved by applying the superposition principle, while the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> constructed some distance above an impervious layer is solved by discretizing the tunnel length into subsectors. Both models can simulate transient discharge into <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> drilled at various speeds through a heterogeneous unconfined aquifer, and allow the prediction of discharge rates in shallow tunnels located in highly diffusive aquifers. We successfully applied this approach to <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> in heterogeneous volcanic rock...|$|R
