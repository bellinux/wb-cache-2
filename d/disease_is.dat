5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E

50|$|Environmental <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> {{a direct}} result from the environment. This {{includes}} diseases caused by substance abuse, exposure to toxic chemicals, and physical factors in the environment, like UV radiation from the sun, as well as genetic predisposition. Meanwhile, pollution-related <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> attributed to exposure to toxins in the air, water, and soil. Therefore all pollution-related <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> environmental <b>diseases,</b> but not all environmental <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> pollution-related <b>diseases.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a wasting disease that affects young sheep. Bluetongue <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{an incurable}} {{neurodegenerative}} disease which most often affects {{the elderly and}} {{accounts for more than}} half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E

In the two remaining cases, the patients presented initially with Crohn’s disease of the ileum and, subsequent to resection, developed ulcerative colitis. Well-documented cases of patients diagnosed with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> rare.

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E

30|$|In general, <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} eight main categories: genetic disease, syndrome, medical disease, disease of metabolism, disease of {{cellular}} proliferation, disease by infectious agent, disease of anatomical entity and disease of mental health.

50|$|Though {{the time}} distinctions <b>are</b> imprecise, <b>diseases</b> can <b>be</b> rapidly {{progressive}} (typically days to weeks) or slowly progressive (months to years). Virtually all slowly progressive <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> also chronic <b>diseases</b> {{in terms of}} time course; many of these are also referred to as degenerative diseases. Not all chronic <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> progressive: a chronic, non-progressive <b>disease</b> may <b>be</b> referred to as a static condition.|$|R
5|$|DPB has {{its highest}} {{prevalence}} among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals {{with the disease}} have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> more common in males, with the male to female ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not {{believed to be a}} cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.|$|E
5|$|DPB is idiopathic, {{which means}} an exact physiological, environmental, or {{pathogenic}} {{cause of the}} <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> unknown. However, several factors are suspected {{to be involved with}} its pathogenesis (the way in which the disease works).|$|E

Almost 80% of Ontarians {{over the age of}} 45 have a chronic condition, and treatment for these diseases amount to 55% of Ontario’s total health costs (MOHLTC, 2007).

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 6.6 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths. Most people with the disease are poor, and most do not realize they are infected. Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen {{an increase in the}} years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> classified as a neglected tropical disease. It affects more than 150 other animals.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{conventionally}} {{divided into}} {{states where the}} parathyroid is overactive (hyperparathyroidism), and states where the parathyroid is under- or hypoactive (hypoparathyroidism).

5|$|The <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{preventable}} {{with the}} polio vaccine; however, {{a number of}} doses are required {{for it to be}} effective. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> occurring. Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Von Willebrand's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a {{hereditary}} {{bleeding disorder}} found in both dogs and humans. It {{is caused by}} a lack of von Willebrand factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal platelet function and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose bleeds, and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this condition with Type I being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. Type I von Willebrand's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> relatively common in the Scottish Terrier.|$|E
