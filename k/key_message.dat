5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course. She stated that the days of big spending were over {{and that it was}} time to rein in public spending. Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the <b>key</b> <b>message</b> in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing and}} {{story of the}} game were {{especially}} praised by reviewers. Kieron Gillen of Rock, Paper, Shotgun said that after playing it, he [...] " [...] {{think of a better}} love story in the Western medium", and that the terse and minimalist prose worked well to create clearly defined characters. A reviewer from The Economist called the story [...] "engaging", saying that it provided a [...] "memorable and thought-provoking experience". In an analysis of the game's story, Emily Short of Gamasutra called the decision to leave the protagonist blank rather than writing a viewpoint character [...] "brilliant", saying that it made the entire game work much better than it otherwise would. A reviewer from The A.V. Club, grading the game as an [...] "A", called the story [...] "moving". The majority of the criticism for the game was in regards to the interface used to navigate the online world; while The Economist found it quirky and realistic, Gillen felt that it made it easy for the player to miss a <b>key</b> <b>message,</b> leaving the player stuck with no direction as to where to turn.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 May 2008, Benedict XVI {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} talk to participants in the International Congress organized by the Pontifical Lateran University on the 40th anniversary of Humanae vitae. He put the encyclical in the broader view of love in a global context, a topic he called [...] "so controversial, yet so crucial for humanity's future." [...] Humanae vitae became [...] "a sign of contradiction but also of continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition... What was true yesterday is true also today." [...] The Church continues to reflect [...] "in an ever new and deeper way on the fundamental principles that concern marriage and procreation." [...] The <b>key</b> <b>message</b> of Humanae vitae is love. Benedict states, that the fullness of a person is achieved by a unity of soul and body, but neither spirit nor body alone can love, only the two together. If this unity is broken, if only the body is satisfied, love becomes a commodity.|$|E

When comparing the RKR for overall learning content and <b>key</b> <b>messages,</b> the RKR for <b>key</b> <b>messages</b> was significantly higher at all time points in the postgraduate group. In the student group, the slope according to the forgetting curve of Ebbinghaus was seen again. The difference {{could be explained by}} the lack of clinical experience in the student group making it more difficult to recognize <b>key</b> <b>messages.</b> The students would then more likely be prone to direct their attention at to more detailed information not crucial to the general concept.

2500|$|De Valera, now {{leader of}} the opposition, left the actual {{parliamentary}} practice of opposing the government to his deputy, Seán Lemass, and himself embarked on a world campaign {{to address the issue}} of partition. He visited the United States, Australia, New Zealand and India, and in the latter country, was the last guest of the Governor-General, [...] Lord Mountbatten of Burma, before he was succeeded by the first Indian-born Governor-General. In Melbourne, Australia, de Valera was feted by the powerful Catholic Archbishop Daniel Mannix, at the centenary celebrations of the diocese of Melbourne. He attended mass-meetings at Xavier College, and addressed the assembled Melbourne Celtic Club. In October 1950, just thirty years after his dramatic escape from Lincoln Gaol, he returned to Lincoln and received the freedom of the gaol. The Anti-Partition of Ireland League of Great Britain marked the occasion with a dinner in his honour and the toast was 'Anglo-Irish Friendship'. A <b>key</b> <b>message</b> in de Valera's campaign was that Ireland could not join the recently established North Atlantic Treaty Organization as long as Northern Ireland was in British hands; although the coalition government favored alliance with NATO, de Valera's approach won more widespread support and prevented the state from signing onto the treaty.|$|E

This research examines award-winning campaigns to explore what assumptions and understandings underpin {{the use of}} <b>key</b> <b>messages</b> by public relations practitioners. It was envisaged this would help explicate an aspect of practice that is seemingly widespread and ingrained. The findings report in four thematic areas {{that emerged from the}} data: environment, development, attributes and context. The concept of a congested and contested messaging environment was found to be the key driver behind the use of <b>key</b> <b>messages.</b> Practitioners saw well-crafted <b>key</b> <b>messages</b> as having the power to cut through the environment to achieve specific outcomes and positively position organisations. The study concludes that although a transmission model/media effects theoretical perspective was evident, practice could also be conceptualised as a social constructionist endeavour in that practitioners worked to create versions of social reality to achieve organisational goals. Further, it was also found that practitioners might benefit from a deeper understanding of how people receive, engage with, and process information in terms of campaign message design and evaluation...|$|R

5000|$|Persuasive discursive {{activity}} {{included the}} propagation and repetition {{of a few}} <b>key</b> <b>messages</b> consistently over time, {{with the aim of}} misdirecting public attention from the silence-generating activities. <b>Key</b> Bush Administration <b>messages</b> were that detainees were evil, dangerous terrorists; that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic; that interrogation techniques, although harsh, were legal (apart from isolated acts of abuse), necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror; and that Guantánamo was a model prison. <b>Key</b> British Administration <b>messages</b> were of initial ministerial ignorance (until 2004) of American intelligence agencies’ new interrogation strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened; and of no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies in extraordinary rendition. <b>Key</b> <b>messages</b> common to both British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy from which lessons had been learned regarding Army training and interrogation guidance (new Army guidelines on interrogation were produced under the Bush and Blair Administrations). These <b>key</b> <b>messages</b> were propagated through a range of discursive activity (including press conferences and media interviews, authorised leaks, real-time reporting, official investigations and public inquiries) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once-secret documents. The consistency of <b>key</b> <b>messages</b> over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth-telling, positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable. However, the strategic generation of <b>key</b> <b>messages</b> and selectivity of supporting information presented across all these discursive modes means that full accountability is avoided, while the public is potentially fooled into thinking that justice has been served, all-the-while being constant targets of manipulation.|$|R
