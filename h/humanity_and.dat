5|$|Caudillos like Facundo Quiroga are seen, at the {{beginning}} of the book, as the antithesis of education, high culture, and civil stability; barbarism was like a never ending litany of social ills.

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between <b>humanity</b> <b>and</b> extraterrestrials, high-information {{messages}} from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock.

The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E
