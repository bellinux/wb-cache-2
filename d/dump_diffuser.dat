40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental/computational study of cold {{flow in the}} combustor-diffuser system of industrial gas turbines to address issues relating to flow interactions and pressure losses in the pre- and dump diffusers. The present configuration with can annular combustors differs substantially from the aircraft engines which typically use a 360 degree annular combustor. Experiments were conducted in a one-third scale, annular 360 -degree model using several can combustors equispaced around the turbine axis. A 3 -D computational fluid dynamics analysis employing the multidomain procedure was performed to supplement the flow measurements. The measured data correlated well with the computations. The airflow in the <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> adversely affected the prediffuser flow by causing it to accelerate in the outer region at the prediffuser exit. This phenomenon {{referred to as the}} sink-effect also caused a large fraction of the flow to bypass much of the <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> and go directly from the prediffuser exit to the bypass air holes on the combustor casing, thereby, rendering the <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> ineffective in diffusing the flow. The <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> was occupied by a large recirculation region which dissipated the flow kinetic energy. Approximately 1. 2 dynamic head at the prediffuser inlet was lost in the combustor-diffuser system; much of it in the <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> where the fluid passed through the narrow gaps and pathways. Strong flow interactions in the combustor-diffuser system indicate the need for design modifications which could not be addressed by empirical correlations based on simple flow configurations...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} flow {{calculations}} were conducted for a model annular <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser.</b> Because {{the presence of}} the multichanneled flow configuration in this model diffuser required careful numerical treatment, various numerics issues were studied. Among those issues, the influences of the numerical schemes and their interaction with the grid distribution are investigated. Proper grid distribution was crucial for obtaining an appropriate numerical solution. Grid distributions for this flow configuration were found to significantly affect the computing time as well as the characteristics of the calculated solutions. In addition, the downstream boundary conditions needed to yield the unique solution are discussed. Different flow characteristics caused by the change of downstream boundary conditions were observed. The importance of the flow profile at the <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> inlet is also identified via the theory data comparison. © 1985...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the 3 D computations of a flow {{field in the}} compressor/combustor diffusers of an industrial gas turbine. The geometry considered includes components such as the combustor support strut, the transition piece and the impingement sleeve with discrete cooling air holes on its surface. Because the geometry was complex and 3 D, the airflow path was divided into two computational domains sharing an interface region. The body-fitted grid was generated independently {{in each of the}} two domains. The governing equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations were solved using the finite volume approach. The results show that the flow in the prediffuser is strongly coupled with the flow in the <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> and vice versa. The computations also revealed that the flow in the <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> is highly nonuniform...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{design program}} {{was developed to}} incorporate the suction slots in solving the potential flow equations with prescribed boundary conditions. Using the contour generated from this program two Griffith diffusers were tested having area ratios AR = 3 and 4. The inlet Reynolds number ranged from 600, 000 to 7 million. It {{was found that the}} slot suction required for metastable operation depends on the sidewall suction applied. Values of slot suction of 8 % of the inlet flow rate was required for AR = 4 with metastable condition, provided that enough sidewall suction was applied. For AR = 3, the values of slot suction was about 25 % lower than those required for AR = 4. For nearly all unseparated test runs, the effectiveness was 100 % and the exit flow was uniform. In addition to the Griffith <b>diffusers,</b> <b>dump</b> and cusp <b>diffusers</b> of comparable area ratios were built and tested. The results obtained from these diffusers were compared with those of the Griffith diffusers. Flow separation occurred in all test runs with the <b>dump</b> and cusp <b>diffusers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of Part 2 is {{to employ a}} computational scheme to investigate the difference in flow pattern, pressure drop, and heat transfer in a gas turbine’s <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> and over the outer surface of the combustor with and without a sheath. Both experimental and computational studies are performed. In Part 1, the experiments are conducted under low pressure and temperature laboratory conditions to provide a database to validate the computation model, which is then used to simulate the thermal-flow field surrounding the combustor and transition piece under elevated gas turbine operating conditions. For laboratory conditions, the CFD results show that (a) the predicted local static pressure values are higher than the experimental data but the prediction of the global total pressure losses matches the experimental data very well; (b) the tota...|$|E
40|$|A short, annular <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> with suction {{stabilized}} vortices in {{the region}} of abrupt area change was tested with a full scale, annular swirl can combustor. The prediffuser area ratio was 1. 4. Performance data were obtained for both isothermal and burning conditions at inlet temperatures of 589 to 895 K and pressures of 0. 5 to 1. 0 MPa for a range of diffuser inlet Mach numbers from 0. 25 to 0. 53. Suction rates were 0 to 20 percent of the total diffuser mass flow rate. Diffuser effectiveness increased from 47 percent without suction to approximately 80 percent for a total suction rate of 14 percent. Combustor total pressure loss for the same total suction rate was reduced from 6. 8 percent without suction to 4. 0 percent at an inlet Mach number of 0. 40...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the {{turbulent}} isothermal flow in axisymmetric annular dump difluser geometries is described and appraised. The calculation method {{is based on}} the numerical solution of the time-averaged transport equations for momentum, continuity, turbu-lence kinetic energy and energy dissipation, using a jinite diyerence formulation. A boundary-jitted curvilinear orthogonal grid obtained from a solution of the inverse Laplace equations is used to represent the curved combustor head accurately and reduce numerical diffusion errors due to better alignment of the flow streamlines with the grid lines. Comparison between predicted results and measure-ments indicates that variations in (a) the overall pressure recovery and (b) the loss coeflcient performance of the <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> system, with changes in diffuser design features (for example innerfouter annulus mass flow split or dump gap), can be predicted to within 7 per cent of the inlet dynamic head without adopting a more refined turbulence closure.

40|$|A {{doctoral}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy. Diffusers are essential in gas turbine combustors, decelerating the compressor efflux prior to the combustion chamber to reduce total pressure losses. Modern, low emission, radially staged combustors require even more diffusion due to the increased flame tube depth {{of this type of}} combustor. Furthermore, these high rates of deceleration are accompanied by large adverse pressure gradients and an associated risk of flow separation. Previous studies have shown that hybrid diffusers can achieve high rates of efficient diffusion in far shorter lengths than conventional faired diffusers or <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> systems, representing a potential performance gain and weight saving. Hybrid diffusers consist of a wide angle diffuser immediately downstream of a sudden expansion, with flow separation prevented by bleeding off a small amount of the mainstream flow. However, previous studies have not provided a conclusive understanding of the associated flow mechanisms leading to hybrid diffusers currently being considered high risk. Additionally definitive data does not exist on the influence of bleed gap geometry and therefore hybrid diffusers cannot, currently, be optimised for use in a modern gas turbine. Further issues also not addressed by earlier studies, but concerning the use of hybrid diffuser in gas turbine combustors, are the effect of representative inlet conditions incorporating vane wakes at diffuser inlet, the quality of the bleed air and its potential for use for component cooling, the effect of radial struts within a hybrid diffuser {{and the quality of the}} flow delivered to the combustor feed annuli (total pressure losses). Therefore, a predominately experimental study, coupled with CFD predictions, was undertaken to investigate the controlling flow mechanisms of hybrid diffusers and address the questions necessary to evaluate the suitability of hybrid diffusers for use in modern, low emission, radially staged combustion systems. An existing isothermal test facility was used comprising a fully annular, staged combustor downstream of a single stage axial compressor incorporating engine representative outlet guide vanes. Initial experimental work led to rig modifications which allowed a range of hybrid diffusers to be studied. To act as a benchmark the performance of a conventional single-passage, <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> system was first studied. A hybrid diffuser demonstrated a 53...|$|E
40|$|Turbulent {{isothermal}} flow {{inside an}} axisymmetric <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> and casing-liner annulus {{has been studied}} by using realizable k-ε model with and without swirl. Hemispherical, ellipsoidal and vertical ellipsoidal shapes of dome have been considered as liner heads in the simulation. The effects of different dome shapes on the flow pattern in the domain and pressure distributions along the casing and liner walls have been studied over a range of inlet swirl number. The static pressure recovery across the diffuser has been evaluated from the pressure distribution for each case. It is noticed that despite the variation in the size and intensity of the recirculating vortices, the pressure recovery remains nearly {{the same for all}} the three dome shapes for a particular swirl level in the inlet. However, swirl in the inlet flow considerably influences the pressure recovery. As the inlet swirl level increases, the size of the corner recirculation decreases, but a central reciculation is additionally formed. The static pressure recovery increases with the inlet swirl level in the range of swirl number considered. This indicates higher effectiveness in pressure recovery with swirl in flow...|$|E
40|$|A short, annular <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> was {{designed}} to use suction to establish stabilized vortices on both walls for improved flow expansion {{in the region of}} an abrupt area change. The diffuser was tested at near ambient inlet pressure and temperature. The overall diffuser area ratio was 4. 0. The inlet height was 2. 54 cm and the exit pitot-static rakes were located at a distance from the vortex fence equal to two or six times the inlet height. Performance data were taken at near ambient temperature and pressure for nominal inlet Mach numbers of 0. 18 to 0. 41 with suction rates of 0 to 18 percent of the total inlet airflow. The exit velocity profile could be shifted toward either wall by adjusting the inner- or outer-wall suction rate. Symmetrical exit velocity profiles were unstable, with a tendency to shift back to hub- or tip-weighted profile. Diffuser effectiveness was increased from about 47 percent without suction to over 85 percent at a total suction rate of about 14 percent. The diffuser total pressure losses at inlet Mach numbers of 0. 18 and 0. 41 decreased from 1. 1 and 5. 6 percent without suction to 0. 48 and 5. 2 percent at total suction rates of 14. 4 and 5. 6 percent, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDiffuser is one key {{component}} of the gas turbine combustor following the compressor. Its primary function is {{to slow down the}} air flow delivered by the compressor in order to promote efficient combustion and avoid large total pressure losses. The impacts of pre-diffuser wall angle and dump gap ratio on the performance of dump diffusers have been discussed in the previous work, but few work has been undertaken on designing diffusers with greater pre-diffuser wall angle. It was observed that apparent flow separation occurred on pre-diffuser wall when pre-diffuser wall angle amplified to certain degree. The pre-diffuser exit flow was distorted, indicating that the uniform exit conditions typically assumed in the diffuser design were violated. Skew distribution of the pre-diffuser outlet flow can result in strong transverse mixing for liquid, the total pressure loss of pre-diffuser increases significantly. In this paper, vortex generators were introduced to delay pre-diffuser separation. PIV system was used to obtain the velocity filed of <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> in the non-reacting condition. Comparisons between experimental results and numerical simulations using different turbulence models show that Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) can better predict flow field of diffuser Calculations result indicated that vortex generators delayed pre-diffuser separation observably and the total pressure drop was reduced to five percent of previous value...|$|E

The paper reports an experimental investigation into the possibility of increased interactions between combustor external aerodynamics and upstream components e. g. pre-diffuser, compressor OGV and even the compressor rotor, caused by the trend in lean module fuel injectors to larger mass flows entering the combustor cowl. To explore these component interaction effects, measurements were made on a fully annular rig comprising a single stage compressor, an advanced integrated OGV/pre-diffuser, followed by a <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> and a generic combustor flametube with metered cowl and inner/outer annulus flows. The flow split entering the cowl was increased from 30 % to 70 %. The results demonstrate that, with fixed geometry, as the injector flow increases, the performance of the pre-diffuser and feed annuli suffer. Pre-diffuser losses increase and at high injector flow rates the diffuser moves close to separation. The substantial circumferential variation in cowl flow can feed upstream and cause rotor forcing.

40|$|Six {{catalytic}} combustor concepts were defined, analyzed, and evaluated. Major design considerations included low emissions, performance, safety, durability, installations, operations and development. On {{the basis of}} these considerations the two most promising concepts were selected. Refined analysis and preliminary design work was conducted on these two concepts. The selected concepts were required to fit within the combustor chamber dimensions of the reference engine. This is achieved by using a <b>dump</b> <b>diffuser</b> discharging into a plenum chamber between the compressor discharge and the turbine inlet, with the combustors overlaying the prediffuser and the rear of the compressor. To enhance maintainability, the outer combustor case for each concept is designed to translate forward for accessibility to the catalytic reactor, liners and high pressure turbine area. The catalytic reactor is self-contained with air-cooled canning on a resilient mounting. Both selected concepts employed integrated engine-starting approaches to raise the catalytic reactor up to operating conditions. Advanced liner schemes are used to minimize required cooling air. The two selected concepts respectively employ fuel-rich initial thermal reaction followed by rapid quench and subsequent fuel-lean catalytic reaction of carbon monoxide, and, fuel-lean thermal reaction of some fuel in a continuously operating pilot combustor with fuel-lean catalytic reaction of remaining fuel in a radially-staged main combustor...|$|E

This paper will report on one such unconventional diffuser; the hybrid diffuser which, under the action of bleed, has been shown to achieve high rates of diffusion in relatively short lengths.
