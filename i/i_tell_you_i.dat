500|$|Texans {{knew of the}} {{oil that}} lay beneath {{the ground in the}} state for decades, but this was often seen more as a problem than a benefit because it {{hindered}} the digging of water wells. Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and they got me oil. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was mad, mad clean through.

I joined Dad's Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window. Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist?" ...|$|E
500|$|... « Toccata »: In this introduction, we are {{introduced}} to the narrator, and discover how he has ended up in France after the war. He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. He closes the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do what can be done, it's the same for everyone, I am a man like other men, I am a man like you. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> am just like you!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Alice, {{frequently}} spoiled with gifts, matured into young womanhood, {{and became}} known as a great beauty like her mother. However, continuing tension with her stepmother and prolonged separation and limited attention from her father created {{a young woman who}} was as independent and outgoing as she was self-confident and calculating. When her father was Governor of New York, he and his wife proposed that Alice attend a conservative school for girls in New York City. Pulling out all the stops, Alice wrote, [...] "If you send me I will humiliate you. I will do something that will shame you. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> will." ...|$|E

2500|$|Just before Hill's attack began, Johnston {{received}} {{a note from}} Longstreet requesting that he join the battle, the first news he {{had heard of the}} fighting. Johnston went forward on the Nine Mile Road with three brigades of Whiting's division and encountered stiff resistance near Fair Oaks Station, the right flank of Keyes's line. Soon heavy Union reinforcements arrived. Brig. Gen. Edwin C. Sumner, II Corps commander, heard the sounds of battle from his position north of the river. On McClellan's orders, he dispatched a division under Brig. Gen. John Sedgwick over the sole remaining bridge. The treacherous [...] "Grapevine Bridge" [...] was near collapse from the swollen river, but the weight of the crossing troops helped to hold it steady against the rushing water. When told that the river could not be crossed, Sumner replied [...] "Impossible!? Sir, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> can cross! I am ordered!" [...] After the last man had crossed safely, the bridge collapsed and was swept away. Sedgwick's men provided the key to resisting Whiting's attack. The fighting was costly as Whiting lost three of four brigade commanders. Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton went down wounded, Robert H. Hatton was killed, and J. Johnston Pettigrew was wounded and captured. On the Union side, Brig. Gen. Oliver O. Howard had his right arm shattered by a Minié ball. The arm was amputated, and he would not return to action for several months.|$|E
