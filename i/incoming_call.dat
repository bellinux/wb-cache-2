25|$|With the {{introduction}} of microcomputers with expansion slots, like the S-100 bus machines and Apple II, it became possible for the modem to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to pick up an <b>incoming</b> <b>call,</b> communicate with the user, and then hang up the call when the user logged off.|$|E
25|$|In the {{new version}} from the December 21 interview, Mangum claims she was {{attacked}} from 11:35p.m. to midnight, much earlier than her previous accusations. This new timing is before the well-documented alibi evidence for Reade Seligmann that places {{him away from the}} house. However, the defense revealed that this new timing would suggest Seligmann {{was on the phone with}} his girlfriend during the height of the attack. Additionally, she received an <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> at 11:36p.m. and somebody stayed on the line for 3 minutes, which would be during the party according to the new timetable.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Virtual {{connection}} tree (VCT) is {{a network}} architecture that can upgrade the quality-of-service (QoS) in wireless {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (ATM) network. The call admission control (CAC) limits the <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> into the network {{in order to maintain}} the quality-of-service of the on going calls, which are already connected to the network. In this paper two different types of systems using VCT are compared, one with queue for new <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> and the other without the queue of the new <b>incoming</b> <b>calls.</b> Both of the systems use prioritizing scheme of handoff calls. There will be some delay of the new <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> when using system with queue. The probability of delay and the handoff dropping probability of the systems will be analyzed...|$|R

25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual switchboards, Panel Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office. The lamps illuminated digits on a display panel corresponding to the number dialed. The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next <b>incoming</b> <b>call.</b> In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call Annunciator signaling system was used to avoid installing lamp panels at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{modulation}} used {{is normally}} DE-QPSK, although DE-BPSK is used on the uplink (mobile to satellite) for acquisition and synchronization. Each time slot is 8.28 ms long and sits in a 90 ms frame. Within each FDMA channel there are four TDMA time slots in each direction. The TDMA frame starts off with a 20.32 ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert Iridium phones of an <b>incoming</b> <b>call,</b> followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots. This technique is known as time-division multiplexing. Small guard periods are used between time slots. Regardless of the modulation method being used, communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at 25 kilobaud.|$|E

When Michael {{notices the}} caller ID of an <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> {{matching}} Kessel's hotel room pseudonym, he realizes Harper {{is part of}} the conspiracy and attempts to strangle her. Later, Michael is visited by himself from the [...] "green reality" [...] who leads him to the jail door. Past the door, Michael first witnesses Kessel's murder and Detective Vega, in a penguin suit, shows Harper's heel breaking in the process hinting that this can be used as hard evidence to place Harper at Kessel's murder.

2500|$|The {{economy of}} the area is heavily {{dependent}} on the petroleum industry and has experienced a series of booms and busts {{as the price of}} crude oil has fluctuated. The Permian Basin {{is the source of the}} New York Mercantile Exchange's benchmark West Texas Intermediate Crude. Traditionally, the core cities of Midland and Odessa have played very distinct roles in the petroleum industry. Midland is home to most of the corporate offices and has a predominantly white-collar population. Odessa by contrast is home to mostly blue-collar workers and industrial facilities. In 2003 Family Dollar constructed its seventh distribution center, in its industrial complex, since then Telvista, an <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> center, and Coca-Cola Enterprises have relocated to this complex located on Interstate 20. In even-numbered years, Odessa hosts the Permian Basin International Oil Showthe world's largest inland petroleum expositionat the Ector County Coliseum. [...] In recent years, both cities have made efforts to diversify into additional industries to reduce their dependence on the petroleum industry. Midland–Odessa is well positioned to become an energy nexus for the region and for the United States as a whole. [...] The metropolitan area is home to two major natural gas powerplants and in July 2006 it was announced that Odessa was one of four possible sites for a FutureGen zero-emissions coal-fired powerplant (which eventually was awarded to Mattoon, Illinois). [...] The Permian Basin is also home to several windfarms and the city of Andrews is a candidate site for an experimental high temperature nuclear reactor. This focus on new sources of alternative energy in addition to petroleum has led some to refer to the Permian Basin as the Energy Basin. [...] The recent high price of crude oil has led to a significant economic boom in the area.|$|E
