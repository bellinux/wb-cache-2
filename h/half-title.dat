25|$|A {{series of}} {{changes to the}} book suggest Houghton Mifflin printed the first edition several times. The {{earliest}} copies show the same bowing hobbit emblem on the title page as is visible on the cover, but in outline. At some point, however, the publisher replaced the emblem on the title page with a seated flautist. This earliest printing also has no <b>half-title</b> page. The first two printings mistakenly identify Chapter VII as Chapter VI on page 118, a defect corrected in the third. While generally similar in all the variants, the binding's cloth changes in color and texture in step with other changes. The first printing's table of illustrations lists Thrór's map as the front endpaper, {{in accordance with the}} text (page 30) but contradicting the actual order. The later printings of the first edition list the Wilderland map as the front endpaper, in accordance with the actual order but contradicting the text. This mess was not fully straightened out until the second edition.|$|E

2500|$|Changing {{the title}} {{was not a problem}} for the American edition, since the running heads {{throughout}} the book only showed the titles of the chapters, and the title page, which would include the publisher's name, could not be printed until a publisher was found. In October Harper's New Monthly Magazine printed chapter 54, [...] "The Town-Ho's Story", with a footnote saying: [...] "From The Whale. The title of a new work by Mr. Melville". The one surviving leaf of proof, [...] "a 'trial' page bearing the title 'The Whale' and the Harper imprint," [...] shows that at this point, after the publisher had been found, the original title still stood. When Allan's letter arrived, no sooner than early October, Bentley had already announced The Whale in both the Athenaem and the Spectator of 4 and 11 October. [...] Probably to accommodate Melville, Bentley inserted a <b>half-title</b> page in the first volume only, which reads [...] "The Whale; or, Moby Dick".|$|E
