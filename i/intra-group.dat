5|$|There's a Riot Goin' On is {{the fifth}} studio album by American band Sly and the Family Stone. It was {{released}} on November 20, 1971, by Epic Records. The album was recorded during 1970 and 1971 at Record Plant Studios in Sausalito, California, with sessions dominated by band frontman Sly Stone {{during a period of}} drug use and <b>intra-group</b> tension. There's a Riot Goin' On embraced a darker and more challenging sound than the optimistic psychedelic soul style of the group's previous records, making use of hard funk rhythms, primitive drum machines, excessive overdubbing, and unconventional mixing techniques. The album's planned title was Africa Talks to You, but it was retitled in response to Marvin Gaye's album What's Going On (1971), released five months before.|$|E

40|$|Our {{recent study}} of a nation-wide {{production}} network uncovered a community structure, namely how firms are connected by supplier-customer links into tightly-knit groups with high density in <b>intra-groups</b> and with lower connectivity in inter-groups. Here we propose a method to visualize the community structure by a graph layout based on a physical analogy. The layout can be calculated in a practical computation-time and is possible to be accelerated by a special-purpose device of GRAPE (gravity pipeline) developed for astrophysical N-body simulation. We show that the method successfully identifies the communities in a hierarchical way by applying it to the manufacturing sector comprising tenth million nodes {{and a half million}} edges. In addition, we discuss several limitations of this method, and propose a possible way to avoid all those problems. ...|$|R

The average distribution of strategies illustrates a prominent central peak which is relevant to the peak-fat-tail character of price change distribution in stock markets. Furthermore, in the modified model the tolerance time parameter makes the agents diversified. Finally, we compare the strategies distribution with the price change distribution in real stock market, and we conclude that contrary behavior rules and tolerance time parameter are indeed valid {{in the description of}} market model...|$|R

25|$|People {{are more}} likely to {{cooperate}} on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from <b>intra-group</b> competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.|$|E

We compare this environment to one in which only one group is exogenously endowed with sanctioning institutions. We find that subjects' ability to vote on institutions leads to (i) a more efficient partition of subjects between groups, (ii) a lower migration rate, (iii) an increase in overall payoffs, and (iv) a decrease in both inter- and <b>intra-groups</b> (payoff) inequality.

To avoid issues linked to the cross-sectional regression and the time series approaches, a non-parametric density estimation approach is instead used. The main goal is to show that Spanish provinces had a convergence dynamics during years, but a divergent one in the last decades. After a period of convergence during the sixties and part of the seventies, evidence in favour of <b>intra-groups</b> convergence (or polarization of income) is found during the eighties, and a starting process of divergence and increasing polarization among groups (clustering) is found for the last period analysed (1991 - 1997).

40|$|We {{all know}} that our eyes can {{inherently}} and effectively recognize/classify objects under complex conditions. Hence, we believe that an efficient clustering approach not only depends {{on the principles of}} physical systems by which the data are generated but also on the manner that human eyes sense the structure of the data. In this study a visual system theoretic cost criterion function is proposed and based upon which a new clustering algorithm is derived. The new cost criterion is visual sampling and Weber’s law is applied. The new criterion function can be made “kernelized” so that developed based on a visual system modeling of the multi-dimensional data where the visual system theories like different kernel functions can be used under different practical requirements. Furthermore, it evaluates the tightness of <b>intra-group’s</b> data distribution and the separable degree among groups simultaneously.

40|$|The classic {{spectrum}} management methods cannot efficiently supply the future multicast traffic demands. Recently, the cognitive radio technology {{has emerged as}} a promising solution to enhance the spectrum utilization. However, the potential heterogeneity in channel availability among the network users leads to send the packets through multiple channels. This significantly decreases the network throughput. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} reduce the multicast period in a single-cell and multi-channel wireless mesh cognitive radio network. In this regard, we jointly exploit the multicast scheduling policies, the <b>intra-groups</b> and inter-groups assistance strategies, and the Wireless Broadcast Advantage (WBA). Based on WBA, a single transmission of a node can simultaneously cover multiple neighboring receivers. In addition, by assigning multiple radios to each network user, we allow the nodes to simultaneously transmit/receive the packets on distinct channels. Numerical results of our comprehensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in term of the network throughput...|$|R
2500|$|Social {{exclusion}} of infected individuals can also prevent <b>intra-group</b> transmission. When dampwood termites (Z. angusticollis) {{come into contact}} with high densities of entamopathogenic fungal spores, they perform a whole-body [...] "vibratory motor display" [...] which induce others who are not in direct contact with the spores to flee, increasing their distance from the infected individual. In the eastern subterranean termite (R. flavipes) infection with the same fungus also causes a vibratory alarm response; termites then aggregate around the infected individual and box it in, preventing it from moving to other areas of the colony; it is sometimes licked and bitten before subsequently being buried. Individual Temnothorax unifasciatus ants who are dying due to fungal infection, carbon dioxide poisoning or 'naturally' (of unknown cause in colonies which had not been experimentally manipulated) permanently leave the nest one to 50 hours before their death, altruistically ceasing all social interactions with nestmates and dying alone away from the colony. Some Apis mellifera workers are 'hygiene specialists'—they detect cells in the colony containing diseased or dead brood, uncap these cells and then remove the cell contents.|$|E

Objective: To evaluate {{the effects of}} an intervention program through conventional physiotherapy (CP) and physiotherapeutic of wiiterapia in muscle strength of older women with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and compare the results pre- and post-intervention. Methods: Longitudinal study, and interventionist, was conducted with 71 elderly women (GI= 33 (CP) and GII= 38 (wiiterapia)), aged ≥ 60 years, with knee OA. Initially the subject answered a questionnaire, after an isokinetic evaluation in speeds of 120, 180 and 240 o/s was carried out. They performed 20 sessions of physiotherapy. The intervention consisted of balance exercises, proprioception, stretching, strengthening. Results: The flexor muscles are weaker in the CF group, and the extensors are stronger in both groups, and the higher the speed the lower the extensor strength. Despite the strength be higher in the wiiterapia group, CF group also showed increased strength in both flexors and extensors.

Analyses of the freshwater lake's bacterial communities under different environments would be of pivotal importance to monitor the condition of waterbody. In this study, we have collected freshwater samples from two lakes on Yun-Gui plateau of China, Lake Dianchi and Lake Haixihai, and analyzed the bacterial community structures from these samples based on 16 S rRNA sequencing. Results have shown that: Firstly, the bacterial community of these samples have very different taxonomical structures, not only between two lakes but also among the <b>intra-groups</b> for samples collected from Dianchi. Secondly, the differences between samples from two lakes are highly associated with the chemical-geographical properties of the two lakes. Thirdly, for samples of Dianchi and Haixihai, analytical results of physicochemical, taxonomical structure and relative abundance of community revealed that extreme physicochemical factors caused by human activities have strongly affected the bacterial ecosystem in Dianchi. These results have clearly indicated the importance of combining biological profiling and chemical-geographical properties for monitoring Chinese plateau freshwater bacterial ecosystem, which could provide clues for Chinese freshwater ecosystem remediation on plateau...|$|R

Using data from 2007, this study evaluates the effi ciency of the 37 major banks operating in Portugal through DEA methodology. Effi ciency is evaluated trough Chen and Zhu (2004) two-stage model applied to the banking industry, circumventing the usual problem inherent in the existence of two approaches (Production/ Intermediation). The main contribution of this study is the incorporation of new variables that refl ect, besides profi tability, value creation and risk, such as intrinsic value added. It is usual to apply standard DEA models to each stage to typically two-stage processes. However, such an approach may conclude that two ineffi cient stages lead to an overall effi cient DMU with the inputs of the fi rst stage and outputs of the second stage. The distortion/improvement in the DEA frontier is caused by the presence of intermediate measures. Effi ciency is analyzed under a global perspective including all banks, assuming that all access the same technology. Subsequent analysis is made to the effi ciency by groups based on size/business and risk factors, estimated separate frontiers, analyzed the ineffi ciencies <b>intra-groups</b> and differences among groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{clarifying}} the effect, if any, of symmetrical scaffolding versus asymmetrical scaffolding on English reading comprehension of Iranian students. The research was carried out on 80 elementary male students in six classes. The six classes {{were randomly assigned to}} two inter-class groups, i. e. symmetrical group (SG) and asymmetrical group (AG). Then two parallel tests {{in the form of a}} cloze test served as the pre- and post-tests. Since the students accomplished answering the cloze tests with recourse to their similar dictionaries, the results were regarded as the potential knowledge, i. e. zone of proximal development (ZPD), of the students in reading comprehension. In each of the <b>intra-groups</b> of the SG, consisting of four (at times three) students, the students with similar ZPDs in reading comprehension were asked to work together.

40|$|Introduction: Children {{with severe}} hearing loss have a delay in the {{vocabulary}} repertoire compared to the normal-hearing children of the same chronological age. One of the factors considered to be basic {{during the process of}} language development is the family intervention. Objective: To propose a program controlled for guiding of parents of children using cochlear implant (CIC) and verify the effectiveness of the program through the variation of the children's lexical performance. Method: Prospective study. Eight CIC and their respective families took part in the research and were divided into two groups: GI (with guiding program) and GII (without guiding program). The lexical performance of the children was measured through the List of Evaluation of Expressive Vocabulary (LAVE) with prior and posterior guiding program. The guiding program Participative Family for CIC was composed by four sessions, of weekly application, with duration of 60 minutes each. The topics approached were development of auditory and linguistic skills. Results: The <b>intra-groups</b> ANOVAs didn't present a different significant performance in LAVE for the prior and posterior guiding comparison of both groups. The ANOVAs between groups didn't reveal a statistically significant difference between the groups for lexical performance. Conclusion: The groups didn't differ in the effectiveness of the program as measured by LAVE. Such results must be an important indicator of lexical evolution measures based only on the family perception.

METHODS Two groups were studied, and compared for gender, age and HR: A) Ten (10) patients reporting septal HCM (70 % non-obstructive); B) ten (10) healthy volunteers. HRV was analyzed along four successive stages: at rest, under controlled breathing, while bending, and controlled breathing associated to bending. Variables means were compared between groups and <b>intra-groups</b> in the different stages; in Group A, variables means were correlated to echocardiographic measurements (interventricular septum and left atrial diameter). RESULTS No HRV difference was reported among groups in the fi rst 3 stages. In the fourth stage vagal activity was shown to be higher in Group A [quadratic mean log between RR intervals (RMSSD) – 1. 35 + 0. 14 vs 1. 17 + 0. 16; p= 0. 019; high frequency component logarithm (LogHF) - 4. 89 + 0. 22 vs 4. 62 + 0. 26; p= 0. 032]. Along the stages, vagal measurements [rate of pairs of consecutive RR intervals whose difference is ≥ 50 ms (pNN 50) and LogHF] also showed lower reduction in the third stage in Group A, while LogHF showed some increase in last stage (p= 0. 027), thus indicating marked parasympathetic activity in that group.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective in}} post-method pedagogy is developing language learner’s communicative competence {{to enable them}} to participate in communication acts. Effective oral communication entails observation of a number of conversational principles and appropriate use of various strategies to avoid violation of mutually recognized rules, e. g. politeness strategies. Some researchers believe that politeness strategies have a number of universal Features (Goff man, 1967, 1971 : Goody, 1978 a). In line with previous research studies, the present study set out to investigate whether nationality would influence the use of request politeness strategies by Iranian and Turkish EFL learners at the same proficiency level. Participants in this study included 448 students at four different levels of proficiency who were majoring in English language teaching at Gazi University in turkey and Islamic Azad University – Tabriz Branch. 224 Turkish students at four different grade levels and the same number of Iranian students participated directly in this phase of the research. Each grade level group consisted of 56 students. The researcher administered a questionnaire enquiring their preferences in selecting the proper forms of requests (Blum - Kulka & Olshtain, 1985). The statistical analysis revealed a strong correlation in <b>intra-groups</b> while the inter – group results displayed relatively significant differences.

Design: Prospective interventional case-series. University practice. Participants: Fifty six eyes (56 patients) with uncontrolled primary open-angle glaucoma. Methods: Patients received either SLT (n= 25) or Hydrus implantation (n= 31) in two centres. Patients were evaluated at baseline and 1, 7 days, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Main Outcome Measures: Intraocular pressure and number of glaucoma medications variations inter-groups and <b>intra-groups.</b> Results: There {{were no significant differences}} at baseline between groups, but the mean deviation was worse in the Hydrus group (- 8. 43 ± 6. 84 dB, confidence limits (CL) - 2. 8 /- 3. 3 vs. - 3. 04 ± 0. 65 dB, CL- 6 /- 10. 8; P< 0. 001). After 12 months, there was a significant decrease in IOP and medications in the Hydrus group compared with baseline values. In the SLT group, only the decrease in IOP was significant. There was 3 -fold greater reduction in medication use in the Hydrus group compared with SLT (- 1. 4 ± 0. 97 vs. - 0. 5 ± 1. 05, P= 0. 001). 47 % of patients were medication free at 12 months in the Hydrus group (4 % in the SLT group).
