5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which {{was taken from the}} film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E
5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white lead was used during Vermeer’s time, {{but of course}} he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E

40|$|An in vivo {{experiment}} was performed with pigs {{to study the}} inhibitory effect of fermented feed on the bacterial population of the gastrointestinal tract. Results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between pH and lactobacilli <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach <b>contents</b> of pigs in dry feed as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach <b>contents</b> of pigs fed fermented feed. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between the pH and the numbers of bacteria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Enterobacteriaceae <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of <b>the</b> stomach of pigs fed dry feed was found. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> stomach <b>contents</b> of pigs fed fermented feed, a significant negative correlation {{was found between the}} concentration of the undissociated form of lactic acid and the numbers of Enterobacteriaceae. The numbers of Enterobacteriaceae <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of <b>the</b> stomach, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum of pigs fed fermented feed were significantly lower compared with <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of <b>the</b> stomach, ileum, caecum, colon, and rectum of pigs fed dry feed.

40|$|Butanoic acid plays a {{significant}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maintenance of mucosal health and is the preferred energy substrate for <b>the</b> cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colon. Here, butanoic acid was selectively conjugated to the secondary hydroxyl group of β-cyclodextrin through ester bond using sodium hydride as the deprotonation reagent. The preliminary release behaviors of butanoic acid in rat gastrointestinal tract contents were investigated at 37 °C within 12 [*]h. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of stomach, <b>the</b> conjugates did seldom release butanoic acid, released butanoic acid only 5. 8 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of small intestine, and released butanoic acid significantly up to 38. 4 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of colon. These results indicate that the conjugate activation took place site specifically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rat colonic <b>contents,</b> via <b>the</b> biodegradation by glycosidases and hydrolases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colon. Therefore, the β-cyclodextrin conjugates of butanoic acid may be of value as an orally administered colon-specific formulation for the nutrition of colon...|$|R

25|$|This {{compendium}} of biblical and classical history (original title: De aetatibus mundi et hominis libri XXIII) is told in fourteen books, each lacking a particular {{letter of the}} alphabet ('A' in book i, 'B' in book ii., etc.). The deliberate omission of each letter means that Fulgentius cannot use any word containing that letter for the entirety of that section. However, he varies this avoidance of words with his second technique of swapping omitted letters for other arbitrarily selected letters. These techniques obscure his language, making {{it very difficult for}} the reader to understand his meaning. Just as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Content</b> of Virgil, Fulgentius claims the work was completed {{as a result of the}} request of his unnamed patron.|$|E
25|$|As {{its title}} suggests, Cvetkovich's book is “organized as ‘an archive of feelings,'” and is “an {{exploration}} of cultural texts as repositories of feelings and emotions, which are encoded not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> {{of the texts}} themselves but in the practices that surround their production and reception.” According to Cvetkovich, archives of trauma resemble the archives {{of gay and lesbian}} cultures. Not only are ephemera, ephemerality, and memory fundamental to both of these archives, but both also challenge the very concept of the archive. Cvetkovich's sources – her archive – include oral interviews, performances, fiction, poetry, memoirs, photographs, and films. Theoretically, she engages with feminist, critical race, Marxist, and queer theory.|$|E
25|$|The clays {{used are}} often {{described}} as being long or short, depending on their plasticity. Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In soil mechanics, plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe {{the ease with which}} a clay may be worked. Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.|$|E

25|$|A {{controversial}} {{example of}} an unreliable narrator occurs in Agatha Christie's novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, where the narrator hides essential truths in the text (mainly through evasion, omission, and obfuscation) without ever overtly lying. Many readers at the time felt that the plot twist at {{the climax of the}} novel was nevertheless unfair. Christie used the concept again in her 1967 novel Endless Night. The same technique was employed (baldly) in William Makepeace Thackeray's 1847–8 serial and novel Vanity Fair—one of the few examples of an unreliable authorial narrator in the English novel—where he admits passing over the worst of Becky's misdeeds in silence while providing enough allusions and clues (including <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> and captions of the illustrations, also done by Thackeray) to show the way to those interested in them; even their accuracy, however, is made dubious by his admission that he learned the story second-hand from the diplomat Tapeworm. The Norwegian crime writer Sven Elvestad's 1909 The Iron Wagon is another early example of the trope.|$|E

500|$|In {{everyday}} life, psychologists {{noticed that}} people are persuaded by messages differently based on {{the identity of the}} author. It seemed that the more prestige the author/speaker has, the more likely the person will believe them. [...] Many social psychologists prior to Asch had studied this phenomenon. However, Asch disagreed with many of them and critiqued their interpretations. His main conclusion was that a change in evaluation requires a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> and meaning of the response {{as a result of the}} change in context. Therefore, the meaning of the message is interpreted differently depending on who is the author of the message. He suggests that participants are not blindly accepting a message based on the author, but rather they are making meaning of the quote based on the author.|$|E

In addition, his commitment to launching his Dark Horse record label had left Harrison rushing to finish the album while rehearsing for the concerts; as a result, he contracted laryngitis and sang hoarse on much of the recordings and throughout the tour. While Dark Horse sold well initially in America, it failed to place at all on Britain's top 50 albums chart.|$|E
