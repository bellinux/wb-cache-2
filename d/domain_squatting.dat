40|$|Background: The Lysholm knee {{scale is}} a condition-specific outcome measure that was {{originally}} designed to assess ligament injuries of the knee. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the psychometric properties of the Lysholm knee scale for various chondral disorders of the knee. Methods: Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, content validity, criterion validity, construct validity, and respon-siveness to change were determined for the Lysholm knee scale within subsets of an overall study population of 1657 patients with chondral disorders of the knee. The study population was a heterogeneous group of patients with various types of traumatic and degenerative chondral lesions, including isolated lesions and those associated with meniscal and ligament injuries. Results: The overall Lysholm knee scale and six of the eight domains had acceptable test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 91) and internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0. 65). The overall Lysholm knee scale demonstrated acceptable floor (0 %) and ceiling (0. 7 %) effects; however, the floor effects for the <b>domain</b> of <b>squatting</b> and the ceiling effects for the domains of limp, instability, support, and locking were unacceptable (> 30 %). There was acceptable criterion validity with significant (p < 0. 05) correlations between the overall Lysholm knee scale and the physical functioning, role-physical, and bodily pain domains of the Short Form- 12 scale; the pain, stiffness, and func-tion domains of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index; and the Tegner activity scale...|$|R
40|$|The Protection of Registered Trademark of Cyber Crime Through The Restriction of The Domain Name Registration. The {{progress}} {{of science and}} technology has implications for the {{progress of}} the current trading method. It is not only done conventionally but also carried out through cyberspace. Trading in the virtual world requires the use of a <b>domain</b> name (cyber <b>squatting)</b> as a differentiator between one company with other companies. Law No. 11 Year 2008 on Information and Electronic Transactions regulate the use of domain names and emphasize the element of good faith in the implementation. In practice, there is a breach of the domain name registration is a crime which is the trademark or name that has a commercial value. This paper is going to examine aspects of protection-registered trademark of cyber crime through the restriction of the domain name registration and implementation of good faith.

In the current era of globalization {{is the use of}} information technology is growing rapidly, causing the occurrence of acts of piracy brand through a virtual world called cybersquatting or <b>domain</b> name <b>squatting.</b> Cybersquatting actions cause harm to the original brand owners need certainty and legal protection amid legal vacuum regulating cybersquatting action in Indonesia. This research is a kind of research using normative juridical approach legislation. This research was conducted with the objective of identifying, analyzing and evaluating forms of legal protection of brands from cybersquatting action in Indonesia, and to identify, analyze and evaluate efforts to improve the legal protection of brands from cybersquatting action in Indonesia. The results {{of this study indicate that}} 1). Legal protection of brands from cybersquatting law in Indonesia is still not regulated explicitly in legislation in Indonesia, both in the law that governed the brand in Law Number 15 Year 2001 on Trademarks, the Code of Criminal Code (Code), and Act No. 8 of 1999 on Consumer Protection, 2). Efforts to improve the legal protection of the brand in Indonesia from cybersquatting action has been carried out by the Indonesian government through the delegation of authority to the PANDI (Domain Name Management Indonesia). PANDI provides the requirements for creating a domain name with a naming guidelines include a requirement that domain, a domain naming must comply with the provisions and requirements of the Brand name / Trade mark Name / Name Copyright / IP other is related to the Domain Name brand / trade mark / copyright / other Intellectual Property Rights of the Registrant / entity-business / agency / organization that supported / evidenced by certificates of brand / trade-mark / copyright / other Intellectual Property Rights. ...|$|R
50|$|Within Germanic neopaganism in Germany in particular, {{debate on}} neopaganism and neo-Nazism is very {{prominent}} and controversial. The {{large majority of}} German neopagans vehemently renounce all right extremist associations, especially since a 1996 case of a Sauerland neo-Nazi who had confessed to four murders which he claimed were inspired by the command of Odin. The controversy is kept alive because there remain a number of neo-Nazi or far-right neopagan groups, with JÃ¼rgen Rieger's Artgemeinschaft (Rieger died 2009) notoriously <b>domain</b> <b>squatting</b> asatru.de since 1999.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of ICANN's generic {{top-level}} domain (gTLD) expansion, the risk of <b>domain</b> <b>squatting</b> has increased significantly. For example, based on current regulations, the registration of the gTLDs [...]olympics or [...]redcross is not allowed, however the registration of sites such as olympics.example or redcross.example is not controlled.Experts say that further restrictions are needed for second-level domains under the new gTLD [...]health, as well. For example, second-level domains under [...]tobacco.health or [...]diet.health can be easily misused by companies and therefore are a potential threat to Internet users.|$|E

[...] Trademark owners initially responded by filing cybersquatting lawsuits against registrants to enforce their trademark rights. [...] However, as the number of cybersquatting incidents grew, trademark owners noticed that registrants would often settle their cases rather than litigate. [...] Cybersquatting lawsuits are a defensive strategy to combat cybersquatting, however such lawsuits may also be used as a way of strongarming innocent domain name registrants into giving up domain names that the trademark owner is not, in fact, entitled to.|$|E
40|$|<b>Domain</b> <b>squatting</b> is {{a common}} {{adversarial}} practice where attackers register domain names that are purposefully similar to popular domains. In this work, we study {{a specific type of}} <b>domain</b> <b>squatting</b> called "combosquatting," in which attackers register domains that combine a popular trademark with one or more phrases (e. g., betterfacebook[. ]com, youtube-live[. ]com). We perform the first large-scale, empirical study of combosquatting by analyzing more than 468 billion DNS records [...] -collected from passive and active DNS data sources over almost six years. We find that almost 60 % of abusive combosquatting domains live for more than 1, 000 days, and even worse, we observe increased activity associated with combosquatting year over year. Moreover, we show that combosquatting is used to perform a spectrum of different types of abuse including phishing, social engineering, affiliate abuse, trademark abuse, and even advanced persistent threats. Our results suggest that combosquatting is a real problem that requires increased scrutiny by the security community. Comment: ACM CCS 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we present soundsquatting, a {{previously}} unre-ported type of <b>domain</b> <b>squatting</b> which we uncovered during analysis of cybersquatting domains. In soundsquatting, an attacker {{takes advantage of}} homophones, i. e., words that sound alike, and registers homophone-including variants of popular domain names. We explain why sound-squatting is different from existing domain-squatting attacks, and de-scribe a tool for the automatic generation of soundsquatting domains. Using our tool, we discover that attackers are already aware of the princi-ples of soundsquatting and are monetizing them in various unethical and illegal ways. In addition, we register our own soundsquatting domains and study the population of users who reach our monitors, recording a monthly average of more than 1, 700 non-bot page requests. Lastly, we show how sound-dependent users are particularly vulnerable to sound-squatting through the abuse of text-to-speech software. ...|$|E
