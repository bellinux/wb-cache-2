There are several such belts namely the Shihongtan <b>uranium</b> <b>deposit</b> in Tuha basin, the Kujieertai <b>uranium</b> <b>deposit,</b> the Wukuerqi <b>uranium</b> <b>deposit</b> in Yili basin, the Bashibulake <b>uranium</b> <b>deposit</b> in Tarim basin, the Qianjiadian <b>uranium</b> <b>deposit</b> in Songliao basin, and the Dongsheng <b>uranium</b> <b>deposit</b> in Ordos basin. The research demonstrates that large-scale activity of oil-gas or coal-gas is universal in various sandstone-type <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> and <b>uranium</b> prospective belts. The oil-gas activity is more prominent than coal-gas, {{and the type of}} oil-gas is different to some degree in different region. But the oil-gas inclusion petrography and the optical character evidences reveal that multistage oil-gas activities existed in the ore-formation stages of sandstone-type <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> in north China. By analyzing 58 metal elements in 60 fluids samples including various petroleum, groundwater in the oil-bearing beds, uranium- and oxygen-bearing groundwater in uranium ore districts, and by comparing uranium and thorium contents in the samples, petroleum is first confirmed to be an ore fluid with abundant uranium and multiple metal elements. More than 90 % of metal elements in petroleum have higher content than those in groundwater of the oil-bearing beds. All the metal elements in petroleum have higher content than those in spring water in the uranium-source rocks (granite and volcanic rocks) and those in uranium- and oxygen-bearing groundwater in uranium or...|$|R

40|$|South China {{is rich in}} vein-type {{hydrothermal}} <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> hosted in granitic, volcanic, and carbonaceous and siliceous pelitic sedimentary rocks. The <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> are spatially {{associated with}} extensional structures and/or mantle-derived mafic dikes. Both the <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> and mafic dikes are Cretaceous to Tertiary in age, temporally coincident with the crustal extension. Carbon isotope analyses of calcite deposited in the main-stage mineralization in the veins from 12 representative <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> yield δ 13 C values of ore-forming fluids mainly from - 4 to - 8 per mil, which are permissive of a mantle origin for the CO 2 in the ore-forming fluids. A mantle origin {{is consistent with the}} association of the deposits with mafic dikes and the 3 He/ 4 He ratios of ore-forming fluids (e. g., 0. 10 - 2. 02 Ra for the volcanic-hosted Xiangshan <b>uranium</b> <b>deposit).</b> Isotopic compositions of H and 0 demonstrate that water in the ore-forming fluids is predominantly meteoric in origin. Ore-forming temperatures ranged approximately from 150 ° to 250 °C. Uranium-rich crustal rocks in South China may have been the sources for the uranium. Crustal extension and associated mafic magmatism are considered to have heated the rocks and allowed CO 2 (possibly from mantle sources) to migrate upward and to mix with CO 2 -poor meteoric water.

40|$|A local geochemical {{soil survey}} {{was carried out}} for the {{exploration}} of <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> {{in the area of}} north – east Vogelkop Irian Jaya, Indonesia. The study explores the use of trace elements associations as an indicator for the possible presence of <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits.</b> This selective association of trace elements is useful since radon, helium or any other gaseous daughter product of uranium can not be used, as there are no known <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> in the area. Hence no local ore samples are available to establish the inter-elemental association as a guide. To establish the trace elements association in ores, known <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> from {{different parts of the world}} are investigated. Fifteen ore samples are analyzed by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) for their total metal content. The comparative study of elemental association, established for these 15 ore samples with the elemental association shown by the soil is non-representative of the ore types that could be expected in such a geological environment.

40|$|The Mount Isa region {{contains}} over 20 <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits,</b> few {{of which}} contain economic concentrations of uranium. They {{are thought to}} be significant in the exploration for new copper deposits, based on the model that the <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> are located in the pathways of oxidized hydrothermal fluids that formed the postmetamorphic Mount Isa copper orebodies. There are two <b>uranium</b> <b>deposit</b> types, both hosted in volcanosedimentary rocks. We suggest that they represent one mineralization event but different metamorphic histories. Examples in the eastern low-grade metamorphic zone are dominated by a brannerite-anatase-apatite assemblage and are low in uranium. The examples in the western high-grade metamorphic zone are characterized by uraninite and titanite with higher uranium concentrations. The chemical association of U, Ti, and Ca is consistent for all deposits; however, phosphate is only important at low metamorphic grade. The most likely mechanism of formation in the lower metamorphic grade Anderson’s Lode example is the complete replacement of chlorite in the sedimentary host-rock matrix by the mineralizing assemblage. In this model, chlorite acted as a reductant, allowing the deposition of uranium from an oxidized fluid. This mechanism of uranium deposition is similar to that proposed for unconformity-type <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits.</b> We conclude that these <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> are metamorphosed equivalents of Proterozoic unconformity-type <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> found elsewhere in northern Australia. At Anderson’s Lode, brannerite and apatite were concentrated in veinlets by pressure dissolution after the deposition of the original assemblage. These pressure dissolution seams are cut by premetamorphic quartz-chlorite veins. Examples at higher metamorphic grade have textures that suggest uranium deposition was pre- to synmetamorphic at the latest. This precludes any genetic or temporal connection between the <b>uranium</b> <b>deposits</b> and the postmetamorphic Mount Isa copper deposit...|$|R
