500|$|The trio {{released}} two 7-inch EP recordings with Cargo {{during the}} interim. By {{the summer of}} 1996, [...] "Wasting Time" [...] had been released as a single to keep matters moving along nattily. The track was the final single from the Cheshire Cat sessions, and the band would soon return to their native home state to record a follow-up. Before recording of the album began, the band booked time at DML Studios in Escondido, California, where they perfected the songs for Dude Ranch. Most of the lyrics for the album had been written over 1995 and 1996, while touring. [...] "I remember writing most of those songs <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> room, sitting on a [...] curb, whatever," [...] recalled DeLonge in 2001. [...] "Back then, each song was pretty much written with a specific girl or event in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Loretta was {{created as a}} temporary love interest for Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) and was intended to feature only in Hollyoaks Later, the spin-off from the Hollyoaks series. In 2009 {{it was announced that}} the Hollyoaks producer Lucy Allan had decided to introduce both Loretta and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) into the main show. Allan said, [...] "Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show. Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed me with their performances in Hollyoaks Later and I'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly." [...] Loretta was initially paired with Dom and, after ending their relationship, was given links to other characters in the series. To prepare for the role Walton took pole-dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club. After watching girls perform at the club she carried out routines in her underwear. She also had a pole set up in her living room to carry on practicing. Speaking of her research Walton stated: [...] "I loved it. It's really good exercise. It's really good for toning. They didn't ask me to, but I did... I went and I had pole dancing classes. I had a pole put up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> room." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{recording}} made at Carfax Tower in Oxford {{provided the}} bell chimes heard {{at the end}} of [...] "Strange Ones". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, [...] "Sitting Up Straight", which was not included in Supergrass is 10. [...] "Strange Ones" [...] was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the [...] "throwaway song" [...] on the B-side to [...] "Caught by the Fuzz". Another song on the album with the same theme, [...] "I'd Like To Know", was inspired by listening to [...] "Strange Ones" [...] played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, [...] "One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.... I remember everybody got in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [...] on bass, a friend of his on hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take.... We made I Should Coco so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!" [...] In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered [...] "writing that song [...] <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> room on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and just did it on 4 track".|$|E
2500|$|Tré Cool's {{father was}} {{supportive}} and overhauled a bookmobile {{to transport the}} band. He would later say: [...] "I watched them go from {{a bunch of kids}} to a group of musicians with work ethic," [...] also adding: [...] "On their first tour or two, {{it was more of a}} party than anything else. I still scratch my head and say, 'How in the hell did they make it?' They used to practice <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> room here – a lot of the songs they did on Dookie.

2500|$|Wolverine {{was tough}} for Jackman to portray {{because he had}} few lines, {{but a lot of}} emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Road Warrior. [...] "Here were guys who had {{relatively}} little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it." [...] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. [...] "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty." [...] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. [...] "Every day <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{young man}} {{came to see me}} at my lodgings the other night, and began to talk of the making of the earth and the heavens and much else. I {{questioned}} him about his life and his doings. He had written many poems and painted many mystical designs since we met last, but latterly had neither written nor painted, for his whole heart was set upon making his mind strong, vigorous, and calm, and the emotional life of the artist was bad for him, he feared. He recited his poems readily, however. He had them all in his memory. Some indeed had never been written down. They, with their wild music as of winds blowing in the reeds,[FN#1] seemed to me the very inmost voice of Celtic sadness, and of Celtic longing for infinite things the world has never seen. Suddenly {{it seemed to me that}} he was peering about him a little eagerly. [...] "Do you see anything, X-----?" [...] I said. [...] "A shining, winged woman, covered by her long hair, is standing near the doorway," [...] he answered, or some such words. [...] "Is it the influence of some living person who thinks of us, and whose thoughts appear to us in that symbolic form?" [...] I said; for I am well instructed in the ways of the visionaries and in the fashion of their speech. [...] "No," [...] he replied; [...] "for if it were the thoughts of a person who is alive I should feel the living influence <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> body, and my heart would beat and my breath would fail. It is a spirit. It is some one who is dead or who has never lived." ...|$|E
