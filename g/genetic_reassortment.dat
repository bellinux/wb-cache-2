There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that the genome is non-segmented and thus cannot undergo <b>genetic</b> <b>reassortment.</b> In order for this process to occur, segments are needed as reassortment happens when segments from different strains are mixed {{together to create a}} new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another and so there is no antigenic shift. The second reason relates to the idea of antigenic drift. Since RNA dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that paramyxoviruses should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient.

An increasing concern towards West Nile disease (WND) has been observed due to the high number of human and animal cases reported in these areas confirming the importance of this zoonosis. A new epidemiological scenario is currently emerging: although new introductions of the virus from abroad are always possible, confirming the epidemiological role played by migratory birds, the infection endemisation in some European territories today is a reality supported by the constant reoccurrence of the same strains across years in the same geographical areas. Despite the WND reoccurrence in the Old World, the overwintering mechanisms are not well known, and the role of local resident birds or mosquitoes in this context is poorly understood. A recent new epidemiological scenario is the spread of lineage 2 strain across European and Mediterranean countries in regions where lineage 1 strain is still circulating creating favourable conditions for <b>genetic</b> <b>reassortments</b> and emergence of new strains.

40|$|Accepted (Day Month Year) Influenza A {{virus is}} a {{negative}} stranded RNA virus, composed of eight segmented RNA molecules, including polymerases (PB 2, PB 1, PA), haemaglutin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (MP), and nonstructure gene (NS). The influenza A viruses are notorious for rapid mutations, frequent genomic reassortments, and possible recombinations.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we reconstituted reassortant ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, and demonstrated that the PB 2 subunit of A/HongKong/ 156 / 1997 (H 5 N 1) [HK PB 2] dramatically reduced the synthesis of mRNA, cRNA and vRNA when introduced into the polymerase of other influenza strains of H 1 N 1 or H 3 N 2. The HK PB 2 had no significant effect on the assembly of the polymerase trimeric complex, or on promoter binding activity or replication initiation activity in vitro. However, the HK PB 2 was found to remarkably impair the accumulation of RNP. This impaired accumulation and activity of RNP was fully restored when four amino acids at position 108, 508, 524 and 627 of the HK PB 2 were mutated.

Water-isolated viruses have rarely been genetically characterized and evaluation for persistence in water and infectivity in natural hosts has never been documented. In this study, we focused on two IA viruses (H 3 N 8 and H 4 N 6 subtypes) isolated from surface lake water in Minnesota, USA. We investigated the relative prevalence of the two virus subtypes in wild duck populations at the sampling site and their genetic relatedness to IA viruses isolated in wild waterbirds in North America. Viral persistence under different laboratory conditions (temperature and pH) and replication in experimentally infected Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were also characterized. Both viruses were the most prevalent subtype one year following their isolation in lake water. The viruses persisted in water for an extended time period at constant temperature (several weeks) but infectivity rapidly reduced under multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Furthermore, the two isolates efficiently replicated in Mallards.

However complex evolutionary events, such as <b>genetic</b> <b>reassortments</b> or hybrid speciations which occur commonly in viruses, bacteria and plants, do not fit into this elementary framework. Alternatively, various network representations have been developed. Circular networks are a natural generalization of leaf-labeled trees interpreted as split systems, that is, collections of bipartitions over leaf labels corresponding to current species. Although such networks do not explicitly model specific evolutionary events of interest, their straightforward visualization and fast reconstruction have made them a popular exploratory tool to detect network-like evolution in genetic datasets. Standard reconstruction methods for circular networks, such as Neighbor-Net, rely on an associated metric on the species set. Such a metric is first estimated from DNA sequences, which leads to a key difficulty: distantly related sequences produce statistically unreliable estimates. This is problematic for Neighbor-Net as {{it is based on the}} popular tree reconstruction method Neighbor-Joining, whose sensitivity to distance estimation errors is well established theoretically. In the tree case, more robust reconstruction methods have been developed using the notion of a distorted metric, which captures the dependence of the error in the distance through a radius of accuracy.

40|$|Abstract Background H 9 N 2 avian {{influenza}} A viruses have become panzootic in Eurasia {{over the last}} decade and have caused several human infections in Asia since 1998. To study their evolution and zoonotic potential, we conducted an in silico analysis of H 9 N 2 viruses that have infected humans between 1997 and 2009 and identified potential novel reassortments. Results A total of 22 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were retrieved from the NCBI flu database. It was identified that mature peptide sequences of HA genes isolated from humans in 2009 had glutamine at position 226 (H 3) of the receptor binding site, indicating a preference to bind to the human α (2 - 6) sialic acid receptors, which is different from previously isolated viruses and studies where the presence of leucine at the same position contributes to preference for human receptors and presence of glutamine towards avian receptors. Similarly, strains isolated in 2009 possessed new motif R-S-N-R in spite of typical R-S-S-R at the cleavage site of HA, which isn't reported before for H 9 N 2 cases in humans. Other changes involved loss, addition, and variations in potential glycosylation sites as well as in predicted epitopes. The results of phylogenetic analysis indicated that HA and NA gene segments of H 9 N 2 including those from current and proposed vaccine strains belong to two different Eurasian phylogenetic lineages confirming possible <b>genetic</b> <b>reassortments.</b> Conclusions These findings support the continuous evolution of avian H 9 N 2 viruses towards human as host and are in favor of effective surveillance and better characterization studies to address this issue. </p...|$|R

40|$|Influenza A {{virus has}} the ability to {{overcome}} immunity from previous infections through the acquisition of genetic changes. Thus, understanding the evolution of the viruses in humans is important for the surveillance and the selection of vaccine strains. A total of 30 influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses and 35 influenza A/H 1 N 1 viruses that were collected in Vietnam from 2001 to 2006 were used to analyze the evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein (M) genes. Phylogenetic analysis of individual gene segments revealed that the HA and the NA genes of the influenza A viruses evolved in a sequential way. However, the evolutionary pattern of the M gene proved to be nonlinear and was not linked with that of the HA and NA genes. Genetic drift in HA 1 segments, especially in the antigenic sites of A/H 3 N 2 viruses, occurred more frequently in A/H 3 N 2 viruses than it did in A/H 1 N 1 viruses.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{evolution}} of avian influenza A viruses (IAV), as well as host-pathogen interactions between these viruses and their main reservoir host, the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). IAV is a genetically diverse, multi-host virus and wild birds, particularly dabbling ducks, are the natural reservoir. At our study site, up to 30 % of migratory Mallards are infected with IAV during an autumn season, and host {{a large number of}} virus subtypes. IAV diversity is driven by two main mechanisms: mutation, driving <b>genetic</b> drift; and <b>reassortment</b> following co-infection, resulting in <b>genetic</b> shift.   <b>Reassortment</b> is pervasive within an autumn season, both across multiple subtypes and within a single subtype. It is a key genetic feature in long-term maintenance of common subtypes, as it allows for independent lineage turn-over, generating novel genetic constellations. I hypothesize that the decoupling of successful constellations and generation of novel annual constellations enables viruses to escape herd immunity; these genetic changes must confer antigenic change for the process to be favourable. Indeed, in an experiment utilizing vaccines, circulating viruses escaped homosubtypic immunity, resulting in the proliferation of infections with the same subtype as the vaccine. While the host {{plays an important role in}} shaping IAV evolutionary genetics, one must consider that Mallards are infected with a multitude of other microorganisms. Here, Mallards were infected with IAV, gamma coronaviruses, and avian paramyxovirus type 1 simultaneously, and we found a putative synergistic interaction between IAV and gamma coronaviruses.   Mallards occupy the interface between humans, poultry, and wild birds, and are the reservoir of IAV diversity. New incursions of highly pathogenic H 5 viruses to both Europe and North America reaffirms the role of wild birds, particularly waterfowl, in diffusion of viruses spatially.

To assess the genetic variability of RVFV, several isolates from diverse localities of Africa were investigated by means of reverse transcription-PCR followed by direct sequencing of a region of the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genomic segments. Phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of three major lineages corresponding to geographic variants from West Africa, Egypt, and Central-East Africa. However, incongruences detected between the L, M, and S phylogenies suggested that <b>genetic</b> exchange via <b>reassortment</b> occurred between strains from different lineages. This hypothesis, depicted by parallel phylogenies, was further confirmed by statistical tests. Our findings, which strongly suggest exchanges between strains from areas of endemicity in West and East Africa, strengthen the potential existence of a sylvatic cycle in the tropical rain forest. This also emphasizes the risk of generating uncontrolled chimeric viruses by using live attenuated vaccines in areas of endemicity...|$|R
