Wireless channels severely suffer from fading phenomena, which causes unreliability in <b>data</b> <b>decoding.</b> Fundamentally, diversity coding sends multiple copies through multiple transmit antennas, {{so as to}} improve {{the reliability of the}} data reception.

50|$|Another {{method for}} {{reducing}} DSN burdens is the Beacon Monitor experiment. During the long cruise periods of the mission, spacecraft operations are essentially suspended. Instead of data, the craft emits a carrier signal on a predetermined frequency. Without <b>data</b> <b>decoding,</b> the carrier {{can be detected}} by much simpler ground antennas and receivers. If the spacecraft detects an anomaly, it changes the carrier between four tones, based on urgency. Ground receivers then signal operators to divert DSN resources. This prevents skilled operators and expensive hardware from babysitting an unburdened mission operating nominally. A similar system is used on the New Horizons Pluto probe {{to keep costs down}} during its ten-year cruise from Jupiter to Pluto.|$|E

The data is rarely sent in raw form, and is instead [...] "pointed to" [...] by passing in an address to a memory location that holds the <b>data.</b> <b>Decoding</b> this address and getting the data out of the memory takes some time, during which the CPU traditionally would sit idle waiting for the requested data to show up.

30|$|This paper {{investigated}} the PAPR reduction and <b>data</b> <b>decoding</b> performances of a cluster-based modulation and demodulation method called ECM. The ECM method applies a slightly modified SLM to produce low PAPR signals. The PAPR reduction {{performance of the}} ECM method {{is dependent on the}} cluster size and the number of subcarriers. When compared with SLM, the ECM method achieves less PAPR reduction gain, particularly when the number of subcarriers is small. However, with a larger number of subcarriers, both methods produced almost identical PAPR reduction performance. At the receiver, the use of ECM-enabled <b>data</b> <b>decoding</b> with no need for SI estimation and as a result, eliminate the computational complexity of SI estimation. Results showed that the ECM method produced identical BER performance as other methods including when there exists perfect SI estimation and even in the presence of amplifier distortions.|$|E
