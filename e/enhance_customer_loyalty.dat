This paper evaluates the impact of service quality underlying the SERVQUAL model on customer loyalty, with cus-tomer satisfaction mediating these variables. This analytical study is mainly based on the primary data collected through a questionnaire that was personally administered to 422 individuals selected from five local banks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The study’s findings indi-cate that while the respondents evaluate the banks positively overall, there is still room for improvement. Few studies have assessed customer loyalty in Saudi banking.

To use loyalty programs as relationship marketing tactics has become popular and it is frequently used in the grocery retailing industry (Noble & Phillips, 2004). <b>Customer</b> <b>loyalty</b> differences might be influenced by customers’ gender and age (Kuruvilla, Joshi & Shah, 2009; Patterson, 2007). It is expected that females {{tend to be more}} loyal than males, and that older customers tend to be more loyal than younger generations (Patterson, 2007; Ndubisi, 2007). Purpose The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the impact {{of gender and}} age on <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty</b> in the grocery retailing industry.

Conclusion Customers’ gender could be one variable influencing and impacting <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty,</b> however age is not. Gender impacting <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty,</b> could be explained by potential differences in how females and males choose to shop in store as well as by the fact that the majority of the members in the loyalty program were females. <b>Loyalty</b> among <b>customers</b> belonging to different age group did not have any significant differences...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Very little {{research}} has investigated the effects of service quality dimensions on <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty.</b> Also, up to now, no research has investigated the direct effect of expertise on loyalty and the moderating effect of expertise on the link between satisfaction and loyalty. This paper seeks to fill these gaps in the literature and to investigate the effects of individual dimensions of service quality in creating and <b>enhancing</b> <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty</b> via <b>customer</b> satisfaction. It also aims to investigate the direct and indirect effects of customer expertise on <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a causal modelling approach and proposes a conceptual model after an extensive review of the literature.

This study extends previous research by proposing and testing a model that investigates key mediating processes (via trust, satisfaction and identification) that underlie the relationship between virtual community participation and consumer loyalty intentions.

40|$|Existing {{research}} shows that loyalty {{is a function of}} customer perceptions of trust following service recovery. The authors propose a cognitive appraisal model that portrays trust and emotions as key mediators in the relationship between perceived justice and customer loyalty.

Furthermore, while existing research has focused primarily on negative emotion, the authors 2 ̆ 7 model adopts a two-dimensional view of emotion (positive and negative emotions), and the results support the inclusion of both dimensions.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that loyalty includes some degree of pre-dispositional commitment toward a brand. Brand loyalty is viewed as multidimensional construct. It is determined by several distinct psychological processes and it entails multivariate measurements. Customers perceived value, brand trust, customers satisfaction, repeat purchase behavior, and commitment are found to be the key influencing factors of brand loyalty. Commitment and repeated purchase behavior are considered as necessary conditions for brand loyalty followed by perceived value, satisfaction, and brand trust.Fred Reichheld, One of the most influential writers on brand <b>loyalty,</b> claimed that <b>enhancing</b> <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty</b> could have dramatic effects on profitability. However, new research shows that the association between <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty</b> and financial outcomes such as firm profitability and stock-market outcomes is not as straightforward as was once believed. Many firms may overspend on <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty,</b> and then do not reap the intended benefits. Among the benefits from brand loyalty — specifically, longer tenure or staying as a customer for longer — was said to be lower sensitivity to price. This claim had not been empirically tested until recently. Recent research found evidence that longer-term customers were indeed less sensitive to price increases. Byron Sharp showed empirically that behaviour affects attitudinal response not the other way round. Longer term customers are less sensitive because it is harder for them to completely stop using the brand.|$|R
