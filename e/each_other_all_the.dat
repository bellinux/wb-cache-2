25|$|The {{situation}} is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other.

25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was the Final Four {{match for the}} vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship between The Undertaker, Bret Hart, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Vader. In order to be {{eliminated}} from the contest, a wrestler had to be physically thrown over the top rope by an opponent. Hart and Austin, who had a well-known rivalry, started brawling with each other while Undertaker attacked Vader and hit him with a crossbody over the top rope. Undertaker attacked both Hart and Vader. Vader recovered and then hit Undertaker with a steel chair to the outside. Undertaker blocked the chair and drove Vader {{in the chair and}} then the steel steps opening his right eye. Austin bumped Hart and then began working on Undertaker while Hart and Vader punched <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> four men began wrestling on outside as Undertaker crotched Austin. Vader attacked Hart with a steel chair. Undertaker began working on Hart, who eye raked Undertaker and was powerslammed by Undertaker. Vader and Austin attacked each other by hitting steel chairs, steps, bell and even a camera man. Vader applied Hart's own maneuver Sharpshooter on him, but Austin hit Vader with a Lou Thesz Press to break the hold. Vader tried to hit Undertaker a Vaderbomb, but instead went a Vadersault which missed. Hart then put Austin in a fireman's carry and threw him over the top rope, which eliminated him from the match. Hart and Undertaker brawled with each other while Vader recovered in the corner. Paul Bearer interfered and attacked Undertaker while Vader was superplexed by Hart. Despite being eliminated, Austin interfered in the match and attacked Hart. Vader went for a Vaderbomb from the top rope, but Undertaker low blowed Vader and threw him over the top rope. Undertaker and Hart remained the final two participants. He tried to hit a Tombstone on Hart until Austin distracted Undertaker while Hart clotheslined Undertaker over the top rope to win his fourth WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Hunt {{published}} {{her first}} novel, Joy, {{about a woman}} who grew up to join a singing group reminiscent of The Supremes before dying an early death. Set in a posh New York apartment in the course of one day in the spring of 1987, the novel contains frequent flashbacks that describe life in a black neighbourhood in the 1950s and 1960s. The book also deals with stardom in the music business and some people's inability, despite their riches, to make their own American Dream come true and to lead fulfilled lives. Hunt indicates that within her novel, all the characters are victims who are also guilty, a reflection of real life where [...] "e get hurt, but we're also hurting <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time." [...] Hunt wrote Joy while touring England with a group performing Othello and said her fellow actors made fun of her while she was writing the book; given her reputation, she feels, they may have thought her an aspiring Joan Collins. Hunt says Joy is also about the colorism that existed within black society at the time, where girls with fairer skin and longer hair were preferred to girls with kinky hair and more stereotypically Black characteristics. Hunt said that living in England and exploring its accents taught her how beautiful Black language was, a [...] "culturally important" [...] feature she preserved in her novel.|$|E

It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". Fox commented that the pair would make good parents but have [...] "a lot of growing up to do themselves", before adding that she hoped Nancy and Darren would stay together for a long time" [...] as she enjoyed the pairing. On Darren's feelings for Nancy, Dawson said she has [...] "really calmed Darren down. He's totally in love with her". He added that the pair share a [...] "tempestuous relationship, even if it's also very sweet". On Darren's feelings for Nancy, Dawson said: [...] "He's besotted with her. He feels she's good for him and that he almost doesn't deserve her. He feels like a bit of a failure and Nancy is this strong woman who's organised and everything Darren isn't".
