25|$|Some {{of these}} changes also cause changes in {{expression}} patterns of the developmental genes, resulting in different phenotypes. The Floral Genome Project looked at the EST data from various tissues of many flowering plants. The researchers confirmed that the ABC Model of flower development is not conserved across all angiosperms. Sometimes expression domains change, {{as in the case}} of many monocots, and also in some basal angiosperms like Amborella. Different models of flower development like the fading boundaries model, or the overlapping-boundaries model which propose non-rigid domains of expression, may explain these architectures. There is a possibility that from the basal to the modern angiosperms, the domains of floral architecture have <b>gotten</b> <b>more</b> and more fixed through evolution.|$|E

25|$|Mexico {{is ranked}} 10th {{in the world}} for cheese {{production}} and eighth for consumption. Grouped with Argentina and Brazil, Mexico is part of a region which is third in cheese production, behind Europe and the US. Cheese sales in Mexico were 218,000 tons in 2003, with fresh (not aged) cheeses making up over one-third of the market, the largest segment. Only 126,200 tons of the cheese consumed in the country that year were produced domestically, with the rest imported. About 10% of the milk production in the country is dedicated to the making of dairy products, most of which is cheese. The overwhelming majority of cheese is made with cows’ milk. While a number of cheeses are made with goats’ milk, they are not as popular and have <b>gotten</b> <b>more</b> difficult to find in markets. Shepherding, though, historically has never been a major commercial activity nationwide, efforts to since the 1980s to promote sheep milk and meat have resulted in a significant {{rise in the number of}} sheep being raised. This is promoting the development of sheep’s milk cheese in the country, although it still accounts for a very small percentage. One of the major sheep-producing states is Querétaro, with most of the milk destined for cheesemaking.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were [...] mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a string of poorly {{executed}} jokes with some mild successes sprinkled here and there."

500|$|Too Much Too Soon {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{a review of}} the album for Rolling Stone, Dave Marsh hailed the New York Dolls as the leading hard rock band in the US and noted what he felt was Nolan's competent drumming, Johansen's ability to add depth to his characters, and Thunders's innovative guitar playing. Marsh especially praised his playing on [...] "Chatterbox", calling it [...] "a classic", and believed even the most brazen songs sounded successful because Morton's production highlighted the group's more unrefined musical qualities. Writing for Creem magazine, Christgau said the polished sound reproduction preserved the band's raw qualities, {{especially in the case of}} Johansen's vocals and Nolan's drumming, and remarked that Rundgren [...] "should be ashamed—Shadow Morton has <b>gotten</b> <b>more</b> out of the Dolls than they can give us live on any but their best nights." [...] Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times felt Too Much Too Soon was a better-produced album that proved the band to be [...] "the real thing", calling it the best record of derisive punk rock since Exile on Main St. by the Rolling Stones in 1972. In The New Yorker, Ellen Willis wrote that she learned to appreciate Too Much Too Soon more than New York Dolls after seeing the band perform songs from the former album in concert, particularly [...] "Human Being" [...] and [...] "Puss 'n' Boots", while Ron Ross from Phonograph Record magazine said the group's [...] "easy going ironic sensibility" [...] was expressed [...] "far more amusingly and accessibly" [...] here than on their debut album.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{problems}} regarding studies of free will. Particularly in earlier studies, research relied too much on the introspection of the participants, but introspective estimates of event timing were found to be inaccurate. Many brain activity measures have been insufficient and primitive as there is no good independent brain-function measure of the conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions. The conclusions drawn from measurements that have been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings is representing. In other words, the dip might {{have nothing to do with}} unconscious decision, since many other mental processes are going on while performing the task. Some of the research mentioned here has <b>gotten</b> <b>more</b> advanced, however, even recording individual neurons in conscious volunteers. Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected – challenging any versions of [...] "free will" [...] where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.|$|E
