5000|$|Parmenides {{claimed that}} there is <b>no</b> truth <b>in</b> the {{opinions}} of the mortals. Genesis-and-destruction, as Parmenides emphasizes, is a false opinion, because to be means to be completely, once and for all. What <b>exists</b> can <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> not <b>exist.</b> For this view, that That Which Is Not exists, can never predominate. You must debar your thought from this way of search, nor let ordinary experience in its variety force you along this way, (namely, that of allowing) the eye, sightless as it is, and the ear, full of sound, and the tongue, to rule; but (you must) judge by means of the Reason (Logos) the much-contested proof which is expounded by me.

5000|$|The {{writing of}} Heraclitus (c. 535 - c. 475 BC) {{was the first}} place where the word logos was given special {{attention}} in ancient Greek philosophy, Heraclitus held that everything changes and all was fire and conflicting opposites, seemingly unified only by this Logos. He {{is known for his}} obscure sayings. This logos holds always but humans always prove unable to understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this logos, humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep. Diels-Kranz In contrast to Heraclitus, Parmenides held that all is one and nothing changes.

5000|$|The tyranny is ostensibly {{overseen by}} Big Brother, the Party leader who enjoys an intense cult of personality, but {{who may not}} even exist. The Party [...] "seeks power entirely for its own sake. It is not {{interested}} in the good of others; it is interested solely in power." [...] The protagonist of the novel, Winston Smith, {{is a member of the}} Outer Party, who works for the Ministry of Truth (or Minitrue in Newspeak), which is responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism. His job is to rewrite past newspaper articles, so that the historical record always supports the party line. The instructions that the workers receive portray the corrections as fixing misquotations and never as what they really are: forgeries and falsifications. A large part of the Ministry also actively destroys all documents that have not been edited and do not contain the revisions; <b>in</b> this <b>way,</b> <b>no</b> proof <b>exists</b> that the government is lying. Smith is a diligent and skillful worker but secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion against Big Brother. The heroine of the novel, Julia, is based on Orwell's second wife, Sonia Orwell.|$|R
