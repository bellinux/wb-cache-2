40|$|Process {{designs and}} {{economics}} {{were developed to}} produce LNG and liquid carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) from landfill gas (LFG) using the Acrion CO{sub 2 } wash process. The patented Acrion CO{sub 2 } wash process uses liquid CO{sub 2 } to absorb contaminants from the LFG. The process steps are compression, drying, CO{sub 2 } wash contaminant removal and CO{sub 2 } recovery, residual CO{sub 2 } removal and methane liquefaction. Three flowsheets were developed using different residual CO{sub 2 } removal schemes. These included physical solvent absorption (methanol), membranes and molecular sieves. The capital and operating costs of the flowsheets were very similar. The LNG production cost was around ten cents per gallon. In parallel with process flowsheet development, the business aspects of an eventual commercial project have been explored. The process {{was found to have}} significant potential commercial application. The business plan effort investigated the economics of LNG transportation, <b>fueling,</b> <b>vehicle</b> conversion, and markets. The commercial value of liquid CO{sub 2 } was also investigated. This Phase 1 work, March 1998 through February 1999, was funded under Brookhaven National laboratory contract 725089 under the research program entitled ``Liquefied Natural Gas as a Heavy Vehicle Fuel. '' The Phase 2 effort will develop flowsheets for the following: (1) CO{sub 2 } and pipeline gas production, with the pipeline methane being liquefied at a peak shaving site, (2) sewage digester gas as an alternate feedstock to LFG and (3) the use of mixed refrigerants for process cooling. Phase 2 will also study the modification of Acrion's process demonstration unit for the production of LNG and a market site for LNG production...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we have {{investigated}} the cost-effectiveness of alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> as a measure for CO 2 reduction. Computed {{results indicate that the}} installation of alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> is much more expensive than fuel switching in industry or the power generation sector. However, some economic incentives will make the price go down to the level at which alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> are competitive with conventional vehicles. At the same time, mass production makes their prices go down although it is rather expensive at present. Then we developed the scenarios in which CO 2 emissions could be stabilized at the level in 1990. In the higher demand case (1. 2 %/yr.), it is indispensable to introduce alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> into the market. Our model selects electric vehicles and compressed natural gas vehicles as cost-effective options. In the scenario where carbon tax revenue is not offset by subsidy, we have to impose prohibitively high carbon tax to suppress CO 2. However, CO 2 emission can be suppressed by a reasonable carbon tax if the tax revenue is returned to the market to subsidize alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their infrastructures...|$|R

The rate of introduction of alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> will be an important influence on the time path of fuel use and emissions, and the sustainability of transportation patterns. The Transitional Alternative <b>Fuels</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (TAFV) Model simulates the use and cost of alternative fuels and alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> over the time period of 1996 to 2010.

As a dynamic transitional model, it can help to assess what may be necessary to reach mature, large scale, alternative <b>fuel</b> and <b>vehicle</b> markets, and what it may cost.
