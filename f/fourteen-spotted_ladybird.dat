40|$|We {{examined}} {{the interaction between}} the <b>fourteen-spotted</b> <b>ladybird</b> beetle, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (L.), and the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), on two grasses with divergent leaf architectures. Like wheat, crested wheatgrass bears flat, broad leaves, whereas Indian ricegrass produces slender, tightly rolled leaves. In the absence of aphid prey, residence times and time budgets of larvae and adults of P. quatuordecimpunctata were similar on the two hosts, although larvae tended to remain longer on crested wheatgrass. When aphids were present, both predator stages dislodged, contacted, and captured aphids at higher rates on Indian ricegrass than on crested wheatgrass. Predator time budgets and behavior sequences also reflected a greater predation risk for D. noxia on Indian ricegrass, and were consistent with earlier, population-level experiments in the field. Comparisons between aphid-free and aphid-infested plants suggest that the effect of host plant in this tri-trophic system largely depended on differences in the availability of prey refuges rather than on differences in predator searching behavior; proportionally more aphids fed in exposed locations on Indian ricegrass than on crested wheatgrass. Plant architecture is likely to be {{an important component of the}} predation risk of D. noxia because of the aphid 2 Ì† 7 s tendency to feed in relatively concealed locations...|$|E
40|$|Mutual {{interference}} involves direct {{interactions between}} individuals {{of the same}} species that may alter their foraging success. Larvae of aphidophagous coccinellids typically stay within a patch during their lifetime, displaying remarkable aggregation to their prey. Thus, as larvae are exposed to each other, frequent encounters may affect their foraging success. A study was initiated {{in order to determine the}} effect of mutual interference in the coccinellids' feeding rate. One to four 4 th larval instars of the <b>fourteen-spotted</b> <b>ladybird</b> beetle Propylea quatuordecimpunctata were exposed for 6 hours into plastic containers with different densities of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, on potted Vicia faba plants. The data were used to fit a purely prey-dependent Holling type II model and its alternatives which account for interference competition and have thus far been underutilized, i. e. the Beddington-DeAngelis, the Crowley-Martin and a modified Hassell-Varley model. The Crowley-Martin mechanistic model appeared to be slightly better among the competing models. The results showed that although the feeding rate became approximately independent of predator density at high prey density, some predator dependence in the coccinellid's functional response was observed at the low prey-high predator density combination. It appears that at low prey densities, digestion breaks are negligible so that the predators do waste time interfering with each other, whereas at high prey densities time loss during digestion breaks may fully accommodate the cost of interference, so that the time cost may be negligible...|$|E
