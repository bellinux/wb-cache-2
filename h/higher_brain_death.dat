For a definition of death to succeed is important that it is a universal definition and that under it, all human beings are correctly identified as alive or dead.

40|$|The {{possible}} symmetry {{between the}} concepts of brain death and brain birth (life) is explored. Since the symmetry argument has tended to overlook the most appropriate definition of brain death, the fundamental concepts of whole brain death and <b>higher</b> <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> are assessed. In this way, a context is provided {{for a discussion of}} brain birth. Different writers have placed brain birth at numerous points: 25 - 40 days, eight weeks, 22 - 24 weeks, and 32 - 36 weeks gestation. For others, the concept itself is open to question. Apart from this, it needs to be asked whether a unitary concept is an oversimplification. The merits of defining two stages of brain birth, to parallel the two definitions of brain death, are discussed. An attempt is then made to map these various stages of brain birth and brain death onto a developmental continuum. Although the results hold biological interest, their ethical significance is less evident. Development and degeneration are not interchangeable, and definitions of death apply specifically to those who are dying, not those who are developing. I conclude that while a dual concept of brain death has proved helpful, a dual concept of brain birth still has problems, and the underlying concept of brain birth itself continues to be elusive...|$|E
40|$|Organ {{donation}} after <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> {{provides the}} most important source for deceased organs for transplantation, both {{because of the number}} of potential organ donors that it makes available and also because of the unparalleled viability of the organs retrieved.

40|$|BACKGROUND: After kidney transplantation, {{decreased}} graft {{survival is}} seen in grafts from brain dead (BD) donors compared with living donors. This might result partly from a progressive nonspecific inflammation in the graft. In this study, we focused {{on the effects of}} BD on inflammatory response (adhesion molecules, leukocyte invasion, gene expression) and stress-related heat shock proteins in the human kidney. Research outcomes and clinical donor parameters were then linked to outcome data after transplantation. METHODS: Kidney biopsy specimens and serum were obtained during organ retrieval from BD and living organ donor controls. Immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were performed on the biopsy specimens. Clinical and laboratory parameters from BD donors were recorded and connected to outcome data of the recipients of the kidneys studied. RESULTS: After <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> immunohistochemistry showed an increase of E-selectin (P< 0. 01) and interstitial leukocyte invasion (P< 0. 05) compared with controls. Also, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed a threefold increased heme oxygenase- 1 (P< 0. 05) and Hsp 70 (P< 0. 01) gene expression after BD. Levels of monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 and transforming growth factor-beta were twice as <b>high</b> after <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> but did not reach significance. Transplantation outcome was influenced by several donor variables: positively most notably by donor treatment with desmopressin and negatively by high serum urea levels during <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> and by <b>high</b> intercellular adhesion molecule and vascular cell adhesion molecule expression in the kidney. Heme oxygenase- 1 proved to have a protective function, but only in kidneys from living donors. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of interstitial leukocytes and the early adhesion molecule E-selectin in BD donor kidneys indicates an early-phase inflammatory process during organ retrieval. Elevated levels of monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 and transforming growth factor-beta suggest a role for monocytes/macrophages in this phase. We suggest that BD causes a stress-related response against which protective heat shock proteins are formed in the future graft. This stress response may be too severe to be fully counteracted by elevated heat shock proteins. Which systemic and/or local factors trigger brain death-related graft injury is currently under investigation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> is {{associated}} with a severe inflammation that can compromise the quality of the kidneys as well as other organs. <b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> derived organs have a lower survival rate compared to living donors, mainly because of an increased rate of chronic rejection.

40|$|Objectiveβ-Adrenergic {{receptor}} desensitization through {{activation of}} the G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2 is an important mechanism of early cardiac dysfunction after <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> We hypothesized that acute β-blockade can prevent myocardial β-adrenergic receptor desensitization after <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> through attenuation of G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2 activity, resulting in improved cardiac function. MethodsAdult pigs underwent either sham operation, induction of <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> or treatment with esmolol (β-blockade) for 30 minutes before and 45 minutes after <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> (n = 8 per group). Cardiac function was assessed at baseline and for 6 hours after the operation. Myocardial β-adrenergic receptor signaling was assessed 6 hours after operation by measuring sarcolemmal membrane adenylate cyclase activity, β-adrenergic receptor density, and G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2 expression and activity. ResultsBaseline left ventricular preload recruitable stroke work was similar among sham, <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> and β-blockade groups. Preload recruitable stroke work was significantly decreased 6 hours after <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> versus sham, and β-blockade resulted in maintenance of baseline preload recruitable stroke work relative to <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> and not different from sham. Basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were preserved in the β-blockade group relative to the <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> group and were not different from the sham group. Left ventricular G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2 expression and activity in the β-blockade group were markedly decreased relative to the <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> group and similar to the sham group. β-Adrenergic receptor density was not different among groups.

40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> {{can have}} an impact on donor organ function. This is often {{attributed}} to an altered hormonal, mainly thyroidal, status after <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> A second possible explanation is that during the <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> process, blood flow is redistributed, causing ischemic damage in underperfused organs or regions. We investigated blood flow redistribution with colored microspheres in the rat early and late after <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> induced by inflation of an intracranial balloon, and correlated this with the global hemodynamic situation and plasma catecholamine concentrations. <b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> was proven by the demonstration of lasting absence of brain perfusion in all animals. Myocardial blood flow closely followed the myocardial oxygen need as estimated by the rate-pressure product. The abdominal organs showed intense vasoconstriction early after <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> which led to significantly decreased perfusion of these organs despite the highly increased perfusion pressure, followed by significant vasodilation.

MethodsEighteen Yorkshire pigs (50 - 60 kg) were instrumented with a left ventricular conductance catheter. Cytokine expression, preload recruitable stroke work, and the diastolic relaxation constant tau were measured at baseline and at hourly intervals for 6 hours after induction of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> by intracranial balloon inflation (<b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> n =  6) or sham operation (control, n =  6).

Myocardial water content was measured after the animals were killed. ResultsSix hours after induction of <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> tumor necrosis factor and interleukin- 6 were highest in the brain death group (106 ± 13. 1 pg/mL and 301 ± 181 pg/mL, respectively), lowest in controls (68. 3 ± 8. 55 pg/mL and 37. 8 ± 11 pg/mL, respectively), and intermediate in the <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> + hemoadsorption group (81. 2 ± 35. 2 pg/mL and 94. 6 ± 20 pg/mL, respectively). Compared with controls, preload recruitable stroke work was significantly reduced in the <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> group 4 hours after the induction of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> and was 50 % of baseline by 5 hours. In the <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> + hemoadsorption group, preload recruitable stroke work was relatively preserved at 80 % of baseline at similar time points.

RESULTS: Heart rate variability in the respiratory frequency range significantly increased, whereas in the low-frequency range it tended to decrease after <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> Systolic and diastolic blood pressure variability up to 0. 18 Hz largely disappeared, but stayed unchanged in the respiratory frequency range. High-dose combined phentolamine and propranolol pretreatment induced a haemodynamic picture comparable to the situation seen after <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> without pharmacological intervention. <b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> did not further deteriorate the haemodynamic situation after combined pretreatment.

40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> {{results in}} cardiac injury and hemodynamic instability. After <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> {{catecholamine}} levels surge {{in concert with}} increased expression of select myocardial gene products. Sympathetic blockade was used to investigate {{the effects of the}} adrenergic nervous system on myocardial gene expression in a rabbit model of <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> Methods: A balloon expansion model of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> in rabbits (n = 42) was used with and without sympathetic blockade (xylazine, acetylpromazine, and ketamine). Sham-operated and naive rabbits served as control animals. Over 4 hours, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, electrocardiographic results, catecholamine levels, myocardial histology, and messenger RNA levels were assessed. Results: Sympathetic blockade decreased basal catecholamine levels and blocked the catecholamine surge accompanying <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> The typical hemodynamic instability, adverse electrocardiographic changes, and myocellular injury associated with <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> were all significantly decreased. Sympathetic blockade not only suppressed the previously reported increases in myocardial gene expression (cardiac and skeletal α-actin, egr- 1, and heat shock protein 70) but also suppressed the expression of multiple other genes (α and β myosin heavy chain, calcium ATPase [sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-adenosine triphosphatase pump, SERCA- 2 a], phospholamban [ryanodine receptor], and c-jun).

We evaluated {{the role of the}} microcirculation in the hemodynamic and inflammatory events that occur after <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> and the effects of autonomic storm inhibition via thoracic epidural blockade on mesenteric microcirculatory changes and inflammatory responses. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. <b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> was induced via intracranial balloon inflation. Bupivacaine (brain death-thoracic epidural blockade group) or saline (<b>brain</b> <b>death</b> group) infusion via an epidural catheter was initiated immediately before <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> induction. Sham-operated animals were used as controls (SH group). The mesenteric microcirculation was analyzed via intravital microscopy, and the expression of adhesion molecules was evaluated via immunohistochemistry 180 min after <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> induction. RESULTS: A significant difference in mean arterial pressure behavior was observed between the brain death-thoracic epidural blockade group and the other groups, indicating that the former group experienced autonomic storm inhibition. However, the proportion of perfused small vessels in the brain death-thoracic epidural blockade group was similar to or lower than that in the <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> and SH groups, respectively. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was similar between the brain death-thoracic epidural blockade and <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> groups but was significantly lower in the SH group than in the other two groups. The number of migrating leukocytes in the perivascular tissue followed the same trend for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although thoracic epidural blockade effectively inhibited the autonomic storm, it did not affect mesenteric hypoperfusion or inflammation induced by <b>brain</b> <b>death...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> {{is defined}} as the permanent, {{irreversible}} and concurrent loss of all brain and brain stem functions. <b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and it is not routine to use paraclinical studies. In some countries, electroencephalogram (EEG) is performed in all patients for the determination of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> while there is some skepticism in relying on EEG as a confirmatory test for <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> diagnosis. In this study, we assessed the validity of EEG and its abnormalities in <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> diagnosis. In this retrospective study, we used 153 EEGs from medical records of 89 <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> patients in organ procurement unit of the Iranian Tissue Bank admitted during 2002 - 2008. We extracted and analyzed information including EEGs, which were examined by a neurologist for waves, artifacts and EEG abnormalities. The mean age of the patients was 27. 2 &plusmn; 12. 7 years. The most common cause of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> was multiple traumas due to accident (65 %). The most prevalent artifact was electrical transformer. 125 EEGs (82 %) were isoelectric (ECS) and seven EEGs (5 %) were depictive of some cerebral activity which upon repeat EEGs, they showed ECS patterns too. There was no relationship between cause of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> and cerebral activity in EEGs of the patients. In this study, we could confirm ECS patterns in all <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> patients whose status had earlier been diagnosed clinically. Considering the results of this study, it seems sensible to perform EEG as a final confirmatory test as an assurance to the patients' families...|$|R
5|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total loss of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> varies geographically and is not always accepted. In some countries {{there is also a}} defined syndrome of brainstem <b>death.</b> Declaration of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will be associated with the withdrawal of life support, and as those with <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if color flow duplex scanning (CFDS) {{can be used}} for rapid confirmation of presumed <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> Design: Pilot cohort study comparison of CFDS with radionuclide cerebral scanning (RCS) as the criterion standard. Setting: Community-based level I trauma center intensive care unit. Patients: Twenty-four patients who satisfied criteria for presumed <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> Main Outcome Measure: Confirmation of presumed <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> Results: CFDS correctly identified 16 of 24 patients as brain dead, confirmed by RCS. Eight patients with brain flow on RCS were also correctly identified by CFDS. Only two of 24 patients survived their severe injuries. Conclusions: CFDS provides a uniform, cost-effective diagnostic tool for rapid confirmation of clinical <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> with 100 % accuracy. Its use should complement RCS, given its rapid interpretation, portability, and economical assessment of presumed <b>brain</b> <b>death...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> on inflammatory response {{and the effects of}} <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> on liver function both directly after explantation and after reoxygenation. Methods: The influence of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> on liver function was studied in rats using a <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> model and the liver slice model to mimic reoxygenation. Liver function was assessed by measuring the ATP content and the ATP-driven urea synthesis. The activation of non-parenchymal cells was studied by measuring mRNA levels of IL- 10, cytokine production (IL- 10 and IL- 1 beta) and inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) upregulation (mRNA) and protein level. Results: <b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> had no direct influence on the ATP content of the liver. However, it led to induction of several cytokines because of activation of non-parenchymal cells, which led to upregulation of iNOS and to nitric oxide metabolites production. It is known that cytokine production may influence the drug metabolism capacity; however, no influence of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> on drug metabolism was observed. An explanation may be the relatively short experimental period. Conclusions: Kupffer cells seem to be activated during the onset of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> induction; however, they become quiescent when liver slices of brain dead rats were reoxygenated during incubation. Other non-parenchymal cells, possibly the endothelial cells, remain activated during incubation and reoxygenation in slices from <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> donors but not in slices from control livers. Future experiments in our rat liver transplantation model need to elucidate the implications of these findings...|$|R
40|$|Brain dead-derived kidney grafts have {{inferior}} transplantation outcomes {{compared to}} living donated kidneys. Factors leading to inferior organ quality are diminished organ perfusion and pro-inflammatory changes during the <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> period. The protective heat shock proteins (HSPs) {{are known to}} be up-regulated, {{but at the end of}} <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> To reduce the brain death-related kidney injury, we want to increase the Hsp 72 expression at the start of <b>brain</b> <b>death.</b> In this study we investigated whether geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a Hsp 72 inducer, can reduce the pro-inflammatory changes and improve kidney donor quality in an in vivo <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> rat model. Male F 344 rats (275 - 300 g, n= 15) underwent slow induction of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> and were kept brain dead for 4 hours. We administered GGA (400 mg/kg orally) or a saline vehicle 20 h and 1 h prior to <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> induction. Sham-operated animals (n= 14) received the same treatment. At the moment of organ retrieval, the expressions of Hsp 72 or other HSPs are not increased by GGA. However, kidney interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) mRNA levels in GGA pre-treated brain dead rats were lower compared to saline-treated controls. Systemic ASAT levels were also reduced by GGA, indicating decreased inflammation. These results suggest that GGA reduces pro-inflammation during the <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> period, despite the unchanged expression of Hsp 72. To further explore the benefits of GGA on organ quality, we would need to transplant the GGA pre-treated <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> kidneys. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a translatable <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> animal model has significant potential to advance not only transplant research, but also {{the understanding of the}} pathophysiologic changes that occur in <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> and severe traumatic brain injury. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe a rhesus macaque model of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> designed to simulate the average time and medical management described in the human literature. Following approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, a <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> model was developed. Non-human primates were monitored and maintained for 20 hours after <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> induction. Vasoactive agents and fluid boluses were administered to maintain hemodynamic stability. Endocrine derangements, particularly diabetes insipidus, were aggressively managed. A total of 9 rhesus macaque animals were included in the study. The expected hemodynamic instability of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> in a rostral to caudal fashion was documented in terms of blood pressure and heart rate changes. During the maintenance phase of <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> the animal's temperature and hemodynamics were maintained with goals of mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mmHg and heart rate within 20 beats per minute of baseline. Resuscitation protocols are described so that future investigators may reproduce this model. We have developed a reproducible large animal primate model of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> which simulates clinical scenarios and treatment. Our model offers the opportunity for researchers to have translational model to test the efficacy of therapeutic strategies prior to human clinical trials...|$|R
