5|$|Switzerland {{has five}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 43% of its electricity around 2007 (34% in 2015). Some Swiss {{spent nuclear fuel}} has been sent for reprocessing in France and the United Kingdom; most fuel is being stored without reprocessing. An industry-owned organization, ZWILAG, built and operates a central <b>interim</b> <b>storage</b> facility for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, and for conditioning low-level radioactive waste and for incinerating wastes. Other <b>interim</b> <b>storage</b> facilities predating ZWILAG continue to operate in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{electric}} utilities have been transporting spent fuel to <b>interim</b> <b>storage</b> facilities at Gorleben, Lubmin and Ahaus until temporary storage facilities {{can be built}} near reactor sites. Previously, spent fuel was sent to France or the United Kingdom for reprocessing, but this practice was ended in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen nuclear {{reactors}} produce about 3% of India’s electricity, and seven more are under construction. Spent fuel is processed at facilities in Trombay near Mumbai, at Tarapur {{on the west}} coast north of Mumbai, and at Kalpakkam on the southeast coast of India. Plutonium will be used in a fast breeder reactor (under construction) to produce more fuel, and other waste vitrified at Tarapur and Trombay. <b>Interim</b> <b>storage</b> for 30 years is expected, with eventual disposal in a deep geological repository in crystalline rock near Kalpakkam.|$|E
40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) {{currently}} owns {{several hundred}} {{metric tons of}} aluminum clad, spent nuclear fuel and target assemblies. The vast majority of these irradiated assemblies are currently stored in water basins that were designed and operated for short term fuel cooling prior to fuel reprocessing. Recent DOE decisions to severely limit the reprocessing option have significantly lengthened the time of storage, thus increasing the tendency for corrosion induced degradation of the fuel cladding and the underlying core material. The portent of continued corrosion, coupled with the age of existing wet storage facilities {{and the cost of}} continuing basin operations, including necessary upgrades to meet current facility standards, may force the DOE to transition these wet stored, aluminum clad spent fuels to <b>interim</b> dry <b>storage.</b> The facilities for <b>interim</b> dry <b>storage</b> have not been developed, partially because fuel storage requirements and specifications for acceptable fuel forms are lacking. In spite of the lack of both facilities and specifications, current plans are to dry store fuels for approximately 40 to 60 years or until firm decisions are developed for final fuel disposition. The transition of the aluminum clad fuels from wet to <b>interim</b> dry <b>storage</b> will require a sequence of drying and canning operations which will include selected fuel preparations such as vacuum drying and conditioning of the storage atmosphere. Laboratory experiments and review of the available literature have demonstrated that successful <b>interim</b> dry <b>storage</b> may also require the use of fuel and canister cleaning or rinsing techniques that preclude, or at least minimize, the potential for the accumulation of chloride and other potentially deleterious ions in the dry storage environment. This paper summarizes an evaluation of the impact of fuel transitioning techniques on the potential for corrosion induced degradation of fuel forms during <b>interim</b> dry <b>storage...</b>|$|R

25|$|Local residents, however, {{were seriously}} divided. Those {{who would like}} to return to their houses, were afraid, that an interim-storage might prove to be a very {{permanent}} storage, and would make any return impossible. But others had already accepted the fact, that the radiation-levels around their former houses would be too high, and would make living there impractical for a long time.

25|$|The {{financial}} costs of every {{nuclear power plant}} continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as greenfield status. After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor core materials are dismantled and {{cut into small pieces}} to be packed in containers for <b>interim</b> <b>storage</b> or transmutation experiments. The consensus on how to approach the task is one that is relatively inexpensive, but {{it has the potential to}} be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.|$|E
40|$|<b>Interim</b> dry <b>storage</b> of spent {{nuclear fuel}} (SNF) rods is of {{critical}} concern because a shortage of existing SNF wet storage capacity combined with delays in {{the availability of a}} permanent disposal repository has led to an increasing number of SNF rods being placed into <b>interim</b> dry <b>storage.</b> Safe <b>interim</b> dry <b>storage</b> must be maintained for a minimum of twenty years according to the Standard Review Plan for Dry Cask Storage Systems [1] and the Code of Federal Regulations, 10 CFR Part 72 [2]. <b>Interim</b> dry <b>storage</b> licensees must meet certain safety conditions when storing SNF rods to ensure that there is a ''very low probability (e. g. 0. 5 %) of cladding breach during long-term storage'' [1]. Commercial SNF typically consists of uranium oxide pellets surrounded by a thin cladding. The cladding is usually an {alpha}-zirconium based alloy know as ''Zircaloy''. In dry storage, the SNF rods are confined in one of several types of cask systems approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). ''The cask system must be designed to prevent degradation of fuel cladding that results in a type of cladding breach, such as axial-splits or ductile fracture, where irradiated UO{sub 2 } particles may be released. In addition, the fuel cladding should not degrade to the point where more than one percent of the fuel rods suffer pinhole or hairline crack type failure under normal storage conditions [1]. '' The NRC has approved two models [3, 4] for use by proposed dry storage licensees to determine the maximum initial temperature limit for nuclear fuel rods in dry storage that supposedly meet the above criteria and yield consistent temperature limits. Though these two models are based on the same fundamental failure theory, different assumptions have been made including the choice of values for material constants in the failure equation. This report will examine and compare the similarities and inconsistencies of these two models. It will illustrate some of the shortcomings of the current models and suggest modifications as well as some experiments that should be started in the near future. This report will also discuss changes in the current NRC standards with regard to the adoption of a strain-based model to be used to determine maximum allowable temperatures of the SNF...|$|R

40|$|VKTA {{decommissioned}} the old {{nuclear facilities}} of former GDR's (German Democratic Republic) Central Institute of Nuclear Research which was closed end of 1991.

The period from 1982 to about 1997 was mainly characterized by obtaining the necessary licenses for decommissioning and developing a new infrastructure (i. e. waste treatment facility, <b>interim</b> <b>storages</b> for fissile material and waste, clearance monitoring facility). The decommissioning work has been in progress since that time. The decommissioning projects are concentrated on three complexes: (1) the reactors and a fuel development and testing facility, (2) the radioisotope production facilities, and (3) the former liquid and solid waste storage facilities.

2500|$|Questions {{concerning}} {{the constitutionality of}} the <b>interim</b> <b>storage</b> provision, 25524.1(b), however, are not ripe for review. While the waste disposal statute operates on a statewide basis, the Energy Commission is directed to make determinations under 25524.1(b) on a case-by-case basis. As the Court of Appeals explained, because [...] "we cannot know whether the Energy Commission will ever find a nuclear plant's storage capacity to be inadequate," [...] judicial consideration of this provision should await further developments. 16 [...] Furthermore, because we hold today that 25524.2 is not pre-empted by federal law, there is little likelihood that industry behavior would be uniquely affected by whatever uncertainty surrounds the <b>interim</b> <b>storage</b> provisions. In these circumstances, a court should not stretch to reach an early, and perhaps premature, decision respecting 25524.1(b).|$|E

40|$|The end of {{the cold}} war has {{resulted}} in the shutdown of nuclear weapons production and the start of dismantlement of significant numbers of nuclear weapons. This, in turn, is creating an inventory of plutonium requiring <b>interim</b> and long-term <b>storage.</b> A key question is, ``What is required for safe, multidecade, plutonium storage?`` The requirements for storage, in turn, define what is needed to stabilize the plutonium from its current condition into a form acceptable for <b>interim</b> and long-term <b>storage.</b> Storage requirements determine if research is required to (1) define required technical conditions for <b>interim</b> and long-term <b>storage</b> and (2) develop or improve current stabilization technologies. Storage requirements depend upon technical, policy, and economic factors. The technical issues are complicated by several factors. Plutonium in aerosol form is highly hazardous. Plutonium in water is hazardous. The plutonium inventory is in multiple chemical forms [...] some of which are chemically reactive. Also, some of the existing storage forms are clearly unsuitable for storage periods over a few years. Gas generation by plutonium compounds complicates storage: (1) all plutonium slowly decays creating gaseous helium and (2) the radiation from plutonium decay can initiate many chemical reactions-some of which generate significant quantities of gases. Gas generation can pressurize sealed storage packages. Last nuclear criticality must be avoided...|$|R

40|$|Criteria for <b>interim</b> dry <b>storage</b> of DOE owned spent nuclear fuels will {{be based}} on a {{combination}} of technical, regulatory, and political requirements. These requirements have not been fully established but will include issues such as the necessity for monitoring the fuel, retrievability of the fuel, maintenance of final disposal options, siting of interim disposal facilities (will the fuels at each site remain on that site throughout the interim disposal period?), and interfacing with the International Atomic Energy Agency over inspectability of the highly enriched fuels in the inventory. Regardless of the other requirement issues, the technical storage criteria are likely to vary with fuel type and will include: (a) a fuel specific maximum storage temperature coupled to; (b) a specific storage environment (for example, Helium gas with less than xx ppm moisture); (c) a mass limit for fissionable isotopes; and (d) provisions for prestorage characterization and, if necessary, segregation of the fuel based on the established condition of the fuel. Each of these criteria has several associated technical issues and there are significant interactions among the criteria.
