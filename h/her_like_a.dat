5|$|Cheenu {{returns the}} next day and, after paying a huge sum to the madam, takes Vijaya out, {{supposedly}} on a pleasure trip. He takes her away to Ketti, where he is working as a school teacher. He takes her to his residence, where he protects her and also pampers <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child. Viji, as she is called by Cheenu, has completely forgotten her past and becomes very close to him. When Viji accidentally spills ink over Cheenu's documents, angering him, their relationship is threatened, but they reconcile. Later, a local woodcutter named Nataraj lusts for Viji and nearly assaults her, but she manages to save herself. When she tells Cheenu about it, he becomes livid with rage and almost kills Nataraj, but is stopped by his neighbours who were informed of the incident by Viji. Meanwhile, the wife of Cheenu's headmaster is attracted to Cheenu, though he does not reciprocate her feelings.|$|E
5|$|Suzy and Doc are {{attracted}} to each other; she has in fact been quietly tidying his rooms while he is down at the tide pool catching specimens ("The Man I Used to Be"). Fauna tries to persuade Doc, who is very successful with the ladies, to woo Suzy. When Doc is dismissive, Fauna explains {{that she wants to}} get Suzy out of the Bear Flag when it is taken over for the night by a private party. Doc agrees to take Suzy out and treat <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lady. Fauna goes back to the Bear Flag ("Sweet Thursday"), and works to give Suzy confidence ("Suzy is a Good Thing"). Doc and Suzy's date is the source of great interest to the people of Cannery Row. Both are nervous; Doc wears an unaccustomed necktie, while Suzy tries to act like a lady, but her polish wears thin at times. ("All At Once You Love Her"). At the end of the meal, they decide to continue the evening on a secluded sand dune.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
60|$|And then, shaking <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{electric}} shock, came a {{voice that}} she knew--the pleasant voice of Mr Vince.|$|R
60|$|But Anne {{continued}} to face Mrs. Rachel undauntedly, head up, eyes blazing, hands clenched, passionate indignation exhaling from <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> atmosphere.|$|R
60|$|All {{this came}} out of <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{unctuous}} trickle of some acrid oil. The low, voluble delivery was enough by itself to compel my attention.|$|R
5|$|Stanton wanted EVE {{to be at}} {{the higher}} end of technology, and asked iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E
25|$|While Callie Rose is in hospital, Tobey {{gets a new}} job at TFTM (Thanks for the Memories), the Dowds' restaurant. He meets Rebecca, Vanessa Dowd's daughter. Rebecca {{loves his}} company, as he treats <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> person, unlike other boys, who are {{interested}} only in her family and money. Tobey eventually goes out with her but is confused between her and Callie Rose.|$|E
25|$|Peniston {{has acted}} in {{theatrical}} productions such plays as The Wiz, Treat <b>Her</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Lady or When a Woman's Fed Up, and later also wrapped up shooting two independent {{films of the}} same genre (both released on Maverick Spirit in 2005). The first of them, Don't Touch if You Ain't Prayed, featured gospel music performed by Peniston herself, while the second, Pastor Jones, was another urban film appealing to the Christian market.|$|E

50|$|Nene is Sumire's female {{cousin who}} always tries {{to look out}} for <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> older sister. She often {{encourages}} her younger brother Riku in his attempts to ask Sumire out on a date.|$|R
50|$|Animation - Musical Interlude: A {{picture of}} Rodin's The Kiss appears, with the {{addition}} of several small holes along the woman's leg. The woman straightens her leg out, and the man plays <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ocarina.|$|R
25|$|Agnes, {{her sister}} Mary, {{and their mother}} all try to keep {{expenses}} low and bring in extra money, but Agnes is frustrated that everyone treats <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child. To prove herself and to earn money, she is determined to get a position as a governess. Eventually, she obtains a recommendation from a well-placed acquaintance, is offered a position, and secures her parents' permission. With some misgivings, she travels to Wellwood house {{to work for the}} Bloomfield family.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with {{her arms and legs}} completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E
25|$|Poor old Keeper, Emily's {{faithful}} {{friend and}} worshipper, {{seemed to understand}} <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> human being. One evening, when the four friends were sitting closely round {{the fire in the}} sitting-room, Keeper forced himself in between Charlotte and Emily and mounted himself on Emily’s lap; finding the space too limited for his comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guest’s knees, making himself quite comfortable. Emily’s heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to Keeper’s preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keeper—make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room. Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emily’s funeral and never recovered his cheerfulness.|$|E
6000|$|But Gyp {{stood looking}} down. Would it be relief to pour her soul out? Would it? His brown eyes {{questioned}} <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old dog's. She {{did not want}} to hurt one so kind. And yet--impossible! ...|$|R
6000|$|She found words {{difficult}} at the moment. His face and voice dazzled <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> open door towards sunshine, {{and after a}} moment's pause she looked round the room, saying: [...] "It's going to be fine." ...|$|R

25|$|In Montfermeil, the duplicitous innkeepers, the Thénardiers, use Cosette as {{a servant}} and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by {{claiming}} that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, Éponine. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly ("Castle on a Cloud"). The Thénardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and {{live a life of}} criminal depravity ("Master of the House"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Thénardiers payment to adopt her ("The Bargain"). The Thénardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris ("The Waltz of Treachery").|$|E
25|$|A {{little girl}} {{introduced}} in volume 4, Nirvana {{is not all}} she appears to be. She is Indian and is first seen as a child who Ah-Gi has taken to kill and make into food. Bi-Ryu and Ah-Rin show up {{just in time to}} save her, though she shows no fear towards the man. He believes her to be a mute, as she has not spoken since he abducted her. Later, after meeting Bi Ryu's Party she speaks slowly with future predictions, accurately predicting Yhun Ah-Rin kicking Bi Ryu. It is also known that she apparently is wanted, as a group of assassins intrude upon Bi-Ryu's party and attempt to kill them to take Nirvana. She seems to like Cho Ryung, as she hugs <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stuffed animal a lot (She's also {{the only one who can}} understand what Cho Ryung says). She carries the memory of the former heads of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, Parvati.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he bared his teeth and barked and growled at <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something {{he did not like}} he made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E

5000|$|Hawks {{then turned}} to Rosalind Russell. During filming, Russell noticed that Hawks treated <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> also-ran, so she confronted him: [...] "You don't want me, do you? Well, you're stuck with me, so {{you might as well}} make the most of it." ...|$|R
500|$|Producer Barry Rosen said, [...] "We {{were very}} lucky that [...] were so human-grounded, {{so we could}} really play off of them {{and the way they}} looked at things that [...] went through. They were also able to get into real-life situations, romances, getting in trouble, jealousies and so on." [...] Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch like a young boy, while Kirsch seemed to <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> younger brother because of his {{youthful}} appearance.|$|E
500|$|Christy's role as {{a villain}} has been widely praised by {{television}} commentators, though Patterson's performance {{was the subject of}} negative criticism. Spanos placed Christy as number three on its list of 161 of the series' antagonist as rated by scariness. Demain praised Christy as an interesting character following the reveal that she was secretly working for the Triad. Gavin Hetherington, on the other hand, wrote he was indifferent about Christy, and found Billie to be the stronger character of the two. The story arc was criticized by Digital Spys Hugh Armitage, who felt it was weakened by Patterson's [...] "habit of pulling 'evil' faces when no one could see <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pantomime villain". Jon Langmead of PopMatters summarized Patterson's acting as [...] "huff and puff through her on-camera time".|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Anthony {{takes an}} {{interest}} to Amira Masood (Preeya Kalidas), Amira states in EastEnders to Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) that Anthony 'brightens up her life by treating <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> princess'. Speaking {{of his relationship}} with Amira, Lapinskas told Digital Spy, [...] "From the very first time Anthony saw Amira at the pub, he said she was a goddess. Since then, he's been helping her out a bit, and she's warming to him. You never know what could happen– watch this space. It could turn into something beautiful! He added, [...] "I think at first she might have wanted to use him to make Syed (Marc Elliot) jealous, but over a period of time, she might start warming to him. He is genuinely a nice guy and quite charming, so she could fall for him".|$|E
5000|$|Seth Bradley, Lynda's 5-year-old son. He is pesky but loveable. He {{always seems}} {{to be able to put}} two and two {{together}} even though he is much younger than everybody else. He accepts Noreen right away and treats <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> older sister.|$|R
60|$|The {{nearness}} of her brother, his gentleness toward her, {{gave her}} a sense of well-being, even though her heart felt heavy with a great sorrow which made the whole future appear before <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> interminable vista of blank and grey dullness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nettie!" [...] cried I, {{and still}} protesting, pursued her {{along the narrow}} alley between the staging toward the hot-house door. I pursued <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> accusation, and she went before me like one who is guilty and ashamed. So I recall it now.|$|R
500|$|However, reviews {{were not}} uniformly positive. Tim Teeman posed the {{question}} in The Times: [...] "I know she's a national institution and June Brown plays <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream, but was last night's Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He noted that Jordan's script worked best as Dot remembered Ethel, but assessed that the episode was overly indulgent, and did not reveal anything [...] "substantially new" [...] about Dot. As with Banks-Smith's review, Teeman felt that the episode was incompatible with Dot's former characterisation, suggesting that her Christian faith ought to have tempered her decision not to care for Jim. He felt that overall, the episode was somewhat dull and boring, describing Dot as an EastEnders [...] "jewel" [...] who should be cherished, not turned into a [...] "drag act".|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{single-hander}} {{episode of}} EastEnders received much critical acclaim. The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith deemed Brown possibly {{the only member}} of the cast with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) capable of carrying such a monologue. Robert Hanks for The Independent wrote that [...] "I don't ever remember hearing anybody on a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well." [...] Conversely, Tim Teeman posed the question in The Times: [...] "I know she’s a national institution and June Brown plays <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream, but was last night’s Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He deemed Dot a [...] "soap icon", however he also assessed that: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1936, {{the crew of the}} Insect class gunboat HMS Gnat voted to get a ship's mascot. This was {{due in part to the}} {{competitive}} nature of the gunboats, with HMS Bee, Cicada, and Cricket already having mascots of their own. The Captain and the Chief Bosun's mate, Lt. Cmdr. J. Waldergrave and Chief Petty Officer Charles Jefferey, purchased Judy from the kennel and presented her to the crew. As her mother was known as Kelly of Sussex, Judy was listed as Judy of Sussex in her Royal Navy paperwork. It was hoped to train her as a gundog, but the men began to treat <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pet instead, and several days after her arrival, Jefferey's log stated that [...] "our chances of making her a trained gundog are very small." [...] Her time spent on the streets of Shanghai was blamed for her lack of hunting instinct, the only time that she would point in the traditional manner was when she could smell food.|$|E
5000|$|He {{could not}} think of her either with greed or with the fury of passion.

That would be a {{happiness}} greater than anything he could imagine." ...|$|R
60|$|An {{unimportant}} Baniya[FN#87] (trader), Hiranyadatt, had a daughter, {{whose name}} was Madansena Sundari, the beautiful army of Cupid. <b>Her</b> face was <b>like</b> the moon; <b>her</b> hair <b>like</b> the clouds; <b>her</b> eyes <b>like</b> those of <b>a</b> muskrat; <b>her</b> eyebrows <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bent bow; <b>her</b> nose <b>like</b> <b>a</b> parrot's bill; <b>her</b> neck <b>like</b> that of <b>a</b> dove; <b>her</b> teeth <b>like</b> pomegranate grains; the red colour of <b>her</b> lips <b>like</b> that of <b>a</b> gourd; her waist lithe and bending <b>like</b> the pards: <b>her</b> hands and feet <b>like</b> softest blossoms; <b>her</b> complexion <b>like</b> the jasmine-in fact, day by day the splendour of her youth increased.|$|R
