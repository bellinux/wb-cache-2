5|$|In the 20th century, the Court {{began to}} read the Fifteenth Amendment more broadly. In Guinn v. United States (1915), a {{unanimous}} Court struck down an Oklahoma <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause</b> that effectively exempted white voters from a literacy test, finding it to be discriminatory. The Court ruled in the related case Myers v. Anderson (1915), that the officials who enforced such a clause were liable for civil damages.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the U.S. {{ratified}} the 22nd Amendment, making a president ineligible for election {{to a third}} term or for election to a second full term after serving more than two remaining years of a term of a previously elected president. The latter clause would have applied to Truman's situation in 1952 except that a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause</b> in the amendment explicitly excluded the amendment from applying to the incumbent president.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{ended his}} {{chairmanship}} of Oxford in 1987, {{when he took}} control of Derby County and became that club's chairman; still owning Oxford as well, he installed his son Kevin as chairman there. In late 1987 he attempted to buy Watford from Elton John, prompting the Football League to institute new regulations preventing the major shareholder of any member club from owning more than 2% of another League team. While Maxwell {{was able to keep}} his stakes in Derby, Oxford and Reading under a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause,</b> the new rules prevented him from adding Watford to his football empire. He grudgingly accepted this. He retained his football club shares until his mysterious death in November 1991, when he apparently fell off his yacht near the Canary Islands.|$|E
5000|$|Many jurisdictions {{prohibit}} {{ex post facto}} laws, and <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> can be used {{to prevent}} a law from having retroactive effects.|$|R
50|$|Connecticut also bans listed {{makes and}} models of semiautomatic {{firearms}} and copies of those firearms. <b>Grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> and other exceptions apply, depending.|$|R
25|$|Harlan also dissented in Giles v. Harris (1903), a case {{challenging}} {{the use of}} <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> to restrict voting rolls and de facto exclude blacks.|$|R
5|$|Impressed by Rivera's pitching, Yankees {{management}} {{chose not}} to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead to replace him as closer with Rivera. In April 1997, MLB retired the uniform number 42 league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson for breaking the baseball color line, although Rivera was among a dozen players allowed to continue wearing the number per a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause.</b> Rivera's transition from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; he blew three of his first six save opportunities and indicated that he was initially uncomfortable in the role. With reassurance from manager Joe Torre, Rivera settled into the ninth-inning role, and he earned his first All-Star selection with 27saves and a 1.96ERA at the midseason break. In the 1997 All-Star Game, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an All-Star Game. That summer, he added a cut fastball to his pitching repertoire after accidentally discovering how to throw the pitch. Rivera finished the regular season with 43saves in 52opportunities with a 1.88ERA. His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the 1997 AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians; with the Yankees four outs from advancing to {{the next round of}} the postseason, Rivera allowed a game-tying home run to Sandy Alomar Jr. The Yankees eventually lost that game and the next, eliminating them from the postseason.|$|E
25|$|The {{conditions}} {{contain a}} <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause,</b> which exempts stadiums built before October 2007. However, most stadiums which regularly host international games easily meet the minimum dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Prairie {{dogs that}} were in captivity {{at the time of}} the ban in 2003 were allowed to be kept under a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause,</b> but were not to be bought, traded, or sold, and {{transport}} was permitted only to and from a veterinarian under quarantine procedures.|$|E
5000|$|He {{sided with}} the Supreme Court {{majority}} in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which upheld the legality of state segregation to provide [...] "separate but equal" [...] public facilities in the United States, despite protections of the Fourteenth Amendment to equal treatment under the law. In one of several challenges to Southern states' <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses,</b> used to disfranchise African-American voters {{at the turn of}} the century, he wrote for a unanimous court in Guinn v. United States (1915), which struck down many Southern states' <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Jackie Robinson's #42, {{which he}} wore {{when he broke}} Major League Baseball's 20th-century color line and {{throughout}} his Hall of Fame career with the Brooklyn Dodgers, {{is the subject of}} two such <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After the U.S. Supreme Court found such {{provisions}} unconstitutional in Guinn v. United States (1915), {{states were}} forced to stop using the <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> to provide exemption to literacy tests. Without the <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses,</b> {{tens of thousands of}} poor Southern whites were disenfranchised in the early 20th century. As decades passed, Southern states tended to expand the franchise for poor whites, but most blacks could not vote until after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. [...] Ratification in 1964 of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited the use of poll taxes in federal elections, but some states continued to use them in state elections.|$|R
25|$|U.S. jurisdictions that {{currently}} regulate or license naturopathy include Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Utah, Vermont, and Washington. Additionally, Florida and Virginia license {{the practice of}} naturopathy under a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|E
25|$|The FCC classifications of {{licensing}} {{have evolved}} considerably since the program's inception (see History of US amateur licensing, below). When the FCC {{made the most}} recent changes it allowed certain existing operator classes to remain under a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause.</b> These licenses {{would no longer be}} issued to new applicants, but existing licenses may be modified or renewed indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Stack {{simultaneously}} holds {{a seat in}} the New Jersey Senate and as Mayor. This dual position, {{often called}} double dipping, is allowed under a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause</b> in the state law enacted by the New Jersey Legislature and signed into law by Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine in September 2007 that prevents dual-office-holding but allows those who had held both positions as of February 1, 2008, to retain both posts.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{decision}} handed down on June 21, 1915, the Court ruled [...] "the <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> in the Maryland and Oklahoma constitutions to be repugnant to the Fifteenth Amendment and therefore null and void." [...] This also affected similar {{provisions in the}} constitutions of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia.|$|R
50|$|Under new constitutions, {{amendments}} {{and laws}} passed from 1890 (Mississippi) to 1908 {{in the remaining}} southern states, white Democrats disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites by creating barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, literacy tests and <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses.</b> They passed laws imposing Jim Crow and racial segregation of public facilities.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} methods survived US Supreme Court {{challenges}} and, if overruled, states had quickly developed new ways to exclude blacks, such as use of <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> and white primaries. In some cases, would-be voters were harassed economically, {{as well as by}} physical assault. Lynchings had been high {{at the turn of the}} century and continued for years.|$|R
25|$|The {{voting rights}} of blacks were {{systematically}} restricted or denied through suffrage laws, {{such as the}} introduction of poll taxes and literacy tests. Loopholes, such as the <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause</b> and the understanding clause, protected the voting rights of white people who were unable to pay the tax or pass the literacy test. Only whites could vote in Democratic Party primary contests. Where and when black people did manage to vote in numbers, their votes were negated by systematic gerrymander of electoral boundaries.|$|E
25|$|Under the new legislation, the Governor {{was given}} {{authorization}} {{to regulate the}} seal's use. All new seals acquired after January 1, 1969, were required to bear the new design, and the requirement was extended to county and municipal governments for the first time. Many cities had already adopted seals that bore {{no relation to the}} state seal, but they were exempted under a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause.</b> Though the physical Great Seal was also exempted, the Governor's office eventually replaced it with one that conformed to the new design.|$|E
25|$|The NAACP {{began to}} lead {{lawsuits}} targeting disfranchisement and racial segregation early in its history. It {{played a significant}} part in the challenge of Guinn v. United States (1915) to Oklahoma's discriminatory <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause,</b> which effectively disenfranchised most black citizens while exempting many whites from certain voter registration requirements. It persuaded the Supreme Court of the United States to rule in Buchanan v. Warley in 1917 that {{state and local governments}} cannot officially segregate African Americans into separate residential districts. The Court's opinion reflected the jurisprudence of property rights and freedom of contract as embodied in the earlier precedent it established in Lochner v. New York.|$|E
5000|$|The United States also {{prohibits the}} {{imposition}} of any [...] "... voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure ... to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color," [...] which prevents the use of <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses,</b> literacy tests, poll taxes and white primaries.|$|R
50|$|States {{also used}} <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> to enable {{illiterate}} whites {{who could not}} pass a literacy test to vote. It allowed a man to vote if his grandfather or father had voted prior to January 1, 1867; at that time, most African Americans had been slaves, while free people of color, even if property owners, and freedmen were ineligible to vote until 1870.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> were {{contained in}} new state constitutions and Jim Crow laws passed by white-dominated state legislatures from 1890 to 1908 {{in most of}} the Southern United States to restrict voter rolls and effectively prevent blacks, Mexican Americans (in Texas), and poor whites from voting. [...] Prohibitions on freedmen's voting in place before 1870 were nullified by the Fifteenth Amendment.|$|R
25|$|Cingular Wireless {{began its}} {{sponsorship}} of the #31 Chevrolet, owned by Richard Childress Racing, in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series in 2002. Two years later, when Nextel Communications (now Sprint Corporation) purchased the naming rights to NASCAR's top division (rebranding the division as the Nextel Cup, and later the Sprint Cup), Cingular and Alltel, sponsor of the #12 Dodge (owned by Penske Racing and driven by Ryan Newman), were allowed to stay as sponsors under a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause.</b> In early 2007, following its purchase by AT, Cingular began a re-branding effort to the AT Mobility brand. NASCAR quickly claimed that a clause in their contract with Sprint Nextel would not allow Cingular to change either the name or brand advertised on the #31 car.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{decided to}} run for another term as {{governor}} in 2010, and was able to do so due to a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause</b> in a term-limit law passed in 1990 for California state office. The law limited a governor to two terms; however, the four living governors when the law was passed (which consisted of himself, Brown's father Pat, his predecessor Ronald Reagan, and his successor George Deukmejian, who was in office when the law was enacted) remained eligible. Brown defeated Meg Whitman in 2010 to become the 39th California Governor in 2011; on October 7, 2013, he became the longest-serving governor in California history, surpassing Earl Warren. Brown was re-elected in 2014, with sixty percent of the vote. As a consequence of the 28-year gap between his second and third terms, Brown has been both the sixth-youngest California Governor, and the oldest California Governor in history.|$|E
25|$|The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), the National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball filed {{a federal}} lawsuit against New Jersey to prevent sports betting, {{based on the}} Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 which banned sports betting in all but four states. In February 2013, United States District Court judge Michael A. Shipp {{ruled in favor of}} the {{athletic}} leagues, and barred New Jersey from issuing sports betting licenses. The court ruled that under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the regulation of gambling and the granting of a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause</b> to four states is within Congress's power. In September 2013, a three-judge panel from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to uphold Shipp's decision. Christie said he will appeal the case to the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
5000|$|Mississippi's {{constitution}} of 1890 politically disfranchised African-Americans, using provisions such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> to raise barriers to voter registration and exclude blacks from voting. In the early 1960s, a {{local chapter of}} the NAACP was founded by E.W. Steptoe for the purpose of registering black voters. He was soon joined by Robert Parris Moses of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).|$|R
5|$|United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, most black voters in the South were effectively disenfranchised by new state constitutions and state laws incorporating such obstacles as poll taxes and discriminatory literacy tests, from which white male voters were exempted by <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses.</b> A system of whites-only primaries and violent intimidation by white groups also suppressed black participation.|$|R
25|$|Appointed in 1920 as {{the first}} black {{executive}} secretary of the NAACP, Johnson helped increase membership and extended the movement's reach by organizing numerous new chapters in the South. During this period the NAACP was mounting frequent legal challenges to the southern states' disenfranchisement of African Americans, which had been established {{at the turn of}} the century by such legal devices as poll tax, literacy tests, <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses</b> and white primaries.|$|R
25|$|PennDOT {{also tried}} {{acquiring}} a local pizza shop, Pizza Dude, {{for the southern}} end of the new right-of-way, but the owner didn't want to sell the property since it would potentially lose business from the college students as well as no other suitable property nearby that would adequately replace his old building, a former Burger Chef location. PennDOT and the owner agreed to a compromise in which the owner got to stay on his property, but had to tear down the front portion of the building (which, for the time being, eliminated seating at the building) so that the right-of-way would have enough clearance from the building. The owner also gave up a portion of his parking lot, but the building itself would be protected by a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause</b> requiring a certain length between a road and a building since it was a pre-existing building. In 2010, Pizza Dude moved on its own to downtown Beaver Falls, and the building is currently vacant.|$|E
25|$|Though NASCAR {{typically}} promotes {{competition between}} multiple brands, {{including those that}} sponsor the sport and individual races, the sanctioning body provides exclusive protection to its series title sponsors, such as Monster Energy in the Cup Series, as well as current fuel supplier Sunoco. This policy, known as the Viceroy rule, prevents sponsorship from direct competitors within a certain series, although it does not prevent a company from moving to a different series within the sport, or advertising a product that does not directly conflict with the title sponsor. For example, Royal Dutch Shell, Texaco and other oil companies {{have been allowed to}} promote their motor oil brands (Pennzoil and Havoline respectively) but not their gasoline products. When a new title sponsor creates conflicts with existing team sponsors, NASCAR typically allows the team sponsors to remain under a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause.</b> The rule is named after the British cigarette brand Viceroy, and is in reference to the 1972 USAC Championship Car season during which title sponsor Marlboro renounced its branding when Viceroy entered the sport to sponsor entries.|$|E
500|$|In United States v. Reese (1876), {{the first}} U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} interpreting the Fifteenth Amendment, the Court interpreted the amendment narrowly, upholding ostensibly race-neutral limitations on suffrage including poll taxes, literacy tests, and a <b>grandfather</b> <b>clause</b> that exempted citizens from other voting requirements if their grandfathers had been registered voters, a condition only white men could generally meet. The Court {{also stated that}} the amendment does not confer the right of suffrage, but it invests citizens of the United States with the right of exemption from discrimination {{in the exercise of}} the elective franchise on account of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and empowers Congress to enforce that right by [...] "appropriate legislation". The Court wrote: ...|$|E

50|$|This type of debt bondage, {{for blacks}} and poor whites, led to a populist {{movement}} in the late 19th century that began to bring blacks and whites together for a common cause. This early populist movement is largely credited with helping to cause state governments in the South, mostly controlled by the planter elite, to enact various laws that disenfranchised poor whites and blacks, through <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses,</b> literacy tests, poll taxes, and various other laws.|$|R
50|$|With {{the rise}} of Jim Crow laws in the late 19th century, the Haliwa-Saponi and African Americans were disfranchised by state law in 1896 and a new {{constitution}} in 1899 that was discriminatory {{in the application of}} poll taxes, literacy tests and <b>grandfather</b> <b>clauses.</b> This was the pattern for every former Confederate state, beginning with Mississippi in 1890 and proceeding through 1908. The Haliwa continued their efforts to build and maintain separate cultural institutions.|$|R
