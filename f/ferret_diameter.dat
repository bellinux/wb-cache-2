The AFM image {{was transformed into}} a binary image using an appropriate z-height threshold. Every pixel of the processed image contained information not only for the z-height in the pixel area but also for the presence of particles in the pixel area. The x-histograms of MEAC and <b>Ferret</b> <b>diameter</b> (Fig. 2 (a 2 –d 2, a 3 –d 3)) were extracted by using the “Image J 1.51 n Fiji distribution software”, with the correct z-height threshold values.

40|$|Abstract. The {{results of}} {{intercept}} and profile counts are commonly {{interpreted as a}} suitable estimates of the mean grain size as represented e. g. by the grain density V. The term grain size is not explicitly defined even when some relation to grain volume and/or mean grain breadth (the mean <b>Ferret</b> <b>diameter)</b> is tacitly assumed. However, the intercept count L {{is directly related to}} the mean value of grain boundary area per unit volume SV and the profile count A is, under relatively general assumptions, directly related to the mean value of grain junctions per unit volume LV. Their relation to V can be generally written as V = c′ (A) 3 / 2 = c″ (L) 3, but the coefficients c ′ and c″ strongly depend on the structural characteristics like grain size dispersion, anisotropy etc. and their evaluation is far from being simple. Consequently, whereas the reliable estimates of SV and LV result from intercept and profile counts, the estimate of grain density based on them requires a careful consideration...|$|E

The ratio between maximum and minimum <b>Ferret</b> <b>diameter</b> {{were used to}} obtain the aspect ratio (Ferret min/Ferret max) of the particles. Edge objects were excluded in the measurement. In the assessment of orientation objects with low aspect ratio were excluded. The aspect ratio can, presented as cumulative diagrams, be used as one tool to identify {{the source of the}} aggregate and to compare the aggregate in different samples. Other tools that can be used are mineralogical composition and aggregate size distribution. The aggregate orientation measured as the orientation of the longest axis of the particle {{can be used as a}} tool for assessment of surface treatment of the fresh mortar. A strong orientation of the aggregate particles near the surface implies a tooling of the surface. A lack of orientation implies a mortar of low workability or only little tooling of the fresh mortar. The analysed mortars range from pure lime mortars to hydraulic mortars with and without pozzolanic additives. The mortars come from buildings in southern and central Sweden and the age of the mortars date from the 16 th to the 20 th century...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the ability to reduce the particle size of glibenclamide to the nanometric scale through a very simple and well-known laboratory scale method, the laboratory scale ultra cryo-milling. The effect of milling on glibenclamide crystalline properties and dissolution behavior was deliberately evaluated in the absence of any surfactants as stabilizers. The milling procedure consisted in adding particles to liquid nitrogen and milling them in a mortar with a pestle for different time intervals (15, 30, 40 minutes). For comparison, the same milling procedure was also applied without liquid nitrogen. The particle size reduction was evaluated for the coarsest samples (> 3 m) by measuring the particle <b>Ferret’s</b> <b>diameter</b> through scanning electron microscopy, while for the smallest one (< 3 m) by dynamic light scattering. A time grinding of 40 minutes in presence of liquid nitrogen was revealed highly efficacious to obtain particles of nanodimensions, with a geometric mean particle size of 0. 55 ± 0. 23 m and more than the 80...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} reviews results of {{research}} on the quantitative determination of cell structural parameters such as: surface area, perimeter, <b>Ferret's</b> <b>diameters,</b> elongation, compac- tion, for the parenchyma of potato tuber, taking into consideration inner and outer core tissues. Tissue images were obtained for the samples in their natural state without any preparation using an optic confocal microscope. The quantitative analysis of the microscopic image of the cross-sections of the cell's structure, was carried out according to the method worked out by the present authors earlier. Four potato varieties were chosen for the present experiment (Danusia, Kuba, Mila, Triada), in three consecutive crop years in the conditions selected (1999, 2000, 2001) and with a controlled storage system. Our studies showed that the quantitative structure described by means of cell size and shape parameters is a charac- teristic feature of potato tuber tissues, outer and inner core, for a given variety and harvest date. The size of cells changes, whereas their shape is similar in each variety, type of core and harvest date...|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{characteristics}} of the soil aggregates are important tools to analyzing and monitoring the structural quality. The present study aimed to characterize morphometrically aggregates of a Inceptisol, originated from pelitic rocks, after 1. 5 years of {{the implementation of a}} management system that adopts conservation tillage practices in the coffee cultivation. The aggregates were collected at the depths of 0. 0 - 0. 05; 0. 05 - 0. 20; 0. 20 - 0. 40; 0. 40 - 0. 80 m, both at row and interrow position in a coffee field, and also a natural environment of native vegetation that was used as a reference for the study. The analyzes of the aggregates were carried through 2 D images obtained by scanning at 300 dpi spatial resolution. Each image contained 60 households and were processed using the software QUANTPORO. The morphometric variables were obtained: area, perimeter, compactness, roughness, appearance and <b>Ferret</b> <b>diameter.</b> For validation, the correlations among morphometric variables determined by image analysis and pattern aggregation indices (GMD, MWD and aggregates retained in the class > 2. 00 mm) obtained by wet sieving were studied.

For this purpose, here, we are developing nickel ion doped nHAp which improves angiogenesis. nHAp doped with varying concentrations of nickel were prepared using wet chemical precipitation method using cationic surfactant (CTAB) as a template and the extent of doping was studied using EDAX. The prepared particles with <b>ferret</b> <b>diameter</b> of 15 - 17 nm (TEM analysis), showed almost similar surface area for all samples (using BET analysis) but there was an increase in surface charge observed as the doping increases (ZETA potential). Crystalline nature of doped hydroxyapatite particles were studied using XRD and FTIR. Detailed analysis relevant to the bone cells (Mg- 63) proliferation and differentiation showed that doping of nickel to hydroxyapatite supports cell growth and proliferation (MTT, live dead assay and cell cycle analysis) and also differentiation of these cells which were analysed using in vitro Runx 2 expression and bone nodule formation by SEM study. VEGF expression by ELISA and HIF- 1 a expression studies revealed that doping of nickel greatly supports angiogenesis. This confirms that nickel ion doped hydroxyapatite improves angiogenesis along with osteogenesis pinpointing its potential in bone tissue engineering applicatio...|$|E
40|$|Changes in soil {{physical}} properties {{are inherent in}} land use, mainly in superficial layers. Structural alterations can directly influence distribution, stability and especially morphometry of soil aggregates, which hence will affect pore system and the dynamic process of water and air in soil. Among the methods used to measure these changes, morphometry is a complementary tool to the classic methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate structural quality of a Latosol (Oxisol), under different management systems, using morphometric techniques. Treatments consisted of soil under no-tillage (NT); pasture (P), in which both had been cultivated for ten years, and an area under native vegetation (NV – Savannah like vegetation). Aggregates were sampled at depths of 0 - 0. 10 and 0. 10 - 0. 20 m, retained on sieves with 9. 52 – 4. 76 mm, 4. 76 – 1. 0 mm, 1. 0 – 0. 5 mm diameter ranges. Aggregate morphometry was assessed by 2 D images from scanner via QUANTPORO software. The analyzed variables were: area, perimeter, aspect, roughness, <b>Ferret</b> <b>diameter</b> and compactness. Moreover, disturbed samples were collected at the same depths to determine particle size, aggregate stability in water, water-dispersible clay, clay flocculation index and organic matter content. It was observed that different soil management systems have modified soil aggregate morphology as well as physical attributes; and management effects’ magnitude increased from NT to P. </p...|$|E

The mean n -variogram γ (n) Ξ 0 : (u 1 · · · u n) ↦ E[ν d (Ξ 0 ∩(Ξ 0 − u 1) · · ·∩ (Ξ 0 − u n)) ] of a random convex set Ξ 0 on R d reveals information on the n th order structure of Ξ 0. Especially we will show that considering the mean n -variograms of the dilated random sets Ξ 0 &# 8853 rK by an homothetic convex family rK r > 0, it's possible to estimate some characteristic of the n th order structure of Ξ 0. If we make a judicious choice of K, it provides relevant measures of Ξ 0. Fortunately the germ-grain model is stable by convex dilatations, furthermore the mean n -variogram of the primary grain is estimable in several type of stationary germ-grain models by the so called n -points probability function. Here we will only focus on the Boolean model, in the planar case we will show how to estimate the n th order structure of the random vector composed by the mixed volumes t (A (Ξ 0), W (Ξ 0, K)) of the primary grain, and we will describe a procedure to do it from a realization of the Boolean model in a bounded window. We will prove that this knowledge for all convex body K is sufficient to fully characterize the so called difference body of the grain Ξ 0 &# 8853 ˘Ξ 0. we will be discussing the choice of the element K, by choosing a ball, the mixed volumes coincide with the Minkowski's functional of Ξ 0 therefore we obtain the moments of the random vector composed of the area and perimeter t (A (Ξ 0), U (Ξ)). By choosing a segment oriented by &# 952 we obtain estimates for the moments of the random vector composed by the area and the <b>Ferret's</b> <b>diameter</b> in the direction &# 952, t ((A (Ξ 0), H Ξ 0 (&# 952)). Finally, we will evaluate the performance of the method on a Boolean model with rectangular grain for the estimation of the second order moments of the random vectors t (A (Ξ 0), U (Ξ 0)) and t ((A (Ξ 0), H Ξ 0 (&# 952)) ...|$|R
40|$|Microscopic changes {{occur in}} plant food {{materials}} during drying significantly influence the macroscopic properties and quality factors of the dried food materials. It is very critical to study microstructure {{to understand the}} underlying cellular mechanisms to improve performance of the food drying techniques. However, there is very limited research conducted on such microstructural changes of plant food material during drying. In this work, Gala apple parenchyma tissue samples were studied using a scanning electron microscope for gradual microstructural changes as affected by temperature, time and moisture content during hot air drying at two drying temperatures: 57 ℃ and 70 ℃. For fresh samples, the average cellular parameter values were; cell area: 20000 μm 2, ferret diameter: 160 μm, perimeter: 600 μm, roundness: 0. 76, elongation: 1. 45 and compactness: 0. 84. During drying, {{a higher degree of}} cell shrinkage was observed with cell wall warping and increase in intercellular space. However, no significant cell wall breakage was observed. The overall reduction of cell area, <b>ferret</b> <b>diameter</b> and perimeter were about 60 %, 40 % and 30 %. The cell roundness and elongation showed overall increments of about 5 % and the compactness remained unchanged. Throughout the drying cycle, cellular deformations were mainly influenced by the moisture content.
