25|$|Cramer said {{achieving}} a Republican-majority Senate {{could result in}} the removal of controversial Democratic Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He had long opposed the Vietnam War. In response, Chiles noted that <b>if</b> <b>Republicans</b> controlled the Senate, other southern Democrats would also forfeit committee chairmanships earned and long controlled through their seniority.|$|E
25|$|Lichtman {{was interviewed}} about his book after President Trump fired FBI {{director}} James Comey. He told Newsweek this {{added to the}} evidence that Trump may have engaged in obstruction of justice, and compared it to the Watergate scandal. He reminded The National that support for impeachment grew after Nixon fired his special prosecutor. Lichtman remarked to Salon that Comey's firing and circumstantial evidence of 2016 election coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia were reasons for impeachment. He explained public opinion in 1974 changed the viewpoints of Nixon's Republican comrades towards impeachment. Lichtman elaborated that impeachment was possible even with a Republican-controlled Congress. He pointed out impeachment grew likely <b>if</b> <b>Republicans</b> felt Trump hurt their election chances. Lichtman emphasized to AM Joy, the first adage of politicians was to safeguard their careers. He commented to Mic and Newsweek the chance of impeachment grew after Comey's Senate Intelligence Committee testimony about his memos, and said the evidence was stronger than that in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Writing in The Hill Lichtman said that Paul Ryan's assertions {{that some of the}} president's actions could be excused because of ignorance or naivety were indefensible, and would not stand.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{was elected}} in November 1888 over President Cleveland. [...] By 1889, Foraker was openly opposed by a faction of Ohio Republicans, led by Hanna, Sherman and McKinley. [...] Foraker felt {{relieved}} at the break, writing to a friend, [...] "From Toledo to Chicago, my neck was under a yoke, but now I am free." [...] Despite the factional opposition, he sought a third term in 1889, hoping that <b>if</b> <b>Republicans</b> kept their majority in the legislature, he could be elected to the Senate as Sherman's junior colleague in the legislative election {{to be held in}} January 1890. [...] He was renominated at the 1889 state convention in Columbus on the second ballot, as the opposition to him was divided.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, when Doug Wead ran for U.S. Representative from Arizona, {{he wrote}} a {{campaign}} book entitled Time for a Change. The first chapter was called “The Compassionate Conservative” and outlined Wead’s philosophy that the masses didn’t care <b>if</b> <b>Republican</b> policies worked <b>if</b> the attitude and purpose behind the policies were uncaring.|$|R
500|$|Following McCarthy {{dropping}} out of the race on October 8, the caucus vote was indefinitely postponed. Massie and Peter T. King referred to the House as a [...] "banana republic." [...] Massie also criticized Boehner for postponing the election, saying they [...] "called off the election because they didn’t like the result," [...] which was echoed by Tom Rice, Louie Gohmert, and Justin Amash. McMorris Rodgers and Conference Vice Chairwoman Lynn Jenkins defended Boehner, saying the matter was handled properly, as conference rules give him sole discretion. Rich Lowry of National Review asked McCarthy in a phone interview if the House was governable, to which McCarthy replied [...] "I don’t know. Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom." [...] Charlie Dent, a Republican from Pennsylvania who had supported McCarthy, suggested that <b>if</b> <b>Republicans</b> are unable to agree on a candidate, the best option might be for a bipartisan coalition to select a Speaker.|$|E
2500|$|Webster's main {{platform}} in the 2010 election {{was a call}} for smaller, streamlined government, spending cuts, budget roll backs, and tax cuts. He also said he would increase the protection of personal rights and encourage financial responsibility in the federal government. Webster predicted that <b>if</b> <b>Republicans</b> took back Congress in November, [...] "we would have the opportunity for turning this country around." [...] In the January 2015 vote for Speaker of the House, Webster received the second most Republican votes.|$|E
2500|$|Boehner {{has been}} highly {{critical}} of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President Barack Obama, including the [...] "cap and trade" [...] plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and said that, <b>if</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{took control of the}} House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would {{do whatever it takes to}} stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying [...] "one dime" [...] to pay the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan. He also led an opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI). [...] He has advocated for an across-the-board spending freeze, including entitlement programs.|$|E
50|$|As {{political}} executive functions generally {{moved to}} more democratic bases, noble courts {{have seen their}} function reduced once more {{to that of a}} noble household, concentrating on personal service to the household head, ceremonial and perhaps some residual politico-advisory functions. <b>If</b> <b>republican</b> zeal has banished an area's erstwhile ruling nobility, courts may survive in exile. Traces of royal court practices remain in present-day institutions like privy councils and governmental cabinets.|$|R
5000|$|Yonhap {{said that}} the {{re-election}} of Obama (along with the leadership change in China due to take place) could usher in change on the Korean Peninsula as it [...] "induce North Korea to ease confrontational policies and possibly adopt an engagement stance;" [...] it added that the result [...] "gave breathing room to North Korea, whose policy options {{would have been far}} more limited <b>if</b> <b>Republican</b> rival Mitt Romney, a hard-liner, had been elected." ...|$|R
50|$|Under Polland's {{tenure as}} the Harris County Republican chairman, the GOP {{continued}} to win majorities {{in the county}} even <b>if</b> <b>Republican</b> candidates lost in the Houston corporate limits in contested races. Polland earned national recognition for his party's success from such publications as the national conservative weekly Human Events, which called him the most effective party chairman in the nation. Other publications in which Polland has been cited are the American Spectator, The Houston Chronicle, and Inside Houston Magazine.|$|R
2500|$|Economist and New York Times {{columnist}} Paul Krugman {{has argued}} that Republican and conservative strategies in opposing healthcare are based on spite: [...] "At this point, the guiding principle {{of one of our}} nation’s two great political parties is spite pure and simple. <b>If</b> <b>Republicans</b> think something might be good for the president, they’re against it – whether or not it’s good for America." [...] He argued that Republican opposition to Medicare savings proposed by the President is [...] "utterly at odds both with the party’s traditions and with what conservatives claim to believe. Think about just how bizarre it is for Republicans to position themselves as the defenders of unrestricted Medicare spending. First of all, the modern G.O.P. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan – and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare’s creation, warning that it would destroy American freedom. (Honest.) In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich tried to force drastic cuts in Medicare financing. And in recent years, Republicans have repeatedly decried the growth in entitlement spending – growth that is largely driven by rising health care costs." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{should like}} it {{understood}} that, if not absolutely devoid of preferences and prejudices, I at least believe myself to be; that except as to result I think {{no more of}} one form of government than of another; and that with reference to results all forms seem to me bad, but bad in different degrees. If asked my opinion as {{to the results of}} our own, I should point to Homestead, to Wardner, to Buffalo, to Coal Creek, to the interminable tale of unpunished murders by individuals and by mobs, to legislatures and courts unspeakably corrupt and executives of criminal cowardice, to the prevalence and immunity of plundering trusts and corporations and the monstrous multiplication of millionaires. I should invite attention to the pension roll, to the similar and incredible extravagance of Republican and Democratic [...] "Houses"--a plague o' them both! If addressing Democrats only, I should mention the protective tariff; <b>if</b> <b>Republicans,</b> the hill-tribe clamor for free coinage of silver. I should call to mind the existence of prosperous activity of a thousand lying secret societies having for their sole object mitigation of republican simplicity by means of pageantry and costumes grotesquely resembling those of kings and courtiers, and titles of address and courtesy exalted enough to draw laughter from an ox.|$|E
50|$|For House Republicans, the Steering {{committee}} is chaired {{by the party}} leader in the House, either the Speaker (<b>if</b> <b>Republicans</b> are in the majority) or the Minority (Floor) Leader (<b>if</b> <b>Republicans</b> are in the minority).

50|$|The killing sparked {{criticism}} and political debate over San Francisco's sanctuary city policy, {{which aims to}} strengthen community safety by disallowing local officials from questioning a resident's immigration status, thus enabling local victims of crime to report without fear of deportation. Multiple Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump and Jeb Bush, made statements blaming the immigration policy for Steinle's death, and encouraged {{the need for a}} secure border wall.

40|$|The {{revival of}} republican {{political}} philosophy has certainly impacted upon many different areas. Obviously, its main contribution is on politics. However, contemporary republican theory actually fails to redeem an autonomous conception of politics. Despite {{the recognition of}} the central role of contestation, republican political theory either moralises or legalises politics. In this way, all the epistemic and normative potential of the idea of contestation is attenuated, up to a point where this idea does not add a particular value to republicanism. Astonishingly, there is no discussion of constituent power; but <b>if</b> <b>republican</b> political theory wants to remain true to its own aspirations, it has take into account the reflexive dimension of politics...|$|R

5|$|Adams {{focused his}} {{political}} agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential in a <b>republican</b> government. <b>If</b> <b>republican</b> leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered.

Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress. The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting the part of a virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity. Adams favored James Bowdoin for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories.|$|R
