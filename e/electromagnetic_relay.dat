He was the secretary for the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, a precursor of the Smithsonian Institution. He was highly regarded during his lifetime.

He also discovered mutual inductance independently of Michael Faraday, (1791–1867), though Faraday was the first to make the discovery and publish his results. Henry developed the electromagnet into a practical device. He invented a precursor to the electric doorbell (specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire, 1831) and electric relay (1835). The SI unit of inductance, the henry, is named in his honor. Henry's work on the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>relay</b> was the basis of the practical electrical telegraph, invented by Samuel F. B.

However, in ordinary relays, this function is not prevalent and, hence, not considered in the existing system of relay classification. In interface relays, however, the property of galvanic isolation (decoupling) between the input and output circuits is significantly bolstered, and parameters of the galvanic isolation have an utmost importance from standpoint of the functions performed by this relay. On the other hand, the parameters associated with switching capacity are secondary and can significantly vary in interface relays with the same level of galvanic decoupling.|$|E

50|$|A simple <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>relay</b> {{consists}} of a coil of wire wrapped around a soft iron core (a solenoid), an iron yoke which provides a low reluctance path for magnetic flux, a movable iron armature, and one or more sets of contacts (there are two contacts in the relay pictured). The armature is hinged to the yoke and mechanically linked {{to one or more}} sets of moving contacts. The armature is held in place by a spring so that when the relay is de-energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit. In this condition, one of the two sets of contacts in the relay pictured is closed, and the other set is open. Other relays may have more or fewer sets of contacts depending on their function. The relay in the picture also has a wire connecting the armature to the yoke. This ensures continuity of the circuit between the moving contacts on the armature, and the circuit track on the printed circuit board (PCB) via the yoke, which is soldered to the PCB.|$|E

In this study, a characterization of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>relays</b> that were operated at their optimal performance with appropriate and steady parameter values was performed to estimate the levels of their potential defects {{and to develop a}} lifetime prediction model. First, the initial parameter information value and stability were quantified to measure the performance of the electronics. In particular, the values of the initial parameter information were estimated using the probability-weighted average method, whereas the stability of the parameter information was determined by using the difference between the extrema and end points of the fitting curves for the initial parameter information. Second, a lifetime prediction model for small-sized samples was proposed on the basis of both measures. Finally, a model for the relationship of the initial contact resistance and stability over the lifetime of the sampled <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>relays</b> was proposed and verified. A comparison of the actual and predicted lifetimes of the relays revealed a 15. 4 % relative error, indicating that the lifetime of electronic devices can be predicted based on their initial parameter information...|$|R

The strength of turbulence is a statistical measure of local {{variations in the}} turbulent medium. It influences engineering decisions made in these domains. Tur-bulence strength (TS) also affects safety of aircraft and tethered bal-loons, and reliability of free-space <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>relays.</b> We show {{that it is possible}} to estimate TS, without having to reconstruct instantaneous fluid flow fields. Instead, the TS field can be directly recovered, passively, using videos captured from different viewpoints. We formulate this as a linear tomography problem with a structure unique to turbulence fields. No tight synchronization between cameras is needed. Thus, realization is very simple to deploy using consumer-grade cameras. We experimentally demonstrate this both in a lab and in a large-scale uncontrolled complex outdoor environment, which includes industrial, rural and urban areas. 1 The Need to Recover Turbulence Strength Turbulence creates refractive perturbations to light passing through a scene.

Metallic microstructures with high-aspect-ratio serves as basic blocks for metallic microdevices, such as micro gears, micro <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>relays</b> and mi-crochannel heat exchangers. There {{are a few}} technologies and processes for high-aspect-ratio microstructures in metallic materi-als: (1) in LIGA or LIGA-Like, metallic microstructures are usually fabricated based on the metallic ion elec-trochemical deposition on a cathode.

Line-and-space structures with an aspect ratio up to 5 were successfully transferred from the mother PMMA patterns to the nickel microstructures [2].

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a {{theoretical and practical}} study of the dynamic behaviour of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>relays.</b> After discussing the problem of solving the dynamicc equations analytically and presenting a historical survey of the earlier works in the relay and its dynamics, the simulation of a relay on the analogue computer is discussed. It is shown that the simulation {{may be used to}} obtain specific solutions to the dynamic equations. The computer analysis provides the dynamic characteristics for design purposes and may be used in the study of bouncing, rebound oscillations and stability of the armature motion. An approximate analytical solution to the two dynamic equations is given {{based on the assumption that}} the dynamic variation of the pull with the position of the armature is linear. The assumption is supported by the Computer-aided analysis and experimental results. The solution is intended to provide a basis for a rational design. A rigorous method of analysing the dynamic performance by using Ahlberg's theory is also presented. This method may be justified to be the extension of Ahlberg's theory by taking the mass and frictional damping forces into account. While calculating the armature motion mathematically, Ahlberg considers the equilibrium of two kinds of forces, namely pull and load, and disregards the mass and friction forces, whereas the present method deals with the equilibrium of all four kinds of forces. It is shown how this can be utilised to calculate the dynamic characteristics for a specific design. The utility of this method also extends to the study of stability, contact bounce and armature rebound. The magnetic circuit and other related topics which are essential to the study of relay dynamics are discussed and some necessary experimental results are given...|$|R
