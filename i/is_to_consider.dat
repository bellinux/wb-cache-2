5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> {{a multidimensional}} object {{such as a}} garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Gergonne's {{approach}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> {{the solution}} circles in pairs. Let {{a pair of}} solution circles be denoted as CA and CB (the pink circles in Figure6), and let their tangent points with the three given circles be denoted as A1, A2, A3, and B1, B2, B3, respectively. Gergonne's solution aims to locate these six points, and thus solve for the two solution circles.|$|E

5|$|One {{possible}} fix <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> {{collections of}} objects {{that can be easily}} divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.|$|E
5|$|The signs s1, s2 and s3 on the {{right-hand}} sides of the equations may be chosen in eight possible ways, and each choice of signs gives up to two solutions, since the equation for r's is quadratic. This might suggest (incorrectly) that there are up to sixteen solutions of Apollonius' problem. However, due to a symmetry of the equations, if (r's, x's, y's) is a solution, with signs s'i, then so is (−r's, x's, y's), with opposite signs −s'i, which represents the same solution circle. Therefore, Apollonius' problem has at most eight independent solutions (Figure2). One way to avoid this double-counting <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> only solution circles with non-negative radius.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} also of {{importance}} when classifying the trust as either constructive or express, {{a matter of}} considerable debate. On one view, if the traditional theory is correct, secret trusts are created by the courts, and are thus constructive; if the more modern view is correct, the trusts exist without the court's permission, and are express trusts. However, a secret trust {{does not have to}} obey the separate formalities of the Law of Property Act 1925, even when it concerns land and one solution to this problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> them constructive. Some commentators believe that half-secret trusts may fall into a different category to fully secret trusts in this regard.|$|E

25|$|One way to {{visualize}} a 4-dimensional figure <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> various 3-dimensional cross-sections.

25|$|Another {{important}} idea in geometric group theory <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> {{finitely generated}} groups themselves as geometric objects.
