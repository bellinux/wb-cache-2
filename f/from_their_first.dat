5|$|United were unbeaten <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> 10 league {{games of}} the 1985–86 campaign, and unbeaten <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> 15, and seemed destined to win the First Division title. However they dropped off in mid-season and won just six of their final 18 games to end the season in fourth place, 12 points behind champions Liverpool. The press blamed the decline in form on the club's {{drinking}} culture and Ron Atkinson's lax disciplinary attitude, though in his autobiography Whiteside denies that this was to blame, and states that stories of the player's drinking sessions were exaggerated.|$|E

On 25 October, in his second game as manager, he guided Sunderland to a 3–0 win against rivals and his former club Newcastle United.

In 2005, Florida Leader magazine named this new tradition the best college superstition in Florida.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal made an {{indifferent}} {{start to}} their league campaign with four consecutive draws <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> five matches. After defeat to Aston Villa in December 1998, the team {{embarked on a}} 19 match unbeaten run to steadily climb up the league table. A 6-1 win against Middlesbrough in April 1999 moved Arsenal {{to the top of}} the table for the first time in the season and victory against Tottenham Hotspur put the team three points clear as main challenger United drew with Liverpool. Both Arsenal and Manchester United went into the final two games of the league season on the same number of points, but the latter's defeat to Leeds United all but ended their chances of retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{started with}} attacking play, with Brazilian Marcelo's shot going wide {{in the third}} minute and German Sami Khedira's shot in the seventh minute being {{inadvertently}} blocked by his teammate Toni Kroos. In the 11th minute, the Germans scored <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> corner of the game. Thomas Müller escaped his marker, David Luiz, in the penalty box, and Toni Kroos's delivery found him wide open for a side-footed shot into the net. In the following minutes Brazil tried to respond but their attacks came to nothing; although Philipp Lahm needed to deliver a brilliant tackle to keep Marcelo from setting up a chance in the penalty box. Instead, in the 23rd minute, Germany scored again after Kroos and Müller combined to set up Miroslav Klose, who scored on the rebound after his initial shot was saved by goalkeeper Júlio César. It was Klose's 16th goal at a World Cup, passing the Brazilian Ronaldo as the all-time World Cup top scorer.|$|E

5|$|Building for the 2001–02 Premier League campaign, Allardyce signed France {{international}} defender Bruno N'Gotty from Marseille in a loan deal {{which was}} eventual {{made into a}} permanent one after N'Gotty {{established himself as a}} key first team player. He also brought in Henrik Pedersen from Silkeborg IF for £650,000, though otherwise remained loyal to the players that had won promotion the previous campaign. They recorded a 5–0 win at Leicester City on the opening day, then beat Middlesbrough and Liverpool to secure nine points <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> three games. After six games without a win, Bolton then recorded a shock 2–1 victory over Manchester United on 20 October. However their form dropped, and so in the January transfer window Allardyce brought in Danish midfielder Stig Tøfting, German striker Fredi Bobic (on loan), and World Cup-winning attacker Youri Djorkaeff. Djorkaeff scored both goals in a 2–1 win over Charlton Athletic on 23 March and Bobic scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over Ipswich Town on 6 April; the victory over Ipswich proved to be essential as Bolton ended the season in 16th place on 40 points, ahead of Ipswich who were relegated with 36 points.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{tested the}} new Mercedes-Benz W25 at the AVUS track in April, {{and despite his}} injuries—his right leg had healed five shorter than his left, leaving him with a {{noticeable}} limp—he was cleared to race. However, Neubauer withdrew the Mercedes team <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> race, also at the AVUS track, as their practice times compared too unfavourably to Auto Union's. Caracciola was judged not fit to race for the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, but made the start for the German Grand Prix at the same track six weeks later. He took the lead from Auto Union driver Hans Stuck {{on the outside of}} the Karussel on the 13th lap, but retired a lap later when his engine failed. He had better luck at the 1934 Italian Grand Prix in September. In very hot weather, Caracciola started from fourth and moved to second, where he trailed Stuck. After 59laps, the pain in his leg overwhelmed him, and he pitted, letting teammate Fagioli take over his car. Fagioli won from Stuck's car which by then had been taken over by Nuvolari. His best results in the rest of the season were a second place in the Spanish Grand Prix—he led before Fagioli passed him, much to the anger of Neubauer, who had ordered the Italian to hold position—and first at the Klausenpass hillclimb.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
