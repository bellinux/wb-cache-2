The technical skills learned through phonics are important for many children when learning to read, spell, and <b>general</b> <b>language</b> comprehension and engagement {{of children in the}} whole-language approach is also important to keep the children motivated and excited to learn. Many teachers and schools acknowledge this and say that they use multiple methods to teach children to read.|$|E
25|$|While the {{capabilities}} of the physical structures used are large factors in determining linguistic intelligence, there have been several genes that have been linked to individual linguistic ability. The NRXN1 gene has been linked to <b>general</b> <b>language</b> ability, and mutations of this gene has been shown to cause major issues to overall linguistic intelligence. The CNTNAP2 gene is believed to affect language development and performance, and mutations in this gene is thought to be involved in autism spectrum disorders. PCDH11 has been linked to language capacity, and it is believed {{to be one of the}} factors that accounts for the variation in linguistic intelligence.|$|E

25|$|The {{continuing}} {{campaigns to}} eradicate illiteracy also {{were a part}} of basic education. Chinese government statistics indicated that of a total population of nearly 1.1 billion in 1985, about 230 million people were illiterate or semiliterate. The difficulty of mastering written Chinese makes raising the literacy rate particularly difficult. In <b>general,</b> <b>language</b> reform was intended to make writing and the standard language easier to learn, which in turn would foster both literacy and linguistic unity and serve as a foundation for a simpler written language. In 1951 the party issued a directive that inaugurated a three-part plan for language reform. The plan sought to establish universal comprehension of a standardized common language, simplify written characters, and introduce, where possible, romanized forms based on the Latin alphabet. In 1956 Putonghua (Modern Standard Chinese) was introduced as the language of instruction in schools and in the national broadcast media, and by 1977 it was in use throughout China, particularly in the government and party, and in education. Although in 1987 the government continued to endorse the goal of universalizing putonghua, hundreds of regional and local dialects continued to be spoken, complicating interregional communication.|$|E

This paper investigates issues {{to be considered for}} the design of an XML-based <b>general</b> music markup <b>language.</b> Most present efforts focus on CWN (Common Western Notation), yet that system addresses {{only a fraction of the}} domain of music. It is argued that a <b>general</b> music markup <b>language</b> should consider more than just CWN. A framework for such a comprehensive <b>general</b> music markup <b>language</b> is proposed. Such a <b>general</b> markup <b>language</b> should consist of modules that could be appended to core modules on a needs basis...|$|R
2500|$|The generous {{approach}} to constitutional interpretation mentioned in Ong Ah Chuan {{might be said}} to accord with the purposive approach because the use of broad and <b>general</b> <b>language</b> in Articles of the Constitution dealing with fundamental liberties suggests a parliamentary intention to give courts the discretion [...] "to interpret the Constitution based on prevailing social conditions". It may {{also be noted that}} although the court may depart from previously held constitutional interpretations, it cannot disregard the text entirely.|$|E

"Legislation, both {{statutory}} and constitutional, is enacted, it is true, from {{an experience}} of evils but its <b>general</b> <b>language</b> should not, therefore, be necessarily confined to the form that evil had theretofore taken. Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes. Therefore a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true of Constitutions. They are not ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall, 'designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.'" [...] (Weems v. United States (1910) 217 U.S. 349, 373) ...|$|E
2500|$|Without clear congressional {{intent to}} preempt, federal laws should not {{invalidate}} state programs. [...] "In a dual {{system of government}} in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to Congress." [...] While individual anticompetitive acts of state governments may be considered unwise or counterproductive, the decision to make such choices lies within the sovereign power of the states. Congress {{did not intend to}} override important state interests in passing the Sherman Act. [...] "The <b>general</b> <b>language</b> of the Sherman Act should not be interpreted to prohibit anticompetitive actions by the States in their governmental capacities as sovereign regulators." ...|$|E

2500|$|Zamenhof {{had three}} goals, {{as he wrote}} already in 1887: to create an easy {{language}}, to create a language ready to use [...] "whether the language be universally accepted or not" [...] and to find some means to get many people learn the language. So Zamenhof's intention was not only to create an easy-to-learn language to foster international understanding as a <b>general</b> <b>language,</b> but also to create a language for immediate use by a (small) language community. Esperanto was {{to serve as an}} international auxiliary language, that is, as a universal second language, not to replace ethnic languages. This goal was widely shared among Esperanto speakers {{in the early decades of}} the movement. Later, Esperanto speakers began to see the language and the culture that had grown up around it as ends in themselves, even if Esperanto is never adopted by the United Nations or other international organizations.|$|E
2500|$|Secondly, Ritchie {{also held}} that Parliament {{did not intend}} the Canadian Bill of Rights to {{fundamentally}} change or alter any constitutional scheme such as those contained in the Indian Act and, in particular, those provisions which constitute a [...] "necessary structure [...] [...] [...] for the internal administration {{of the life of}} Indians on Reserves and their entitlement to the use and benefit of Crown lands"? It was a widely accepted convention, he argues, that an Act, in which Parliament exercises its constitutional functions, can only be changed or amended [...] "by plain statutory language expressly enacted for the [...] purpose." [...] With respect to this case, he contended that Parliament did not intend to amend the Indian Act with the [...] "use of broad <b>general</b> <b>language</b> directed at the statutory proclamation of the fundamental rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Canadians [...] [...] [...] Citing the case of Barker v. Edger with approval and applying the Privy Council's reasoning in that case, Ritchie concluded that the Canadian Bill of Rights, likewise, did not and cannot amend the Indian Act. For good measure, Ritchie also noted that Justice Pigeon came to similar conclusion in Drybones.|$|E

Its ulterior uses, as respects the general course of our {{intellectual}} operations, hardly require illustration, being in fact the acknowledged uses of <b>general</b> <b>language.</b> They amount substantially to this, that the inductions may be made once for all: a single careful interrogation of experience may suffice, and the result may be registered {{in the form of a}} general proposition, which is committed to memory or to writing, and from which afterward we have only to syllogize. The particulars of our experiments may then be dismissed from the memory, in which it would be impossible to retain so great a multitude of details; while the knowledge which those details afforded for future use, and which would otherwise be lost as soon as the observations were forgotten, or as their record became too bulky for reference, is retained in a commodious and immediately available shape by means of <b>general</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E

60|$|Against this {{advantage}} {{is to be}} set the countervailing inconvenience, that inferences originally made on insufficient evidence become consecrated, and, as it were, hardened into general maxims; and the mind cleaves to them from habit, after it has outgrown any liability to be misled by similar fallacious appearances if they were {{now for the first}} time presented; but having forgotten the particulars, it does not think of revising its own former decision.
