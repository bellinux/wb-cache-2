40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{suggested}} a new methodology {{to estimate the}} probability of default of a country {{as a function of}} other macroeconomics variables.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{theoretical and empirical}} study explaining and analysing the existence {{and the development of}} bond yield differentials among EU eurobonds issued between 1991 and 2002. A discrete-time two-asset model explains that the yield differential between two countries that issue bonds in the same currency depends on their default probabilities, the liquidity of their bond markets, and the investors ’ risk aversion towards credit risk. In the empirical part, we show that the interest differential between EU countries and the benchmark country Germany depends on the fiscal perfor-mance of the issuer states. The interest rate spread increases with the debt and deficit level of the <b>issuer</b> <b>country.</b> Also the investors ’ attitude towards credit risk helps to explain the bond yield spreads between EU countries and Germany. In periods of high risk aversion towards credit risk, which is measured as the yield differential between low grade corporate bonds and government bonds in the USA, the interest rate differentials tend to increase, which reflects the investors ’ tendency towards more liquid and risk-free bond markets...|$|E

Consistent with this, our results indicate that pre-event information asymmetries may have been higher for banks than for non-banks in the sample period. Some of the variation in CAR between the industries are found to be explained by firm-specific, market-specific and issue-specific characteristics. First, regulated firms are found to issue equity more frequently than unregulated firms in volatile periods and in locally depressed economies.

40|$|As {{the world}} economy and {{financial}} markets become increasingly more integrated, cross-boarder securities transaction becomes a daily event. Because Unite States has the world’s largest and arguably most liquid capital markets, it has attracted {{a significant number of}} foreign companies to cross-list their stocks in a U. S. stock exchange. Unavoidably, such transactions will not only bring out fortune, but also disputes between transacting parties. Relying on the powerful federal securities law, U. S. investors who have bought or sold such stocks have routinely sued foreign stock issuers through class action when the stock prices went down, alleging their loss is caused by the issuer’s misdeeds, such as a failure to disclose material financial information. Although such misdeeds, if established, usually affect both U. S. investors and their foreign counterparts, the latter could easily be dismissed by federal courts on jurisdiction or legal standing grounds when they try to join the action. In order to show the existence of subject matter jurisdiction, foreign investors who have transacted in the stocks need to pass {{one or both of the}} two jurisdictional tests developed by federal courts. The “conduct” test is based on fraudulent conduct that took place within the United States, even though “the allegedly fraudulent transactions involved foreign investors, foreign sellers, or foreign securities. ” The other is called “effects” test, which requires subject matter jurisdiction be based on an adverse effects on American investors despite the foreign involvement in the allegedly fraudulent transactions. The determination of subject matter jurisdiction is “a very fact-intensive exercise,” and foreign investors could be denied the access to a federal court due to factual variations. Moreover, if a class action is particularly brought under section 11 of the Securities Act or section 9 (e) of the Exchange Act, foreign investors may be excluded for another reason—their shares may have been bought from a foreign exchange and therefore, they cannot satisfy the registration requirement under these two sections. Excluding foreign investors from securities class action while entertaining American investors’ actions is unfair because the foreign investors may not only be denied the same protection, but also be forced to pay for the loss of their American counterparts when the assets of their company are used to pay for the judgment rendered by federal courts. This discrepant treatment of shareholders based on residence arises because the federal substantive and procedural law may make it easier for investors to receive compensation in the U. S. than in the <b>issuer’s</b> home <b>country,</b> even when the underlying claim is the same. Such a prospect is especially possible if the level of investor protection in the <b>issuer’s</b> home <b>country,</b> such as China, is much less than that usually found in developed economies, such as United States. In 2002, the Supreme People’s Court of China issued Several Regulations Concerning the Adjudication of Civil Compensation of Securities Cases Based upon Misrepresentation (to be called Several Regulations, supra). Although this regulation would for the first time allow the Chinese courts to accept private law suits based on misrepresentation, it has laid down some substantial procedural limitations on a defrauded investor right to sue an issuer for misdeeds. The author believes that the current judicial interpretation of the extra-territorial application of the federal securities law is against the equal treatment principle of the traditional corporate law. Such unequal treatment is not justified because the affected foreign shareholders did not bargain for such an arrangement. Moreover, the unequal treatment will degrade the market integrity and will hurt the U. S. interests in the longer run. Therefore, the Court and the legislators should consider making adjustment to the current approach towards such litigations. Possible solutions may include extending subject matter jurisdiction to foreign investors, through a contractual arrangement where transacting parties could negotiate a dispute resolution regardless of the scope of the transaction, or through a reciprocal treaty arrangement so the applicable forum and law could be uniform for all investors involved...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the information and liquidity effects of corporate bond underpricing in the euro bond market. Most of the existing literature on new security issue underpricing focuses on equities; however, recent studies have found similar underpricing for corporate bond IPOs. This thesis adds to the existing research by investigating the relatively young euro corporate bond market, while also providing evidence on the effects of the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008 on corporate bond underpricing. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The sample consists of 1813 euro-denominated bonds from 360 individual non-financial corporations. 153 bond issues are identified as bond IPOs, or the inaugural bond issued by a company, while the rest are defined as seasoned bond offerings (SBOs). The sample ranges from 1999 to 2013, and includes <b>issuers</b> from 25 <b>countries</b> from the European Union and European Free Trade Association. Underpricing is indicated by initial returns, adjusted with the return of similar bonds in Barclays Capital bond indexes. A positive initial return indicates underpricing. Initial returns for IPOs and SBOs are first investigated and compared in panels divided according to several categories to test for information and liquidity effects. Next, multivariate OLS regressions are performed with several models to control for other factors and assess the relative importance of the determinants of underpricing. Matching samples of IPOs and SBOs are then constructed to check the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Significant underpricing is found in both the IPO (71 basis points) and SBO (35 basis points) samples. Information problem theories receive significant support from the results, while no liquidity effects are found. The financial crisis of leads to an increase in underpricing of 61 basis points on average and 78 basis points for IPOs. The financial also increases the significance of many information related factors, while reducing the additional underpricing of high yield bonds relative to investment grade bonds...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyIn {{the second}} quarter of 2002, {{conditions}} in global financial markets worsened as investor confidence deteriorated and risk aversion heightened. The revelation of corporate accounting irregularities in mature markets negatively affected investors' sentiment, causing a rebalance of portfolios in favor of higher quality assets and away from equities and low-grade bonds. Countries seen as higher risk were adversely affected by this rebalancing of portfolios. A number of Latin American countries were the focus of investors' concerns, in particular Brazil, where developments during {{the second quarter}} reflected investors' uncertainties about continuity of market friendly policies after the presidential elections, as well as worries about the possibly unsustainable dynamics of the Brazilian public sector debt. Access to international capital markets declined significantly to low-grade issuers in Latin America. Given that sovereign borrowers had covered most of their financing needs for this year, Latin American corporate borrowers, in particular, were vulnerable to the closure of international capital markets. Credit enhancements, such as secured bond issues and insurance from a third party, were required from corporate <b>issuers</b> in high-risk <b>countries.</b> By the end of the quarter, with international capital markets closed for unsecured issues, top tier corporates in Latin America started to turn to domestic markets as a source of financing. Although during most of the second quarter investors discriminated among emerging markets based on their policy stance and track record, {{toward the end of the}} quarter signs of contagion from Brazil emerged, as the correlation of emerging market bond movements with developments in Brazil increased (Table 1). In addition, contagion from Argentina was felt by neighboring countries through banking and real sector channels. A banking crisis in Uruguay was precipitated by capital outflows as liquidity constrained Argentine investors withdrew savings from their neighbor country's banks. The increased volatility in Brazil and contagion from Argentina led to a great number of credit downgrades during the second quarter. After Standard & Poor's upgraded Chile's A- foreign currency debt outlook to positive from stable in April, only downgrades followed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to compare our {{empirical}} findings related to the level of disclosure ensured by corporate governance codes in force in European Union member states, by referring in this respect to OECD principles, with prior related research results. The comparative analysis is justified by the fact that our paper approached corporate governance form transparency and disclosure perspective, using other framework for comparison and a different methodology for measuring the disclosure level (Jaccard's similarity coefficient) than those used in previous studies (Latent Semantic Analysis technique or the Leximetric one). The comparative analysis performed considered various features of corporate governance codes already studied, such as their <b>issuer</b> type or <b>country's</b> legal regime. The research methodology used for achieving our goal is based on econometric analysis using various statistical tools, like descriptive analysis, mainly based on computing means, and correlations for identifying the relationship between our results and those of others researchers. The results of the performed analysis reveal that our empirical results, providing a disclosure index developed for all European Union member states, are not consistent with prior research findings related to disclosure as “primary theme” of corporate governance codes. On the other hand, by analysis these codes considering their issuer type we have reached to the same conclusion as other researchers interested on this same topic. Thus, those codes issued in collaboration of several institutions, coming from various economic fields, reached the highest level of disclosure, while those developed by industry or trade associations and groups proved to be the less interested in transparency. Similar was the conclusion reached after comparing the level of disclosure in corporate governance codes by grouping them according to countries’ legal regimes. The most relevant result in this respect is that Common law regime ensures the highest level of transparency through corporate governance requirements. Finally, we can assert that the compliance of corporate governance codes with OECD principles is consistent with prior research findings related to disclosure considering codes’ issuer type and countries’ legal regime...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies how International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans {{interact}} with private capital flows {{and how they}} affect the level of welfare of borrower countries and private lenders. The first chapter presents a model highlighting {{the fact that the}} IMF has both de jure and de facto seniority rights over private creditors. It is shown that IMF lending affects borrowers and lenders in different ways. Ex-post, once the initial borrowing decisions have been made, an IMF intervention always make the borrower country better off. The effects on private lenders depend {{on the size of the}} senior intervention and on what they expect to get in case that the IMF does not intervene. For some parameter values, IMF interventions make existing lenders worse off when the liquidity situation is either good or weak and make them better off when it is in an intermediate range. This is consistent with the empirical evidence presented in Chapter 2. The expectation of a future IMF intervention may reduce the level of borrowing and borrowers' welfare ex-ante, because seniority allows the IMF to lend in cases where it is not socially optimal to do so. This effect is contrary to the moral hazard view where "too much" rescuing leads to "too much" borrowing. Thus, the country may have incentives to commit today not to borrow tomorrow from the IMF in the future, although this promise is not time consistent. The second chapter, which is a joint work with Ashoka Mody, analyzes empir- ically if IMF programs influence the ability of developing <b>country</b> <b>issuers</b> to tap international bond markets and whether they improve spreads paid on the bonds issued. It is found that Fund programs do not provide a uniformly favorable signaling effect. Instead, the evidence is most consistent with a positive e®ect of IMF programs when they are viewed as likely to lead to policy reform and when undertaken before economic fundamentals have deteriorated significantly. The size of the Fund's program matters, but the credibility of a joint commitment by the country and the IMF appears to be critical...|$|R
40|$|Mexico's Telmex {{undertook}} {{the first}} future-flow securitization transaction in 1987. From then through 1999, the principal credit rating agencies rated more than 200 transactions totaling $ 47. 3 billion. Studying several sources, the authors draw {{conclusions about the}} rationale for using this asset class, {{the size of its}} unrealized potential, and the main constraints on its growth. Typically the borrowing entity (the originator) sells its future product (receivable) directly or indirectly to an offshore special purpose vehicle (SPV), which issues the debt instrument. Designated international customers make their payments for the exports directly to an offshore collection account managed by a trustee. The collection agent makes principal and interest payments to investors and pays the rest to the originator. This transaction structure allows many investment-grade borrowers in developing countries to pierce the sovereign credit ceiling and get longer-term financing at significantly lower interest costs. The investment-grade rating attracts a wider group of investors. And establishing a credit history for the borrower makes it easier for it to access capital markets later, at lower costs. This asset class is attractive forinvestors-especially buy-and-hold investors, such as insurance companies-because of its good credit rating and stellar performance in good and bad times. Defaults in this asset class are rare, despite frequent liquidity crises in developing <b>countries.</b> Latin American <b>issuers</b> (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela) dominate this market. Nearly half the dollar amounts raised are backed by receivables on oil and gas. Recent transactions have involved receivables on credit cards, telephones, workers'remittances, taxes, and exports. The potential for securing future receivables is several times the current level ($ 10 billion annually). The greatest potential lies outside Latin America, in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (fuel and mineral exports), the Middle East (oil), and South Asia (remittances, credit card vouchers, and telephone receivables). One constraint on growth is the paucity of good collateral in developing countries. Crude oil may be better collateral than refined petroleum. Agricultural commodities are harder to securitize. Another constraint: the dearth of high-quality <b>issuers</b> in developing <b>countries.</b> Securitization deals are complex, with high preparation costs and long lead times. The ideal candidates are investment-grade entities (in terms of local currency) in sub-investment-grade countries (in terms of foreign currency). Establishing indigenous rating agencies can slash out-of-pocket costs. Developing standardized templates for certain types of securitizations might help. A master trust arrangement can reduce constraints on size. Multilateral institutions might consider providing seed money and technical assistance for contingent private credit facilities.
