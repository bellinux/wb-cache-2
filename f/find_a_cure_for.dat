The gameplay borrows elements from various video game genres, occasionally switching between them and the main role-playing-based gameplay.|$|E

5000|$|Comments by opponents: The {{state should}} not borrow money {{to finance a}} cancer {{research}} program while {{the state has a}} fiscal surplus and could pay for the program out of general revenue. The interest on $3 billion in general obligation bonds is approximately $1.6 billion. By borrowing $3 billion to pay for the cancer research program, the state would end up paying $4.6 billion for the cancer research program. The extra $1.6 billion would be used to pay the interest on the general obligation bonds instead of being used for cancer research. The extra $1.6 billion could be better spent by providing other benefits to the residents of the state, such as expanding the CHIP program, paying for schools, or building roads. <b>Finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> cancer is <b>an</b> international issue.
