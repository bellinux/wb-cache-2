All 2CVs from this date can run on unleaded fuel. 1970s cars featured rectangular headlights, except the Spécial model. In 1971 the front bench seat was replaced with two <b>individual</b> <b>seats.</b> In 1972 2CVs were fitted with standard three-point seat belts. In 1973 new seat covers, a padded single-spoke steering wheel and ashtrays were introduced.|$|E

25|$|In August 2008 the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) {{announced}} that it had approved plans to redevelop the ground, involving expanding its capacity to 40,000. Development plans showed a reconfiguration of the playing surface and a remodelled western stand. The redevelopment would make the ground a viable option for hosting Australian Football League games as well as international soccer and rugby. The state and federal Governments each pledged $25m to the project, leaving the SACA to raise at least $45m. The SACA planned for the new stand to be ready {{in time for the}} 2010–11 Ashes series. The Western grandstands were torn down in June 2009 and a single Western stand was developed in its place ahead of the 2010-11 Ashes series. The new Western stand incorporates 14,000 <b>individual</b> <b>seats</b> and features improved shading conditions and amenities for SACA members.|$|E
500|$|Even {{while the}} {{economic}} boom continued, the LCL vote gradually declined after 1941. [...] The LCL never held more than 23 seats during Playford's tenure due to being almost nonexistent in Adelaide. [...] With few exceptions, its support in the capital {{was limited to the}} eastern crescent and the Holdfast Bay area even at the height of Playford's power. [...] It relied on favourable preferences from minor parties and independents and the malapportioned electoral system in order to stay in office. It did, however, win a majority of actual votes, barring 1944 and 1953, on a two-party-preferred basis until 1962. Labor had begun to combat the Playmander by directing its efforts at <b>individual</b> <b>seats,</b> and abandoning a statewide campaign. Slowly, seats were whittled away—the loss of Norwood in 1953 was followed by the losses of Murray, Millicent and Frome in 1956, and Mt Gambier and Wallaroo in 1957–8 by-elections. Playford's dominance over the party and his ignorance of the wishes of its broad membership base brought about a degree of disillusionment, and the party machine began to decay. The dominance stopped {{the emergence of a new}} generation of political talent, and had a [...] "stultifying" [...] effect. Although the Playmander ensured his ongoing electoral success, and Playford was credited with South Australia's economic success, the LCL polled a lower percentage than the corresponding Liberal government at federal level.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the Toronto Rocket subway trains on the Yonge–University–Spadina and Sheppard lines, all of the T-1 series trains were transferred to the Bloor–Danforth line where they replaced the remaining H-4 and H-6 series subway trains. The T-1s are now the only trains operating on the line. The remaining H-4 trains were retired from revenue service throughout the fall of 2011, and the last cars were decommissioned on January 27, 2012. They were the last version of TTC trains that were not equipped with air-conditioning systems (but instead used ceiling fans); they were also the last of which to be outfitted with larger orange upholstered bench seating and were mainly used on weekdays, most often during rush hour several years before their retirement. [...] The H-4s also had a similar interior design based from the H-2 subway cars. [...] The H-6 series trains (which had bright orange doors and panels, <b>individual</b> <b>seats,</b> along with light brown floors, cream walls and brown simulated wood grain panels) were retired from service between 2013 and 2014; the final run for the last H-6 series train took place on June 20, 2014. In the summer of 2016, a few TR trains were used on Line 2 because of an air conditioning malfunction in numerous individual T1 cars, combined with a hotter than average summer.|$|E

2500|$|On June 21, 2007, the University's Board of Regents {{approved}} a $226 million renovation (equivalent to $ million in [...] ) and expansion project for Michigan Stadium.

2500|$|The stadium was a {{complicated}} structure with its seating layered in seven separate levels. The lowest, or [...] "100 Level", extended only part {{way around the}} structure, between roughly the 25-yard lines for football games and near the two dugouts for baseball. The [...] "200 Level" [...] comprised field-level boxes, and the [...] "300 Level" [...] housed what were labeled [...] "Terrace Boxes". [...] These three levels collectively made up the [...] "Lower Stands". [...] The [...] "400 Level" [...] was reserved for the press and dignitaries; the upper level began with [...] "500 Level" [...] (or [...] "loge boxes"), the [...] "600 Level" [...] (upper reserved, or <b>individual</b> <b>seats),</b> and finally, the [...] "700 Level" [...] (general admission for baseball). Originally, the seats were in shades of brown, terra cotta, orange and yellow, {{to look like an}} autumn day, but in 1995 and 1996, blue seats replaced the fall-hued ones.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Porto {{approved}} {{a plan to}} build a new stadium to accommodate and meet the demands of larger attendances, but the project only moved forward with the purchase of [...] of land in {{the eastern side of the}} city in 1947. Designed by Portuguese architects Oldemiro Carneiro and Aires de Sá, the construction of the Estádio do Futebol Clube do Porto– better known as Estádio das Antas (Antas Stadium) for the neighbourhood where it was built– began in January 1950, one month after the first stone was symbolically laid. Two years later, on 28 May 1952, the stadium was inaugurated with a ceremony, featuring the presence of the President of the Republic Francisco Craveiro Lopes, and a match against Benfica, which Porto lost 2–8. The stadium's initial layout had an open east sector (Marathon Door), which was closed in 1976 with the construction of a two-tier stand that raised the capacity to 70,000. In 1986, works to lower the pitch and build an additional tier in the place of the athletics and cycling track were concluded, setting the capacity to a new maximum of 95,000. As stadium safety regulations became stricter during the following decade, the placing of <b>individual</b> <b>seats</b> brought the capacity of the Estádio das Antas down to 55,000 by 1997.|$|E
2500|$|The 1977 models had {{numerous}} changes. Most noticeable {{was a new}} front end that AMC intended to make exclusive for the Gremlin line, consisting of independent squared headlight bezels with rounded corners and an egg-crate smile-shaped grille carrying over the rectangular parking lights of {{the previous two years}} and a new front bumper. A second [...] "American" [...] emblem was applied over the front edge of the hood on the right corner. The two-point seatbelts were replaced by fixed three-point units on both sedan models. Wagons included three-point retractable units as factory issue. The Carter RBS carburetor was discontinued leaving only the YF model on the 258 six. Two-door sedans with the manual transmissions now featured a floor-mounted gearshift with low-back fold-down <b>individual</b> <b>seats,</b> while models with automatic transmissions retained the bench seat with split folding backs and a column-mounted shifter. This also meant manual units incorporated a safety lock lever in their steering column ignition switch shared with American Rally model. The seats and door panels were slightly modified from the last year. A new [...] "American" [...] emblem with different typography was applied to glove box door. The [...] "258" [...] rear quarter panel emblems were replaced by new [...] "4.2" [...] units.|$|E
50|$|The stadium was {{initially}} constructed after the Second World War {{and had a}} capacity for 7,500 spectators.

2500|$|In {{that first}} match for which Maracanã had been built, Brazil beat Mexico {{with a final}} score 4–0, with Ademir {{becoming}} the first scorer of a competitive goal at the stadium with his 30th-minute strike. Ademir had two goals in total, plus one each from Baltasar and Jair. The match was refereed by Englishman George Reader. [...] Five of Brazil's six games at the tournament were played at Maracanã (the exception being their 2–2 draw with Switzerland in São Paulo). Eventually, Brazil progressed to the final round, facing Uruguay in the match (part of a round-robin final phase) {{that turned out to}} be the tournament-deciding match on 16 July 1950. Brazil only needed a draw to finish as champion, but Uruguay won the game 2–1, shocking and silencing the massive crowd. This defeat on home soil instantly became a significant event in Brazilian history, being known popularly as the Maracanazo. The official attendance of the final game was 199,854, with the actual attendance estimated to be about 210,000. [...] In any case, it was the largest crowd ever to see a football game—a record that is highly unlikely to be threatened in an era when most international matches are played in all-seater stadiums. [...] At the time of the World Cup, the stadium was mostly grandstands with no <b>individual</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the late-1940s the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad {{was seeking}} {{a way to}} {{increase}} capacity on commuter trains serving Chicago, Illinois, without having to add more cars to handle {{the increasing number of}} commuters. The problem faced by the Burlington Route was that its main terminal in Chicago, Chicago Union Station, charged the railroads serving it by the length a given train, and the Burlington wanted to avoid such charges. Because of the line's satisfaction with Budd's products they approached Budd seeking to find a solution. Budd proposed to build coaches that were taller than the typical lightweight passenger car while keeping the streamline car's length of 85 feet, with the cars having a capacity 50% more than previous commuter cars. To address the issue of the conductor collecting tickets without having to climb a set of stairs, the upper level was designed {{in such a way that}} its center portion was open so that the conductor could reach the tickets from upper-level passengers. Two rows of <b>individual</b> <b>seats,</b> one on each side of the car, provided for the increase in seating capacity. The unique design of the upper level's open center section led to the cars being called [...] "Gallery" [...] cars. With the design approved by the Burlington an order was submitted for 30 cars. These cars, built as Budd lot 9679-041, were delivered to the line between August 1950 and January 1951 and not only marked a change in how the commuters were handled but also were the first cars in commuter service to have air conditioning. The Burlington equipped its earlier cars with air conditioning as well, once the new cars had entered service.|$|E
