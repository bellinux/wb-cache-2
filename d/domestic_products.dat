5|$|Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 {{by heavy}} vehicle {{importers}} {{because the two}} companies had access to {{a large share of}} the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply. The importers' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very <b>domestic</b> <b>products</b> and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in Finland. According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. VAT and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy vehicle chassis. Eventually, the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{traditional}} indicator of Green GDP and EDP, which ignored the ecological content when {{used to assess}} the regional sustainable development level, we proposed a new indicator, "EcoDP". which consists of five sub-indicators: eco-service <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> eco-disaster <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> eco-construction <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> eco-threat <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> and eco-protection cost input, to distinguish {{the traditional}} EDP; we also suggest that the "EcoDP" should rather be divided into two main types: the "EcoDP value-stocked" and the "EcoDP value-added". An analysis is carried out of China's "EcoDP" change from 1999 to 2008, providing the following figures for the past 10 years: eco-service <b>domestic</b> <b>product</b> rose by 0. 11 trillion yuan; eco-disaster <b>domestic</b> <b>product</b> increased by (sic) 1. 03 trillion; eco-construction <b>domestic</b> <b>product</b> dropped by (sic) 9. 8 billion; eco-threat <b>domestic</b> <b>product</b> rose by (sic) 114. 4 billion; eco-protection cost input grew by (sic) 431. 1 billion; and then we discussed the reasons for this change in China's "EcoDP" from the perspectives of ecosystem, environment, resources and energies. Finally, based on various uncertainties regarding the research methodology adopted, the paper considers how to conduct quantified research and assessment for regional sustainable development in a comprehensive way in the future, in terms of GDP, EDP and social <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> like HDI.

25|$|By {{the early}} 1940s, the Soviet economy had become {{relatively}} self-sufficient; {{for most of}} the period until the creation of Comecon, only a very small share of <b>domestic</b> <b>products</b> was traded internationally. After the creation of the Eastern Bloc, external trade rose rapidly. Still the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade. Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s. During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry. At the same time, the Soviet Union became the largest arms exporter to the Third World. Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states.|$|E
25|$|A {{flat tax}} system and income taxes overall are not {{inherently}} border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported {{to a foreign}} country (see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price). Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. The <b>domestic</b> <b>products</b> could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would impact the global competitiveness of a country. However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed Border Tax Equity Act in the U.S. attempts this). Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit {{is a violation of}} the World Trade Organization agreement. Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally.|$|E

25|$|Opposition to {{this new}} policy of armed {{neutrality}} was weak in that all major parties, such as the Conservatives, Agrarians and Liberal People's Party, supported the government's position. On a regular basis, beginning in 1936, the Swedish government requested increases in its defense budget to strengthen its military preparedness as the international situation continued to worsen. The actual military budget from 1936 to 1939 increased many times over. In 1936, military spending was $37,000,000; 1937, $50,000,000; 1938, $58,575,000; and in 1939 it was at $322,325,000. After the war began, military spending peaked in 1942 at $527,575,000 in one year alone. With the increased need of an expanded military, Swedish industry was required to not only supply the increased demand for <b>domestic</b> <b>products,</b> exacerbated by the German blockade of the North Sea, but also had to meet an increased demand in military armaments for the Swedish government.

Much of the mercantile activity in Malacca, therefore, relied on the flow of goods {{from other parts of}} the region. Among Malacca's most crucial functions was its role as both a collection centre for cloves, nutmeg and mace from the Spice Islands and a redistribution centre for cotton textiles from ports in Gujarat, the Coromandel Coast, Malabar Coast and Bengal. Other goods traded in Malacca included porcelain, silk and iron from China and natural products of the Malay archipelago, such as camphor, sandalwood, spices, fish, fish roe and seaweed. From the coastal regions on both sides of Malacca Straits came forest products; rattan, resin, roots and wax, and some gold and tin.

His supporters believe that he had solid social priorities, including his government's extensive funding of education, health care and the environment. Critical indicators, such as infant mortality, literacy rate, and economic well-being, are among the best in the continent. During his rule, the Seychelles avoided the volatile political climate and underdevelopment in neighbouring island countries such as the Comoros and Madagascar. His critics believe that he and his party are responsible for torture and other human rights abuses involving opponents of the government, allegedly including the death of a prominent dissident in London, Gérard Hoarau. After the 1977 coup, a significant portion of the population, including the deposed President Mancham, fled to the UK and South Africa due to political persecution and fear of the new government's alignment with the Soviet Union, Tanzania and North Korea. René also faced international pressure regarding his government's former requirement that all applicants to the country's secondary education system graduate a compulsory National Youth Service, which included traditional curricula, political education and, according to some critics, ideological indoctrination and paramilitary training. This requirement was abandoned after the transition to multiparty rule and the organisation was eventually abolished entirely. Critics of the René regime also call out perceived corruption and cronyism in his term.|$|E

500|$|Supporters of {{independence}} for Puerto Rico {{argue that the}} U.S. favored {{the establishment of the}} present Commonwealth status to create a perpetual consumer base for U.S. and foreign products and services. Foreign products and services are redirected to Puerto Rico and other [...] "unincorporated" [...] lands of the United States to satisfy a portion of foreign trade agreements, while allowing <b>domestic</b> <b>products</b> and services a greater [...] "home" [...] market share. Another argument by the independence movement is that the Macheteros are continuing the historical rebellion that Puerto Ricans such as Pedro Albizu Campos and the Nationalist Party have waged, against U.S. domination of the island. It is known, for example, that Los Macheteros deliberately chose September 12 for their Águila Blanca assault on the Wells Fargo depot, because September 12 was the birthday of Puerto Rican Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. Beginning in the 1960s, the FBI infiltrated Puerto Rico's free press and political circles in order to monitor and disrupt efforts related to independence movements like Los Macheteros. This operation was part of COINTELPRO. The EPB's rebuttal to being classified as a terrorist organization is that per the definition adopted in the 1979 Conference on International Terrorism that posits [...] "deliberate, systematic murder, maiming and menacing of the innocent to inspire fear in order to earn political gains", they do not qualify as such since their targets are strictly the American military or law enforcement and that they have never targeted civilians.|$|E
