Mother Jones wrote: [...] "Texans <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> 15 years what Red Headed Stranger finally revealed to the world – that Nelson is simply too brilliant a songwriter, interpreter, and singer – just too damn universal – to be defined as merely a country artist".|$|E
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Compass {{problems}} {{are one of}} the cited phrases in many Triangle incidents.

2500|$|In 1950, Robert Dale Segee of Circleville, Ohio {{claimed he}} was {{responsible}} for setting the circus fire. Segee, a [...] roustabout for the show from June 30 to July 14, 1944, when he was about 14 years old, said he had a nightmare in which an Indian riding on a [...] "flaming horse" [...] told him to set fires. He further claimed that after this nightmare his mind went blank, and that he did not come out of this state until the circus fire had already been set. It was said Segee fit the description of a serial arsonist right out of a psychiatrist's textbook. Segee also knew intimate details of the incident, which some believed only the real arsonist could <b>have</b> <b>known.</b> <b>For</b> instance, it was never made public that the circus had two smaller fires of undetermined origin prior to the tragedy. Segee admitted setting both of them as well. These statements, Segee added, were in response to a later dream he'd had of a woman standing in flames urging him to confess.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{influence}} of Dilthey, Hans-Georg Gadamer writes the following: [...] "As far as Dilthey is concerned, we all know today what I <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> a long time: namely {{that it is a}} mistake to conclude on the basis of the citation in Being and Time that Dilthey was especially influential in the development of Heidegger's thinking in the mid-1920s. This dating of {{the influence}} is much too late." [...] He adds that by the fall of 1923 it was plain that Heidegger felt [...] "the clear superiority of Count Yorck over the famous scholar, Dilthey." [...] Gadamer nevertheless makes clear that Dilthey's influence was important in helping the youthful Heidegger [...] "in distancing himself from the systematic ideal of Neo-Kantianism, as Heidegger acknowledges in Being and Time." [...] Based on Heidegger's earliest lecture courses, in which Heidegger already engages Dilthey's thought prior to the period Gadamer mentions as [...] "too late", scholars as diverse as Theodore Kisiel and David Farrell Krell have argued for the importance of Diltheyan concepts and strategies in the formation of Heidegger's thought.|$|E

Since all Hansen had to go on was the word of David Stanley and his mother, he could not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> sure if there really had been money in the envelope. In fact, Hansen never {{actually}} mentioned money when he produced the envelopes, only asking {{whether or not there was}} any correspondence between the AD's office and the Stanley family. By refusing to acknowledge that he had, in fact, sent something to Stanley's family and then backtracking when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statement, Hansen knew Parker was hiding something. Hansen also admitted that Parker could've just lied about the contents of the envelopes and his investigation would've been stopped cold. As Hansen said years after the incident, [...] "That was the defining moment. All (Parker) had to say was, 'I'm glad you asked, I sent him an insurance form,' and we would've had to start all over, because every dot that we connected started from the premise that we know he sent something." ...|$|E

2500|$|King's {{switch from}} the BDO to rival {{organization}} the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) created much debate and controversy. During the 2007 BDO World Darts Championship {{there was much}} speculation that King and three fellow BDO players (Michael van Gerwen, Jelle Klaasen and Vincent van der Voort) would be switching to the PDC after the World Championships. King was angry that rumours had surfaced and even threatened to quit the tournament as the speculation heightened even stating, [...] "I'm really {{not happy with the}} treatment I've had today, not just from one person but from {{a lot of people who}} I <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> many minutes". Despite claiming to BDO press officer Robert Holmes that he would [...] "rather eat raisins with teeth than play for the PDC" [...] King announced his switch to the PDC on 6 February 2007 in a bid to [...] "further his career". Having reached the semi-final of the 2007 BDO World Championships losing to eventual champion Martin Adams, King had signed a contract confirming he would play at the 2008 tournament due to a clause in all contracts of BDO players stating that if they reach the semi-finals of the World Championship they are obliged to return the following year, with champions committing themselves to three years. King's switch meant that the BDO threatened legal action against King.|$|E
