40|$|In humans, {{intestinal}} defences develop during gestation and, at full term, {{have the}} capacity to respond in an appropriate manner to infectious agents and foreign antigens. Before an active protective response can occur, however, the gut must first be exposed to colonizing bacteria. Colonization with diverse intestinal microbes is necessary for the development of important gut defenses such as the synthesis and secretion of polymeric immunoglobulin A and the generation of a balanced T helper (Th) cell response. Insights into normal immune physiological development of the gut have been made by studying the <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal</b> and intestinal defenses. These studies have provided insights into the physiology of immune responses. Two important immunological functions are the secretion of polymeric immunoglobulin A to protect the intestinal surface against harmful stimuli and inhibition of the systemic response to commensal bacteria and food proteins (eg, oral tolerance) to prevent chronic inflammation. Neither function exists in the germ-free state, but rapidly develops after conventionalization (colonization) of the <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal.</b> In the present review, the importance of bacterial colonization on the appearance of normal mucosal immune function and to the clinical consequences of inadequate colonization to the development of disease will be discussed. For example, excessive Th 2 activity can lead to atopy, whereas Th 1 predominance is found in conditions such as Helicobacter pylori gastritis and Crohn's disease. With the eradication of infectious diseases in developed countries in the past three decades, the incidence of atopic and autoimmune diseases has increased. This epidemiological observation has been explained by the 'hygiene hypothesis', which suggests that a reduction in microbial burden by public health measures has contributed to an immunological imbalance in the intestine. A family of pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptors) on gut lymphoid and epithelial cells mediates innate immune responses to bacterial molecular patterns and, thereby, orchestrates acquired immunity. As the role of bacterial communication within the gut (bacterial-epithelial cross-talk) is clarified, physicians should be able to modulate gut immune responses, for example, by the use of probiotics...|$|R

To study the role of neutrophils in LPS-induced endotoxemia, we developed a new mouse model, PMNDTR mice, in which injection of diphtheria toxin induces selective neutrophil ablation. Using this model, we found, surprisingly, that neutrophils serve to protect the host from LPS-induced lethal inflammation. This protective role was observed in conventional and <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal</b> facilities, indicating {{that it does not}} depend on a particular microbiological environment. Blockade or genetic deletion of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a key neutrophil enzyme, significantly increased mortality after LPS challenge, and adoptive transfer experiments confirmed that neutrophil-derived MPO contributes importantly to protection from endotoxemia.

Tanikawa and Associate Professor J. Tanami. In our laboratory, a new compact type of rearing unit HMC- 1 was constructed after Reyniers 2 ̆ 7 system and Gustafsson 2 ̆ 7 s apparatus in 1954. Continuously the rearing unit HMC- 2 was constructed with the useful advice given by Professor M. Miyakawa. A thermo-sterilizing plant and glass-wool filter are used for air sterilization. In order to eliminate humidity in the air a fin-coil type refrigerating desicator is used. The ventilation power of pump on the average is 60 1 per minute, and this quantity of air is sufficient for 2 rearing tanks and 1 operating tank. The rearing tank is constructed of steel 6 mm in thickness, the diameter of the tank is 60 cm and the length is 120 cm. Entire surface of the tank is covered with asbestos in 3 cm thickness. This tank has 4 glove ports and 2 viewing ports, gloves are made of artificial rubber and are fixed on the glove ports of the tank with a special ring. The operating tank is almost equal to the rearing tank in its size and shape. This tank has a chamber for the operating trap provided under it. This trap is used for moving an animal into the tank. The sterilizing food clave is a small steel tank, 25 cm in diameter and 65 cm in length. This is used for removing food, water and the other heat steriliable articles into the rearing tank. The germicidal trap is an apparatus through which all objects placed into the rearing tank, which must not be sterilized with heat, must pass. The double Seitz-filter is an apparatus through which certain kinds of solution can be filtered and sterilized. The entire system can be sterilized at the same time, but in accordance with the demands of the experiment procedures, one part of the system, either the rearing tank or the operating tank, must be separately sterilized. Because of this reason a sterilizing pipe system is constructed for that purpose. The air temperature of the rearing tank is controlled by the air temperature regulator and the hot water tank provided under part of the tank, so there must be two electric regulating system for the rearing tank. All sorts of furnishings in the rearing tanks must be provided so as not to injure the,rubber gloves during manipulation. The HMC- 2 system is arranged to form a compact unit, so the system as a whole can be set in a chamber 3. 6 m× 7. 2 m and can be used coveniently.

40|$|Although {{the effects}} of {{commensal}} bacteria on intestinal immune development seem to be profound, it remains speculative whether the gut microbiota influences extraintestinal biological functions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating autoimmune disease leading to progressive deterioration of neurological function. Although the cause of MS is unknown, microorganisms seem to be important for the onset and/or progression of disease. However, {{it is unclear how}} microbial colonization, either symbiotic or infectious, affects autoimmunity. Herein, we investigate a role for the microbiota during the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS. Mice maintained under germ-free conditions develop significantly attenuated EAE compared with conventionally colonized mice. <b>Germ-free</b> <b>animals,</b> induced for EAE, produce lower levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL- 17 A in both the intestine and spinal cord but display a reciprocal increase in CD 4 ^(+) CD 25 ^(+) Foxp 3 ^+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Mechanistically, we show that gut dendritic cells from <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals</b> are reduced in the ability to stimulate proinflammatory T cell responses. Intestinal colonization with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) is known to promote IL- 17 production in the gut; here, we show that SFBs also induced IL- 17 A–producing CD 4 ^+ T cells (Th 17) in the CNS. Remarkably, <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals</b> harboring SFBs alone developed EAE, showing that gut bacteria can affect neurologic inflammation.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{carrageenan}} {{model for}} ulcerative colitis {{has been studied}} {{in an effort to}} define the role of bacteria in the experimental disease. It was found that guinea pigs given a 5 % w/v carrageenan solution developed cecal ulcerations within 14 days which were histologically similar to lesions seen in the human disease. Bacteriological studies of the cecal contents of carrageenan recipients indicated that both the coliform and. gram negative anaerobic bacterial counts were increased as compared to bacterial counts obtained from healthy control animals. Suppression of cecal bacterial populations with oral antimicrobial agents during carrageenan challenge was used to determine whether specific microfiora populations were necessary for ulceration. It was found that antimicrobials active versus obligate anaerobes prevented cecal ulceration in carrageenan recipients, while antimicrobials active versus gram positive organisms or coliforms did not suppress ulcer development. It was also noted that <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals</b> given carrageenan did not develop typical lesions, but <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals</b> associated with a conventional microflora acquired cecal ulcerations during carrageenan challenge.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of microbiota inhabiting the intestine is increasingly apparent.

40|$|Males {{and females}} {{are known to}} have gender-specific {{differences}} in their immune system and gut microbiota composition. Whether these differences in gut microbiota composition are a cause or consequence of differences in the immune system is not known. To investigate this issue, gut microbiota from conventional males or females was transferred to <b>germ-free</b> (GF) <b>animals</b> of the same or opposing gender. We demonstrate that microbiota-independent gender differences in immunity are already present in GF mice. In particular, type I interferon signaling was enhanced in the intestine of GF females. Presumably, due to these immune differences bacterial groups, such as Alistipes, Rikenella, and Porphyromonadaceae, known to expand in the absence of innate immune defense mechanism were overrepresented in the male microbiota. The presence of these bacterial groups was associated with induction of weight loss, inflammation, and DNA damage upon transfer of the male microbiota to female GF recipients. In summary, our data suggest that microbiota-independent gender differences in the immune system select a gender-specific gut microbiota composition, which in turn further contributes to gender differences in the immune system. </p...|$|R

It is nowadays proposed that the microbiome, incapable {{to keep up with the}} changes of our life-style and feeding sources, within few years might have contributed to immune imbalances. A number of studies in <b>germ-free</b> and antibiotic-treated <b>animal</b> models support causal roles for intestinal bacteria in disease susceptibility. Probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. The rationale and the challenges of using these probiotics in management of patients, there have been so many studies performed up. in these studies findings support probiotics as a viable therapeutic method to treat intestinal flora imbalance and diseased caused by dysbiosis...|$|R
40|$|An {{intestinal}} ecosystem {{has three}} major actors, i. e., the macroorganism, the microflora and the environment. Influences of some exogenous factors on {{functions of the}} intestinal microbes and their interactions within the ecosystem in vivo, have been studied by utilizing the so-called microflora-associated characteristic (MAC) / <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal</b> characteristic (GAC) concept. The parameters were bile acid, urobilinogen, cholesterol faecal tryptic activity (FTA) mucin, beta-aspartylglycine, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The establisment of MACs h 35 germ-free rats was followed. The microbes were introduced in different ways and a faecal enema and social contacts with conventional rats gave rapidly an development of microbial functions. The establishment could be clustered into two groups, I) a rapid development probably depending on the microbes involved ll) a wider time range, probably depending on the way of introduction. The influence of diet was investigated in patients with Crohn's disease, receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and in healthy volunteers given a balanced diet, enteral nutrition (EN), by following six MACs. The results showed greater influence of TPN than EN on bile acids, cholesterol and FTA. Diarrhoea {{is one of the}} most common side-effects of antimicrobial treatment, so-called antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD). SCFAs were investigated in 31 AAD patients and the total amount SCFAs and their distribution were significantly changed compared to healthy adults. Five other MACs were also studied and formation of coprostanol and urobilinogen and faecal tryptic activity were significantly altered in the AAD patients compared to healthy persons. Six MACs were studied in nine AAD patients given a faecal enema. Most of the patients were cured within 4 days. No relapses occurred within 18 months. Different probiotics have been used in order to avoid diarrhoea connected with antimicrobial treatment and an investigation was performed to evaluate the influence of a probiotic on 7 alpha-dehydroxylation. A suspension of Lactobacillus delbruekii and Streptococcus thermophilus (LS) was given to 20 rats together with and without clindamycin. This antibiotic has a pronounced effect on most MACs h studies of healthy human and showed similar influence in rats on 7 alpha-dehydroxylation. The micbes per se in LS are not claimed to 7 alpha-dehydroxylate bile acids. In the present study, 7 alpha-dehydroxylation was significantly reduced in the rats receiving clindamycin alone, but concomitantly use of LS reduced significantly the antimicrobial effect. Thus, the probiotics significantly influenced on a MAC not related to the microbes per se. In conclusion, the first contacts with microbes are of importance for the establishment of intestinal ecosystems. The metabolic activities of an intestinal ecosystem can be influenced by several exogenous factors such as diet and antimicrobial drugs. Probiotics as well as enemas containing a species-specific faecal flora may restore altered functions. The intestinal ecosystem is a complex interplay, with all main actors involved in maintaining a "balanced unbalance...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} gut {{microbiota}} in eliciting innate and adaptive immune responses beneficial for the host {{in the context}} of effective therapies against cancer has been highlighted recently. Chemotherapeutic agents, by compromising, to some extent, the intestinal integrity, increase the gut permeability and selective translocation of Gram-positive bacteria in secondary lymphoid organs. There, anticommensal pathogenic Th 17 T-cell responses are primed, facilitating the accumulation of Th 1 helper T cells in tumor beds after chemotherapy as well as tumor regression. Importantly, the redox equilibrium of myeloid cells contained in the tumor microenvironment is also influenced by the intestinal microbiota. Hence, the anticancer efficacy of alkylating agents (such as cyclophosphamide) and platinum salts (oxaliplatin, cis-platin) is compromised in <b>germ-free</b> mice or <b>animals</b> treated with antibiotics. These findings represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of the mode of action of many compounds having an impact on the host-microbe mutualism...|$|R
