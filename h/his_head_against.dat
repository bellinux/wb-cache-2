5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third day of the trial, Wiens incurred a self-inflicted injury by banging <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a table. He was diagnosed with haematomas and a suspected traumatic brain injury, but was judged fit to stand trial after a hospital-based medical examination. While continuing with noncompliant and destructive behaviour, Wiens was temporarily restrained by nine security officers in court.|$|E
5|$|Warren Jeffs' prison {{life has}} been tumultuous. At Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility, he {{suffered}} from infected ulcers on his knees, which resulted from praying days on end during solitary confinement. He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself at one point. In August 2008, Jeffs went into convulsions after banging <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> {{the walls of his}} cell repetitively and had to be taken to a hospital by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Van der Sloot {{arrived at}} Lima police {{headquarters}} on 5 June, {{where he was}} interrogated about the Flores murder while represented by attorney Luz Maria Romero Chinchay. The Dutch embassy provided a translator for his defense. He was held in a seventh floor cell and permitted to contact his mother. Van der Sloot was placed on suicide watch by guards after {{it was reported that}} he deliberately hit <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a wall. On 10 June, he was moved to a cell at the prosecutor's office in central Lima.|$|E

5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the wall of his stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman {{spent the night in}} the dungeon. He thought about beating <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew {{as soon as he saw}} Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 1917, Benoist {{died when}} he struck <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a {{telephone}} pole while stepping off a streetcar {{in front of the}} Roberts Motor Company in Sandusky. With him gone and facing continued financial problems, the Benoist Aircraft Company and the Roberts Motor Company both went out of business in early 1918. Benoist Aircraft had built just over 100 airplanes in its history by the time it ceased operations.|$|E

25|$|A Hell of a Woman {{was also}} adapted in French as Série noire (1979) by Alain Corneau, with dialogues by French Oulipo writer Georges Pérec. This noir {{masterpiece}} {{set in the}} grim Paris outskirts features a 16-year-old Marie Trintignant's debut performance, {{as well as what}} is generally agreed to be Patrick Dewaere's finest performance. Dewaere conveys a tragic dimension to his manic portrayal of a mediocre door-to-door salesman, at one point repeatedly bashing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a car in an effort to exorcise his angst and guilt.|$|E
25|$|With his {{failures}} behind him, Gordon {{turned to}} Victoria, not to Melbourne which had ignored his poetry, but to Ballarat. In November he rented Craig's livery stables at Ballarat {{in partnership with}} Harry Mount, {{but he had no}} head for business and the venture was a failure. In March 1868 he had a serious accident, a horse smashing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a gatepost of his own yard. His daughter, born on 3 May 1867, {{died at the age of}} 11 months, his financial difficulties were increasing, and he fell into very low spirits.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging {{in the behavior}} decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.|$|E

25|$|A special, high gibbet {{was erected}} in the {{marketplace}} at Launceston, and Mayne was executed there on 29 November 1577. He {{was not allowed to}} speak to the crowd, but only to say his prayers quietly. Just {{as he was about to}} be hanged, he refused to implicate his co-religionists. It is unclear if he died on the gibbet. One source states that he was cut down alive, but in falling struck <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the butcher's scaffold. In any case, he was unconscious when being drawn and quartered.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Twitty was exiting {{his tour}} bus when he {{slipped on the}} steps and fell, hitting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the steps. John Hughey, who was Twitty's steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, {{including}} family members, said that Twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident. According to his daughter Joni, Twitty {{was not in a}} right state of mind for several months, saying {{in an interview that he}} had picked up a TV remote and began talking into it, thinking it was a phone.|$|E
25|$|Later, Charlie Brown {{comes across}} Lucy {{teaching}} Linus about nature {{the way she}} views it with such as bugs pulling the grass to make it grow or snow growing {{out of the ground}} in winter. Charlie Brown tries to correct her, but she retaliates with a false explanation, and Charlie Brown bangs <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a tree in frustration ("Little Known Facts"). That evening, Snoopy complains that he hasn't been fed yet, and begins to overcomplicate and dramaticize the matter until Charlie Brown shows up with his dinner. Snoopy bursts into song about his craving for supper until Charlie Brown firmly tells him to eat his meal ("Suppertime").|$|E

25|$|Robertson told ministers (30 May) that “Haig {{had no idea}} of {{any attempt}} to break through the German lines. It would only be a move to (rescue) the French”, {{although}} he was probably not aware of Haig’s insistence, overruling Rawlinson’s earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and “fighting the enemy in the open”. Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig “does not mean to knock <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition he means to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else”.|$|E
25|$|Prior to his {{election}} as pope in 2005, Ratzinger {{had hoped to}} retire—on account of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75)—and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of Pope John Paul II. In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but he recovered completely. This was never officially made public—the official news was that Ratzinger had fallen and struck <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a radiator—but was an open secret known to the conclave that elected him pope.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Kay Sage and Yves Tanguy was as enigmatic as their art. At the same parties {{during which he}} banged <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> those of other men, Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically, pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife. Sage, according to friends’ accounts, made no response to her husband’s aggression except {{to try to persuade}} him to go home. Friends also said that Tanguy did not like Sage’s painting and felt jealous of the fame that came to her. The couple must have shared different feelings in private, however, because all accounts agree that Sage was devastated by Tanguy’s death. “Yves was my only friend who understood everything,” she wrote to Jehan Mayoux, an old friend of Tanguy’s, about a month after Tanguy’s fatal stroke.|$|E

25|$|On 9 April 1937, eleven {{days after}} ceremonially handing over Evans's ashes and thirty-four days before King George VI's coronation, Sullivan {{died when he}} was {{returning}} to his accommodation and accidentally slipped in Birdcage Walk, Westminster, near the Wellington Barracks, and struck <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the kerb. He {{died as a result of}} the severity of the head injuries he had sustained. He was afforded a full military funeral in London where the Australian contingent's salute volley was respectfully returned by the Foot Guards. Field Marshal Lord Birdwood and a dozen British VC winners attended the funeral. His body was cremated at Golders Green in London and his ashes were returned to Sydney and interred at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium where they rest by a plaque on Tree 267A in the North section. A month after the funeral, a gap was deliberately left in the ranks of the Australian contingent as they marched in the coronation parade.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{the twelve}} {{passengers}} who suffered major injuries, nine suffered the injuries from the impact and three suffered the injuries from the evacuation. Most of the injuries occurred to passengers and crew located in the flight deck and forward cabin. According to passenger reports, the leap from the aircraft to the ground caused many of the injuries, including broken legs, and ruptured vertebrae. The Captain sustained back and head injuries during {{the impact of the}} crash when his seat was wrenched out of place by the force of the impact, causing him to hit <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the overhead controls. Minor injuries included twisted ankles, sore necks, bruises and effects from smoke inhalation. A total of 33 persons were taken to various hospitals within and outside Toronto for treatment, of which 21 were treated for minor injuries and released. The York-Finch campus of the Humber River Regional Hospital treated seven people for smoke inhalation. William Osler Health Centre, Etobicoke General Hospital, Credit Valley Hospital, and Peel Memorial Hospital were additional nearby hospitals that had admitted victims of the crash.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E
