International flights can also depart from concourses T & A–D, such as when space is unavailable at concourses <b>E</b> <b>or</b> <b>F,</b> or when an aircraft arrives as a domestic flight and continues as an international flight. Furthermore, all international pre-cleared flights, regardless of origin, will collect their baggage at the international terminal.|$|E

The actual performance of the team in the Group Stage played no role in determining if the team qualified into Super Eight Group <b>E</b> <b>or</b> <b>F.</b> For example, in Group C, though Sri Lanka finished with more points than New Zealand, for the purpose of the Super Eight groupings, New Zealand retained the group's top seed position (C1) while Sri Lanka retained the group's second seed position (C2).|$|E

The flask containing the resulting mixture was suspended in ultrasonic water bath at 80  °C for 8  h. The desired products were obtained by the following work-up: the reaction mixtures were acidified with HCl 3  M to pH ~ 5; the solutions were allowed to cool slowly to 0  °C to precipitate crude products. These were recrystallized with MeOH:H 2 O (1 : 3) to afford pure chalcones.|$|R

2500|$|A played note of <b>E</b> <b>or</b> <b>F</b> has a {{frequency}} {{which is often}} {{very close to the}} natural resonating frequency of the body of the instrument, [...] and if the problem is not addressed this can set the body into near resonance. [...] This may cause an unpleasant sudden amplification of this pitch, [...] and additionally a loud beating sound results from the interference produced between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the “wolf tone” because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator (a metal cylinder or a rubber cylinder encased in metal), or moving the sound post.|$|E

Very often, in {{the farther}} {{treatment}} of the profiles <b>e</b> <b>or</b> <b>f,</b> another limb is added to their curve in order to join it to the upper or lower members of the cornice or capital. I do not consider this addition as forming another family of cornices, because the leading and effective part of the curve is in these, as in the others, the single ogee; and the added bend is merely a less abrupt termination of it above or below: still this group is of so great importance in the richer kinds of ornamentation that we must have it sufficiently represented. We shall obtain a type of it by merely continuing {{the line of the}} Matterhorn side, of which before we took only a fragment. The entire line e to g on Plate VII., is evidently composed of three curves of unequal lengths, which if we call the shortest 1, the intermediate one 2, and the longest 3, are there arranged in the order 1, 3, 2, counting upwards. But evidently we might also have had the arrangements 1, 2, 3, and 2, 1, 3, giving us three distinct lines, altogether independent of position, which being applied to one general dotted slope will each give four cornices, or twelve altogether. Of these the six most important are those which have the shortest curve convex: they are given in light relief from k to p, Plate XV., and, by turning the page upside down, the other six will be seen in dark relief, only the little upright bits of shadow at the bottom are not to be considered as parts of them, being only admitted in order to give the complete profile of the more important cornices in light.|$|E
