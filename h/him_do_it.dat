500|$|It was Jones who {{ultimately}} played {{most of the}} bass parts during the Bollocks recordings; Howard calls his rudimentary, rumbling approach the [...] "explosive missing ingredient" [...] of the Sex Pistols' sound. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release, [...] "Bodies". Jones recalls, [...] "He played his farty old bass part and we just let <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low. I {{think it might be}} barely audible on the track." [...] Following [...] "God Save the Queen", two more singles were released: [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] (largely written by Matlock) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions, [...] "Holidays in the Sun" [...] on 14 October. Each was a Top Ten hit.|$|E
500|$|The Diocletianic {{persecution}} {{was ultimately}} unsuccessful. As one modern historian has put it, {{it was simply}} [...] "too little and too late". Christians were never purged systematically {{in any part of}} the empire, and Christian evasion continually undermined the edicts' enforcement. Some bribed their way to freedom. The Christian Copres escaped on a technicality: To avoid sacrificing in court, he gave his brother power of attorney, and had <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> instead. Many simply fled. Eusebius, in his Vita Constantini, declared that [...] "once more the fields and woods received the worshippers of God". To contemporary theologians, there was no sin in this behavior. Lactantius held that Christ himself had encouraged it, and Bishop Peter of Alexandria quoted [...] ("when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another") in support of the tactic.|$|E

Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Abandon All Hope...", Castiel {{helps the}} Winchesters {{retrieve}} the Colt, and joins {{them on their}} hunt for Lucifer. However, he ventures off after discovering hundreds of Reapers {{are already in the}} town, hoping to discover what has called them there. He soon becomes imprisoned by Lucifer, who tries to tempt Castiel into joining him, pointing out they are both targets of Heaven, but Castiel refuses. He later manages to free himself, but finds he no longer has the power to kill demons. After Sam and Dean fail in their attempt to kill the Devil, Castiel teleports them to safety. After exhausting most of his remaining power to take Sam and Dean back in time to save their parents from renegade angel Anna, Castiel aids the Winchesters in their battle with Famine, the Horseman of the Apocalypse – the brothers having already defeated War – but his weakened powers render him susceptible to Famine's influence, Famine attacking Jimmy's hunger for red meat to make Castiel more interested in eating burgers than actually fighting. When the brothers are killed by vengeful hunters in [...] "Dark Side of the Moon", Castiel – unable to return to Heaven – briefly communicates with them. He tasks them with finding the angel Joshua, who communicates directly with God. Although Joshua reveals God is alive, he claims He is apathetic to the Apocalypse; having saved the brothers and Castiel, God feels He has done enough. When relayed to Castiel, his hopes and faith are shattered, leading him to drink heavily in the subsequent episode [...] "99 Problems" [...] when Sam summons him for answers about the actions of the people in a town. Castiel reveals that they are dealing with the Whore of Babylon and provides the stake that can kill her, but as he is no longer a true servant of Heaven, is unable to do it himself. He gets Pastor Gideon so they can have <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and tries to hold the Whore in place so the Pastor can stab her. However, she casts a spell that causes him great pain and knocks him out of the fight. In the end, Dean stabs her with the stake, identifying himself as a true servant of heaven.|$|E

Cavalera stated that producer Ross Robinson recommended that he work with Durst. Durst also made an appearance on Korn's album Follow the Leader. Jonathan Davis had intended to write a battle rap with B-Real of Cypress Hill, but the latter's label wouldn't let <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and Durst was tapped instead. Davis and Durst wrote the lyrics for [...] "All in the Family", which featured the two vocalists trading insults.

During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife {{to the base}} of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, [...] "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you...

2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, he was {{involved}} in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when you heard <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. He {{knew exactly what he was}} doing." [...] Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and [...] double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.|$|E
2500|$|Lisa makes {{friends with}} Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) and moves in with Mark Fowler (Todd Carty). Although Mark has {{feelings}} for her, Lisa does not notice, having a fling with Gianni di Marco (Marc Bannerman) and {{a relationship with}} Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), resulting in Lisa's pregnancy. Phil asks her {{to have an abortion}} but she refuses so he asks her to move in after coming round to the idea but she miscarries and blames Phil.

She keeps this secret as Phil keeps belittling her, and on Melanie and Steve Owen's (Martin Kemp) wedding night, Phil says that he never loved her and suggests Melanie give her tips in the bedroom. In revenge, Lisa steals a gun from the e20 nightclub and shoots Phil. He survives and confronts her after leaving hospital but realises that he drove her to it and frames his enemy Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) instead. Wanting to keep Phil away from her child, Lisa and Mark marry, claiming that he is the baby's father. Everyone believes it and their romance becomes real. Lisa gives birth to baby Louise, and Lisa tells Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), that Phil is Louise's father. Sharon, however, tells Phil that Louise is his daughter and he forces them to accept he will be part of Louise's life. Despite initial animosity, when Lisa sees Phil with Louise, old feelings resurface and they eventually reconcile. However, Phil wants Louise, not Lisa, and when she realises, she and Louise emigrate to Portugal. Phil finds her and brings Louise home after blackmailing Lisa about shooting him and making her think she is unstable and an unfit mother.
