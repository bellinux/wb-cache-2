The South Korean civilians were evacuated in 1976, while General Rhee and two other diplomats were held captive until April 1980. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> were also left behind or chose the remain in Saigon, 38 of them, together with their dependents, were evacuated to Bangkok on 1 August 1976.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people who}} lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, monks from Sri Lanka {{established}} the Washington Buddhist Vihara in Washington, D.C., the first Theravada monastic {{community in the}} United States. The Vihara was quite accessible to English-speakers, and Vipassana meditation was part of its activities. However, the direct influence of the Vipassana movement would not reach the U.S. until a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> returned there in the early 1970s after studying with Vipassana masters in Asia.|$|E
25|$|In 1867 the Chi Phi {{fraternity}} established its Theta chapter at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, {{marking the}} first foray of the American social fraternity outside {{the borders of}} the United States. At the time, many students from the American south were moving to Europe to study, due to the disrepair into which southern universities had fallen {{as a result of the}} American Civil War. One such <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> organized Chi Phi at Edinburgh, however, in the course of the Theta chapter's existence, it initiated no non-American members. With declining American enrollment at European universities, Chi Phi at Edinburgh shuttered in 1870.|$|E

25|$|Under the Spanish colonial system, {{trade between}} Americans and the Spanish outpost at Santa Fe was prohibited, {{but with the}} end of the Mexican War of Independence Spanish {{authorities}} were removed from the area in 1821. American traders, mainly operating out of St. Louis, Missouri, were eager to test whether commercial activities in Santa Fe would now be allowed, and a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> returned successfully in December 1821 from a small trading foray. At age 18 Young sold the farm he had recently purchased and eagerly signed up to join a somewhat larger group bound for Santa Fe. In May 1822 this party departed, becoming the first overland wagon train to traverse the Santa Fe Trail. Young and the others found that they were welcomed by the new Mexican authorities in Santa Fe.|$|E
25|$|In September 1835, Nicolás Gutiérrez was {{appointed}} as interim governor of California in January 1836, {{to be replaced}} by Mariano Chico in April, but he was very unpopular. Thinking a revolt was coming, Chico returned to Mexico to gather troops, but was reprimanded for leaving his post. Gutierrez, the military commandant, re-assumed the governorship, but he too was unpopular. Senior members of Alta California's legislature Juan Bautista Alvarado and José Castro, with support from Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, Comandante of the Fourth Military District and Director of Colonization of the Northern Frontier, and assistance from a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> led by Isaac Graham, staged a revolt in November 1836 and forced Gutierrez to relinquish power. The Americans wanted Californian independence, but Alvarado instead preferred staying part of Mexico, albeit with greater autonomy.|$|E
25|$|Once Hamel {{had been}} {{successfully}} invested and most resistance had ceased in the village, a brief halt was called. During this time, small actions continued as a German machine-gun post {{north of the}} Pear Trench was silenced by a Lewis gun team and a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> The {{second phase of the}} attack resumed after a 10-minute pause, as the men of the 43rd Battalion began to clear the remaining German defenders from the village and the nearby quarry. The British tanks fired machine-guns and cannons that fired grape-shot in the confined spaces of the village. As the sun began to rise they were no longer inhibited by the darkness and came to dominate the situation, winkling out isolated pockets of resistance in the areas that had already been captured.|$|E

500|$|The first non-Native Americans to {{pass through}} the area of Castle Lake were hunters and trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company, who began to come down the Siskiyou Trail from present-day Washington into Mexican-controlled California, in the late 1820s and early 1830s, in search of beaver and other pelt-bearing animals. [...] At about this same time, Ewing Young led the first <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> up the Siskiyou Trail, passing near Castle Lake.

500|$|As late as 1974, the Olympic Review {{listed the}} United States team of John Flanagan, Robert Garrett, Truxton Hare, Josiah McCracken, Lewis Sheldon and Richard Sheldon as the gold medalists for the 1900 tug of war. A {{report in the}} Paris edition of the New York Herald {{described}} the tug of war contest at the Olympic Games as being [...] "an object lesson in how not to do a thing". The report mentioned the Scandinavian team's defeat of France, before detailing a second match, between an American team and the Scandinavians. The New York Herald recorded that in the second contest, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> formed a team {{to take on the}} victorious Scandinavians, beating them in two pulls, the second of which took over five minutes. In contrast, the Journal des Sports suggested that the Americans initially wanted to wear spiked shoes {{to take part in the}} match, but were then forced to remove them after protests. They then won the first pull against the mixed Swedish/Danish team, but during the second pull, some of their compatriots joined in pulling the rope to help the tiring team. A fight nearly broke out, but was avoided by the intervention of officials. Irrespective of the result of this second contest, it was not considered to be part of the official competition, but rather a private contest, and the United States were not considered to have officially taken part.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Eastwood starred with Shirley MacLaine in {{the western}} Two Mules for Sister Sara, {{directed}} by Don Siegel. The film follows an American mercenary, who gets mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun, and ends up helping a group of Juarista rebels {{during the reign of}} Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. Eastwood once again played a mysterious stranger—unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest, and smoking a cigar. Although it received moderate reviews, the film is listed in The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000Movies Ever Made. Later the same year, Eastwood starred as one of a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> who steal a fortune in gold from the Nazis, in the World War II film Kelly's Heroes, with Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas. Kelly's Heroes was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions. Filming commenced in July 1969 on location in Yugoslavia and in London. The film received mostly a positive reception and its anti-war sentiments were recognized. In the winter of 1969–70, Eastwood and Siegel began planning his next film, The Beguiled, a tale of a wounded Union soldier, held captive by the sexually repressed matron (played by Geraldine Page) of a Southern girls' school. Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood's finest works by the French. However, it grossed less than $1million and, according to Eastwood and Lang, flopped due to poor publicity and the [...] "emasculated" [...] role of Eastwood.|$|E
