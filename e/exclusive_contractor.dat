State school computers are usually maintained by the same <b>exclusive</b> <b>contractor</b> in the entire city and updated slowly. Internet access is often provided by phone companies free of charge. Especially in schools the teachers' computer skills are often very low.|$|E
50|$|In May 2012, Good Energy {{received}} {{criticism for}} using G4S Utility Services as their meter-reading contractor. Good Energy responded {{that the relationship}} {{was the result of}} their original contractor Accuread being acquired by G4S in 2008. Due to ethical considerations, Good Energy discontinued their contract with G4S Utility Services and in April 2013 appointed an independent company, Lowri Beck, as their <b>exclusive</b> <b>contractor</b> to provide meter reading services.|$|E

He decided that something must be left to chance, though the thought that he might have handled heavy rails for the <b>contractor's</b> <b>exclusive</b> benefit was strongly distasteful. Walking across the town, he paid a visit to Miss Foster.|$|R
2500|$|A {{major reason}} {{for the growth of}} Edwards AFB was the {{nearness}} of West Coast aircraft manufacturers. [...] However, another major reason was the decision in 1947 to build a missile test facility on the base. [...] The need for a static missile faculty to test high-thrust missile rocket engines was first envisioned in 1946 by the Power Plant Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. [...] It was that decision that such a facility should be government-owned to prevent a single <b>contractor</b> <b>exclusive</b> advantages on Air Force contracts for high-thrust missile rocket power plants, and it would eliminate duplication of like facilities by different manufacturers. [...] The choice of location in 1947 was the Leuhman Ridge east of Rogers Dry Lake on Edwards AFB. [...] Construction began in November 1949 on what was to become the Experimental Rocket Engine Test Station.|$|R
