5|$|Abu Nuwar {{spent much}} of his time in exile between Syria and Egypt {{organizing}} opposition to <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> monarchy, all the while maintaining his innocence in the Zarqa incident. He returned to Jordan in 1964 after being pardoned by Hussein as part of the latter's broader reconciliation efforts with his exiled opposition. In 1971, Abu Nuwar was made ambassador to France and he was later appointed to the Senate of Jordan's parliament in 1989. He died from blood cancer at a London hospital at age 66, one year after the publication of his memoirs, A Time of Arab Decline: Memoirs of Arab Politics (1948–1964).|$|E
5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, his insistence on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with Hussein led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the US, which were major sources of foreign aid to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's leadership by palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against <b>Hussein,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dissident version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar resigned and was allowed to leave Jordan for Syria. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in absentia.|$|E

25|$|The party counted Iraq's Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party {{as one of}} its {{political}} and financial backers until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as the parties found common cause in defiance of the United States. Similar sentiment led the party to back Libya's Muammar Gaddafi following the 2011 military intervention in Libya by NATO. Serbia and Libya had maintained good relations since Gaddafi vocally opposed NATO intervention in Serbia in the 1990s, while he also backed Serbia's opposition to Kosovo's independence. The SRS has also expressed support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad following the Syrian Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{main body}} of {{coalition}} forces continued their drive {{into the heart of}} Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi president Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the period of military occupation.|$|E
25|$|The British {{had first}} {{acknowledged}} Tengku Abdul Rahman {{at the time}} of their first presence in Malacca. The situation however had changed. In 1818, Farquhar visited Tengku Hussein in the little island of Penyengat, off the coast of Bintan, the capital of the Riau Archipelago. There, new plans were drawn and in 1819, Raffles made a deal with Tengku Hussein. The agreement stated that the British would acknowledge Tengku Hussein as the legitimate ruler of Singapore if he allowed them to establish a trading post there. Furthermore, Tengku <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> temenggung would receive a yearly stipend from the British. The treaty was ratified on 6 February 1819. With the Temenggung's help, Hussein left Penyengat, pretending that he was 'going fishing', and reached Singapore, where he was quickly installed as Sultan.|$|E

25|$|After {{the lengthy}} Iraq {{disarmament}} crisis culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq, which was refused, a coalition {{led by the}} United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Approximately 250,000 United States troops, with support from 45,000 British, 2,000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces, entered Iraq primarily through their staging area in Kuwait. (Turkey had refused to permit its territory {{to be used for}} an invasion from the north.) Coalition forces also supported Iraqi Kurdish militia, estimated to number upwards of 50,000. After approximately three weeks of fighting, <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ba'ath Party were forcibly removed, followed by 9 years of military presence by the United States and the coalition fighting alongside the newly elected Iraqi government against various insurgent groups.|$|E
25|$|The BBC began {{simulcasting}} {{the channel}} overnight on terrestrial channel BBC One with {{the launch of}} the channel, ending the tradition of a closedown {{but at the same time}} effectively making the service available to many more viewers. In the early 2000s, BBC Two also started simulcasting the channel, although the weekend morning show Weekend 24 had been simulcast on the channel in the early days. During major breaking news events, the BBC News Channel has been broadcast on BBC One; examples of special broadcasts include the 11 September 2001 attacks, 7 July 2005 London bombings, the capture of Saddam <b>Hussein,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> death of Osama bin Laden.

25|$|Disagreements {{between the}} monarchy and the leftist {{government}} culminated in March 1957 when Nabulsi provided Hussein {{with a list}} of senior officers in the military he wanted to dismiss; Hussein initially heeded the recommendations, but then Nabulsi presented a new list, which Hussein refused to act upon. Nabulsi's government was forced to resign on 10April. On 13April, rioting broke in the Zarqa army barracks and the 21 year-old Hussein went to end the violence between royalist and Arab nationalist army units after the latter group spread rumors that the King had been killed. A 3,000-man Syrian force started moving south in support of what they perceived as a coup attempt, but turned around after the army units showed their loyalty to the King. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by army chief of staff Ali Abu Nuwar against King <b>Hussein,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dissident version asserting that it was a staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar and other senior Arabist officers resigned and were allowed to leave Jordan for Syria, where they incited opposition to the Jordanian monarchy. Hussein imposed martial law and disbanded Palestinian-dominated military units after the incident. Although he eventually relaxed some of these measures, namely military curfews and severe press censorship, Hussein's moves significantly curtailed the constitutional democracy that existed in Jordan in the mid-1950s. The alleged conspirators were sentenced to 15 years in absentia, but later on were pardoned by Hussein in 1964 as part of his reconciliation efforts with his exiled opposition, and were given senior posts in the government.|$|E

500|$|During the Black September clashes in Jordan, al-Wazir {{supplied}} the encircled Palestinian forces in Jerash and Ajlun with arms and aid, [...] but the conflict was decided in Jordan's favor. After Arafat {{and thousands of}} Fatah fighters retreated to Lebanon, al-Wazir negotiated an agreement between King <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> PLO's leading organizer, calling for better Palestinian conduct in Jordan. Then, {{along with the other}} PLO leaders, he relocated to Beirut.|$|E
500|$|Abu Nuwar {{consistently}} {{denied any}} betrayal of Hussein and {{claimed he was}} a [...] "fall man", the victim of political intrigue in the kingdom in which his rivals sought to discredit him. At {{a press conference in}} Damascus, he stated that the entire incident was an overreaction by Hussein to sensational and false reports of a coup plot and that the incident was likely a preemptive coup by <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old guard, supported or engineered by US intelligence, against the main proponents of pan-Arab unity in Jordan. Rashid and Ma'an Abu Nuwar likewise strongly denied any kind of coup plot on their end. According to Pearson, the accounts of the Free Officers and al-Hiyari were lent further credence by the lack of evidence in the military trials against the alleged conspirators who were arrested, the light sentences that they were given and the eventual rehabilitation of the alleged conspirators, including Abu Nuwar, who were later reassigned to high-ranking posts in the state and military.|$|E

This symbolic deal allows the state to respect religious edicts without wastefully destroying massive quantities of food. In 2009, Hussein put down a cash deposit of $4,800 (about 20,000 shekels) for $150 million worth of chametz, acquired from state companies, the prison service and the national stock of emergency supplies.

Ted Turner, founder of CNN, charged that Rupert Murdoch was using Fox News to advocate an invasion. Critics have argued that this statistic is indicative of misleading coverage by the U.S. media since viewers in other countries {{were less likely to}} have these beliefs.
