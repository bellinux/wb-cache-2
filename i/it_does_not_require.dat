5|$|The Act's {{labeling}} {{requirement is}} unconstitutionally compelled speech under the First Amendment because <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{the disclosure of}} purely factual information, but compels the carrying of the State's controversial Opinion.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching is that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> morality to exist objectively; Linville considers {{the view that}} this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as {{an essential part of}} reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (NJROTC) is {{a program}} {{allowing}} {{high school students to}} participate in the academic and physical training aspect of naval service, while also providing leadership opportunities to those involved in the program. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a commitment to military service following high school graduation. Port Charlotte's NJROTC program was established in the early 1990s; since then, it has grown significantly. The company of cadets are overseen and instructed by two retired United States Navy personnel, who are in turn overseen by the United States Navy itself through the form of Area Managers. Port Charlotte's unit is a member of NJROTC Area Seven, and is known for service to its community.|$|E
5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E
