40|$|The aim of {{this study}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine to what extent Swedish writers, who write in English, use the modals must, have <b>to</b> and have <b>got</b> <b>to.</b> The {{hypothesis}} being tested argues that the core modal must is not being challenged by the emerging modals have <b>to</b> and have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> in this non-native variety of English. The objective of this thesis <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accomplished by attempting to answer the following research questions: 1) What is the frequency and usage of the English modals must, have <b>to</b> and have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> in the material? 2) How do the frequencies in the Swedish material compare with the frequencies in the British and American corpora and to the previous studies? 3) How do the Swedish writers use the modals with regard to epistemic and deontic meaning? The study is corpus based, and the corpora used consist of Swedish newspapers in English (SWENC) and material from blogs and tweets which are written in English by Swedes (SESMC). These are compared with the press sub-corpora in BE 06 (the British 2006 corpus of CQP web at Lancaster) and in AE 06 (the American 2006 corpus of CQP web at Lancaster), which represent British and American native varieties of English. The method is quantitative and the results are presented after the process of normalization. The results show that must, have <b>to</b> and have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>are</b> used in SWENC and SESMC although, to greatly varying degrees. The core modal must is more frequently used in the Swedish corpus than in the British and American sub-corpora. The emerging modal have <b>to</b> <b>is</b> used more frequently than must in all three corpora. The second emerging modal have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> seldomly used. Additionally, a qualitative examination of the modals and their meanings reveal that the writers in SWENC and SESMC use the older modal must alongside the newer have to and newest modal have <b>got</b> <b>to,</b> but with a preference for a toned-down style of language. The conclusion drawn is that the core modal must is indeed being challenged by the emerging modal have to even in the non-native variety of English...|$|R

60|$|Miss Henrietta Coldbrooke was the {{daughter}} of an Englishman of good family, and some estate, who had emigrated to America and married, under the impulse of certain theories in politics which induced him to imagine that this was the promised land. I remember him as a disappointed and dissatisfied widower, who <b>was</b> thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> daily growing poorer under the consequences of indiscreet investments, and who at last <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so <b>very</b> English in his wishes and longings, as to assert that the common Muscovy was a better bird than the canvas-back! He died, however, in time to leave his only child an estate which, under my uncle's excellent management, was known by me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rather more than one hundred and seventy-nine thousand dollars, and which produced a net eight thousand a year. This made Miss Henrietta a belle at once; but, having a prudent friend in my grandmother, as yet she had not married a beggar. I knew that uncle Ro went quite as far as was proper, in his letters, in the way of hints touching myself; and my dear, excellent, honest-hearted, straightforward old grandmother had once let fall an expression, in one of her letters to myself, which induced me to think that these hints had actually awakened as much interest in the young lady's bosom, as could well be connected with what was necessarily nothing but curiosity.|$|R

60|$|I had {{received}} a visit the day before from a principal inhabitant of Vévey, with an invitation to breakfast, at his country-house, on the heights. This gratuitous civility <b>was</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> declined, though it <b>was</b> our desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quiet, as we considered the residence at Vévey, a sort of villagiatura, after Paris. Accordingly, I got into a char, and climbed the mountain for {{a mile and a}} half, through beautiful pastures and orchards, by narrow winding lanes, that, towards the end, <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of a <b>very</b> primitive character. Without this little excursion, I should have formed no just idea of the variety in the environs of the place, and should have lost a good deal of their beauty. I have told you that this acclivity rises behind the town, for a distance exceeding a mile, but I am now persuaded it would have been nearer the truth had I said a league. The majesty of Swiss nature constantly deceives the eye, and it requires great care and much experience to prevent falling into these mistakes. The house I sought, stood on a little natural terrace, a speck on the broad breast of the mountain, or what would be called a mountain, {{were it not for the}} granite piles in its neighbourhood, and was beautifully surrounded by woods, pastures, and orchards. We were above the vine.|$|R
6000|$|His {{wife was}} a Danish Princess, Sister of poor Christian II., King of that Country: dissolute Christian, who took up with a huckster-woman's daughter,--"mother sold gingerbread," [...] it would appear, [...] "at Bergen in Norway," [...] where Christian was Viceroy; Christian made {{acceptable}} love to the daughter, [...] "DIVIKE (Dovekin, COLUMBINA)," [...] as he called her. Nay he made the gingerbread mother a kind of prime-minister, said the angry public, justly scandalized at this of the [...] "Dovekin."

60|$|Our provisions--if I {{may give}} that name {{to what we}} had left--were reduced to the rind of one lemon and {{about a couple of}} handsfull of coffee-berries. Besides these great distresses, caused by the death, the danger, and the {{suffering}} among my crew and passengers, I had had a little distress of my own to shake me still more, in the death of the child whom I had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> fond of on the voyage out--so fond that I was secretly a little jealous of her being taken in the Long-boat instead of mine when the ship foundered. It used to be a great comfort to me, and I think to those with me also, after we had seen the last of the Golden Mary, to see the Golden Lucy, held up by the men in the Long-boat, when the weather allowed it, as the best and brightest sight they had to show. She looked, at the distance we saw her from, almost like a little white bird in the air. To miss her for the first time, when the weather lulled a little again, and we all looked out for our white bird and looked in vain, was a sore disappointment. To see the men's heads bowed down and the captain's hand pointing into the sea when we hailed the Long- boat, a few days after, gave me as heavy a shock and as sharp a pang of heartache to bear as ever I remember suffering in all my life. I only mention these things to show that if I did give way a little at first, under the dread that our captain was lost to us, it was not without having been a good deal shaken beforehand by more trials {{of one sort or another}} than often fall to one man's share.|$|E

"Well, you {{see that}} there is a very rough {{population}} in Alexandria--Greek, Maltese, and Italian, in fact the scum of the Mediterranean--and my father, who is a very sensible man, thought that the knowledge of how to use my fists well might be of much greater value to me than anything else I could learn in England, so he asked my uncle, with whom I lived when I was at school, to get me the best masters in boxing that he could find. I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> fond of it, and worked very hard. I had three lessons a week all the time I was at school, and the last year changed my master three times, and so got all their favourite hits. Of course I used to get knocked about, for some boxers can't help hitting hard, and to the end I used to get punished pretty heavily, because though I might hit them as often as they hit me, they were able to hit much harder than I was, but I fancy now that they would find it pretty hard work to knock me out of time. My father used to say that being really a good boxer kept a man or a boy out of trouble. A man who knows that he can fight well can afford to be good-tempered and put up with things that another man wouldn't, and if he is driven to use his fists gets off without being knocked about; and besides, as soon as it is known that he can fight, others don't care about quarrelling with him.

I would never advise any man to sully his honour." [...] As Sir Anthony said this he raised himself a little with his two sticks and spoke out in a bolder voice. The voice however, sank again as he descended from the realms of honour to those of prudence. [...] "But none of these cases are yours, Fred. To be sure you'll have the Perivale property; but that is not a family estate, and you'll be much better off by turning it into money. And in the way of comfort, you can be a great deal more comfortable without a wife than you can with one. What do you want a wife for? And then, as to Miss Amedroz,--for myself I must say that I like her uncommonly. She has been very pleasant in her ways with me. But,--somehow or another, I don't think you are so much in love with her but what you can do without her." [...] Hereupon he paused and looked his son full in the face. Fred had also been thinking of the matter in his own way, and asking himself the same question,--whether he was in truth so much in love with Clara that he could not live without her. [...] "Of course I don't know," [...] continued Sir Anthony, [...] "what has taken place just now between you and her, or what between her and your mother; but I suppose the whole thing might fall through without any further trouble to you,--or without anything unhandsome on your part?" [...] But Captain Aylmer still said nothing. The whole thing might, no doubt, fall through, but he wished to be neither unjust nor ungenerous,--and he specially wished to avoid anything unhandsome. After a further pause of a few minutes, Sir Anthony went on again, pouring forth the words of experience. [...] "Of course marriage is all very well. I married rather early in life, and have always found your mother to be a most excellent woman. A better woman doesn't breathe. I'm as sure of that as I am of anything. But God bless me,--of course you can see. I can't call anything my own. I'm tied down here and I can't move. I've never got a shilling to spend, while all these lazy hounds about the place are eating me up. There isn't a clerk with a hundred a year in London that isn't better off than I am as regards ready money. And what comfort have I in a big house, and no end of gardens, and a place like this?
