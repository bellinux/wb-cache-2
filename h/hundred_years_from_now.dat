On the afternoon of April 12, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain {{in the back of}} my head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage (stroke). At 3:35pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining consciousness. As Allen Drury later said, “so ended an era, and so began another.” After Roosevelt's death, an editorial by The New York Times declared, [...] "Men will thank God on their knees a <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> that Franklin D.

50|$|Due to tidal acceleration, {{the orbit}} of the Moon around the Earth becomes about 2.2 cm more distant each year. It is {{estimated}} that, in slightly less than 1.4 billion <b>years,</b> the distance <b>from</b> the Earth to the Moon will have increased by 30,400 km. During that period, the apparent angular diameter of the Moon will decrease in size, meaning that it {{will no longer be}} able to completely cover the Sun's disk as seen from the Earth. This will be true even when the Moon is at perigee, and the Earth at aphelion. Moreover, the Sun is increasing in diameter by about 5% per billion years. Therefore, the last total solar eclipse on Earth will occur about six <b>hundred</b> million <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b>|$|R

60|$|In {{the space}} of one <b>hundred</b> and seventy-six <b>years</b> the Lower Mississippi has {{shortened}} itself two hundred and forty-two miles. That is an average of a trifle over one mile and a third per year. Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind or idiotic, can {{see that in the}} Old Oolitic Silurian Period,' just a million years ago next November, the Lower Mississippi River was upwards of one million three hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod. And by the same token any person can see that seven <b>hundred</b> and forty-two <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> the Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their streets together, and be plodding comfortably along under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen. There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.|$|R

60|$|VIVIAN. Quite so. They are so {{like them}} that a <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> {{no one will}} believe in them. The only portraits in which one {{believes}} are portraits where {{there is very little}} of the sitter, and a very great deal of the artist. Holbein's drawings {{of the men and women}} of his time impress us with a sense of their absolute reality. But this is simply because Holbein compelled life to accept his conditions, to restrain itself within his limitations, to reproduce his type, and to appear as he wished it to appear. It is style that makes us believe in a thing--nothing but style. Most of our modern portrait painters are doomed to absolute oblivion. They never paint what they see. They paint what the public sees, and the public never sees anything.|$|E
6000|$|No, the Victorian epoch was not {{the dawn}} of a new era; it was a hasty, trial experiment, a {{gigantic}} experiment of the most slovenly and wasteful kind. I suppose it was necessary; I suppose all things are necessary. I suppose that before men will discipline themselves to learn and plan, they must first see in a hundred convincing forms the folly and muddle that come from headlong, aimless and haphazard methods. The nineteenth century was an age of demonstrations, some of them very impressive demonstrations, of the powers that have come to mankind, but of permanent achievement, what will our descendants cherish? It is hard to estimate what grains of precious metal may not be found in a mud torrent of human production on so large a scale, but will any one, a <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> consent to live in the houses the Victorians built, travel by their roads or railways, value the furnishings they made to live among or esteem, except for curious or historical reasons, their prevalent art and the clipped and limited literature that satisfied their souls? ...|$|E

"Yes," [...] {{said the}} colonel, [...] "considering the {{age in which}} they lived, and their total lack of modern improvements, mental, moral, and physical, we must {{acknowledge}} that they did pretty well. It wasn't on a very large scale; but I don't see how {{they could have been}} braver, if every man had been multiplied by ten thousand. In fact, as it's going to be all the same thing a <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> I don't know but I'd as soon be one of the men that tried to take Quebec as one of the men that did take Atlanta. Of course, for the present, and on account of my afflicted family, Mr. Arbuton, I'm willing to be what and where I am; but just see what those fellows did." [...] And the colonel drew from his glowing memory of Mrs. Ellison's facts a brave historical picture of Arnold's expedition.

60|$|An {{imagination}} {{prone to}} the picturesque insists {{at this stage}} upon {{a vision of the}} latter days of one of the less happily situated lines. Along a weedy embankment there pants and clangs a patched and tarnished engine, its paint blistered, its parts leprously dull. It is driven by an aged and sweated driver, and the burning garbage of its furnace distils a choking reek into the air. A huge train of urban dust trucks bangs and clatters behind it, en route to that sequestered dumping ground where rubbish is burnt to some industrial end. But that is a lapse into the merely just possible, and at most a local tragedy. Almost certainly the existing lines of railway will develop and differentiate, some in one direction and some in another, according {{to the nature of the}} pressure upon them. Almost all will probably be still in existence and in divers ways busy, spite of the swarming new highways I have ventured to foreshadow, a <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{speaking}} of the war-flurry, {{it seemed to me}} to bring to light the unexpected, in a detail or two. It seemed to relegate the war-talk to the politicians {{on both sides of the}} water; whereas whenever a prospective war between two nations had been in the air theretofore, the public had done most of the talking and the bitterest. The attitude of the newspapers was new also. I speak of those of Australasia and India, for I had access to those only. They treated the subject argumentatively and with dignity, not with spite and anger. That was a new spirit, too, and not learned of the French and German press, either before Sedan or since. I heard many public speeches, and they reflected the moderation of the journals. The outlook is that the English-speaking race will dominate the earth a <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> if its sections do not get to fighting each other. It would be a pity to spoil that prospect by baffling and retarding wars when arbitration would settle their differences so much better and also so much more definitely.|$|E

[...] "My religious disadvantages have been such that I don't care much for priests or monks, or young John the Baptists, or small female cherubim, but I do like little charity-boys with voices of pins and needles and hair cut à la dead-rabbit. I should like, if it {{were consistent with the}} consular dignity, to go down and rub their heads. I'm fond, also, of old charity-boys, I find. Those paupers make one in love with destitute and dependent age, by their aspect of irresponsible enjoyment. See how briskly each of them topples along on the leg that he hasn't got in the grave! How attractive likewise are the civilian devotees in those imperishable dress-coats of theirs! Observe their high collars of the era of the Holy Alliance: they and their fathers and their grandfathers before them have worn those dress-coats; in a <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> their posterity will keep holiday in them. I should like to know the elixir by which the dress-coats of civil employees render themselves immortal. Those penitents in the cloaks and cowls are not bad, either, Miss Vervain. Come, they add a very pretty touch of mystery to this spectacle. They're {{the sort of thing that}} painters are expected to paint in Venice--that people sigh over as so peculiarly Venetian. If you've a single sentiment about you, Miss Vervain, now is the time to produce it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{theory is}} admirable, but I think {{the system is}} in decay, though {{to say this is}} {{something}} like accusing the stability of the Constitution. Very likely if some American ghost were to revisit a well-known London street a <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> he would find it still with the legend of [...] "Apartments" [...] in every transom; and it must not be supposed that lodgings have by any means fallen wholly to the middle, much less the lower middle, classes. In one place there was a marquis overhead; in another there was a lordship of unascertained degree, who was heard on a court night being got ready by his valet and the landlord's whole force, and then marking his descent to his cab by the clanking of his sword upon the stairs, after which the joint service spent {{a good part of the}} night in celebrating the event at a banquet in the basement. At two lodgings in a most unpretentious street, it was the landlords' boast that a royal princess had taken tea with their tenants, who were of the quality to be rightfully taken tea with by a royal princess; and at certain hours of the afternoon during the season it was not uncommon to see noble equipages standing at the doors of certain apartments with a full equipment of coachmen and footmen, and ladies of unmistakable fashion ascending and descending by the carriage-steps like the angels on Jacob's ladder. It could be surmised that they were visiting poor relations, or modest merit of some sort, but it was not necessary to suppose this, and upon the whole I prefer not.|$|E
6000|$|I like {{to think}} that [...] "Tom Sawyer" [...] and [...] "Huckleberry Finn" [...] will be looked upon, fifty or a <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> as the picture of buoyant, dramatic, human American life. I feel, deep in my own heart, pretty sure that they will be. They won't be looked on then as the work of a [...] "humorist" [...] any more than we think of Shakespeare as a humorist now. I don't mean by this to set up a {{comparison}} between Mark Twain and Shakespeare: I don't feel competent to do it; and I'm not at all sure that it could be done until Mark Twain's work shall have its fair share of historical perspective. But Shakespeare was a humorist and so, thank Heaven! is Mark Twain. And Shakespeare plunged deep into the deep, sad things of life; and so, in a different way (but in a way that has more than once brought tears to my eyes) has Mark Twain. But after all, it isn't because of any resemblance for anything that was ever before written that Mark Twain's books strike in so deep: it's rather because they've brought something really new into our literature--new, yet old as Adam and Eve and the Apple. And this achievement, the achievement of putting something into literature that was not there before, is, I should think, the most that any writer can ever hope to do. It is the one mark of distinction between the [...] "lonesome" [...] little group of big men and the vast herd of medium and small ones. Anyhow, this much I am sure of--to the young man who hopes, however feebly, to accomplish a little something, someday, as a writer, the one inspiring example of our time is Mark Twain. [...] Very truly yours, [...] SAMUEL MERWIN.|$|E
