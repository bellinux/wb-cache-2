25|$|The US Atomic Energy Commission {{required}} improved {{safety standards}} in the early 1970s for nuclear reactors so ORNL staff wrote almost 100 requirements covering many factors including fuel transport and earthquake resistance. In 1972 the AEC {{held a series of}} public hearings where <b>emergency</b> <b>cooling</b> requirements were highlighted and the safety requirements became more stringent.|$|E
25|$|Still much {{development}} needed - Despite the ARE and MSRE experimental reactors already {{built in}} the 1960s, {{there is still a}} lot of development needed for the LFTR. This includes most of the chemical separation, (passive) <b>emergency</b> <b>cooling,</b> the tritium barrier, remote operated maintenance, large scale Li-7 production, the high temperature power cycle and more durable materials.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of a {{periodic}} inspection carried out by the operating personnel, a manually operated valve, which should have been open, was found to be closed. As result of the false position, one of three <b>emergency</b> <b>cooling</b> systems of Beznau 1 was not ready for immediate use over a period of two weeks. This breach of the technical specifications led to the incident being assessed as level 1 (Swiss scale level B).|$|E
25|$|Heat {{generated}} by fission products would initially be at about 7% of full reactor power, which requires significant cooling. The CANDU designs have several <b>emergency</b> <b>cooling</b> systems, {{as well as}} having limited self-pumping capability through thermal means (the steam generator is well above the reactor). Even {{in the event of}} a catastrophic accident and core meltdown, it is important to remember that the fuel is not critical in light water. This means that cooling the core with water from nearby sources will not add to the reactivity of the fuel mass.|$|E
25|$|Early on 13 March an {{official}} of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) told at a news conference that the <b>emergency</b> <b>cooling</b> system of Unit 3 had failed, spurring an urgent search for a means to supply cooling water to the reactor vessel to prevent a meltdown of its reactor core. At 05:38 there was no means of adding coolant to the reactor, owing to loss of power. Work to restore power and to vent excessive pressure continued. At one point, the top three meters of the uranium/mixed oxide (MOX) fuel rods were not covered by coolant.|$|E
2500|$|The {{large size}} of nuclear plants ordered {{during the late}} 1960s raised new safety {{questions}} and created fears of a severe reactor accident that would send large quantities of radioactivity into the environment. [...] In the early 1970s, a highly contentious debate over the performance of <b>emergency</b> core <b>cooling</b> systems in nuclear plants, designed to prevent a core meltdown {{that could lead to}} the [...] "China syndrome", received coverage in the popular media and technical journals. The <b>emergency</b> core <b>cooling</b> systems controversy opened up whether the AECs first priority was promotion of the nuclear industry or protection of public health and safety.|$|R

50|$|In 2014 Japan {{agreed to}} {{cooperate}} in developing the <b>emergency</b> reactor <b>cooling</b> system, {{and in a few}} other areas. As of 2016, France was seeking the full involvement of Japan in ASTRID development.|$|R
25|$|The {{accident}} {{began with}} {{failures in the}} non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of nuclear reactor coolant to escape. The mechanical failures were compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident due to inadequate training and human factors, such as human-computer interaction design oversights relating to ambiguous control room indicators in the power plant's user interface. In particular, a hidden indicator light led to an operator manually overriding the automatic <b>emergency</b> <b>cooling</b> system of the reactor because the operator mistakenly believed that {{there was too much}} coolant water present in the reactor and causing the steam pressure release.|$|E

2500|$|An {{interim report}} was {{issued by the}} investigative panel headed by Yotaro Hatamura.

[...] The Japanese cabinet was not informed of the government's System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information, which could have told them of the wind direction's effect on the spread of radiation, which would have allowed them to make better decisions on which areas to evacuate around Fukushima Daiichi. [...] TEPCO workers mistakenly believed that the isolation condenser for reactor No. 1 was still working, when it was not, delaying efforts to try other methods to cool the reactor. [...] TEPCO workers turned off an <b>emergency</b> <b>cooling</b> system on reactor No. 3 for seven hours to try to switch to another system that was not working, allowing the reactor to overheat more quickly.|$|E

2500|$|This {{power surge}} {{combined}} with the hot fuel rods touching {{the water in the}} reactor caused [...] "fuel fragmentation along with rapid steam production and an increase in pressure." [...] This led to the fuel rods to rupture, and the safety protocols for the reactor core could not withstand the damage of 3–4 of its fuel rod assemblies. The resulting pressure inside the core forced the covering plate of the reactor to dislodge itself, also [...] "rupturing the fuel channels and jamming all the control rods, which by that time, were only half-way down." [...] The resulting steam from the incident caused many of the <b>emergency</b> <b>cooling</b> circuits to malfunction.
