It was reported that an [...] "external breach" [...] was found on a street approximately 500 ft south of the prison wall. The inmates were later stated to have tunneled out of the facility with hacksaw blades provided by a corrections department employee. The men were housed in Honor Block, a privileged housing unit, that allowed them access to cooking stations, televisions, wall mounted telephones, showers, and card tables in the cell house at specified intervals during the day. According to news reports, the escapees used tools from contractors to cut their <b>escape</b> <b>way</b> during the nights, and returned them to their toolboxes afterwards. The escape was elaborate and has been compared to the escape made in the novella and film by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo took a walking tour of the facility with publicity cameras present.|$|E

Union Army Lieutenant Moran described how the sentries were not interested in stopping people outside the bounds of their jurisdiction, [...] "provided, of course, that the retreating form...were not recognized as Yankees." [...] The tunnel provided enough distance from the prison to stealthily subvert those jurisdictional lines and allow prisoners to slip into the dark streets unchallenged.

40|$|Segregation of {{conveyor}} roadways is a ventilation {{practice that}} is being increasingly applied in Australia. It is largely driven by the legislated requirements in Queensland pertaining to separation of <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> from the mine. This legal requirement {{was based on a}} recommendation from the Moura No. 2 Wardens Inquiry into the mine disaster that claimed 11 lives. The report recommended “the introduction of a requirement for all underground mines to have one intake airway that is completely segregated from other parallel intake airways so as to provide two separate means of egress from the mine via an intake airway”. This recommendation seeks to assist mineworkers to escape from a mine after a fire by providing them with an airway that is free from smoke or contaminants. The concept of an airway being “completely segregated” is an ideal that is challenging to implement in practice when considering the effect of leakage. The practice of belt segregation is concerned with the potential for fires in the belt roadway although there are numerous other potential fire sources in underground coal mines. A review of segregation practices has been conducted applying ventilation engineering principles. Four different scenarios have been analysed with regard to the effectiveness of the segregation stoppings in preventing potential fire contaminants migrating {{to other parts of the}} mine. The results show that in some cases the benefits of segregation to a person evacuating a mine in the event of a fire range from beneficial to detrimental. This is influenced by many factors including the location of that individual in that particular mine. There is room for improvement in the design and implementation of <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> in underground coal mines. <b>Escape</b> <b>ways</b> need to be planned and designated with regard to the potential sources of fire, pressure differentials between <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> and the operational practicalities of maintaining the pressure differential between them...|$|R

40|$|Migration can be {{regarded}} as a social phenomenon by changing the policies of social life and countries. Both the whole world and Turkey act as a scene for diverse and intense migration mobility in recent years <b>Escape</b> <b>way</b> of economy, changes in political and social life, readjustment of borders in Eastern Europe and developments in Middle East have accelerated individual and massive migration movements. It is clear that the immigration phenomenon and its multicultural life and effects will continue to transform for many years. It is important to determine the migration perceptions of prospective teachers who will prepare generations for such an age of transformation. The aim of the study is to examine migration fact and effects of migration on education from prospective teachers’ points of view. To answer the main statement of the research, two sub-questions were formed. 1) With which metaphors migration fact is explained by prospective teachers? Which categories can be formed in terms of common features of metaphors revealed by prospective teachers? 2) What are opinions of prospective teachers on effects of migration fact on educational system? In this research phenomenologic pattern method was used. The prospective teachers were asked a metaphor question in parallel with research questions and an open-ended question. The data was decoded by content analysis method. 152 prospective teachers participated into the study. As a result, categories of “new life”, “psychological dimension”, “socio-cultural dimension”, “child and woman abuse”, “tragedies experienced during migration”, “migration geography” and “economic dimension” were formed from the metaphors produced relating to migration fact by the prospective teachers. The prospective teachers produced both positive and negative metaphors, however most of metaphors were negative. Categories of “education programs”, “future of education”, “social-emotional education for social agreement” and “school structures and management relationship” were formed based on opinions of the prospective teachers relating to the effects of migration fact on Turkish educational system...|$|E

40|$|The walking {{speed of}} {{passengers}} {{is important in}} estimating the time re-quired to evacuate a ship. Therefore we investigated the walking speed on stairs and in corridors during ship listing and dynamic ship motion condi-tions, using the TNO Ship Motion Simulator. Data were obtained from sub-jects between 18 and 83 years of age. Ship listing reduced walking speed up to about 35, dependent on the direction of tilt. Seniors were about 15 slower than other age categories. Ascending stairs slowed down walking speed up to 40 for all age categories, descending up to 30. Another find-ing was that people needed the handrail during ship listing. This imposes a considerable reduction on the specific flow through the <b>escape</b> <b>ways.</b> Dy-namic ship movements slowed down walking speed up to 15 with in-creasing frequency and with increasing amplitude. At large eccentric posi-tions, parasitic linear accelerations will be the main factor reducing specific flow: passengers need handrails if these accelerations exceed 0. 5 m/s². For the purpose of predicting the time required for evacuations, the reduction in passenger walking speed and the reduced capacity of <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> {{should be taken into}} account in the IMO guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Partnership makes a {{difference}} [...] . here is one example. Imagine trying to escape when working in an enclosed space hundreds of feet underground. Emergencies like fires or explosions are frightening potential hazards for the approximately 44, 000 underground mine workers in the United States. U. S. law requires underground miners to participate in mine emergency evacuation drills, but these drills are conducted in smoke-free environments that do not fully prepare workers for conditions they might encounter in a real escape situation. Several U. S. mining companies approached NIOSH to help them better prepare their workers for underground emergencies. Working with NIOSH researchers, the group created an innovative program to plan, conduct, and evaluate evacuation exercises using nontoxic smoke to simulate a real fire. Over 1, 900 workers in nine mines traveled 700 to 1, 000 feet through smoke-filled passages with visibility less than five feet. Miners used technologies identified or developed by NIOSH to assist their escape, such as chemical light sticks, audible strobe lights, reflective materials, directional lifelines, lighted vests, and hand-held laser pointers. As {{a result of these}} exercises, several of the mining companies have installed directional lifelines in their <b>escape</b> <b>ways,</b> purchased chemical light sticks, and are exploring the use of hand-held lasers. The Mine Safety and Health Administration has also required directional lifelines in <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> of underground coal mines that are ventilated with conveyor belt entry air. As word of the training spread, so did the number of mining companies that wanted to participate and include smoke simulation training at their facilities. The long-term outcome of this training is a workforce better prepared to deal with emergency situations in a safe manner.
