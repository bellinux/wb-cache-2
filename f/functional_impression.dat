40|$|A widely {{accepted}} axiom of removable partial prosthodontics {{is that the}} prosthesis should be designed and constructed to preserve the oral structures {{as well as to}} restore function. In distal-extension removable partial dentures, support is derived from a combination of relatively rigid teeth, the resilient mucosa, and the underlying bone. Dual-impression techniques have been used to equalize, as much as possible, the support derived from the edentulous ridges and from the abutment teeth. The need for a physiologic or <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> that registers the ridges in their functional form was recognized by McLean. He described a dual-impression technique whereby a <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> of the distal-extension ridges was made under closing pressure with a custom tray, and then a hydrocolloid impression was made with the first impression held in position with finger pressure to register the remainder of the arch.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of disinfectant procedures on the dimensional stability and surface quality of a tissue conditioner used as a <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> material. Materials and Methods: A tissue conditioner (Visco-gel) used as a <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> material was disinfected by immersion in 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite or 2 % glutaraldehyde solutions for 10 or 20 minutes, respectively. The control group consisted of specimens (n= 10) that were not treated by disinfectants. For testing the dimensional stability, impressions of an aluminum edentulous arch with three reference points were made. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water, the specimens were treated by one of the disinfection procedures. Impressions were poured and, subsequently, 50 stone casts were measured with a Nikon profile projector. For surface roughness evaluation, disks that contained Visco-gel were pressed against glass slides. The disks were then stored in distilled water for 24 hours. After disinfection, 50 disk-shaped dental stone casts were prepared. Surface roughness values were determined using a profilometer. For each test, data were subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey′s test (α = 0. 05). Results: The results of the dimensional stability test showed that immersion of Visco-gel impressions in 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite solution or 2 % glutaraldehyde solution did not significantly change the anteroposterior (AP) and cross-arch (CA) distances of the resultant stone casts when compared to the control group (P> 0. 05). The surface quality of dental stone casts formed by Visco-gel did not change significantly when impressions were immersed in the disinfectant solutions for either 10 or 20 minutes, or when stored in distilled water (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: The results showed that the disinfectant solutions used in this study did not have a significant effect on the surface quality and dimensional accuracy of Visco-gel as a <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> material...|$|E
40|$|The highly resorbed {{residual}} ridge is {{the scourge}} of prosthodontists. Swenson stated that "the ideal ridge {{is one that is}} broad on its bearing surface and has practically parallel sides". Seldom are such ridges encountered by prosthodontists. Deterioration of this ideal ridge is frequently encountered, because of multiple factors, which may be local or systemic. Stability of lower denture in such cases is usually the distinguishing factor between success and failure. [1] Sometimes, dentists have come up with various techniques to overcome these problems in some way or the other. The static impression technique was described in 1938 by Page and subsequently by Addison, who popularized it. The technique aimed at creating an extremely accurate impression of undisturbed and uncompressed tissues.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the use of}} a removable acrylic resin tray handle that can be easily attached to custom impression trays to produce an improved peripheral sealing zone. This device can be indicated to develop <b>functional</b> <b>impressions</b> for complete dentures using the patient-conducted muscular motion technique. In upper trays, the handle is fixed in the midline with acrylic resin, while in lower trays the centrally positioned handle is removed before border molding. This removable handle allows patient’s suction and free tongue movements. Final impression is carried out in two stages: peripheral sealing (low fusion compound) and recording of the main supporting region of the denture (zinc oxide and eugenol paste). All border records are obtained from the patient’s own movements (handle suction and tongue motion). The removable handle is simple to use, is reusable, can be adapted to any individual acrylic resin trays and allows accurate registration of the peripheral sealing zone (border tissues).

40|$|Introduction: Ectodermal {{dysplasia}} (ED) is {{an inherited}} disruption {{of two or}} more tissues and structures of ectodermal origin during their embryonal development. Hypodontia or anodontia of the primary and permanent teeth, poorly developed alveolar ridges and inappropriate мaxillo-mandibular relations are the most common oral manifestations. Management of patients with ED (depending on the phenotypic characteristics) needs a multidisciplinary team approach that involves maxillo-facial surgeon, pedodontist, orthodontist and prosthodontist. Case report: A 6 -year-old girl with ectodermal dysplasia having a normal intellectual development has typical facial expresion: square forehead, prominent ears and supraorbital ridges, pigmented and wrinkled eyelids, nose with anteverted nostrils, thin inward lips, and pointed chin. Hypotrichosis is characterized by almost no eyebrows, eyelashes and skin hairs; the sculp is covered with a wig. The skin is dry, thin and rough as a result of decreased function of the sweat glands. Finger and toe nails are short, thick and striated. Decreased lower facial height, together with deep mentolabial and nasolabial folds contributed to an old-looking facial expression. Complete bilateral cleft palate was partially solved on 1. 5 year of age, with remained oro-nasal communication and a presence of soft palate only. An alveolar ridge in the mandible is rather atrophic with deciduous canines destroyed by caries and and carious permanent molar teeth in both jaws (severe hypodontia). The gingiva is rather swollen, with dark-red color especially around the teeth. Treatment procedure: Taking into consideration the patient’s age and clinical findings, removable complete over-denture prosthesis was the treatment of choice. The preliminary impressions were taken with stock trays and irreversible hydrocolloid material, while the <b>functional</b> <b>impressions</b> were taken using custom trays and thermoplastic material for border molding and polyvinyl siloxane impression material. Maxillo-mandibular relations were determined using temporary bases with wax rims. The final trial with artificial teeth arranged according to a balanced occlusion was conducted to verify horizontal and vertical relations, phonetics and esthetics. The maxillar and mandibular prosthesis were produced in the heat cure acrylic resin. Disrupted functions of the oro-facial system such as mastication, swallowing and phonetics are improved significantly with complete dentures. Conclusion: Correct maxillo - mandibular relations and normal function of the dentofacial system in patients with ED, can be achieved by the acrylic dentures. Prosthodontic treatment has a major impact not only on the functions and esthetics, but on the psychological development and emotional state as well.

40|$|Patients with a {{tracheostomy}} stoma experience compromised {{speech and}} function {{due to the}} associated changes in airflow patterns. Rehabilitation of a patient with tracheal stoma is a highly challenging task. The main objective is to design an inexpensive, easily fabricated stomal prosthesis for postlaryngectomy patients who require prolonged tracheotomy. This clinical case report describes a 29 -year-old male patient who underwent for tracheotomy 3 months before for respiratory distress following a suicidal attempt. Hence tracheotomy was done, and the patient {{has been with the}} tracheostomal tube since surgery for the past 3 months. Laryngoscopy examination reported as restricted bilateral vocal cord movements, and the cords were in the adducted position with minimal glottic chink. No history of difficulty in swallowing. On examination, no scar or ulceration is seen around the stoma. The skin around the stoma is healthy. The patient was referred to the oral and maxillofacial Prosthodontics Department from the Department of ENT. The patient′s old tracheostomal tube was used as the dimensions of the custom made tracheal prosthesis without making a <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> of the mature stoma. A tracheal button was made with 2 mm polyethylene urethane sheet to maintain the airway patency of the mature stoma. Width and length of the old tracheostomal tube were measured and customized with polyurethane sheet by directly flaming over heat. The finished product was thin, flexible, maintains enhanced tear strength, require no tapes or adhesives and less technique sensitive. These properties of the prosthesis make more advantageous than the commercially available tracheal buttons. The result in this patient was excellent with no postoperative complications. An innovative approach for fabrication of tracheostomal prosthesis was discussed to increase its successful use in tracheostomal patients.

40|$|Background: Functional {{selective}} pressure {{impression on}} the residual ridge is much highly recommended {{than the rest of}} the anatomic impressions in distal-extension removable partial dentures (RPD). However, the present methods are significantly more complex, require additional treatment time, and involve more laboratory procedures. Methods: This novel impression procedure involves the following steps. A special force transport unit is first designed and assembled on the stock or custom tray over the residual ridge, through which the opposite teeth can bite on the force transport unit and transport the occlusion force to the impression body. The primary full arch impression is then created using heavy body type of vinyl polysiloxane impression materials. Next, part of the impression overlapping the residual ridge is freed from the intact impression body and the tray with a scalpel. Finally, the final impression is made with a lightbody vinyl polysiloxane impression. The light-body materials are loaded onto the surface of the primary impression and the space from the scalpel cut. The primary impression is set into the mouth, allowing the opposite teeth to bite on the force transport during the impression making process. The free parts are bound to obtain the final impression after the materials are set. Results: This <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> method could record the anatomic form of the teeth and the functional form of the residual ridge, simultaneously capturing the surface morphology and location of the saddle, which is derived from the deformation after chew loading. Conclusion: This functional pressure impression for RPD is simple, could be easily mastered by dentists, and does not increase the laboratory workload of dental technicians...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the incidence, main causes, and risk factors of iatrogenic disease occurring in a department of internal medicine. METHODS: Over a 1 -year period, physicians systematically filled out a 2 -page questionnaire for all patients admitted to the ward. A database was created and the data were statistically analyzed. Patients undergoing immunosuppressive, chemo-, or radiation therapy were excluded. Missing data were completed by reviewing the patients' charts. The patients were then divided into two groups: those with and those without iatrogenic disease. The groups were compared using several parameters including gender, age, social features, days of hospitalization, associated illness, <b>functional</b> status, medical <b>impression,</b> prognosis, associated renal or liver function impairment, drugs taken daily, and outcome. In the group with iatrogenic disease, the type, severity, and predictability were also analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 879 patients admitted to the ward, 445 completed questionnaires and were included in the study. A total of 102 patients (22. 9 %) developed 121 iatrogenic events. Forty-four patients (43. 1 %) were admitted for iatrogenic illness, 10 (9. 8 %) developed life-threatening events, and in 3 (6. 8 %) it was the cause of death. Fifty-eight patients (56. 8 %) registered 77 episodes of iatrogenic disease during their hospital stay, 20 (19. 6 %) developed life-threatening events, and 9 (11. 7 %) died, 4 (5. 2 %) of an iatrogenic cause (nosocomial infections). Significant differences were found in 20 out of 26 parameters studied (p< 0. 005 for all cases; 95 % confidence interval). Eighteen percent of all iatrogenic disease was severe, 61. 9 % predictable, 54. 5 % avoidable, and 59 % drug-related, 80 % of which was due to side effects or adverse reactions. Infection and metabolic and electrolyte disorders were the most frequent effects. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to identify risk factors for iatrogenic events.

40|$|The {{physical}} and social space in which a consumer finds herself is a large influencing factor on product evaluation and decision-making (Solomon & Rabolt, 2004 : 434). De Klerk (1999) states that, although most clothing consumers have a preconceived idea about where to go shopping for clothing and which type of clothing is desired, the final decision-making takes place within the store where consumers need information about the clothing products in order to evaluate the quality {{and to be able}} to make the final decision. It is said that retailers need to spend enough money, space and time on fitting rooms as the fitting room can be seen as the point and place where most apparel-based decisions are made (Lee & Johnson, sa: 2). Fitting rooms are one of the critical areas in clothing stores; this is where the consumer tries on apparel products, makes evaluations about the products, and decisions to buy these apparel products or not (Rea, Mang & Underhill, as quoted by Baumstarck, 2008 : 12). The research problem of this study is that in order for consumers to evaluate apparel products effectively and to make apparel buying decisions with which they can be satisfied, the fitting room experience plays a role. However, it is not known how consumers evaluate apparel products’ quality and how the fitting room experience should be in order for the consumers to evaluate the apparel products’ quality effectively. Therefore the purpose of this study was to explore and describe the role of the fitting room experience in Mzansi youth female consumers’ evaluation of apparel products’ quality. The retail experience entails the aesthetic (stimulus, emotion and cognition) as well as <b>functional</b> (synchronising <b>impressions,</b> layout, space, service, furniture & fixtures) aspects. Evaluation of apparel quality comprises intrinsic, extrinsic and behavioural characteristics. The behavioural characteristics include the apparel products’ functional (durability, comfort and maintenance) and aesthetic (stimulus, emotion and cognition) qualities. The justification for conducting this research was that this research could lead to the generation of new information. This information may be used by retailers to enhance the fitting room experience in order to make it easier for consumers to evaluate apparel products’ quality, so that the most appropriate apparel buying decisions can be made and customer satisfaction may be increased. The confirmation/disconfirmation paradigm was used as theoretical perspective for the study. This paradigm was integrated with the literature and the relevant concepts to form the conceptual framework which directed the study. This study was conducted qualitatively where the aim was to explore and describe the phenomenon. Phenomenology was used as strategy of inquiry. The Mzansi youth female consumers, who are part of the Black Diamond consumer group, were used as unit of analysis for this study, as the literature indicates that the Black Diamonds are the fastest growing consumer group within South Africa. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to accumulate the participants of the study. Fifteen females took part in this study. Fortunately data saturation did occur, so no more participants were needed. The researcher used unstructured interviews to gather data as well as a photo-elicitation technique. The photos were used as an external stimulus in the interview process. This ensured data with depth and breadth. Two interviews (approximately 30 minutes each) were held with each participant. The second interview was only conducted after each participant had completed a specific task. The data was analysed by using the five steps suggested by Yin (2011 : 176). The findings showed that the fitting room experience does play a crucial role in the Mzansi youth female consumer’s evaluation of apparel products’ quality. Furthermore it showed that the Mzansi youth female consumers do have clear expectations regarding the fitting room’s aesthetics and functionality, and also how these two elements should interact and should be in order for the Mzansi youth female consumer to be able to evaluate the apparel products’ quality effectively. The findings further showed that when these expectations are not met by the actual fitting room experience it leads to the Mzansi youth female consumer being dissatisfied and therefore stopping her evaluation of the apparel products’ quality or even leaving the store. Therefore this study came to the overall conclusion that the fitting room is the place where the final decision to buy or not to buy is made, and where decisions about possible future visits are made, irrespective of the rest of the retail environment. It should therefore be treated like the queen of the apparel retail environment, and certainly not like the Cinderella.

No information was obtained on the reproduction of surface detail of these materials over time. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate changes in the surface quality of three tissue conditioners after being immersed in water for a period of time. Materials and Method: Detail reproduction was determined by using from a ruled test block the same it was specified in ISO Specification 4823. Three tissue conditioners (GC, Acrosoft, and Visco-gel) were evaluated. Samples were made by pouring freshly mixed materials into a ruled test block. The samples were then stored in distilled water for either of the followings periods of time: 0 hour, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days. Subsequently, the dental stone was mixed with distilled water and poured on each sample and allowed to remain for 60 minutes. Then, 25 specimens were prepared. The detail reproduction was determined based on what is specified in ISO Specification 4823. The samples were examined under a stereo-microscope with low-angle illumination. The data was analyzed through running Kruskal-Wallis Test and Mann-Whitney Test. Results: The three materials had minimum standard of detail reproduction. The detail reproduction were more significantly influenced by the time period of immersion in water (p < 0. 0005) than the type of the material. The best detail reproduction was pertained to Visco-gel not immersed in water. Acrosoft was less influenced by the time period of immersion in water than the two other types. Conclusion: The detail reproduction may be attributed to chemical composition. The type of material and immersion time had a significant effect, while the effect of the type was less significant. The best time for making functional impressions was ranges from 0 to 24 hours...|$|E

Naglašeni su osjetljivi i osobito važni zahvati. Osobito treba istaknuti, da često uspijeva, već po situacijskom otisku s HM-masom i bez funkcionalnog otiska na individualnoj žlici, izraditi funkcionalno dobru protezu. No ovi materijali iziskuju, osim teoretskog upućivanja i zornu demonstraciju. Zato je ova uputa samo podsjetnik i dopuna za protetičare kojima je ta metoda već poznata. U poglavlju Kritički osvrt ukazuje se na neke specifičnosti te metode. Velika važnost pridaje se sistematskom ucrtavanju na situacijskom i funkcionalnom otisku, te na radnom modelu. Pravilno ucrtavanje bitno je za izradu individualne žlice, koja je ključna faza u izradi totalne proteze. Osim specifičnih svojstava ovih materijala, originalna pravila za ucrtavanje sačinjavaju karakteristiku ove metode. Nabore sluznice treba prosuđivati po njihovoj dinamici u odnosu na rubove protezne baze. No dinamička vrijednost nabora je vrlo različita. Samo pri vrlo aktivnim naborima može se približno prosuditi dinamička vrijednost. Dinamička vrijednost manje aktivnih nabora pronalazi se funkcionalnim otiskom, no i na situacijskom otisku s HM-masom dolazi ona do izražaja. Treba naglasiti da dobri rezultati ovise i o pažljivom radu u laboratoriju. Čitav je rad rezultat velikog praktičkog iskustva i odiše uvjerenjem da ovi materijali omogućuju znatno veći postotak uspjeha.

Particular emphasis is placed on delicate and im po rtan t interventions. Apart fro m theoretical instruction these materials require a course of object dem onstration. These instructions are therefore only a reminder for the prosthodontists who were previously acquainted w ith this method. In the chapter »Critical Review« some specificities of this method are mentioned {{in the form of a}} discussion. Particular importance is ascribed to the systematical recording of the positional, <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> and also to the recordings made on the positional and working model. Correctm arking is essential fo r the individual impression spoon which is the key problem in the manufacture of the total prosthetic base since the way in which the edges o f the prosthesis behave towards active and passive tissues depend on it. The folds o f the mucosa must be assessed according to their dynamics in relation to the edges of the prosthetic base. But the dynamic value of the folds is very different. The destabilization effect of the fold cannot be assessed visuaIly but shows on the positional impression made w ith the HM substance. It ought to be emphasized that good results depend m ostly on careful w o rk in the laboratory. The en tire work is the result of great practical experience and confirms the belief that these materials make possible a higher percentage of successful interventions.

40|$|Statement of Problems: Although {{the primary}} use of tissue conditioners is for healing the damaged mucosa {{but they can}} also be used as {{functional}} impression; it seems that its effeicasy depends on its viscoelastic features such as compatibility with gypsum and surface roughness. Purpose: The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the surface roughness of gypsum with several tissue conditioner impression materials avaliable in the market. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, three tissue conditioners (Acrosoft, viscogel & GC) were used. Pars dental gypsum moldano Type III and a polyvinyl siloxane impression were used for the controls. The tissue conditioners powder liquid ratio was mixed according to the manufacturer’s recommendation and immediately poured in a mold with an internal diameter of 18 mm and depth of 2 mm. The mold was completely filled. Then, a glass block with the mean roughness of 0. 8 µm was placed on its surface for two hours. Then, the 5 samples were immediately placed in 37 oC water for 0 - 24 hrs, 3, 7, and 14 days. After that, the specimens were beaded, boxed and poured with pars dental gypsum type III. The gypsum sample’s surface roughness was measured with profilometer with the length of 2. 5 mm and cut-off of 0. 8 mm. The results were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey tests. Results: The results showed that surface roughness of Acrosoft in different storage times did not change significantly and there was no significant difference between Acrosoft and the control group. Viscogels surface roughness was significantly different with all other groups at zero time; with the increase of storage time the surface roughness decreases. The control group showed a significant difference with viscogel at zero time and with GC at 24 hrs and 3 days but it revealed no difference with the other groups. The least surface roughness belonged to GC at zero and 14 days and the highests surface roughness belonged to viscogel at zero time. Conclusion: Surface roughness depends on the chemical structure of the material. The best time for pouring with tissue conditioners for <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> is 24 hrs to 3 days after making impression.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDRehabilitation of edentulous jaws {{without the}} option of osseointegrating {{implants}} will remain the only treatment option within reach of many older patients for the foreseeable future. Many routine prosthodontic procedures are based on dogmas, because no high-level scientific evidence exists to either accept or reject them, among these is the “neutral zone” (NZ) concept. In spite of paucity of evidence using approved patient-based outcome instruments, it is generally agreed that the NZ should be respected when constructing complete dentures. The purpose of this research project was to determine how shapes of conventional and NZ mandibular dentures differ, and if the {{two different types of}} dentures impact differently on oral health–related quality of life by using an accepted oral health-related quality of life instrument as a patient-based outcome. Thirty nine edentulous patients were selected for this prospective, randomised, cross-over, single-blinded clinical trial. Two sets of complete dentures were made for each patient. One denture set was made following conventional biometric guidelines for determining the position of the mandibular posterior denture teeth in relation to the ridge; another set was made following a <b>functional</b> <b>impression</b> of the potential denture space. Each set of dentures was worn for at least two months. A similar number of types of dentures were delivered first. Widths of residual ridges and mandibular denture arches were measured using digital measuring software. Position of denture teeth was related to the ridge. Denture dimensions were compared by means of analysis of variance using the mixed procedure. Using formula of parabola, arch-widths were compared using paired t-tests. Pre- and post-treatment patient feedback was obtained by means of the 20 -item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 20) and a preference score. Treatment effect size (ES) was established based on the OHIP- 20 scores. Relevant associations among denture dimensions, OHIP- 20 scores, preference, age, gender, marital status, education, income, period of edentulousness, and quality of denture-bearing tissue were done using the generalised linear model and correlation analysis. For all statistical analysis, level of significance was determined at p< 0. 05. The mean age of the sample was 62. 3 years. Twenty four patients were female. Mean period of edentulousness was 31 years and mean number of denture sets worn prior to the trial was 2. 5. Except for the canine region, NZ dentures were statistically wider than anatomic dentures. The difference in mean widths between the two types of dentures was larger for female patients. Older patients had smaller differences in denture dimensions. More unfavourable denture-bearing tissue was associated with a larger difference in the two types of dentures. Both types of mandibular dentures significantly improved the OHRQoL of patients. Both types of dentures had a high treatment ES. The OHIP- 20 instrument could not distinguish a statistical difference in impact on OHRQoL between the two treatment options. There was a minute difference in treatment ES between the two types of treatment. The only domain representing a small clinical benefit between NZ and anatomic dentures was “physical pain”, with the NZ dentures scoring better. There was no correlation between pre- and post-treatment scores for both types of dentures. No significant associations were found between post-treatment OHIP- 20 scores {{on the one hand and}} tissue scores, gender, age, education, marital status, period of edentulousness and denture dimension differences on the other hand. Based on OHIP- 20 scores, there was a significant association between denture preference and NZ dentures, but not for the other preferences. No significant associations were found between denture preferences on the one hand and tissue scores, gender, age, period of edentulousness and denture dimension differences on the other hand. Even though no significant relationship was found between preference and gender, the majority of female patients preferred the NZ denture and the majority of male patients did not express a preference. Providing new complete dentures improved OHRQoL of edentulous patients. The majority of female patients preferred the NZ compared over the ANA denture. The NZ technique appeared to have a higher positive impact on OHRQoL of female patients compared to male patients...|$|E
