5|$|After {{the station}} was closed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> {{immediately}} modified. The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but {{could also be used}} for servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{became the}} sixth country (not {{counting}} the United States) {{to have a}} player represent it {{in the major leagues}}, when Joe Quinn made his debut on 26 April 1884 for the St. Louis Maroons. Quinn also became the first Australian-born manager, as a player-manager for the St. Louis Browns in 1895. After Quinn played his last MLB game, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> 85years before another Australian would appear in an MLB game: Craig Shipley on 22 June 1986 for the Los Angeles Dodgers. The most recent Australian-born player to make his debut in the major leagues is Liam Hendriks, who played for the Minnesota Twins on 6 September 2011.|$|E
5|$|Director Reeves {{featured}} many {{scenes of}} intense onscreen torture and violence that were considered unusually sadistic at the time. Upon its theatrical release throughout {{the spring and}} summer of 1968, the movie's gruesome content was met with disgust by several film critics in the UK, despite having been extensively censored by the British Board of Film Censors. In the US, the film was shown virtually intact and was a box office success, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> completely ignored by reviewers.|$|E

5|$|Ganga Bruta was {{the sixth}} feature film {{directed}} by Humberto Mauro {{and his second}} for film studio Cinédia, a company owned by Adhemar Gonzaga. Gonzaga, who was the film producer, conceived it as a silent film with a score recorded on disk and synchronized to the film during its exhibition. When <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> finished, however, Gonzaga agreed to adding voices recorded on Vitaphone, a change prompted by the advent of sound films and their rise in popularity in the Brazilian market during {{the production of the}} film.|$|E
5|$|Rates of DKA {{vary around}} the world. In the United Kingdom, about 4% {{of people with}} type 1 {{diabetes}} develop DKA each year, while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. DKA was first described in 1886 and, until the introduction of insulin therapy in the 1920s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> universally fatal. The risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is currently around 1–4%. Up to 1% of children with DKA develop a complication known as cerebral edema.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was in such}} a state of disrepair by the 1980s that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> demolished, and the nearby tracks were torn up and sold for scrap by 1984. However, the station avoided demolition and was renovated in 1988. It was used as a real estate office, and the rail corridor itself was formally opened five years later as the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. In 1999, the station became an Italian restaurant and received its current name, La Stazione. The {{building was}} expanded in 2003 and served as the setting for a scene in a 2008 mob film.|$|E

5|$|The canal {{company went}} {{bankrupt}} and {{was bought by}} the state in 1886. This briefly gave it a new lease of life, but the canal had an obsolete gauge. By {{the start of the}} 20th century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> abandoned. The canal was neglected and parts were filled in. In the 1970s the A47 autoroute between Givors and Saint-Étienne covered almost all the sections that remained, apart from the site at Tartaras where the double lock and tunnel have been preserved as a heritage site.|$|E

5|$|The west wing's {{design is}} known only from archival records, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> totally {{destroyed}} between {{the seventeenth and}} nineteenth centuries. The {{first part of the}} wing consisted of stables, a spiral staircase leading to the exterior façade, a corridor linking the courtyard to the street and a large pantry. During the seventeenth century, the second part held an indoor jeu de paume court and a chapel; its first floor had three large bedrooms.|$|E

5|$|Advance {{elements}} of the 24th Infantry were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on 5 July, the first encounter between American and North Korean forces. For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> completely destroyed but delayed North Korean forces until July 20. By that time, the 8th Army′s force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Gilbert faced {{financial}} difficulty {{as an amateur}} cricketer. Most amateurs were from privileged backgrounds, whereas professionals mainly came from the working class. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> unthinkable for an amateur to become a professional, although many did receive financial inducements such as generous expenses and sinecure positions within county organisations. Unlike the Grace brothers, Gilbert {{did not have a}} profession outside cricket to provide a supplementary income allowing him to live comfortably. A solution seemed to arrive in 1880, when Fred Grace, the manager of the United South of England XI touring side and one of W. G. Grace's brothers, died and Gilbert took over his paid job as secretary. But the popularity of professional touring teams was already in decline, and the increasing number of matches between county teams attracted more interest. An indication of trouble came in 1882 when a professional cricketer took Gilbert to court over unpaid fees for an appearance in a match.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of political and strategic decisions, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> two years before the battalion went into combat again. In late 1944, in order to free up American troops for operations in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea. The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944, with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944. Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and into the interior. Supported by food supplies from native gardens in the Torricelli Mountains, the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians' primary tactic of aggressive patrolling.|$|E
5|$|During the 19thcentury {{the estate}} was again {{affected}} by transport projects. In 1804 the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was opened, replacing the Mersey and Irwell Navigation; this {{cut off the}} northern part of the estate, making it only accessible by a bridge. The Grand Junction Railway was built across the estate in 1837, followed by the Warrington and Chester Railway, which opened in 1850; both of these lines affected the southeast part of the estate. In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was replaced by the Manchester Ship Canal, and {{the northern part of}} the estate could only be accessed by a swing bridge. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> completely demolished in 1928. Rubble from the house was used in the foundations of a new chemical works. During the demolition, the undercroft was retained and roofed with a cap of concrete. In 1966 the current SirRichard Brooke gave Norton Priory in trust for the benefit of the public.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{the town}} was served by two {{electric}} tram routes operated by Oldham Corporation. The first ran from Higginshaw and opened on 15 November 1904 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> immediately extended to Chadderton Road, Oldham. The second line from Royton opened on 13 April 1905. By January 1921 both lines shared a terminus at Wrens Nest and the Royton line had been extended to Hollinwood. In the same year, the routes were assigned numbers; Hollinwood to Shaw route was No.8 and the route to Chadderton Road was No.9. There were plans to extend the lines to the railway station and High Crompton but these never materialised. Route 9 was closed on 11 June 1935 and route 8 was closed on 2 December 1939, both were replaced by buses.|$|E

5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had a respite from attack because while it hugged the coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always within striking distance, and waiting for an opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Nuremberg Laws had a {{crippling}} {{economic and social}} impact on the Jewish community. Persons convicted of violating the marriage laws were imprisoned, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores, many of which closed {{due to lack of}} customers. As Jews were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government-regulated professions such as medicine and education, many middle class business owners and professionals were forced to take menial employment. Emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country. By 1938 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them. Mass deportation schemes such as the Madagascar Plan proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out, and starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.|$|E
5|$|After {{participating}} in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king's wife Philippa to her coronation in January 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent. At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive. It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment. The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor. Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a rope around his neck {{as a sign of}} atonement. Edward III however knew that leniency was not an option for the aforementioned entrapment utilized by Mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship if his father, Edward II truly was alive. Thus Edward III sanctioned the killing of his uncle. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> impossible to find anyone willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon. Edmund's body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.|$|E
