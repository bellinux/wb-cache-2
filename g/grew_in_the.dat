5|$|As {{automobile}} use {{in southern}} Ontario <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century, road {{design and construction}} advanced significantly. A major issue faced by planners was {{the improvement of the}} routes connecting Toronto and Hamilton, which were consistently overburdened by the growing traffic levels.|$|E
5|$|As the West German public's {{awareness}} of the SS atrocities <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s, the attitudes towards Waffen-SS veterans shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Battersea, {{listed as}} Patricesy (St Peter's Water) in the Domesday Book and first {{mentioned}} in records of 693 AD, {{on the south}} {{bank of the river}} opposite Chelsea, was by contrast low and marshy land, prone to flooding. Conditions were ideal for farming asparagus and lavender, and a small market town <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area based on the asparagus and lavender industries.|$|E

5|$|Between 1964 and 1976, 50 {{killer whales}} from the Pacific Northwest were {{captured}} for display in aquaria, and {{public interest in}} the animals <b>grew.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led {{to the discovery of}} the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.|$|E
5|$|In mythology, {{birds were}} {{sometimes}} monsters, like the Roc and the Māori's Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, {{the first to}} come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was to shake the seeds of all the plants out of the tree.|$|E
5|$|International {{tensions}} <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s. Crises {{were caused}} by the German occupation of the Rhineland in 1936; the Anschluss and Sudeten crisis of 1938; and the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and the Italian invasion of Albania {{in the spring of}} 1939. These events forced the Dutch government to exercise greater vigilance, but they limited their reaction as much as they could. The most important measure was a partial mobilisation of 100,000 men in April 1939.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, concerns <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British government about the threat of German invasion along the east coast of England. The bays just to the north of Dunstanburgh Castle were vulnerable targets for an enemy amphibious landing, and efforts were made to fortify the castle and the surrounding area in 1940, as part of a wider line of defences erected by Sir Edmund Ironside.|$|E
5|$|The Pixies {{achieved}} modest {{popularity in}} their home country, but were more successful in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe and Israel. Their jarring pop sound influenced bands such as Nirvana, Radiohead, the Strokes, Bush, Blur and Weezer.

5|$|The {{population}} grew {{slowly in the}} 17th century: St. John's was Newfoundland's largest settlement when English naval officers began to take censuses around 1675. The population <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summers {{with the arrival of}} migratory fishermen. In 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South Devon) set up fishing rooms at St. John's, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats.|$|E
5|$|While {{the suburb}} still {{contains}} a notable amount of native vegetation, {{and has not}} been exposed to invasive introduced species like other areas have, much of it was originally cleared for grazing and has yet to grow back to the same extent. Before European Settlement Grey Box, SA Blue Gum, Sheoak, Manna Gum and River Red Gum trees were native to and <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, particularly on the slopes leading down to the Adelaide Plains.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to get beyond their trial phase and diminished as conflict <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region in the early 1980s. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla {{as one of the}} Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated.|$|E

5|$|Arable farming <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> High Middle Ages and {{agriculture}} entered {{a period of}} relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century. Unlike England, Scotland had no towns dating from Roman occupation. From the twelfth century there are records of burghs, chartered towns, which became major centre of crafts and trade. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade, and {{until the end of}} the period barter was probably the most common form of exchange. Craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|As {{attendance}} at ISMB <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1990s, several satellite meetings and {{special interest group}} (SIG) meetings formed alongside the main conference. SIG meetings are held over {{one or two days}} before the main conference and focus on a specific topic, allowing more detailed discussion than there would be time for in the main conference. Notable SIG meetings include the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC), which has been held annually since 2000 and Bio-Ontologies, which has been held annually since 1998. Satellite meetings are usually two days long and are held in conjunction with ISMB. The 12th CAMDA conference and the 9th 3DSIG meeting were held as satellite meetings of ISMB/ECCB 2013.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and 1960s, {{the volume of}} mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E

5|$|Ashford's {{importance}} as an agricultural and market town <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th century, and in 1243, King Henry III granted the town a charter {{to hold a}} market for livestock. The pottery industry expanded in the 13th and 14th centuries, with the main works based at what is now Potter's Corner, a few {{miles west of the}} town centre. Later evidence from examining waste suggests that production was on a large scale. The Kent Archaeological society have discovered sandy ware at this location dating from around 1125 – 1250.|$|E
5|$|Clevedon is a {{town and}} civil parish in the unitary {{authority}} of North Somerset, which covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset, England.

It lies among a group of small hills, including Church Hill, Wain's Hill (topped by the remains of an Iron Age hill fort), Dial Hill, Strawberry Hill, Castle Hill, Hangstone Hill and Court Hill which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest along the Severn estuary. Clevedon was mentioned in the Domesday Book but <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Victorian era as a seaside resort.|$|E
5|$|French fur traders from Canada {{were the}} first Europeans to enter Indiana, {{beginning}} in the 1670s. The quickest route connecting the New France districts of Canada and Louisiana ran along Indiana's Wabash River. The Terre Haute highlands were once considered {{the border between the}} two French districts. This made Indiana a vital part of French lines of communication and trade routes. The French established Vincennes as a permanent settlement in Indiana during European rule, but the population of the area remained primarily Native American. As French influence <b>grew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, Great Britain, competing with France for control of North America, came to believe that control of Indiana was important to halt French expansion on the continent.|$|E
