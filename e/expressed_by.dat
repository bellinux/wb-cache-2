5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as <b>expressed</b> <b>by</b> Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as <b>expressed</b> <b>by</b> Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E
5|$|Following an 1866 {{conflict}} between the increasingly authoritarian Cuza and the political class, various trends organized a coup which brought Prince Carol, a Hohenzollern, to the Romanian throne—echoing a will <b>expressed</b> <b>by</b> some of the 1848 activists to have a foreign dynasty rule over a unified state. In 1877, {{as a consequence of}} the Russo-Turkish War, Romania proclaimed her independence.|$|E

5|$|Motion {{argues that}} {{aside from the}} {{sometimes}} facetious tone, the opinions <b>expressed</b> <b>by</b> Larkin in his Coleman persona, particularly the mild xenophobia that enters the essay, foreshadow his own mature prejudices.

5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} widely used for {{industrial}} needs for higher quality. Refined sugar is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500).

5|$|Serpins {{are also}} <b>expressed</b> <b>by</b> viruses {{as a way}} to evade the host's immune defense. In particular, serpins <b>expressed</b> <b>by</b> pox viruses, {{including}} cow pox (vaccinia) and rabbit pox (myxoma), are of interest because of their potential use as novel therapeutics for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy. Serp1 suppresses the TLR-mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac allograft survival in rats. Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase1 and caspase8). In comparison to their mammalian counterparts, viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of secondary structure. Specifically, crmA lacks the D-helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E-helices.|$|E
