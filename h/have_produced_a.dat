5|$|Istanbul's {{strategic}} {{position on the}} historic Silk Road, rail networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> cosmopolitan populace, although less so since {{the establishment of the}} Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established {{at the end of the}} 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today. Infrastructure improvements <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> complex transportation network.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> self-replicating molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|Highly {{energetic}} {{chemistry is}} thought to <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of all life existed.

The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.|$|E

5|$|Impact {{throughout}} the season was minimal and no deaths were recorded. In early August, the remnants of Hurricane Darby aided in localized heavy rainfall in Hawaii, causing minor street and stream flooding; coffee and macadamia trees were damaged as well. In early September, Hurricane Howard resulted in significant flooding across Baja California Peninsula that damaged agricultural land and 393 homes. Large swells also resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in California. In mid-September, Javier caused three fishermen to go missing and helped alleviate a multi-year drought across the Southwest United States. It produced record rainfall {{in the state of}} Wyoming. In mid- to late October, Tropical Storm Lester and Tropical Depression Sixteen-E caused localized flooding; the latter may <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> tornado near Culiacán, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
5|$|Not long after, {{the legend}} continues, {{a group of}} Sakalava (or, by some accounts, Vazimba) warriors were {{preparing}} to attack a village north of Alasora called Ambohipeno. Ralambo {{announced that it would}} be sufficient to throw a rotten egg at the warriors, and Kelimalaza would take care of the rest. According to oral history, the egg was thrown and hit a warrior in the head, killing him on contact; his corpse fell onto another warrior and killed him, and this corpse fell onto another and so forth, until the warriors had all been destroyed, forevermore confirming the power of Kelimalaza as the protector of the kingdom {{in the minds of the}} Merina populace. Similarly, at the besieged Imerina village of Ambohimanambola, invoking Kelimalaza was said to <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> massive hailstorm that wiped out the enemy warriors.|$|E
5|$|Original Tulipa {{species can}} be {{obtained}} for ornamental purposes, such as Tulipa tarda and Tulipa turkestanica. These {{are referred to as}} species, or botanical, tulips, and tend to be smaller plants but better at naturalising than the cultivated forms. Breeding programs <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> wide range of tulip types, enabling blooming through a much longer season by creating early, mid- and late spring varieties. Fourteen distinct types are available in addition to botanical tulips, including Lily-flowered, Fringed, Viridiflora and Rembrandt. In addition to blooming season, tulip varieties differ in shape, and height, and exhibit a wide range of colours, both pure and in combination.|$|E

5|$|Scotland in the High Middle Ages is a {{relatively}} well-studied topic and Scottish medievalists <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of publications. Some, such as David Dumville, Thomas Owen Clancy and Dauvit Broun, are primarily interested in the native cultures of the country, and often have linguistic training in the Celtic languages. Normanists, such as G.W.S. Barrow, {{are concerned with the}} Norman and Scoto-Norman cultures introduced to Scotland after the eleventh century. For much of the twentieth century, historians tended to stress the cultural change that took place in Scotland during this time. However, scholars such as Cynthia Neville and Richard Oram, while not ignoring cultural changes, argue that continuity with the Gaelic past was just as, if not more, important.|$|E
5|$|The local {{way of life}} {{reflects}} the Scottish and Norse heritage of the isles, including the Up Helly Aa fire festival, and a strong musical tradition, especially the traditional fiddle style. The islands <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> variety of writers of prose and poetry, often in the distinct Shetland dialect of Scots. There are numerous areas set aside to protect the local fauna and flora, including {{a number of important}} sea bird nesting sites. The Shetland pony and Shetland Sheepdog are two well-known Shetland animal breeds. Other local breeds include the Shetland sheep, cow, goose, and duck. The Shetland pig, or grice, has been extinct since about 1930.|$|E
5|$|Copp {{wrote that}} Charnwood should <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> rapid {{breakthrough}} but {{concedes that the}} battle {{was one of the}} most difficult of the campaign. Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for such high Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes that from the German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them. Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate local counter-attacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops, losses they could ill-afford. He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.|$|E

5|$|Variations in the toolkit may <b>have</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> {{large part}} of the {{morphological}} evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways. A toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's large ground-finch was enlarged by the BMP gene, or when snakes lost their legs as distal-less became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs. Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, distal-less, which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that small changes in toolbox genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. distal-less generates wing patterns in the butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene, which are Müllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.|$|E
