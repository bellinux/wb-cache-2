25|$|Aneuploidy is the {{presence}} of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, for example a human cell having 45 or 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. It does not include a difference of one or more complete sets of chromosomes, which is called <b>euploidy.</b> An extra or missing chromosome is a common cause of genetic disorders, including some human birth defects. Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers of chromosomes. Aneuploidy originates during cell division when the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells. Most cases of aneuploidy result in miscarriage and the most common extra autosomal chromosomes among live births are 21, 18 and 13.|$|E

50|$|<b>Euploidy</b> is {{the state}} of a cell or {{organism}} having one or more than one set of the same set of chromosomes, possibly excluding the sex-determining chromosomes. For example, most human cells have 2 of each of the 23 homologous monoploid chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. A human cell with an extra set out of the 23 normal ones would be considered euploid. Euploid karyotypes would consequentially be a multiple of the haploid number, which in humans is 23. Aneuploidy {{is the state}} where one or more chromosomes of a normal set are missing or present in more than their usual number of copies. Unlike <b>euploidy,</b> aneuploid karyotypes will not be a multiple of the haploid number. In humans, examples of aneuploidy include having a single extra chromosome (such as Down syndrome), or missing a chromosome (such as Turner syndrome). Aneuploid karyotypes are given names with the suffix -somy (rather than -ploidy, used for euploid karyotypes), such as trisomy and monosomy.|$|E

Chorionic villus samples were diagnosed by traditional karyotyping using short-term cultures (STC) and long-term cultures (LTC), and by MLPA using kit P 095. DNA was extracted after digestion of whole villi with proteinase K and/or trypsin and collagenase. Different cell-dissociation procedures were tested to obtain MLPA results representative of the cytotrophoblast layer and the mesenchymal core. Over 95 % of the MLPA results were in concordance with the traditional karyotyping of STC and LTC. Traditional karyotyping revealed seven mosaics. After digestion of whole villi with proteinase K, only abnormal cell lines confined to the STC gave rise to abnormal MLPA results. In one sample, the complete discrepancy between STC and LTC was resolved after enzymatic dissociation of cells from the cytotrophoblast layer and the mesenchymal core. MLPA in chorionic villus samples was found to be a reliable test for the detection of (an) <b>euploidies</b> of chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X, and Y.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the morphology, <b>euploidy</b> and implantation rate of cleavage stage and blastocyst stage embryos. Setting: Institution-based, tertiary care in-vitro fertilization centre. Study Design: This study included a retrospective data analysis of 306 embryos: 154 cleavage stage embryos and 152 blastocysts that underwent biopsy on day 3 and day 5 / 6, respectively, which were subsequently screened for aneuploidy by array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. Materials and Methods: Both cleavage stage and blastocyst stage embryos were categorized according to their morphology into the following three groups: good, average and poor. In addition, blastocysts were categorized into day 5 and day 6 embryos on the basis of their developmental rate. Results: The <b>euploidy</b> rate was found to be significantly higher for blastocysts with good morphology as compared to those with poor morphology, with 73. 2, 50 and 40. 5 % euploid embryos in the good, average and poor morphology groups, respectively (P[*]=[*] 0. 001). No significant association was found between day 3 embryo morphology and <b>euploidy</b> rates with 40. 6, 29. 3 and 25. 8 % euploid embryos in the three groups, respectively (P[*]=[*] 0. 254). The implantation rates, as per morphology, for the transferred euploid cleavage stage and blastocyst stage embryos were 43. 8, 37. 5 and 0 % (P[*]=[*] 0. 354) and 51. 7, 71. 4 and 66. 7 % (P[*]=[*] 0. 562) in the good, average and poor morphology groups, respectively. The <b>euploidy</b> rate for day 5 blastocysts was significantly higher (70 % vs. 34. 1 %, P < 0. 001) than that of day 6 blastocysts, but the implantation rate was similar in both the groups (58. 8 and 50 %, respectively). The miscarriage rates for the euploid cleavage stage and the blastocysts stage embryos were 18. 2 and 8. 3 % (P[*]=[*] 0. 575), respectively. Conclusion: Blastocyst morphology and the rate of development were found to be significantly associated with <b>euploidy,</b> whereas cleavage stage morphology was not. The implantation rates of the good quality, euploid cleavage stage embryos were higher than that of the poor quality embryos.

The study was performed by application of cell culture technology and a complex of cytochemical and cytophotometric assays. Were used picornaviruses from various genu. Results. According to the results obtained, resistant to picornavirus infection cells of different susceptible lines have similar changes in the phenotype. They have decreased number of nucleoli and increased percentage of <b>euploidy</b> (and near euploid). In resistant cells of all cultures the reduction in amount of DNA and RNA both in nucleus and in cytoplasm was found. All these data correlated with the increased <b>euploidy</b> (and near euploid) of the resistant population. All picornavirus resistant cells had a less transformed phenotype, and decreased proliferative activity. Decreased nucleolar status becomes apparent by reduction of all nucleolar indices.

And the use of BoBs as a screening tool for euploid embryos in PGS was evaluated. Result: In the first part of validation study, there were total 75 embryos completed PGS by both BoBs and aCGH. The success rate of PGS was 97. 4 %, and the results showed 100 % concordance between BoBs and aCGH for aneuploidy. In the second part, a total 219 embryos were involved. The success rate of PGS by BoBs was 100 %. BoBs identified 28 % (62 / 219) <b>euploidy</b> which were further confirmed to be <b>euploidy</b> by aCGH.

40|$|<b>Euploidy</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the evolution and diversification of Psidium Linnaeus, 1753. However, few data about the nuclear DNA content, chromosome characterization (morphometry and class) and molecular markers have been reported for this genus. In this context, the present study aims to shed light on the genome of Psidium guineense Swartz, 1788, comparing it with Psidium guajava Linnaeus, 1753. Using flow cytometry, the nuclear 2 C value of P. guineense was 2 C = 1. 85 picograms (pg), and the karyotype showed 2 n = 4 x = 44 chromosomes. Thus, P. guineense has four chromosome sets, in accordance with the basic chromosome number of Psidium (x = 11). In addition, karyomorphometric analysis revealed morphologically identical chromosome groups in the karyotype of P. guineense. The high transferability of microsatellites (98. 6 %) further corroborates with phylogenetic relationship between P. guajava and P. guineense. Based on the data regarding nuclear genome size, karyotype morphometry and molecular markers of P. guineense and P. guajava (2 C = 0. 95 pg, 2 n = 2 x = 22 chromosomes), P. guineense is a tetraploid species.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Do {{external}} factors affect <b>euploidy</b> in egg donor cycles? SUMMARY ANSWER: The study demonstrates that during human assisted reproduction, embryonic chromosome abnormalities may be partly iatrogenic. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Chromosome abnormalities {{have been linked}} {{in the past to}} culture conditions such as temperature and Ph variations, as well as hormonal stimulation. Those reports were performed with older screening techniques (FISH), or ART methods no longer in use, and the subjects studied were not a homogeneous group. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A total of 1645 donor oocyte cycles and 13 282 blastocyst biopsies from 42 fertility clinics were included in this retrospective cohort study. Samples from donor cycles with PGS attempted between September 2011 and July 2015 were included. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: PGS cycles from multiple fertility clinics referred to Reprogenetics (Livingston, NJ) that involved only oocyte donation were included in this study. Testing was performed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Ploidy data were analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models with logistic regression using a logit link function considering a number of variables that represent fixed and random effects. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: <b>Euploidy</b> rate was associated with the referring center and independent of almost all the parameters examined except donor age and testing technology. Average <b>euploidy</b> rate per center ranged from 39. 5 to 82. 5 %. The mean expected rate of <b>euploidy</b> was 68. 4 %, but there are variations in this rate associated with the center effect. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Data set does not include details of the donor selection process, donor race or ethnic origin, ovarian reserve or ovarian responsiveness. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, associations are apparent, however, causality cannot be established. Discrepancies in regard to completeness and homogeneity of data exist due to data collection from over 40 different clinics. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first study to show a strong association between center-specific ART treatment practices and the incidence of chromosome abnormality in human embryos, although the meiotic or mitotic origin of these abnormalities could not be determined using these technologies. Given the widespread applications of ART in both subfertile and fertile populations, our findings should be of interest to the medical community in general as well as the ART community in particular.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the extent of intra-age and intercycle variations in the frequency of first polar body aneuploidy in two consecutive cycles of oocyte retrieval undertaken by the same patient within 1 year. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Fertility centers. PATIENT(S) : Infertile couples undergoing IVF. INTERVENTION(S) : Patients underwent two consecutive cycles of preimplantation genetic screening through first polar body biopsy within 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Meiosis I aneuploidy. RESULT(S) : A total of 226 patients underwent 452 cycles of preimplantation genetic screening. Differences within age groups were wide, with 0 - 100 % of oocytes being chromosomally normal in all age groups. <b>Euploidy</b> rates between centers were significantly different (48 % vs. 25 %). Intercycle differences for the same patient were also wide (0 - 100 %), but with 68. 5 % of patients having less than ± 2 euploid eggs of difference between cycles. CONCLUSION(S) : Although <b>euploidy</b> rate decreased on average with advancing maternal age, the high intra-age and intercenter variation in oocyte chromosome abnormalities emphasize the difficulty in estimating how many euploid oocytes a specific woman will have.

40|$|Polyploidization {{results in}} genome {{duplication}} {{and is an}} important step in evolution and speciation. The Malus genome confirmed that this genus was derived through auto-polyploidization, yet the genetic and meiotic mechanisms for polyploidization, particularly for aneuploidization, are unclear in this genus or other woody perennials. In fact the contribution of aneuploidization remains poorly understood throughout Plantae. We add to this knowledge by characterization of eupolyploidization and aneuploidization in 27, 542 F 1 seedlings from seven diploid Malus populations using cytology and microsatellite markers. We provide the first evidence that aneuploidy exceeds eupolyploidy in the diploid crosses, suggesting aneuploidization is a leading cause of genome duplication. Gametes from diploid Malus had a unique combinational pattern; ova preserved <b>euploidy</b> exclusively, while spermatozoa presented both <b>euploidy</b> and aneuploidy. All non-reduced gametes were genetically heterozygous, indicating first-division restitution was the exclusive mode for Malus eupolyploidization and aneuploidization. Chromosome segregation pattern among aneuploids was non-uniform, however, certain chromosomes were associated for aneuploidization. This study is the first to provide molecular evidence for the contribution of heterozygous non-reduced gametes to fitness in polyploids and aneuploids. Aneuploidization can increase, while eupolyploidization may decrease genetic diversity in their newly established populations. Auto-triploidization is important for speciation in the extant Malus.

40|$|During oogenesis, {{mammalian}} eggs accumulate proteins {{required for}} early embryogenesis. Although limited data suggest {{a vital role}} of these maternal factors in chromatin reprogramming and embryonic genome activation, {{the full range of}} their functions in preimplantation development remains largely unknown. Here we report a role for maternal proteins in maintaining chromosome stability and <b>euploidy</b> in early-cleavage mouse embryogenesis. Filia, expressed in growing oocytes, encodes a protein that binds to MATER and participates in a subcortical maternal complex essential for cleavage-stage embryogenesis. The depletion of maternal stores of Filia impairs preimplantation embryo development with a high incidence of aneuploidy that results from abnormal spindle assembly, chromosome misalignment, and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) inactivation. In helping to ensure normal spindle morphogenesis, Filia regulates the proper allocation of the key spindle assembly regulators (i. e., AURKA, PLK 1, and γ-tubulin) to the microtubule-organizing center via the RhoA signaling pathway. Concurrently, Filia is required for the placement of MAD 2, an essential component of the SAC, to kinetochores to enable SAC function. Thus, Filia is central to integrating the spatiotemporal localization of regulators that helps ensure <b>euploidy</b> and high-quality cell cycle progression in preimplantation mouse development.

The abnormal mitoses were associated with biochemical defects in the activation of separin, the sister-separating protease, rendering it unable to cleave the cohesin subunit Scc 1 efficiently.

40|$|SummaryThe terms ‘haploid’ and ‘diploid’ that {{describe}} single (n) and double (2 n) chromosome sets in cells were coined by the Polish-German botanist Eduard Strasburger and originate from the Greek terms haplóos meaning ‘single’ and diplóos meaning ‘double’. The term ‘ploidy’ was subsequently derived {{to describe the}} total chromosome content of cells. Consequently, the term ‘euploid’ refers to a chromosome complement that is an exact multiple of the haploid number. Therefore, haploids and diploids are both cases of normal <b>euploidy.</b> Euploid types that have more than two sets of chromosomes are ‘polyploid’ such as ‘triploid’ (3 n), ‘tetraploid’ (4 n), ‘pentaploid’ (5 n), and so forth.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of correct chromosome number (<b>euploidy)</b> during cell division {{is essential for}} health. Loss of <b>euploidy</b> is observed in most cancers and is linked to tumorigenesis. During mitosis, a highly conserved surveillance mechanism termed âspindle assembly checkpointÕ safeguards correct chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly bi-oriented on the spindle apparatus. The kinase Bub 1 functions in the spindle assembly checkpoint and in chromosome congression, but the impact of its catalytic activity on these function remains controversial. Here we present a thorough characterization of two novel small-molecule ATP-competitive inhibitors of Bub 1 kinase, BAY- 320 and BAY- 524, to demonstrate potent Bub 1 kinase inhibition both in vitro and in intact cells. We compared the cellular phenotypes of Bub 1 kinase inhibition in HeLa and RPE- 1 cells with those of protein depletion, indicative of catalytic or scaffolding functions, respectively. We demonstrate that Bub 1 inhibition resulted in the persistence of chromosome arm cohesion. Furthermore, Bub 1 inhibition affected chromosome association of Shugoshin and the chromosomal passenger complex, without abolishing global Aurora B function. Bub 1 cooperates with Haspin on CPC localization, as inhibition of both kinases showed an additive effect. But for all that, Bub 1 kinase inhibition exerted only minor effects on mitotic progression, chromosome alignment or spindle checkpoint function. In striking contrast, Bub 1 depletion impaired all the mentioned mitotic processes, arguing that Bub 1 largely operates as a scaffolding protein. Although, Bub 1 inhibition seems to have little influence in mitotic fidelity, BAY- 320 and BAY- 524 treatment sensitized cells to low doses of Paclitaxel, resulting in remarkable impairment of chromosome segregation and cell proliferation. These findings are relevant {{to our understanding of}} Bub 1 kinase function and the prospects of targeting Bub 1 for therapeutic applications. ...|$|E

All 9 clones could be divided into: (a) hypodiploid (modal number of chromo-somes 19 - 20), (b) diploid, and (c) hyperdiploid (modal number From 24 - 28). Morphologically, hypodiploid clones were fibroblast-like, hyper-diploid clones were epithelial-like, and diploid clones showed an intermediate type of growth. During 7 to 10 months of cultivation, {{the evolution of}} karyotypes of stem cells was observed in 6 of 9 clones, with a tendency of modal classes to shiFt toward diploidy. Karyotypes having 20 chromosomes were replaced by ones with 21 and 23, and those having 28 and 27 were replaced by complements with 27 and 26 chromosomes, respectively. Structural variants of karyotype were noted among cells with the same chromosome number. In the clones, different chromosome types were responsible For deviations From the diploid number. In hypo...|$|E
40|$|Variety seed samples, {{samples of}} eutetraploid plant {{progenies}} and samples of aneutetraploid or tetraploid population progenies were investigated for chromosome numbers. Genomal and chromosomal {{deviations from the}} artificially induced 4 x genome level were encountered. Though deviations from the genome level {{were found to be}} exceptional, their impact on the reproduction of chromosome numbers may not be underestimated because sugar beets cross readily between genome levels. In general eutetraploid plants remained stable at the 4 x genome level, but produced a high percentage of aneutetraploid plants. The chromosomal deviations on the 4 x genome level ranged from - 2 to + 3 chromosomes. In cytogenetic terms chromosome reproduction of eutetraploid plants is characterized by incomplete selection pressure for <b>euploidy.</b> The type of chromosome reproduction differs from the diploid type in as much as eutetraploid plants do not precisely reproduce the chromosome number and gene content, fundamentals on which are based the Mendelian laws of inheritance. In propagation and selection of tetraploid sugar beets the mode of reproduction of chromosome numbers described has to be taken into account. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The genomic in situ {{hybridization}} (GISH) {{has been}} used to identify <b>euploidy</b> and aneuploidy in segregation generations of various plants. In this study, the GISH with minor modifications including, slide preparation of putative secondary Tritipyrum (F 2) root meristemic cells, labeled genomic DNA of Thinopyrum bessarabicum by fluorescein 12 -dUTP nucleotide as probe, genomic DNA of Thinopyrum bessarabicum for {{in situ hybridization}} on root meristemic cells of F 2 (2 n= 6 x= 42, AABBDEb) and unlabeled Chinese Spring cultivar in pre hybridization, was carried {{out for the first time}} in Iran. The results not only indicated the various Eb chromosomes in putative 6 x secondary Tritipyrum plants, but also showed different numbers of A, B and D chromosomes. The range of aneuoploidy in F 2 genotypes was from % 30 to % 66. 7, which could be due to various numbers of Eb and D chromosomes in each genotype. The selfing or back crossing of F 2 plants with bread wheat varieties could lead to chromosomal stability and aneoploidy reduction in secondary Tritipyrum genotypes...|$|E
40|$|Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) {{deficiency}} is an X-linked co-dominant disorder. A couple, with {{a previous}} {{history of a}} neonatal death and a therapeutical termination due to OTC deficiency, was referred to our center for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). The female partner has a nonsense mutation in the exon 9 of the OTC gene (R 320 X). We carried out nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for R 320 X mutation and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) for aneuploidy screening. Among a total of 11 embryos, two blastomeres per embryo from 9 embryos were biopsied and analyzed by duplex-nested PCR and FISH, and one blastomere per embryo from 2 embryos by only duplex-nested PCR. As a result of PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, four embryos were diagnosed as unaffected embryos having the normal OTC gene. Among these embryos, only one embryo was confirmed as <b>euploidy</b> for chromosome X, Y and 18 by FISH analysis. A single normal embryo was transferred to the mother, yielding an unaffected pregnancy and birth of a healthy boy. Based on our results, PCR for mutation loci and FISH for aneuploidy screening with two blastomeres from an embryo coul...|$|E
40|$|Management {{of second}} branchial cleft {{abnormalities}} in adults. Objective: Branchial cleft anomalies are developmental disorders of the neck. Our {{aim is to}} report the diagnostic and treatment procedure followed in three cases of second branchial cleft abnormalities in adults. Methodology: A patient aged over 40 underwent surgical excision of a well-encapsulated cystic neck structure and two further patients of a branchial sinus and branchial fistula respectively. Prior to surgery the patients were assessed by means of imaging techniques, FNA cytology and cytometric DNA analysis. Results: Neutrophils, debris, mature squamous epithelial cells including degenerate forms and lymphoid cells were the key features in the cytological diagnosis. DNA analysis of the pre-operative cytological material in two cases revealed <b>euploidy,</b> thus indicating no malignancy. Histological examination of the lesions after excision established the diagnosis in all cases. No recurrences were reported. Conclusions: Although congenital lesions, the second branchial cleft abnormalities usually present in adulthood {{and have to be}} distinguished from benign and malignant lateral neck swellings. FNA cytology as well as DNA ploidy determination contributes to the establishment of the diagnosis of branchial cleft abnormalities and their differential diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Although mouse {{embryonic}} stem cell lines (mESCs) have been established since 1981, systematic studies about chromosomal changes during culture are lacking. In this study, we report {{the results of a}} cytogenetic analysis performed on three mESC lines (named UPV 02, UPV 06 and UPV 08) cultured for a period of 3  months. At time intervals, the variation of the chromosome number together with the expression of markers of the undifferentiated status, i. e., OCT- 4, SSEA- 1, FOM- 1 and alkaline phosphatase activity, were determined. The three mESC lines showed a progressive loss of euploid metaphases during the 3  months period of culture. Chromosome abnormalities were accumulated at the latest passages analysed. Metacentric chromosomes were the most frequent chromosome abnormality observed throughout the period of culture. Interestingly, in coincidence with, or few passages after, the drop of <b>euploidy,</b> the alkaline phosphatase activity was partially or totally lost, whereas the OCT- 4, SSEA- 1 and FOM- 1 stem markers were always positive throughout the period of culture. Our results remark the necessity to perform the karyotype analysis during culture in order to develop new culture conditions to maintain the correct chromosome complement in long-term culture of mESC lines...|$|E
