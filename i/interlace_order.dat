Typically they use multiple rectifiers/converters in parallel {{in order to}} secure high power ratings and high frequency operation. The rectifiers are supplied from a single-phase A. C. traction transformer with multiple secondaries of high leakage inductance. The switching instants of the PWM rectifiers are phase shifted and <b>interlaced</b> in <b>order</b> to achieve high ripple current cancellation, assuming that the converter loads are balanced.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the power quality {{analysis}} of interlaced four quadrant (4 Q) converters with constant switching frequency. These are in fact the input stages of the locomotives and high speed trains supplied by 25 kV, 50 Hz and 15 kV, 16. 7 Hz lines. Due to the high power needed for the trains circulation, the 4 Q converter can absorb distorted currents, whose harmonic content can affect the signaling systems and communication devices. The presence of more converters gives the opportunity, using dedicated commutation strategy, to <b>interlace</b> them in <b>order</b> to reduce the harmonic content in the absorbed current. In the paper a suitable model of more 4 Q converters is developed. The control logic implemented in the model allows {{the evaluation of the}} harmonic contribution of both single converter and the interlaced configuration. The analysis is carried out through electromagnetic transient simulations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{significance}} of distributive space for understanding capitalist forms of spatio-temporality. It argues that the distributive phase of commodity mobilities has remained a relatively under-represented aspect of social theory, especially {{in the context of}} cultural and social geography. The extant work that has focused on distribution tends to be confined to the areas of economic and transport geography. The thesis aims to address the importance of this space for understanding the formations of late capitalist modernity, particularly its role as a specific, but networked space between production and consumption. Significantly the work addresses the 'construction' of this space by focus sing on the substantive case study of containerisation. In doing so it engages with global commodity mobilities in the form of intermodal shipping containers, and their attendant logistical infrastructure. The research critically considers the spatial and temporal apparatuses that have been developed to organise and order the mobilities of the containers; including the design and development of the object itself, alongside a range of logistics and supply chain management strategies. In theoretical terms an important influence on the research has been Michel Serres' work on the <b>interlacing</b> of <b>order</b> and disorder. Given this, a simultaneous focus of the research deals with the immanent presence of disorder in these systemic environments; thus reflecting an intellectual engagement with theoretical work in the areas of turbulence, complexity theory, assemblage theory and Serres' work on the parasite. Substantively this aspect of the research has been determined by considering the place of the accident within networks and systems, alongside the 'tactical-logistics' of smuggling practices. 3 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Locomotive PWM Rectifiers {{employed}} in A. C traction systems represent several megawatts of electrical load. Typically they use multiple rectifiers/converters in parallel {{in order to}} secure high power ratings and high frequency operation. And the rectifiers are supplied from the single-phase A. C. traction transformer with multiple secondaries of high leakage inductance. The switching instants of the PWM rectifiers are phase shifted and <b>interlaced</b> in <b>order</b> to achieve high ripple current cancellation, assuming that the converter loads are balanced. This would ensure the rectifiers to provide better harmonic performance and also redundancy of operation with multiple units in operation. However, in practice, rectifiers may be closely coupled to the traction inverter to an axle or a group of axles and the real power developed will depend upon the traction conditions. Creep and slip can give rise to variations in power and perfect power balance at the rectifiers is an improbable proposition. There is high degree of interest in the recent times to examine the possibility of equipment failures in locomotive systems that degrade gracefully. Failure of one traction inverter would lead to load unbalance for the rectifier modules. Or sometimes, partial failures may result in unbalanced operation which can cause reduced ripple current cancellation and generate switching frequency harmonic current components. This may adversely impact the signalling systems and/or result in over voltage effects due to resonance in the overhead supply system. This paper examines a 4 MW locomotive with three rectifier modules and a device switching frequency of 900 Hz. This results in a 5400 Hz ripple frequency in the mains current. And this paper will consider what may be the most frequently occurring case; that of loss of load in one traction motor due to wheel slip. Current ripple cancellation is partially lost in this case and lower frequency current components can be produced. Traditionally, number of solutions have been {{employed in}} the industry like passive Filters, Active Filters etc., for this type of a problem. However, this paper explores an elegant, attractive and economical solution of using hybrid filters in order to achieve a level of acceptable satisfactory harmonic performance and thereby improving the power quality of the rail systems...|$|R

40|$|Higher order {{scrambled}} digital nets are randomized quasi-Monte Carlo rules {{which have}} recently been introduced in [J. Dick, Ann. Statist., 39 (2011), 1372 [...] 1398] and shown to achieve the optimal rate of convergence of the {{root mean square error}} for numerical integration of smooth functions defined on the s-dimensional unit cube. The key ingredient there is a digit interlacing function applied to the components of a randomly scrambled digital net whose number of components is ds, where the integer d is the so-called interlacing factor. In this paper, we replace the randomly scrambled digital nets by randomly scrambled polynomial lattice point sets, which allows us to obtain a better dependence on the dimension while still achieving the optimal rate of convergence. Our results apply to Owen's full scrambling scheme as well as the simplifications studied by Hickernell, Matoušek and Owen. We consider weighted function spaces with general weights, whose elements have square integrable partial mixed derivatives of order up to α> 1, and derive an upper bound on the variance of the estimator for higher order scrambled polynomial lattice rules. Employing our obtained bound as a quality criterion, we prove that the component-by-component construction can be used to obtain explicit constructions of good polynomial lattice point sets. By first constructing classical polynomial lattice point sets in base b and dimension ds, to which we then apply the <b>interlacing</b> scheme of <b>order</b> d, we obtain a construction cost of the algorithm of order O(dsmb^m) operations using O(b^m) memory in case of product weights, where b^m is the number of points in the polynomial lattice point set...|$|R
