5000|$|<b>Gerontophilia</b> is {{the sexual}} {{preference}} for the elderly. A person with such a sexual preference is a gerontophile. The word <b>gerontophilia</b> was coined in 1901 by Richard von Krafft-Ebing. It derives from Greek: geron, meaning [...] "old man or woman" [...] and philie, meaning [...] "love". <b>Gerontophilia</b> is classified as a paraphilia, but is {{not mentioned in the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases.|$|E

50|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>gerontophilia</b> is unknown. A study of pornographic search terms on a peer-to-peer network reported that 0.15% had gerontophilic themes. Sex offenders with elderly victims {{do not necessarily}} have <b>gerontophilia.</b> There are other possible motivations for these offenses, such as rage or sadism, that may not involve a sexual preference for the elderly. There are no studies showing that most such offenders are gerontophiles. In one small study, two of six sex offenders against the elderly evinced gerontophilic tendencies. <b>Gerontophilia</b> can also be expressed with consenting elderly partners in a legal context.|$|E

5000|$|On {{a related}} topic, intergenerational relationships, also quite taboo, were {{the focus of}} the film <b>Gerontophilia</b> (between a very old and a very young man), and in the last years many TV shows {{represented}} [...] "cougars" [...] (middle age women with younger men), for example The Cougar and Cougar Town.|$|E
50|$|She {{has worked}} with the Toronto Dance Theatre {{alongside}} choreographer Ame Henderson for the project Henderson/Castle: Voyager.

50|$|Beginning with <b>Gerontophilia</b> in 2013, LaBruce dropped some of {{the more}} sexually {{explicit}} aspects of his filmmaking style. He retained his traditional interest in exploring sexual taboos, dramatizing an intergenerational relationship between a young man and a senior citizen, but opted to do so within a film that would be more palatable to a mainstream audience.|$|E
5000|$|Vlaartark Mimlark (voiced by Kyle McCulloch) - The eccentric, {{possibly}} schizophrenic, uncle of Josh and Mandy. He enjoys eating cats. He also {{considers himself}} {{of a higher}} standard, judging by his voice and general knowledge. It's never stated if he's Balthazor or Tina's brother, though they both called him [...] "uncle" [...] as well. He also has <b>Gerontophilia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Research on <b>gerontophilia</b> {{is limited}} to a small number of case studies, {{beginning}} with a paper by French physician Charles Féré in 1905. Féré described a 27-year-old man who rejected an arranged marriage with a 20-year-old [...] "beauty" [...] in favor of a 62-year-old woman. Such studies commonly report that the subject had an early sexual experience with a much older woman.|$|E
50|$|Following Article 6.21’s passage, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in violence and harassment towards LGBT individuals in Russia. People have been subject to smear campaigns from homophobic civilians and administrative fines; some even had to resign from their jobs to lessen the load. Two vigilante groups in particular have been conducting extensive anti-LGBT campaigns, infringing the privacy of thousands of Russian youth: Occupy <b>Gerontophilia,</b> which targets gay teenagers, and Occupy Paedophilia, which focuses on gay adults (equating homosexuality with pedophelia all the while). These groups often operate by “ambushing” LGBT adults and youth by contacting them online and attempt to convince them to come to allegedly gay-friendly meetings; once the victims arrive, they are viciously harassed and humiliated on-camera. Occupy <b>Gerontophilia</b> posted dozens of videos to the social network VKontakte before it was shut down for infringing the privacy of minors—but not before the organizations page got 170,000 subscribers. Occupy <b>Gerontophilia</b> and Occupy Paedophilia {{are not the only ones}} hostile towards the LGBT community: in May 2013, a 23-year-old man was brutally beaten and killed in the city of Volgograd not long after the “propaganda” law’s passage, all because he had admitted his status as a gay man to his friends. Despite the severe situation, Russian law “does not outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation,” leaving millions of people without any kind of widespread protection. Though Maxim Martsinkevich, the founder of Occupy Pedophilia, was arrested and convicted on charges of “inciting and fomenting cases of extremism,” in his videos and postings on VKontakte, the prosecution did not actually include any of his homophobic videos or statements as evidence in its case against Martsinkevich.|$|E
50|$|Described {{as a gay}} Harold and Maude, {{the film}} follows Lake, {{a young man who}} takes a job in a nursing home and {{develops}} a romantic and sexual attraction to Mr. Peabody, a senior citizen resident in the facility. Unlike most of LaBruce's earlier films, <b>Gerontophilia</b> is not sexually explicit; instead, LaBruce chose to adapt his traditional themes of sexual taboo into a film more palatable to a mainstream audience.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Borcar {{wrote the}} {{original}} music for Nickelodeons TV feature Nicky Deuce - starring James Gandolfini, Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli, Vincent Curatola, Rita Moreno and Steve Schirripa (writer and director). He completed the full score for orchestra of Stefan Miljevics Amsterdam; the full score for Jean-Sebastien Lords LAnge Gardien, starring Guy Nadon, Marilyn Castonguay and Patrick Hivon, {{and the original}} music for Bruce La Bruces <b>Gerontophilia</b> starring Walter Borden, Pier-Gabriel Lajoie and Katie Boland.|$|E
5000|$|Activists of the {{movement}} and Tesak in particular have been criticized by the media for vigilantism, violence, and connections to another branch of Martsinkevich's Restruct movement called Occupy <b>Gerontophilia</b> (Оккупай-геронтофиляй), which targets young males allegedly interested in dates with older same-sex partners. Actions of members of both of the branches have also been described as campaigns against LGBT people, with one Occupy Pedophilia local group leader saying that [...] "practically all gay men are pedophiles".|$|E
5000|$|As producer, Farlinger's {{credits include}} <b>Gerontophilia,</b> {{directed}} by Bruce LaBruce; Trigger, directed by Bruce McDonald and {{named one of}} Toronto International Film Festival's top ten films of the year; Leslie, My Name Is Evil; Otto, or Up With Dead People; and Monkey Warfare, directed by Reginald Harkema, which won a Special Jury Prize at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in 2006. Farlinger's latest film as a producer is Born to Be Blue, directed by Robert Budreau and starring Ethan Hawke, Carmen Ejogo, and Callum Keith Rennie.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of a stigmatic-eligibilic paraphilia, what is {{considered}} repulsive, unsuitable, prohibited, abnormal or taboo by most people turns into something attractive, suitable, permitted, normal and licensed. Thus, in paedophilia, necrophilia and zoophilia, children, corpses and animals are desired despite being incapable of forming sexual (or, indeed, any) relationships. In the attraction to disability, disabled people are desired despite deviating from the physical standard. In <b>gerontophilia</b> and ephebophilia, significantly older or younger people are desired despite being generally considered unsuitable due to great difference in age. In hybristophilia, notorious criminals are desired despite being generally considered objectionable. In urolagnia, coprophilia and emetophilia, urinating, defecating and vomiting in intimate circumstances are seen as arousing despite the general views that they are repulsive. In this sense, stigmatic-eligibilic paraphilias can seem 'non-conformist' and 'taboo-busting.' ...|$|E
5000|$|La nave de los locos (The Ship of Fools) (1984) is {{generally}} regarded by critics as Peri Rossi's most important work. It is an experimental novel which {{takes the form}} of a pastiche of travel writing. The protagonist, Equis, is a misfit who travels to a number of deliberately vague locations. By inviting the reader to see modern society through the eyes of Equis, Peri Rossi is using the technique of defamiliarisation to produce a biting satire of today's world. This includes a strong dose of feminism: Equis eventually renounces his own sexuality, declaring that there is [...] "harmony in impotence," [...] which can be read as a denouncement of patriarchial and phallogocentric society. More generally, the work shows toleration and arguably even idealisation of sexualities that have been traditionally considered dissident, including <b>gerontophilia</b> and controversially, in the character Morris' love for a ten-year-old boy, pedophilia. The novel exposes the dangers of arbitrary dictatorial government in its inclusion an emotional depiction of a concentration camp in a country which remains unspecified, but which could be based on any of the various Latin American dictatorships of the latter half of the twentieth century. The title of the book is taken from the Ship of Fools legend, which is reworked by Peri Rossi in the novel itself. The novel shows sympathy for those condemned to the ship of fools and there is a clear parallel between this medieval episode and the modern-day aforementioned concentration camp passage.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} pattern of sexual offence cases {{attended}} at the One Stop Crisis Center (OSCC) of the Accident and Emergency Department, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM), Kelantan. A total of 439 reported sexual offence cases were examined {{over a period of}} 4 years from 2000 to 2003. Sexual offence constituted by male partner or boyfriend in 18. 9 %, by relatives in 27. 3 % and by “others” in 53. 8 % of cases. Only 0. 7 % of victims did not attempt to lodge a police report. There is a significant relationship between occupation and the risk of experiencing sexual violence. Students were mostly targeted by the perpetrator throughout the study period. Among the offences, rape cases were the highest in number, among those who attended at the OSCC, HUSM with a total of 72. 7 %; followed by 27. 3 % of incest; 26. 4 % of child sexual abuse; 4. 8 % of sodomy and lastly 1. 6 % of <b>gerontophilia</b> cases. Only 70 % of the specimens obtained from sexual offences victims were sent for laboratory analysis. The result remained negative in 82. 4 % specimens and thus the laboratory analysis result is merely functioning as a supportive evidence for sexual offence cases attended at OSCC. The studies showed that most of the sexual assault perpetrators were known to the victims. The place of crime was also known to the perpetrators. Health sectors of various levels should be working in conjunction to promote a societal changes to improve more of the women’s right and thus to reduce the violence crime...|$|E
