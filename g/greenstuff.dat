2500|$|Phaedrus and Socrates both {{note how}} anyone would {{consider}} Socrates a foreigner in the countryside, and Socrates attributes this fault to {{his love of}} learning which [...] "trees and open country won't teach," [...] while [...] "men in the town" [...] will. Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading {{him out of his}} native land: [...] "Yet you seem to have discovered a drug for getting me out (dokei moi tes emes exodou to pharmakon heurekenai). A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of <b>greenstuff</b> in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books (en bibliois) I don't doubt you can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please." ...|$|E
60|$|It is only by bearing vividly in {{mind this}} ceaseless and {{noiseless}} struggle between plants for their gaseous {{food and the}} sunshine which enables them to digest it that we can ever fully understand the varying forms and habits of the vegetable kingdom. To most people, no doubt, it sounds like pure metaphor to talk of an internecine struggle between rooted beings which cannot budge one inch from their places, nor fight with horns, hoofs, or teeth, nor devour one another bodily, nor tread one another down with ruthless footsteps. But that is only because we habitually forget that competition is just as really a struggle for life as open warfare. The men who try against one another for a clerkship in the City, or a post in a gang of builder's workmen, are just as surely taking away bread and butter out of their fellows' mouths for their own advantage, as if they fought for it openly with fists or six-shooters. The white man who encloses the hunting grounds of the Indian, and plants them with corn, is just as surely dooming that Indian to death as if he scalped or tomahawked him. And so too with the unconscious warfare of plants. The daisy or the plantain that spreads its rosette of leaves flat against the ground is just as truly monopolizing a definite space of land as the noble owner of a Highland deer forest. No blade of grass can spring beneath the shadow of those tightly pressed little mats of foliage; no fragment of carbon, no ray of sunshine can ever penetrate below that close fence of living <b>greenstuff.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} choices of putty for {{sculpting}} and converting miniature figures, such as Milliput and <b>Greenstuff</b> (Kneadite). Milliput is a two-part modelling epoxy putty, {{which is considered}} a good sculpting medium and is used by many professional miniature sculptors. [...] Green stuff is another two-part epoxy putty, with blue and yellow components that turn green when mixed together. Both Milliput and <b>Greenstuff</b> must be allowed several hours to dry (although this can be sped up using a hot lamp).|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} foods famous for Qin Lake--”Qin lake eight fresh ”（溱湖八鲜），they are Qin lake Duan crab(溱湖簖蟹)、Qin lake turtle (溱湖甲鱼）、Qin lake icefish （溱湖银鱼）、 Qin lake shrimp （溱湖青虾）、 Qin lake birds （溱湖水禽）、 Qin lake screw shell （溱湖螺贝）、 Qin lake or four （溱湖四喜）、Qin lake <b>greenstuffs</b> （溱湖水蔬）.All {{of them have}} {{distinguishing}} features.|$|R
50|$|A {{string of}} camels, {{in charge of}} wild-eyed desert men and hung with heavy, {{pendulous}} sacks stuffed with henna from the south, stalked disdainfully through the crowd with a soft pad-pad of cushioned feet, {{on their way to}} the fondouk. Crouched in the sand and dust, ragged and filthy hawkers of sweetmeats and vegetables cursed shrilly when bare-legged boys, clad only in a single garment open to the waist, drove too close to their little stock-in-trade tiny donkeys staggering almost hidden under loads of brushwood and <b>greenstuffs.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you go to}} t' wars, Gaffer Swain, we'll look to your homestead,' {{said the}} farmer who had spoken before. 'As to t' <b>greenstuffs</b> as this gentleman asks for he shall have not one wainload but three, if he will but gi' us half-an-hour to fill them up. If he does not tak them t' others will, so we had raither that {{they go to the}} good cause. Here, Miles, do you wak the labourers, and zee that they throw the potato store wi' the spinach and the dried meats into the waggons wi' all speed.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Milliput is {{recommended}} for sculpting the frame of larger miniatures, as it dries hard and can be chiselled away with a knife afterwards if necessary. [...] <b>Greenstuff</b> or 'Kneadatite', the putty sold in Games Workshop stores, is softer and much stickier than Milliput. When fully dry it retains a degree of rubbery flexibility. [...] Although initially much harder to work with, <b>Greenstuff</b> is a superior medium to Milliput for sculpting small miniatures such as 25mm figures, and is widely used by artists in that scale. In addition to sculpting, modelling putty {{can also be used}} to cover up any gaps left when using other tools to convert miniatures.|$|E
5000|$|As fodder, gorse is high {{in protein}} [...] and {{may be used as}} feed for livestock, {{particularly}} in winter when other <b>greenstuff</b> is not available. Traditionally it was used as fodder for cattle, being made palatable either by [...] "bruising" [...] (crushing) with hand-held mallets, or grinding to a moss-like consistency with hand- or water-driven mills, or being finely chopped and mixed with straw chaff. Gorse is also eaten as forage by some livestock, such as feral ponies, which may eat little else in winter. Ponies may also eat the thinner stems of burnt gorse.|$|E

5000|$|At {{temperatures}} below [...] Merriam's pocket mouse becomes torpid and in {{some parts}} of Texas it may become dormant or hibernate in winter. Animals caught by live trapping on a cold night can appear dead in the morning but soon recover when warmed. The diet consists primarily of seeds which it carries back to its burrow in its cheek pouches and consumes there, leaving a littering of husks on the floor. Excess food is cached in store rooms in the burrow. It may also eat some <b>greenstuff</b> and insects. It does not need to drink water because its requirements are met from its food and it passes small quantities of very concentrated urine. In captivity, a Merriam's pocket mouse has lived on a diet of seeds but without water for four years, but the lifespan of wild individuals is shorter and may be in the range of 22 to 33 months.|$|E
50|$|Male field voles {{maintain}} a territory but females {{just have a}} home range which may overlap {{with that of a}} neighbour. After leaving the nest, young female voles remain in or near their mother's home range but young males are forced to disperse by the aggressiveness of the adult males. Female field voles sometimes spontaneously move in the time gap between weaning one litter and producing the next, a phenomenon typical of this species. One of the causes of the large population swings that occur in the field vole is the scramble competition which comes into play when the most desirable food plants are less available in mid summer. At this time litter sizes may fall, growth rates slow down, there may be increased mortality of young in the nest, adults may lose weight and some may die. Similar competition can occur in winter when the availability of <b>greenstuff</b> fails and starvation ensues.|$|E
