[...] Torres {{opined that}} the game [...] "makes {{a strong case for}} the power of simple yet {{incredibly}} addictive gameplay." [...] Knowles stated it represented [...] "Sega at its pure best." [...] The staff of Famitsu [...] "liked the mini-games in addition to the regular modes." [...] Nintendo Power hailed the game as [...] "one of the ultimate party games" [...] and [...] "the best in serious gaming, too." [...] Turner declared it [...] "that rarity of rarities: a perfectly-realized launch title", with a [...] "bounty of extras" [...] that set [...] "a new standard for arcade to home conversions". According to Medina, [...] "probably the greatest thing about this game is that it's so unassuming, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are genuinely very surprised at its extremely high quality." ...|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{initially}} {{created the}} game Confusion in the 1970s, {{and had it}} in finished form by 1980. The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it. The rules {{were published in the}} Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008, but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine. The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they do {{at the beginning of the}} game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not know how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying [...] "In your game Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't you make a board game where you don't know how pieces move?" [...] This is what gave Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe <b>in</b> <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, {{he played}} Mark Thatcher in Coup!, a dramatisation of the {{attempted}} coup in Equatorial Guinea. He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios. He accepted the {{part because it}} was [...] "funny, plausible, plausibly absurd and cruel" [...] and he liked {{that it was a}} translation from an original French play. He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: [...] "Nick is a really good actor and really good to work with <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can have completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego-free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier. If there's only two of you in a play, you are equally responsible – there's nobody else to blame if it goes wrong. So its a greater risk and there's no hiding". At the end of the year, he appeared opposite Richard Wilson in Whipping it Up, a play about whips in a fictional David Cameron government. To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{educators}} have estimated that Esperanto {{can be learned}} in anywhere from one quarter to one twentieth {{the amount of time}} required for other languages. Claude Piron, an Esperanto-Activist and Chinese–English–Russian–Spanish translator for the United Nations, argued that Esperanto is far more intuitive than many ethnic languages: [...] "Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes [...] differs from all other languages <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can always trust your natural tendency to generalize patterns.... The same neuropsychological law [...] Jean Piaget generalizing assimilation—applies to word formation as well as to grammar." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{think we}} were fairly smart with [...] "Spoonman" [...] <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> really don't see us that much in the video.

I remember back when I was a kid, long before MTV, {{and the only way to}} see my favorite bands was to go to their concerts. It was an incredible experience. MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique. It's tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second, then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next. That's what rock and roll has become for some people.|$|E
