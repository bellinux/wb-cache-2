25|$|In July 2011, the Constitutional Court {{ruled in}} a {{historic}} decision, that same-sex couples {{have the right to}} marry in Colombia. The Colombian Congress had to create an equivalent of marriage for same-sex couples by 20 June 2013, or else couples would automatically gain the right to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> judge or notary public to formalise their union, according to the ruling. As the Colombia Congress failed to pass a same-sex marriage bill, the courts instead began approving marriages themselves. The same-sex marriage issue once again came before the Constitutional Court in 2015 after the country's Inspector General requested that the Court invalidate all the same-sex marriages approved in Colombia. A hearing took place in July 2015.|$|E
25|$|Some {{programs}} {{require a}} preliminary application form with fees, and then schedule interviews and a longer application form. Other programs request a full application {{from the beginning}} and then schedule interviews. High school scholarship programs often require a set GPA of around 3.0 or higher.

Students in some programs, such as Rotary, are expected to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> location where the organization places them, and students are encouraged not to have strict expectations of their host country.

25|$|There was one {{additional}} Origin contest played in 1987. The Queenslanders had climbed {{the mountain and}} at no point did they take the project seriously in any competitive sense. The State of Origin trophy was safely stowed in the Queensland Rugby League board room at Lang Park, and for the Maroons the visit to the United States was their end-of-season outing, the game an exhibition... Such was the Blues' disappointment {{at the loss of}} the State of Origin series that they would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> length to restore some vestige of their lost pride. The New South Wales Rugby League hierarchy told their men to prepare for the contest as though it was a deciding test match. The match was played at the Veterans Memorial Stadium in Long Beach, California in front of 12,349 fans. The Blues won the game 30–18.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 1947, a {{group of}} Irgun men {{retrieved}} weapons, chloroform, cloths and ropes from a hidden cache. After the recent failures, the Irgun militants in Netanya were skeptical regarding the chances of this kidnapping attempt. Because of this they did not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> great lengths to cover their tracks, considering the complicated operation they were planning: they did not steal or borrow a vehicle or bring in non-local members who {{were less likely to}} be recognized. Furthermore, Yosef Meller, a longtime Netanya resident and newly recruited Irgun member, volunteered to use his black taxi cab, which was well known around town, for the kidnapping. The abduction operation was led by Benjamin Kaplan, who had been freed in the Acre Prison break. At nightfall one basic precaution was taken; the taxi's license plates were changed in an attempt to prevent it being recognized in the course of the abduction.|$|E

The conditions of the will were met in 2010 after the 1989 death of his last grandchild. In May 2011, twelve of Burt's descendants finally received the estate, worth about $100 million.|$|E

500|$|Wooden Leg {{attended}} a [...] "peace feast" [...] at the Little Bighorn {{to commemorate the}} 30th anniversary of the battle. [...] Some Cheyenne veterans would not go, fearful of retribution from the soldiers present. [...] As late as 1926 there were still Cheyennes who would {{not go to the}} 50th anniversary. [...] Wooden Leg himself did not attend the 50th anniversary, not out of fear, but because the site was now on Crow land, to whom he still felt much animosity. [...] He had resolved [...] "never again to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> place where I might be called upon to shake hands with a Crow". [...] This was very different to his attitude to other former enemies such as the Shoshones, to whom he travelled on a friendly visit. [...] In 1913 Wooden Leg was part of a Cheyenne delegation to Washington. [...] He also visited New York and Philadelphia during this trip.|$|E
500|$|Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu {{commented that}} [...] "though {{the first half}} of the movie is well-paced, the second half sags with the songs and twists forced into the plot to buy time", but stated that it was [...] "passable with its slick production, a few funny lines, glam {{quotient}} and star appeal." [...] Subhash K. Jha criticised the film's [...] "dishy digressions" [...] and [...] "peripheral sub-plots", rating it 2 out of 5 overall, but was impressed with the court scene, which he considered [...] "splendid". He also found Chopra's performance to be a triumph, remarking: [...] "A star is born! As the predatory social-climbing seductress who can <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> length to satiate her lust for life, Priyanka Chopra rocks the scene like never before." [...] Jha believed that Kareena was miscast and seemed a little awkward in a non-glamorous role, but [...] "comes into her own in the climactic courtroom sequence", a sentiment echoed by Jitesh Pillai in his review for The Times of India. Pillai gave a rating of 3 out of 5 and noted that [...] "it isn't drama that directors were striving for, yet the film works." ...|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{found the}} task of researching such a popular {{historical}} figure as Guevara a daunting one: [...] "If you <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> bookstore, you'll find an entire wall of Che-related material. We tried {{to go through all}} of it, we were overwhelmed with information. He means something different to everyone. At a certain point we had to decide for ourselves who Che was". The original source material for these scripts was Guevara's diary from the Cuban Revolution, Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War, and from his time in Bolivia, Bolivian Diary. From there, he drew on interviews with people who knew Guevara from both of those time periods and read every book available that pertained to both Cuba and Bolivia. Bickford and Del Toro met with Harry [...] "Pombo" [...] Villegas, Urbano and Benigno—three men who met Guevara during the Cuban Revolution, followed him to Bolivia, and survived. They interviewed them individually and then Pombo and Benigno together about their experiences in Cuba and Bolivia. Urbano was an adviser while they were filming in Spain and the actors often consulted with him and the others about specific details, like how to hold their guns in a certain situation, and very specific tactical information.|$|E

2500|$|However, at the Bermuda Refugee Conference in 1943, {{both the}} United States and Britain refused to relax their {{immigration}} policies, {{not even for}} British Mandatory Palestine.
