25|$|In {{the process}} of {{investigating}} Cistern 10, Warren discovered tunnels that lay under the Triple Gate passageway. These passages lead in erratic directions, some leading beyond the southern edge of the Temple Mount (they are at a depth below the base of the walls); their purpose is currently unknown – as <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> predate the Temple Mount – a situation not helped by the fact that apart from Warren's expedition no one else is known to have visited them.|$|E

The next four questions <b>were</b> entry-related; <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> routinely sound and dilate the uterus prior to entry of the hysteroscope, the type of hysteroscope used and technique used when inserting the hysteroscope. Question 6 related to specimen retrieval.

25|$|Singer {{argues that}} {{equality}} of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if {{the equality of}} the sexes were based only {{on the idea that}} men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> can suffer.|$|E
25|$|The aborigines’ diet {{very much}} depends on nature. With profuse {{vegetation}} and wild animals, the aborigines were natural hunter-gatherers. Essentially, much of what Aborigines ate depended on their environment – that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> lived in coastal or mountainous areas. Tribes like Amis, Atayal, Saisiyat and Bunun hunt what they can, and gather what they cultivate. On the other hand, tribes like the Yamis and the Thao have fish as a predominant source of food. Majority of foods consisted of millet, taro, sweet potato, wild greens and game like boar and rat. This {{is in contrast to}} the main foods eaten by the Han, which consisted of rice and chicken.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} question regarding public goods <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> should {{be owned by}} the public or the private sector. Economic theorists such as Hart (1995) argue that ownership matters for investment incentives when contracts are incomplete. The incomplete contracting paradigm {{has been applied to}} public goods by Besley and Ghatak (2001). They consider the government and a non-governmental organization (NGO) who can both make investments to provide a public good. Who should be the owner of the public good, the government or the NGO? Besley and Ghatak show that the party who has a larger valuation for the public good should be the owner, regardless of whether the government or the NGO has a better investment technology. This result contrasts with the case of private goods studied by Hart (1995), where the party with the better investment technology should be the owner. However, more recently {{it has been shown that}} the investment technology matters also in the public-good case when a party is indispensable or when there are bargaining frictions between the government and the NGO.|$|E

50|$|For example, if a {{variable}} is religiosity, and {{a unit of}} analysis is an individual, then that one of potentially more numerous indicators of that individual's religiosity would <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> attend religious services; others - how often, or <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> donate money to religious organizations.|$|R
500|$|The {{status of}} panlectal and polylectal grammars has {{been subject to}} debate amongst {{generative}} phonologists since the 1970s; {{one of the foremost}} areas of contention in regards to diaphonemes and diasystems <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> reflect the actual linguistic competence of speakers. William Labov, although warm to the construction of a panlectal grammar, argued that it should be based in speakers' linguistic competence. [...] Peter Trudgill argues against the formation of diasystems that are not cognitively real and implies that polylectal grammars that are not part of native speakers' competence are illegitimate. [...] Similarly, [...] cautions that polylectal grammars are only appropriate when they [...] "result in claims about speaker-hearer's capabilities..." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lion" [...] was the {{nickname}} of several medieval warrior rulers {{with a reputation}} for bravery, such as the English King Richard the Lionheart, Henry the Lion, (...) , Duke of Saxony, William the Lion, King of Scotland, and Robert III of Flanders nicknamed [...] "The Lion of Flanders"—a major Flemish national icon up to the present. Lions are frequently depicted on coats of arms, either as a device on shields themselves, or as supporters, but the lioness is much more infrequent. The formal language of heraldry, called blazon, employs French terms to describe the images precisely. Such descriptions specified whether lions or other creatures were [...] "rampant" [...] or [...] "passant", that <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> were rearing or crouching. The lion is used as a symbol of sporting teams, from national association football teams such as England, Scotland and Singapore to famous clubs such as the Detroit Lions of the NFL, Chelsea and Aston Villa of the English Premier League, (and the Premiership itself), Eintracht Braunschweig of the Bundesliga, and to a host of smaller clubs around the world.|$|E
500|$|The episode's flashforwards {{commence}} with Ben {{waking up}} alarmed in the Sahara with a wounded {{right arm and}} vapor rising from him. [...] The Dharma Initiative parka that he wears was codenamed [...] "Dharka" [...] by the writers. [...] A couple of Easter eggs are present in this scene: Ben's parka has a name tag that indicates that it was formerly owned by Edgar Halliwax (François Chau) and it displays the first appearance of the logo for a Dharma station called the [...] "Orchid" [...] {{that would not be}} seen until the episode titled [...] "There's No Place Like Home". [...] Another Easter egg is glimpsed in the next scene, when Ben reveals his forged Canadian passport previously seen in [...] "The Economist" [...] for his alias Dean Moriarty, which is also the name of the central character in Jack Kerouac's 1951 novel On the Road. [...] Among the most frequent questions that the writers are asked <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> have planned out future storylines, so the writers try to allude to future plot points, such as with the Dharka scene, that they can later call on as proof that they do know where the story is headed. [...] Director Jack Bender described the scene, which was filmed in a Hawaiian rock quarry, as especially hard to shoot because the actors had to ride horses and use guns, the crew had to relocate due to rocks present that were unsuitable for the scene, and Bender walked head-first into a crane. [...] Emerson stated that the set is [...] "definitely a no-glamour zone... I thought we would ease into things. [...] Instead, I get this all-Ben extravaganza: combat, riding horses, foreign languages. And piano playing! [...] All waaaay outside my comfort zone.

500|$|Cultivated plant {{taxonomy}} has been {{distinguished from the}} taxonomy of other plants in at least five ways. Firstly, there is a distinction made according to where the plants are growing — that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are wild or cultivated. This is alluded to by the Cultivated Plant Code which specifies in its title that it is dealing with cultivated plants. Secondly, a distinction is made according to how the plants originated. This is indicated in Principle 2 of the Cultivated Plant Code which defines {{the scope of the}} Code as [...] "... plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to the intentional actions of mankind" [...] — plants that have evolved under natural selection with human assistance.Thirdly, cultivated {{plant taxonomy}} is concerned with plant variation that requires the use of special classification categories that do not conform with the hierarchy of ranks implicit in the Botanical Code, these categories being the cultivar, Group and grex (which are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code). This feature is also referred to in the Preamble to the Cultivated Plant Code which states that [...] "The purpose of giving a name to a taxon is not to indicate its characters or history, but to supply a means of referring to it and to indicate to which category it is assigned." [...] Fourthly, cultivated plant taxonomy serves a particular community of people: the Botanical Code focuses on the needs of plant taxonomists as they attempt to maintain order and stability for the scientific names of all plants, while the Cultivated Plant Code caters for the needs of people requiring names for plants used in the commercial world of agriculture, forestry and horticulture. Finally, the difference between cultivated plant taxonomy and the taxonomy of other plants has been attributed to the purpose for which the taxonomy has been devised, it being plant-centred in the Botanical Code and human-centred in the Cultivated Plant Code.|$|E

2500|$|So {{the natural}} {{question}} to ask about linear operators that are not everywhere-defined <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are closable.

As {{in the case of}} discontinuous operators considered above, the proof requires the axiom of choice and so is in general nonconstructive, though again, if X is not complete, there are constructible examples.|$|E
2500|$|The Thetford assemblage, {{in spite}} of the sadly {{inadequate}} details of its discovery and provenance, {{remains one of the most}} intriguing and unusual of the many late-Roman precious-metal hoards from Britain. [...] Although the combination of silver tableware and gold personal ornament (with or without coins) is common enough in precious-metal hoards of this period from Britain, the fact that the inscriptions, supported by the visual imagery, allude to pagan, rather than Christian, belief towards the end of the 4th century, is important. [...] Attempts have been made to interpret the hoard as Christian, but remain somewhat unconvincing when applied to objects current at a period when paganism, rather than Christianity, was out of favour. In the present state of knowledge, we can still only speculate about the status of the objects, that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> belonged to an individual or family, or to some organisation, such as a religious one.|$|E
