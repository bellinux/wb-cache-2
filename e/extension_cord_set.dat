50|$|Within the United States, Underwriters Laboratories {{certifies}} <b>extension</b> <b>cords</b> as {{complying with}} the NEC. Key standards are UL 817 for the entire <b>extension</b> <b>cord,</b> and UL 62 for the electrical cabling itself. The United States General Services Administration also maintains a standard for <b>extension</b> <b>cords,</b> J-C-1270, that references the UL standards and provides additional criteria.|$|R

50|$|<b>Extension</b> <b>cords</b> {{sold in the}} United States {{may contain}} lead in the PVC {{insulation}} sheathing.

40|$|The common {{electrical}} equipment as laptops, printers, refrigerators, table lights, televisions, etc., are supplied by electrical power cables, flexible <b>cords</b> and <b>extension</b> <b>cords,</b> generally of low cross section, constituted by stranded bare conductors. Flexible <b>cords</b> and <b>extension</b> <b>cords</b> {{are exposed to}} mechanical damages and other insulation stresses and so can be involved in overheating, arcing and burning. Mechanical damages of the stranded bare conductors can degrade locally the effective sizing of the cross section and cause anomalous local conditions and/or electric shock hazard. The circuit protective devices can be unfit to detect the faults of cords that remain so energized and available to electric shock and fire hazards. A series of simulating tests have confirmed how some fire ignitions of nearby flammable materials result caused from these types of faults. It appears necessary wiring the <b>cords</b> and <b>extension</b> <b>cords</b> with a grounding protection conductor also supplying Class II equipment. In fact involving the ground in every faults allows in AC systems a fast protection by residual current protective devices (RCDs or GFPDs). At this aim the use of special cables, Ground-Fault-Forced Cables (GFFCs), is recommended, particularly for <b>cords</b> and <b>extension</b> <b>cords...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{insulation}} of <b>extension</b> <b>cords,</b> particularly light-duty two-wire cords, {{is easily}} damaged by being pinched, crushed, or abraded. The cords {{can also be}} damaged at the plug and socket connections by being pulled on excessively, which sometimes happens when people trip on them. Overloading can cause an <b>extension</b> <b>cord</b> to heat {{up to the point}} that its insulation either melts or carbonizes. Heating appliances may also cause heat damage to the insulation of a cord, melting or burning it away.|$|R

2500|$|In stage {{lighting}} {{for film}} and theater, this connector is sometimes informally known as PBG (Parallel Blade with Ground), U-ground, Edison or Hubbell, {{the name of}} a common manufacturer. (The name [...] "Hubbell" [...] can be confusing as several different connectors share this name depending on the company, industry, and use.) In the motion picture and TV production industries, an <b>extension</b> <b>cord</b> that uses this type of connector (usually with 12 AWG or 10 AWG wire) is called a [...] "stinger". Generally, lighting technicians use these <b>extension</b> <b>cords</b> to deliver power to lights rated at 2000W or less.|$|R
40|$|Conventional power sockets are {{equipped}} with an <b>extension</b> <b>cord.</b> Even with anti-overload devices, incidents of accidental discharge or damage to electrical appliances may still incur due to external factors.

The proposed design also integrated emergency lighting and flashlight functions, so as to expand the practicality and safety of the power socket...|$|R
