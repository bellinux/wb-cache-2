Many springs located in the upper and middle reaches of the watershed engage in karst activity in the limestone prevalent below the surface, forming such caves as Cascade Caverns and Natural Bridge Caverns.

40|$|Background: Third molars are {{teeth that}} have little {{functional}} value and {{a relatively high}} rate of associated pain and disease. Their value, {{as part of the}} dentition <b>of</b> modern <b>people,</b> is dubious. Types of Studies Reviewed: The authors review the evolution, development. moribidity and treatment of third molars. They access the value of third molars in the 21 st century and describe the risks these teeth pose when they develop in the dentition. Conclusions: There is a mandate for the dental profession to improve health outcomes and quality of life. The prevention of third molar-related morbidity should be included in dental research efforts. The authors suggest that novel preventive methodologies be developed to alleviate the problems third molars pose. One potential methodology suggested is intentional therapeutic agenesis of this tooth. Clinical Implications: Prevention of third molar development early in life, even before tooth bud initiation, could dramatically improve healthcare outcomes <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>peoples...</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{before that}} time must {{intervene}} a period which bids one pause for breath. A new romance, like unto none in all the past, the economic romance, will be born. For the dazzling prize of world-empire will {{the nations of the}} earth go up in harness. Powers will rise and fall, and mighty coalitions shape and dissolve in the swift whirl of events. Vassal nations and subject territories will be bandied back and forth like so many articles of trade. And with the inevitable displacement of economic centres, it is fair to presume that populations will shift to and fro, as they once did from the South to the North of England on the rise of the factory towns, or from the Old World to the New. Colossal enterprises will be projected and carried through, and combinations of capital and federations of labor be effected on a cyclopean scale. Concentration and organization will be perfected in ways hitherto undreamed. The nation which would keep its head above the tide must accurately adjust supply to demand, and eliminate waste to the last least particle. Standards of living will most likely descend <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> With the increase of capital, the competition for safe investments, and the consequent fall of the interest rate, the principal which today earns a comfortable income would not then support a bare existence. Saving toward old age would cease among the working classes. And as the merchant cities of Italy crashed when trade slipped from their hands on the discovery of the new route to the Indies by way of the Cape of Good Hope, so will there come times of trembling for such nations as have failed to grasp the prize of world-empire. In that given direction they will have attained their maximum development, before the whole world, in the same direction, has attained its. There will no longer be room for them. But if they can survive the shock of being flung out of the world's industrial orbit, a change in direction may then be easily effected. That the decadent and barbarous peoples will be crushed is a fair presumption; likewise that the stronger breeds will survive, entering upon the transition stage to which all the world must ultimately come.|$|E
