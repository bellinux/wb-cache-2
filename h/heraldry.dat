5|$|Canadian <b>heraldry</b> is the {{cultural}} tradition {{and style of}} coats of arms and other heraldic achievements in both modern and historic Canada. It includes national, provincial, and civic arms, noble and personal arms, ecclesiastical <b>heraldry,</b> heraldic displays as corporate logos, and Canadian heraldic descriptions.|$|E
5|$|Ecclesiastical <b>heraldry</b> {{refers to}} the use of <b>heraldry</b> within the Christian Church for dioceses and Christian clergy. Initially used to mark documents, ecclesiastical <b>heraldry</b> evolved as a system for {{identifying}} people and dioceses. It is most formalized within the Catholic Church, where most bishops, including the Pope, have a personal coat of arms. Clergy in Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches follow similar customs, as do institutions such as schools and dioceses.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in <b>heraldry.</b> He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms, or, <b>Heraldry</b> founded upon facts. As indicated by the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the early history of <b>heraldry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Swedish <b>heraldry</b> {{encompasses}} heraldic {{achievements in}} modern and historic Sweden. Swedish heraldic style {{is consistent with}} the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, noted for its multiple helmets and crests which are treated as inseparable from the shield, its repetition of colours and charges between the shield and the crest, and its scant use of heraldic furs. Because the medieval history of the Nordic countries was so closely related, their heraldic individuality developed rather late. Swedish and Finnish <b>heraldry</b> have a shared history prior to the Diet of Porvoo in 1809; these, together with Danish <b>heraldry,</b> were heavily influenced by German <b>heraldry.</b> Unlike the highly stylized and macaronic language of English blazon, Swedish <b>heraldry</b> is described in plain language, using (in most cases) only Swedish terminology.|$|E
5|$|Swedish <b>heraldry</b> has {{a number}} of {{characteristics}} that distinguish the Swedish style from <b>heraldry</b> in other European countries. Common features of Swedish <b>heraldry</b> {{are similar to those of}} other Nordic countries and Germany, placing it in the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, distinguished from Gallo-British <b>heraldry</b> and other heraldic traditions by several key elements of heraldic style. One of these is the use of multiple helmets and crests, which cannot be displayed separately from the main shield. These helmets and crests are considered to be as important as the shield, each denoting a fief over which the bearer holds a right. In Scandinavia (as distinct from the German custom), when an even number of helmets is displayed, they are usually turned, with their crests, to face outward; when an odd number, the center helmet is turned affronté and the rest turned outward (whereas in Germany the helmets are turned inward to face the center of the escutcheon). Additionally, the crests are often repetitive of charges used on the main shield, and marks of cadency typically occur in the crest, rather than on the shield as in Gallo-British <b>heraldry.</b> Also, the use of heraldic furs on the shield, while common in Gallo-British <b>heraldry,</b> is rare in German-Nordic <b>heraldry.</b> Furs in Scandinavia are generally limited to ermine and vair, which sometimes appear in mantling, supporters, or the trimmings of crowns, but rarely on the shield.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being considered an expert on <b>heraldry,</b> Mitchell was {{regarded as one of}} the best engravers and medal designers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In <b>heraldry,</b> birds, {{especially}} eagles, {{often appear}} in coats of arms.|$|E
5|$|In <b>heraldry,</b> the {{snowflake}} is {{a stylized}} charge, {{often used to}} represent winter or winter sports.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1953, {{the office}} of the National Herald (Riksheraldiker) was {{responsible}} for preparing municipal arms and the royal arms of Sweden, but today these duties are carried out by the <b>Heraldry</b> Board of the National Archives, including the State Herald (Statsheraldiker). In order to register new municipal arms, a municipality must submit its proposal to both the National Archives <b>Heraldry</b> Board, which consults and renders an opinion, and to the PRV for registration. Once the board has completed its consultation process and provided a warrant of arms, the arms thus warranted may then be registered by the PRV and implemented by the municipality. Apart from municipal arms, heraldic arms registered by counties and by military and other government bodies are also handled by the National Archives <b>Heraldry</b> Board and the PRV.|$|E

5|$|According to the English {{officers}} of arms John Martin Robinson and Thomas Woodcock, crests {{have played a}} relatively insignificant role in Scottish <b>heraldry</b> when compared to English <b>heraldry.</b> In consequence many Scottish armigers, including clan chiefs, have comparatively similar crests to one another. Because of this, crest badges can sometimes show an obvious association with another clan. For example, clans associated with the Chattan Confederation share very similar crest badges bearing wild cats. Clans associated with Clan MacTavish Clan Campbell of Breadalbane, Clan MacIver and Clan Campbell use a crest badges which contain similar crests and mottoes that allude {{to that of the}} chief of Clan MacTavish.|$|E
5|$|From 1763 until 1988, <b>heraldry</b> in Canada {{was under}} the {{authority}} of the College of Arms in London and the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. In the late 1980s, the Queen issued Letters Patent creating the Canadian Heraldic Authority.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} Scottish <b>Heraldry,</b> an armiger {{is someone who}} has {{registered}} {{his or her own}} coat of arms, or has inherited a coat of arms according to the Laws of Arms in Scotland from an ancestor who had arms recorded in the Lyon Register.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{received}} all <b>heraldry,</b> lineage {{and honors}} from the 45th Infantry Division, including its shoulder sleeve insignia and campaign streamers for combat in World War II and Korea. It has since received {{several of its}} own decorations {{for participation in the}} subsequent conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{achievements of}} arms in Sweden {{are those of}} two brothers, Sigtrygg and Lars Bengtsson, from 1219. The earliest example of Swedish civic <b>heraldry</b> is the city arms of Kalmar, which originated as a city seal in 1247. The seal (Swedish sigill), used extensively in the Middle Ages, was instrumental in spreading <b>heraldry</b> to churches, local governments, and other institutions, and was the forerunner of the coat of arms in medieval Sweden. Armorial seals of noblewomen appeared in the 12th century, burghers and artisans began adopting arms in the 13th century, and even some peasants took arms in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Vexillology rarely {{distinguishes between}} gold and yellow; in <b>heraldry,</b> {{they are both}} Or. For the German flag, such a {{distinction}} is made: the color used in the flag is gold, not yellow.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{system for}} the Church of England was {{approved}} in 1976. The traditions of Eastern Christian <b>heraldry</b> have less developed regulation. Eastern secular coats of arms often display a shield before a mantle topped with a crown. Eastern clergy often display coats of arms according to this style, replacing the crown with an appropriate hat drawn from liturgical use.|$|E
5|$|Brooke-Little {{maintained}} {{an interest in}} Irish <b>heraldry</b> even after he was promoted from Norroy and Ulster to Clarenceux. After the Director of the National Library of Ireland was made the Chief Herald of Ireland, Brooke-Little wrote to the Daily Telegraph {{of the importance of}} maintaining a strong tradition of heraldic and genealogical expertise in the Irish Office of Arms.|$|E
5|$|Derived {{mainly from}} heraldic traditions in France and the United Kingdom, Canadian <b>heraldry</b> also {{incorporates}} distinctly Canadian symbols, especially native flora and fauna, {{references to the}} First Nations and other aboriginal peoples of Canada, and uniquely Canadian elements such as the Canadian pale, derived from the Canadian flag. A unique system of cadency is used for daughters inheriting arms, and a special symbol for United Empire Loyalists.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heraldry</b> {{developed}} in medieval Europe {{from the late}} 11th century, originally as a system of personal badges of the warrior classes, which served, among other purposes, as identification on the battlefield. The same insignia were used on seals to identify documents. The earliest seals bore a likeness of {{the owner of the}} seal, with the shield and heraldic insignia included. Over time, the seals were reduced to just the shield.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heraldry</b> {{in general}} {{underwent}} {{something of a}} renaissance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{and many of the}} illogicalities of previous centuries were discarded. Crests are now generally not granted unless they could actually be used on a physical helm, and the rules about directions of helms are no longer rigidly observed.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In Swedish, however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively plain language, using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples {{include the use of}} Swedish blå and grön for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the Swedish words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in the lining of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in Swedish <b>heraldry.</b> Vair is also rare in Scandinavian <b>heraldry,</b> and other furs are unknown.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his duties as a professional herald, Brooke-Little held three administrative positions at the College of Arms. From 1974 until 1982, he served as Registrar, with responsibility to enter all new grants and confirmations of arms into the College records. Brooke-Little's signature {{can be found on}} the reverse of the letters patent for every grant made during this period. In addition, he served as the College's librarian from 1974 until 1994 and the treasurer of the College of Arms from 1978 until 1995. He was also the director of the Heralds' Museum at the Tower of London from 1991 to 1997; this museum is no longer operating. Although Brooke-Little enjoyed prominence as a professional officer of arms and as an author on heraldic subjects, his role in founding the <b>Heraldry</b> Society, and in guiding the society and editing its journal for many years, was perhaps his greatest contribution to the science of <b>heraldry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mullsjö Municipality was {{newly created}} in 1952. The coat of arms, granted in 1977, was {{proposed}} by the municipality's recreation committee, to market the municipality as a center for winter sports. The snow crystal is a relatively modern charge, and the modern tree-top line, called kuusikoro in Finnish, is reflective of the Finnish influence on Swedish <b>heraldry.</b> Blazon: Azure, a snow crystal argent beneath a spruce-top chief of the same.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans have {{featured}} {{extensively in}} <b>heraldry,</b> generally using the Christian {{symbolism of the}} pelican as a caring and self-sacrificing parent. Heraldic images featuring a pelican vulning refers to a pelican injuring herself, while a pelican in her piety refers to a female pelicans feeding her young with her own blood.|$|E
5|$|Perceptions of {{bird species}} vary across cultures. Owls are {{associated}} with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe and harbingers of war in Scandinavia. In <b>heraldry,</b> birds, especially eagles, often appear in coats of arms.|$|E
5|$|The National Archives <b>Heraldry</b> Board, {{established}} under Swedish statute 2007:1179, is {{the highest}} heraldic body in Sweden. The board is chaired by the National Archivist and includes three other officials, three deputies, the State Herald (who acts as secretary), the National Archives jurist and the National Archives heraldic artist. This board convenes as needed, which {{in recent years has}} been once or twice a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of the galero in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist's style. The top of the hat may be shown flat or round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it can look like a cappello romano with tassels, but in <b>heraldry</b> it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as knotted cords.|$|E
5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The <b>heraldry</b> continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German <b>heraldry,</b> but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E
5|$|The shield is {{the core}} of <b>heraldry,</b> but other {{elements}} are placed above, below, and around the shield, and are usually collectively called external ornaments. The entire composition is called the achievement of arms or the armorial bearings. Some of these accessories are unique to Church armory or differ notably from those which normally accompany a shield.|$|E
5|$|After the {{university}} moved to Hamilton in 1930, {{the university}} petitioned Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh for {{a coat of}} arms. The request was granted on behalf of The Crown on 20 October 1930. In 1997 the Board of Governors introduced a simplified shield design, which recognized the tradition of McMaster’s <b>heraldry</b> while {{improving the quality of}} print and electronic reproduction. The university's arms and badge was registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 15 October 2006.|$|E
