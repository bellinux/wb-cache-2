The Metropolitan <b>Asylums</b> <b>Board</b> was to insure Atlas and Endymion for £11,000 and £8,000 respectively. There was opposition to the proposed use of Atlas from the Thames Conservancy and other public and private bodies.

25|$|The {{location}} of the ships drew an objection from the shipbuilders Messrs Rennie because some of their employees refused to work near the riverside where Atlas was moored. It was also necessary to move Atlas and Endymion every time Rennie's launched a ship. In 1882, the Thames Conservancy wrote to the Metropolitan <b>Asylums</b> <b>Board</b> urging them to move Atlas and Endymion from Greenwich. The Thames Conservancy also called upon the board to pay a large claim for expenses incurred by Messrs Rennie's. At {{a meeting of the}} board, it was suggested that if moved, Atlas should be used for convalescent patients. The board decided to await the report from a Royal Commission into infectious diseases hospitals before deciding whether or not to move the ships. The last smallpox patients left Atlas in August 1882. The Metropolitan <b>Asylums</b> <b>Board</b> decided that the ships provided a useful facility and that they would be kept.|$|R

50|$|In the United Kingdom, the Metropolitan Poor Act 1867 {{established}} the first municipal hospitals in London under the Metropolitan <b>Asylums</b> <b>Board.</b> The Local Government Act 1929 empowered local authorities to appropriate infirmaries and fever hospitals from Poor law unions and abolished the Metropolitan <b>Asylums</b> <b>Board,</b> whose hospitals {{were transferred to}} {{the control of the}} London County Council as {{in the rest of the}} country. The intention was that hospitals could change “from an institution to which people went because they were poor to a hospital to which people went because they were sick,” but the act was permissive, rather than mandatory. Local councils were not obliged to use its powers. Poor Law Unions did not match local authorities boundaries so not all councils had a hospital in their area. It was not uncommon for a workhouse and Poor Law infirmary in one Public Assistance Institution to share a site, as in Manchester, Darlington and Hastings. By 1935 37 of the 79 county boroughs in England had made some expenditure on general hospitals. There was an increase from 15,765 hospital beds in the public sector in 1931, to 30,264 in 1938 - 66.8% of all hospital beds.|$|R

However, although direct taxation was levied by Tynwald, the Boards' freedom of action before the 1960s was limited by the Lieutenant Governor's control of the Island's budget and his power to appoint certain of their members.|$|R
50|$|Leavesden Mental Hospital {{was founded}} in 1870 on the {{outskirts}} of Abbots Langley by the Metropolitan <b>Asylums</b> <b>Board</b> as the Metropolitan Asylum for Chronic Imbeciles.
