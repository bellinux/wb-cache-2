She had never quite known, quite understood as yet, whether she had made good her footing in her aunt's house in a manner pleasant to her aunt.

60|$|At {{first he}} was too indignant for any relief save {{walking up and down}} the esplanade, endeavouring to digest the {{unfairness}} towards himself of his brother's silence upon views that would have put their <b>joint</b> <b>residence</b> at Avonmouth on so different a footing; above all, when the Temple family were his own peculiar charge, and when he remembered how unsuspiciously he had answered all questions on the money matters, and told how all was left in the widow's own power. It was the more irritating, as he knew that his displeasure would be ascribed to interested motives, and regarded somewhat as he had seen Hubert's resentment treated when Francis teased his favourite rabbit. Yet not only on principle, but to avoid a quarrel, and to reserve to himself such influence as might best shield Lady Temple from further annoyance, he must school himself to meet his brother with coolness and patience. It was not, however, without strong effort {{that he was able to}} perceive that, from the outer point of view, one who, when a mere child, had become the wife of an aged general, might, in her early widowhood, be supposed open to the addresses of a man of higher rank and fewer years, and the more as it was not in her nature to look crushed and pathetic. He, who had known her intimately throughout her married life and in her sorrow, was aware of the quiet force of the love that had grown up with her, so entirely a thread in her being as to crave little expression, and too reverent to be violent even in her grief. The nature, always gentle, had recovered its balance, and the difference in years had no doubt told in the readiness with which her spirits had recovered their cheerfulness, though her heart remained unchanged. Still, retired as her habits were, and becoming as was her whole conduct, Colin began to see that there had been enough of liveliness about her to lead to Lord Keith's mistake, though not to justify his want of delicacy in the precipitation of his suit.|$|E

MethodOne green fluorophore was covalently bound to the Hylan A low molecular weight (MW) molecule (viscous fluid fraction) and a second red fluorophore was covalently bound to Hylan B high MW molecule (globule gel-like fraction). Goats were anesthetized and the right knee received 0. 5 ml of test material or unbound fluorophore dyes. Gross and histological serial evaluations were performed over an 8 -week period. ResultsBy 24 h, the non-covalently linked control labels were not present in the tissues. For the covalently linked labels, the green fluorophore Hylan A diminished rapidly in intensity grossly but persisted to 28 days within the superficial synovial and articular cartilage layers in histologic sections. The red fluorophore linked Hylan B was seen only as globules in the synovial fluid. Mononuclear cells remained attached to these globules for 28 days and showed phagocytosis of the globules {{as well as the}} green fluorophore Hylan A. The globules were absent at 56 days after injection. The synovial fluid leukocyte count peaked at 24 h (mean 9767 cells/mm 3 ± 8574 S. D.) and declined by 7 days. ConclusionsThe smaller MW Hylan was removed more rapidly than the higher MW Hylan. The globules were degraded by a different mechanism involving monocytes/macrophages {{on the surface of the}} higher MW globules...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the rise}} in postdivorce joint {{physical}} custody has fueled scholarly interest in its impact on children, consequences for parents remain understudied. Because children's residence arrangements determine time and coordination demands associated with child care, this study investigated the relationship between postdivorce residence arrangements and parents' time pressure. Regression analyses on 4, 460 formerly married or cohabiting parents in the Netherlands showed that main residence (mother residence, father <b>residence,</b> or <b>joint</b> physical custody) is more strongly related to time pressure than is nonresident parents' visitation frequency. Compared with mother <b>residence,</b> <b>joint</b> physical custody is associated with less time pressure for mothers and slightly greater pressure for fathers, which supports the idea of higher care demands when parents {{spend more time with}} their children. The results do not support the role of coordination demands; the extent of interparental contact and the number of transitions the child makes are not related to time pressure...|$|R

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} patients suffering from Depression with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a tertiary care hospital setting in Pakistan. Methods: Data for three hundred and sixty patients (n= 360; 284 males and 76 females) was analyzed. Three hundred and sixty patients were selected from the outpatient department of cardiology unit of Pakistan institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) and were screened for depression using Urdu version of Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9).

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} labour mobility in Italy, with a <b>joint</b> analysis of <b>residence</b> transfers and "long-rangeâ€ commuting. In the period 1990 - 2005, migration inflows have increased in the Centre North, both in short- and long-range component. In the South, by contrast, the low short-range mobility has decreased further, while the emigration toward the North remained significant; moreover, the high-educated outflows have increased significantly. The empirical findings show that South-North migration continues {{to be driven by}} the large economic differentials between the two areas. In {{the second half of the}} nineties, the widening gap on the employment rate, the downsizing of the public sector and the reduction of the gap on house prices have prompted a growing number of people to emigrate. In the current decade the strong growth of house prices in the Centre North has contributed to reduce the phenomenon.

40|$|The Northeast {{is still}} the poorest region in Thailand, {{but over the past}} two decades it has {{experienced}} underappreciated major economic growth. This growth has not been confined to urban areas, and living conditions in rural villages have improved. Using Thai Government data and other sources, this report describes and analyzes changes that have occurred. More people now work in non-agricultural jobs, both permanently and part-time with agriculture, and remittances from emigrants working outside the region have been of great help. But in farming households agricultural income has so far remained a very major part of overall income, a principal reason why the majority of the population has stayed in agriculture and rural villages became better off. We argue that this occurred primarily because of agricultural breakthroughs after the adoption of the glutinous rice variety RD 6, with the non-glutinous variety KDML 105 playing a complementary commercial role. Increased agricultural income helped make the villages more attractive settings for <b>residence,</b> <b>joint</b> investments and remittances, all of which ramified beyond the villages to help lift the economy of the region, and of the nation...|$|R

The Department of Treasury estimates suggest that the exclusion may result in federal revenue losses of about $ 1. 4 billion from FY 2008 through FY 2013.
