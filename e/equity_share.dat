40|$|<b>Equity</b> <b>sharing</b> in {{international}} joint ventures (IJVs) {{is a critical}} issue with implications for risk sharing, resource allocation, knowledge commitment, and organizational control. As a departure from previous research, this study aims to explore strategic antecedents and environmental dimensions underlying sharing arrangements. It argues that the structure of <b>equity</b> <b>sharing</b> controls the ex post degree of economic exposure or risk propensity, and boosts risk-adjusted returns earned from strategic resources or global integration. Analysis of data collected from IJVs in China suggests that strategic orientation, resource dependence, knowledge protection, and global integration as sought by MNEs are important antecedents of <b>equity</b> <b>sharing.</b> <b>Equity</b> <b>sharing</b> is an inverse function of host-country environmental complexity and hostility as perceived by MNE managers. <b>Equity</b> <b>sharing</b> Joint venture Strategic analysis...|$|R

25|$|The {{calculation}} of Bumiputra-held economic equity has been frequently disputed, {{with a number}} of allegations from some quarters that the government intentionally underestimated the share of Bumiputra equity to justify the NEP and its related policies. Although many affirmative action measures of the NEP were continued under the National Development Policy which ran from 1990 to 2000, and later by the National Vision Policy set to run from 2000 to 2010 – leading many Malaysians to refer to the NEP in the present tense – the official Bumiputra <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> remained less than the original 30% target.|$|E
25|$|Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) {{manufactured}} Gremlins in Mexico under {{license and}} partial ownership (38% <b>equity</b> <b>share)</b> by AMC. Although the Gremlin {{was introduced to}} the U.S. and Canadian markets in 1970, VAM continued assembling its version of the Hornet still bearing the name Rambler American as its smallest, least expensive car until 1974. The fact that VAM already had three lines of products (the top limit permitted by legislation) from 1968 through 1973 made it impossible for the Gremlin to be offered. It was until the discontinuation of the Javelin line in 1973 that a free space was available for the Gremlin, making 1974 its year of debut.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of NOC governance, the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented. The NEP aimed to {{eradicate}} poverty irrespective of race by expanding the economic pie so that the Chinese share of the economy would not be reduced in absolute terms but only relatively. The aim was for the Malays to have a 30% <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> of the economy, {{as opposed to the}} 4% they held in 1970. Foreigners and Chinese held much of the rest. The NEP appeared to be derived from Article 153 and could be viewed as being in line with its wording. Although Article 153 would have been up for review in 1972, fifteen years after Malaysia's independence in 1957, due to the May 13 Incident it remained unreviewed. A new expiration date of 1991 for the NEP was set, twenty years after its implementation.|$|E

40|$|What is an {{appropriate}} <b>equity</b> <b>sharing</b> arrangement for international joint ventures is an important but puzzling issue. The current literature {{does not seem to}} provide a consistent answer to this question. In this paper, we propose that a minority equity position for foreign businesses is a viable <b>equity</b> <b>sharing</b> arrangement for joint ventures located in developing countries. Our proposition seemed to be supported by an empirical study based on field interviews of seventy-three international joint ventures in the People's Republic of China. The findings suggest that joint ventures with a minority foreign equity seemed to operate more smoothly than joint ventures with a 50 %- 50 % <b>equity</b> <b>sharing</b> or a majority foreign <b>equity</b> <b>sharing</b> arrangements.
