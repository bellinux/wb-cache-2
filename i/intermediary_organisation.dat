Given that very few intermediary organisations are, legally, ‘born equal’, pursue identical intermediation goals, serve similarly-situated helices and, accordingly, operate, organise and institutionalise within only a very limited structural typology, the resultant vast variety and diversity of real-world triple helix intermediary organisations across the globe should be analysed on a comparative meta-level to better develop a phenomenology (and concomitant research commonality) of triple helix intermediation in terms of its (legal) experience, properties, convergence and efficiency.|$|E

30|$|Triple helix trilateral {{networks}} tread between {{market and}} hierarchy (Fitjar et al. 2014; Leydesdorff 2000). For {{the purposes of}} optimising real-world triple helix collaborations in a minimally regulated but also transaction-cost efficient manner, as discussed in the Tuunainen case study above, a sphere- 1 mode 3 substructure should be formally formed or incorporated by the helices—thus, creating a special-purpose triple helix intermediation entity, i.e. a helixerator company. Such separate, stand-alone intermediation entity will benefit from both entrepreneurial advance planning (within its constituent documents, for example, its articles and bylaws, and its other foundational agreements among the helixerator company and its stakeholders, sponsors and owners) and the statutory default structures provided by applicable corporation or other organisational laws (see Fernández-Esquinas et al. (2012)). As such, the triple helix company is both an informal and an incorporated affair—a market/entrepreneurial device that transacts with its stakeholder-owners and a hierarchical/regulated structure that centralises and streamlines formative and adaptive decision-making for purposes of the continued survival, prosperity and innovation of the particular triple helix collaboration in question. It provides the sphere- 1 ‘substructure organization’ that produces the organisational innovation and institutionalisation for purposes of governing the overall ‘superstructure organization’ (Lynn et al. 1996 : 98) that is the <b>intermediary</b> <b>organisation</b> (spheres 1 and 2 in combination)—which <b>intermediary</b> <b>organisation,</b> in turn, ‘act[s] to provide collective goods to [the triple helix] members and help[s] to facilitate and coordinate {{the flow of information}} [and other critical resources to and among the helices]’ (Howells 2006 : 717). The helixerator company can, therefore, also be categorised in this regard as a trilateral hybrid between ‘hierarchical,’ ‘network’ and ‘cooperative coordination’ (Todeva 2013) among its triple helix stakeholders.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{logistical}} analysis of construction supply chains by assessing the impact of varying demand on the performance of builders' merchants' logistics. Design/methodology/approach – Taking into consideration that the vast majority of construction materials are distributed through <b>intermediary</b> <b>organisations,</b> the paper focuses on the logistics of builders' merchants. The study follows a field study approach to develop a conceptual logistics model facilitating experimentation using simulation modelling. Findings – The paper highlights the importance of incorporating <b>intermediary</b> <b>organisations</b> in the study of construction supply chains and reveals the implications of varying demand on logistics performance related to inventory and transportation costs. Research limitations/implications – In order to limit assumptions associated with individual company characteristics, the sample has included data from one builder's merchant company.

30|$|In addition, {{it should}} be noted that even within the same {{national}} innovation jurisdiction, the same functional type of <b>intermediary</b> <b>organisation</b> may often be structured and domiciled through very different legal entity forms—simply because there are so many different legal forms to choose and adapt from ad hoc. To name a few options in this regard: should a particular triple helix <b>intermediary</b> <b>organisation</b> be an unincorporated association, a foundation, a trust, a non-profit corporation/company, a for-profit business corporation/company, a for-profit general partnership, a contractual joint venture or consortium (i.e. without separate legal personality), a cooperative or a for-profit/non-profit hybrid corporation/company (for example, in the United Kingdom, a community-interest company)? The current variety in legal organisation may be inevitable given the adaptation default strategy on the one hand and the fact that intermediary legal organisations are tasked with domiciling a wide spectrum of possible real-world triple helix intermediation activities on the other hand. However, even when ‘explored independently’, taking into account that ‘each type of intermediary organization … will have unique characteristics’ (Metcalfe 2010 : 507; see also Landry et al. (2013 : 431); Pollard (2006 : 150)), all of the above types of legal entities (and many more) are pre-existing and generic tools of private/public, for-profit/non-profit ordering for purposes of partitioning and recognising enforceable separations and legal spheres of rights, responsibilities and assets. It may, therefore, be concluded that the legal organisation of real-world triple helix intermediation projects still occurs in very early stages of ad hoc experimentation and improvisation. Thus, it may also be claimed that current triple helix collaborations and their intermediation are both under-planned and under-institutionalised and that matters would generally benefit from a more robust academic discussion as regards (i) the adoption of new, sui-generis types of blended, thus, hybridised private/public, for-profit/non-profit legal organisations in order to specifically and exclusively organise triple helix innovation and its intermediation and (ii) at a minimum, the adaptation of existing legal entity formats in order to allow for the specific creation and tailoring of custom-made triple helix intermediary organisations.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the reframing of {{electricity}} markets as a strategically oriented nonstate governance activity of <b>intermediary</b> <b>organisations.</b> In particular, it is centred on the establishment of ‘green’ electricity labels by environmental and other nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) {{as an attempt to}} establish and shape a market for green electricity. Such labels serve as a ‘boundary object’ between electricity generators, suppliers, consumers, and regulators, and are analysed as the creation of new sociotechnical arrangements around green electricity generation and use. The analysis also shows that private governance initiatives of this kind are highly interdependent with state regulatory systems. NGOs have played a vital role in defining and negotiating such standards, enrolling and aligning supply-side and demand-side actors, communicating with a wider public and building trust for the respective products, establishing links with regulators, and shaping policies for renewable electricity at national and European levels.

Our analysis draws on qualitative case study research with local projects, and a study of how <b>intermediary</b> <b>organisations</b> support local projects. We examine the extent and nature of interactions and resource flows between projects and intermediary actors in order to evaluate the utility of niche theories in the civil society context. While networking and <b>intermediary</b> <b>organisations</b> can effectively spread some types of learning necessary for diffusion, this is not sufficient: tacit knowledge, trust and confidence are essential to these projects’ success, but {{are more difficult to}} abstract and translate to new settings.
