It is shown that a scheme with two penalties (accountability and non-report) is able to induce the first-best solution. However, this scheme needs not imply a punitive environment, but may, under given circumstances, yield insignificant and even negative penalties. Alternative incentive systems, such as voluntary reporting and legal immunity, are found to have less desirable properties. An exception is the principle of confidentiality (anonymity) {{which turns out to}} be an optimal scheme.

40|$|Background: Despite the {{official}} precautionary measures against percutaneous injuries, incidents still occur. Consequently, {{it is possible}} that healthcare workers could contract infections like HBV, HCV, HGV (hepatitis B, C and G viruses) and HIV (human immune deficiency virus). The most serious problem {{lies in the fact that}} percutaneous injuries are often underestimated, <b>resulting</b> in <b>non-reporting</b> of <b>the</b> incident. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of percutaneous injuries in doctors in the School of Medicine at the University of the Free State (UFS), whether the incidents were reported, and <b>the</b> reasons <b>for</b> <b>non-reporting.</b> <b>The</b> use of gloves during procedures was also evaluated. Methods: A mainly descriptive study design was used. Questionnaires were administered from October 2006 through January 2007 to collect information. Participants were selected randomly, and the respondents were divided into surgical and non-surgical groups. Results: The respondents fulfilled the following roles and/or functions in their respective departments of employment: 35 (67. 3 %) were registrars, 12 (23. 1 %) were specialists/consultants, four (7. 7 %) were medical officers, and one (1. 9 %) was exclusively involved in student training. Two of the respondents did not indicate their roles and functions in their respective departments. A total of 82 incidents of percutaneous injuries occurred. Although the surgical groups handled sharp objects more frequently per week than the non-surgical groups (p-value = 0. 04), more incidents occurred in the non-surgical groups (p-value = 0. 02).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the evolution of fraud investigation and prevention in light of the advances in computing technology. These recent advances have impacted upon traditional fraud offences as well as creating a range of new crimes. The financial significance of fraud is growing whereas law enforcement and the judicial system appear to be unable {{to meet the demands of}} these emerging crimes and its victims. This research compares the responses of our present and future investigators with those of our current business leaders from the government and the commercial sectors. This research establishes the needs of corporate decision-makers and the attitudes of police with regard to fraud. Data relating to persons arrested and convicted of fraud was also analysed to identify the issues that may be responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> of offences to police by victims. The research found that victims are seeking solutions that are not available through law enforcement, for example financial compensation. Law enforcement also under-utilises the potential of proactive responses to prevent offences and they are reluctant to acknowledge the benefits of preventative measures and to incorporate this strategy within criminal investigation training programmes. The lack of deterrence offered by the judicial system does not make the situation any better. The police function is still primarily a reactive one. In order to overcome fraud and to be able to adapt to changes there needs to be collaboration between stakeholders. This requires a joint effort from the police, government, commerce and the victims of fraud. An innovative model involving stakeholders has been formulated that represents an alternative to the current system. This approach utilises the financial resources and expertise from the commercial sector as well as the skills of criminal investigators from the police. This means adopting a combined package of both reactive and proactive measures in order to minimise the impact of fraud. This model will be adaptive and will be able to accommodate any future requirements arising out of further inevitable advances in computer technology...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} of outcome reporting bias-the selection for publication of {{a subset of the}} original recorded outcome variables {{on the basis of the}} results-and its impact on Cochrane reviews. DESIGN: A nine point classification system for missing outcome data in randomised trials was developed and applied to the trials assessed in a large, unselected cohort of Cochrane systematic reviews. Researchers who conducted the trials were contacted and <b>the</b> reason sought <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> of data. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the impact of outcome reporting bias on reviews that included a single meta-analysis of the review primary outcome. RESULTS: More than half (157 / 283 (55 %)) the reviews did not include full data <b>for</b> <b>the</b> review primary outcome of interest from all eligible trials. The median amount of review outcome data missing for any reason was 10 %, whereas 50 % or more of the potential data were missing in 70 (25 %) reviews. It was clear from <b>the</b> publications <b>for</b> 155 (6 %) of the 2486 assessable trials that the researchers had measured and analysed the review primary outcome but did not report or only partially reported <b>the</b> results. <b>For</b> reports that did not mention the review primary outcome, our classification regarding the presence of outcome reporting bias was shown to have a sensitivity of 88 % (95 % CI 65 % to 100 %) and specificity of 80 % (95 % CI 69 % to 90 %) on the basis of responses from 62 trialists. A third of Cochrane reviews (96 / 283 (34 %)) contained at least one trial with high suspicion of outcome reporting bias <b>for</b> <b>the</b> review primary outcome. In a sensitivity analysis undertaken for 81 reviews with a single meta-analysis of the primary outcome of interest, the treatment effect estimate was reduced by 20 % or more in 19 (23 %). Of the 42 meta-analyses with a statistically significant result only, eight (19 %) became non-significant after adjustment for outcome reporting bias and 11 (26 %) would have overestimated the treatment effect by 20 % or more. CONCLUSIONS: Outcome reporting bias is an under-recognised problem that affects the conclusions in a substantial proportion of Cochrane reviews. Individuals conducting systematic reviews need to address explicitly the issue of missing outcome data for their review to be considered a reliable source of evidence. Extra care is required during data extraction, reviewers should identify when a trial reports that an outcome was measured but no results were reported or events observed, and contact with trialists should be encouraged...|$|R

This study investigated the reporting behavior, knowledge, and attitude to reporting communicable disease in private doctors in Taiwan. The differences between <b>the</b> reporting and <b>non-reporting</b> doctors were also explored. Methods A total of 1250 clinics were randomly sampled nationwide by a 2 -stage process. Data were collected from 1093 private doctors (87. 4 % response rate) using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Four hundred and six (37. 2 %) doctors reported having diagnosed reportable communicable diseases. Among them, 340 (83. 5 %) have the experiences of reporting. Results The most common reasons for not reporting were "do not want to violate the patient's privacy", "reporting procedure is troublesome", and "not sure whether the diagnosed disease is reportable". Significantly higher proportions of <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> doctors considered <b>the</b> reporting system inconvenient or were not familiar with the system.

SETTING [...] Southside of the Bloomsbury and Islington District Health Authority. DESIGN [...] Reconciliation exercise with CDSC of cases reported with those known to have received treatment in the district from 1982 to March 1990.

RESULTS [...] Cumulatively 13 % (46 / 351) of patients whose initial AIDS illness was diagnosed in the District remained unreported by March 1991. Non-reporting increased from 9 % (2 / 23) of cases diagnosed prior to 1985 to 28 % (26 / 92) of cases diagnosed between 1989 and 1990.

Consequently the insurance market has shown instability with regard to the fluctuations of the premium levels. A fair pricing based on the market conditions is one of the biggest challenges of the albanian insurance market. By means of an econometric model, the correlation between the liberalization process and profitability of insurance companies has been shown. This paper discusses also the efficiency of the Bonus-Malus System, which is expected to be implemented in Albania in 2018 in order to stabilize the insurance market. In this regard the elasticity according to Loimaranta (1972) is calculated <b>for</b> Albania. As <b>the</b> Bonus-Malus System is already implemented in other region countries, the paper suggests that in addition to the advantages this system can bring, there is also the risk of the phenomenon known in the literature as “ Hunger for Bonus”, according to which, people tend to not report the claims.

40|$|Concerning {{the spread}} of PPR within a country, {{there are several ways}} to model the {{susceptible}} population. Data from Tunisia provide information on infected sub-populations, suggesting that a meta-population approach where susceptibles are modelled as a network of interconnected nodes would be appropriate. Although not implemented in this study, this framework would offer the scope to capture heterogeneity across nodes, representing the species composition of individual farms. The strength of connections in this network would then be influenced by the perceived strength of the infectious challenge between nodes. A natural initial approach to this would be to represent the strength of interactions as being monotonically related to Euclidean distance. Anticipating the problems regarding a lack of knowledge on the susceptible population, it is also beneficial to consider frameworks where the susceptible population is represented via a continuous spatial intensity, which then moderates the occurrence of new infections. In particular, it was noted that a framework in which spatial contact distribution models (described later) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> initiation of new infections are used to formulate a marked point process model in which marks are drawn from a distribution - representing the diversity of units forming the susceptible population - may be appropriate, and may offer a way of accommodating the lack of information on the susceptible population. It was identified as being important that parameter uncertainty could be treated properly for any models that are fitted to data on PPR, so that these uncertainties could be propagated through to predictions. With this in mind, particular consideration was given to finding models that could be fitted using either likelihood-based methods (to extract maximum information from data) or a fully Bayesian approach, for uncertainty propagation. As previously mentioned, it was considered important that any approach to model fitting could cope with unobserved processes, or with the increased model complexity that arises from, for example, including parameters <b>for</b> <b>the</b> probability of <b>non-reporting</b> of infections.

The second part closely looks at <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> behavior of victims and describes the individual factors, which lead to the decision to not report a crime to the police. First and nearly most important factor described is the cost and benefit theory. Second factor that the thesis is dealing with is the trust in police in a specific territory. Third factor is the influence of neighborhood in which the victim lives and fourth is the influence of victim's age.

Data from automatic ship reporting systems (AIS and LRIT) have been received during one year over a large Area of Interest (AOI) in the Western Indian Ocean. The data were used to construct the Maritime Situational Picture (MSP) over the AOI, i. e. the map with the current positions of all reporting ships. The MSP has been served continuously in real time to two operational users in the region, between 15 Sep 2014 and 15 Sep 2015. The data have also been used to make monthly ship traffic density maps. Finally, a number of satellite images have been collected to probe <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of ships that are not seen on the reporting systems. This report assesses the quality (completeness and timeliness) of the ship reporting data and the resulting MSP; it presents the derived monthly ship density maps, split between slow moving and fast moving traffic {{in order to understand}} ship activity; and it present results on <b>the</b> fraction of <b>non-reporting</b> ships based on the analysis of the satellite images. The ship reporting data that were used are AIS data received by up to 16 satellites of four different operators, AIS data from various coastal networks in the region, and LRIT data from the Flags that use the EU LRIT Data Centre (“EU Flags”). Fusing the data from these systems – that amounts to more than 566, 000 incoming ship position messages per day (figures are given here <b>for</b> <b>the</b> month of June 2015) – it is found that on average, a total of 1, 522 ships are seen in the AOI on a daily basis. Of those, 11 (0. 7 %) are only seen by LRIT, {{in spite of the fact}} that LRIT contributes only a tiny 614 position reports per day (0. 1 %) on average. A sampling of <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> ship traffic by satellite imaging has shown that 34 % of the ships detected in satellite radar images are not seen in AIS or LRIT. However, this fraction varies much from one location to another; among the limited locations sampled, it is highest off the Somali coast. JRC. G. 3 -Maritime affair...|$|R
50|$|Male-directed sexual {{violence}} is {{more significant than}} is often thought. The scope of such crimes continues, however, to be unknown largely because of poor {{or a lack of}} documentation. <b>The</b> under- or <b>non-reporting</b> of {{sexual violence}} against males may often be due to fear, confusion, guilt, shame and stigma, or a combination thereof. Moreover, men may be reluctant to talk about being victim of crimes of sexual violence. In this regard, the way in which societies construct the notion of masculinity plays a role. Masculinity and victimization may be considered incompatible, in particular in societies where masculinity is equated with the ability to exert power, leading to <b>non-reporting.</b> <b>The</b> incompatibility between the conventional understanding of masculinity and victimization can arise both with regard to the attack itself and when coping with the consequences of such crimes. Because of under- and non-reporting on sexual violence against men, the little evidence that exists tends to be anecdotal.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the level of octopus (Octopus maorum) predation and the daily‐average number of lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) per pot was investigated using commercial catch statistics. Octopus predation {{was found to be}} inversely correlated with lobster catches, such that, lobsters experienced reduced survival when their daily‐average density in a pot was lower. The reduction in survival at lower densities provides evidence for a depen‐satory mechanism underlying the predator‐prey interaction between pot‐caught octopus and lobster. The effect of lobster density on the feeding response of octopus is unknown so this study could not determine whether depensation was brought about by either predator saturation or predator avoidance tactics used by lobsters. The use of commercial catch statistics to investigate this depensatory effect has disadvantages because the lobster mortality estimates can be biased by <b>the</b> <b>non‐reporting</b> of undersized lobsters caught inside pots, under‐reporting of lobsters killed by octopus, the inability to identify unsuccessful predation attempts made by octopus, and the ability of some lobsters to escape from pots. All the sources of bias would tend to make it difficult to conclusively determine both the absolute proportion of lobsters killed by octopus and the true scale of the depensatory mortality, as the scale of the mortality may be greater than the commercial data suggest. However, the bias will not necessarily reduce our ability to detect the depensatory effect if, as seems likely, the sources of bias are relatively constant across the range of daily‐average catches. Depensation in crustacean stocks affected by pot‐related octopus predation has been rarely studied, and, because depleted stocks lead to fewer lobsters being caught per pot, such depensatory mortality has implications <b>for</b> <b>the</b> population dynamics and management of crustacean stocks...|$|R
30|$|In {{the context}} of this barrier the key {{question}} is “do we have the most efficient processes to ensure that effective products benefits the patients?” In spite of the large amounts of resources going into global health R&D, the number of new drugs in the pipeline is actually decreasing as exemplified by the lower number of new antibiotics coming on the market. Clinical trials, the cornerstone of getting drugs and other interventions to patients, are facing major problems with regards to high costs, difficulties in recruitment of trial participants, more regulations and concerns about transparency and accountability. These concerns include unethical behavior on the part of pharmaceutical companies, publication bias, and <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> of adverse events or negative results. Importantly, the developing countries will be affected as {{it has been estimated that}} nearly 20 % of clinical trials globally now take place in the developing world, up from in 9 % in 2003 (Normile 2008). Most of the increases are occurring in Russia, India, China and Brazil. <b>The</b> main reasons <b>for</b> increasing interest in conducting trials in the developing world relate to lower costs, accelerated recruitment and perceived ease of overcoming ethical and regulatory barriers. There is also some concern about the over-regulation of clinical trials, specifically the requirements to adhere to the ICH-GCP guidelines which places too much emphasis on the process rather than on the benefits to the patients (White 2006; Farrar 2007). These bureaucratic requirements also place clinical trials beyond the reach of most developing country investigators and disempowers them from truly participating in the research and sharing in the benefits.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} employment, {{unemployment}} and earnings experience of male immigrants in England {{using data from}} the Quarterly Labour Force Surveys of the United Kingdom which were undertaken between December 1992 and November 1994. After outlining some theoretical developments in the economics of migration, in particular the importance of self-selection, and surveying the recent empirical evidence, concerning international labour migration to the industrialised countries, the characteristics of the whole male population are examined using descriptive statistics. The sample consists of those resident in England, aged 25 - 64. These characteristics are then compared with those males who are economically active (according to International Labour Office definitions). Particular attention is given to the variation in the year of immigration and country of birth amongst the foreign born, and the differences between the ethnic white and ethnic non-white populations.;The employment adjustment of foreign-born males to the English labour market is then examined, using Chiswick's (1982) model. Hypotheses concerning the impact of education, potential labour market experience, years since migration and country of birth on the employment rate are investigated using logistic regression analysis. A similar study is also undertaken of the unemployment experience of foreign born males, using both the International Labour Office definition and the official government measure. Predicted percentage probabilities, calculated for individuals with average group characteristics, clarify the separate impact of each variable upon the employment and unemployment prospects of males in England.;Finally, selectivity corrected earnings functions are estimated, controlling for potential bias in both the employment decision and from <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> of wage information. Importantly, the returns to schooling and to potential experience are separated into those received in the country of origin and those obtained after immigration. The country of birth is shown to influence the earnings performance amongst both the ethnic minorities and the immigrants...|$|R
40|$|Sentinel- 1 is the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{satellite}} of the EU’s Copernicus {{program for}} Earth observation. Being a radar, {{it is very}} suitable for ship detection. Sentinel- 1 produces routinely {{a large amount of}} images over the seas and coasts, in particular in Europe and the Arctic but also elsewhere on the globe. Up to now, software to analyse satellite SAR images for ship detection was limited to handle a few images at the time, so was not up to the high production volume of Sentinel- 1. This report describes improvements in JRC’s ship detector SUMO to fully automatically process large amounts of images. With this increased capability, time series of many months of Sentinel- 1 images are analysed over two sites in the Arctic, revealing the seasonal relation between ship traffic and sea ice. Also a multi-month data set over the Mediterranean Sea, mapping the shipping patterns there, and a one-year data set over the Western Indian Ocean are analysed. The combination of the Sentinel- 1 ship detections with ship positions derived from ship self-reporting systems (AIS and LRIT) results in the quantification and mapping of <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> ship traffic, that is not seen on AIS or LRIT. Beyond mere detection, new methods are tested to estimate the size of the ships from their signature in the Sentinel- 1 images, and to allow discrimination between tankers and cargo vessels even if they are of similar size. The occurrence of range ambiguities, and the occurrence SAR imaging effects on the apparent heading of the ship signatures are briefly discussed. The developments and experiences discussed here should further promote Sentinel- 1 in becoming a tool for maritime surveillance to the benefit of maritime safety, security and sustainability, including spatial planning.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. A {{database}} on South African industrial companies {{listed on}} the Johannesburg Stock Exchange called FIN 01 {{was created by the}} Graduate School of Business (USB), University of Stellenbosch, to capture the various companies' financial data from 1970 to date. FIN 01 database is being updated to capture financial data of listed companies from other African countries. Against the background, {{the purpose of the study}} project was to update the University database (FIN 01) by creating a database for listed Botswana Stock Exchange companies. The creation of the database required gathering and analysis of information of the various Botswana companies. Before the information from the Annual Reports could be captured into the main database, it was captured into Excel created spreadsheets. This information was captured under the respective workbooks as created <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cash flow statements, income statements and balance sheet items. To conform to the requirements of the FIN 01 database, the Botswana companies were allocated codes. The summarised data was then transferred to the main USB database (FIN 01). A thorough analysis on performance of the various companies was then carried out. This was done through trend analysis, common size analysis and ratio analysis. Problems were encountered during the process of data capturing and analysis. These included unavailability of Annual Reports, various different reporting formats and the standard Excel spreadsheets provided. The various companies' inconsistency in reporting was further reflected in <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> of turnover and share prices by most of the listed companies. However, the creation and incorporation of the listed Botswana companies was a success. It is recommended that the project be continued as an ongoing process. The information should be updated on a yearly basis. Companies should be encouraged to continue sending the Annual Reports to the University. The companies should in return get regular feedback on key performance indicators as reflected in the database...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{completeness}} of data on death certificates over the past 25 years in Beirut, Lebanon, and to examine factors associated with the absence of certifiers' signatures and <b>the</b> <b>non-reporting</b> of <b>the</b> underlying cause of death. METHODS: A systematic 20 % sample comprising 2607 death certificates covering the 1974, 1984, 1994, 1997 and 1998 registration periods was retrospectively reviewed for certification practices and missing data. FINDINGS: The information on the death certificates was almost complete in respect of all {{demographic characteristics of the}} deceased persons except for occupation and month of birth. Data relating to these variables were missing on approximately 95 % and 78 % of the certificates, respectively. Around half of the certificates did not carry a certifier's signature. Of those bearing such a signature, 21. 6 % lacked documentation of the underlying cause of death. The certifier's signature was more likely to be absent on: certificates corresponding to the younger and older age groups than on those of persons aged 15 - 44 years; those of females than on those of males; those of persons who had been living remotely from the registration governorate than on those of other deceased persons; and those for which there had been delays in registration exceeding six months than on certificates for which registration had been quicker. For certificates that carried the certifier's signature {{there was no evidence that}} any of the demographic characteristics of the deceased person was associated with decreased likelihood of reporting an underlying cause of death. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> responsibility <b>for</b> failure to report causes of death in Beirut lies with families who lack an incentive to call for a physician and with certifying physicians who do not carry out this duty. The deficiencies in death certification are rectifiable. However, any changes should be sensitive to the constraints of the organizational and legal infrastructure governing death registration practices and the medical educational systems in the country...|$|R
40|$|Violence {{against any}} person is unacceptable; however, {{there seems to}} be a tacit {{collusion}} with perpetrators when <b>the</b> media <b>non-reports</b> or under-reports incidents of violence in which the victims are targeted because of their actual or perceived LGBT identity. One wonders if the political and religious broad brush strokes of a state influence the response of the media within that state. Close examination of this data will determine if there are discrepancies between the two types of states regarding their portrayal of anti-LGBT attacks. How does the governmental bias of a state influence the coverage of these attacks?
