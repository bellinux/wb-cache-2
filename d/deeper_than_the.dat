5|$|Kijak {{revealed}} that upon thinking of Lynch's use of doppelgängers he {{was reminded of}} an interview where Yoshiki said he has two personalities, his public persona and a man wounded by the tragedies in his life. He made this the subtext of the film to have something <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> average rockumentary. He {{said one of the}} hardest aspects was editorial, trying to balance all the characters, albums and drama with Yoshiki's life and work.|$|E
5|$|M1 is flat-crowned. The anteroloph, a crest at {{the front}} of the tooth, lacks a smaller {{accessory}} spur that is present in N.rufus. The paracone, one of the main cusps, is quite small; this cusp is more prominent in N.rufus. The mesoloph, a crest on the middle of the tooth, is distinct but short and located further to the back than in N.rufus. M2 has a longer mesoloph. M3 is largely flat-crowned, but the paracone is a bit more prominent than the rest. The valley between the cusps {{at the front}} is <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> valleys at the back. Each of the upper molars has three roots.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E

5|$|The northwestern and {{northern}} {{portions of the}} Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall {{than the rest of}} the peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. This limestone geology results in most rainwater filtering directly through the bedrock to the phreatic zone, from whence it slowly flows to the coasts to form large submarine springs. Various freshwater springs rise along the coast to form watering holes. The filtering of rainwater through the limestone has caused the formation of extensive cave systems. These cave rooves are subject to collapse forming deep sinkholes; if the bottom of the cave is <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> groundwater level then a cenote is formed.|$|E
5|$|The smalltail shark forms large aggregations {{segregated}} by sex, {{with the}} males generally found <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> females. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, including sea catfish, croakers, jacks, and grunts. Shrimp, crabs, and squid are secondary food sources, while adults are also {{capable of taking}} young sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon), hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and stingrays (Dasyatis). Opportunistic in habits, the dietary composition of this shark generally reflects what is most available in its environment; off northern Brazil, the most important prey species are the croakers Macrodon ancylodon and Stellifer naso. Juveniles consume {{a wider variety of}} prey than adults. In turn, the smalltail shark may potentially be preyed upon by larger sharks.|$|E
5|$|Widespread in the nearshore {{waters of}} the {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific region, the bluespotted ribbontail ray has a range that extends around {{the periphery of the}} Indian Ocean from South Africa to the Arabian Peninsula to Southeast Asia, including Madagascar, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. It is rare in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. In the Pacific Ocean, this species is found from the Philippines to northern Australia, as well as around numerous Melanesian and Polynesian islands as far east as the Solomon Islands. Rarely found <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> , <b>the</b> bluespotted ribbontail ray is a bottom-dwelling species that frequents coral reefs and adjacent sandy flats. It is also commonly encountered in the intertidal zone and tidal pools, and has been sighted near seagrass beds. Every summer, considerable numbers of bluespotted ribbontail rays arrive off South Africa.|$|E

25|$|Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, {{as opposed}} to {{aesthetic}} – enables {{a vision of the}} beautiful as intimating a reality <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> everyday, {{at least in terms of}} the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world. For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see Peter Fuller.|$|E
25|$|The name Pythagorean theorem {{arises from}} the {{geometric}} interpretation of this result as an analogue of the theorem in synthetic geometry. Note that the proof of the Pythagorean theorem in synthetic geometry is considerably more elaborate because of the paucity of underlying structure. In this sense, the synthetic Pythagorean theorem, if correctly demonstrated, is <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> version given above.|$|E

25|$|Faults were {{discovered}} with the Mark 13 torpedo at this point. Many were seen {{to hit the}} target yet failed to explode; {{there was also a}} tendency to run <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> set depth. It took over a year for the defects to be corrected. These problems were not fixed {{by the time of the}} Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{studies from}} the 1990s and 2000s {{show that there}} is a low seismic-wave-speed anomaly beneath Iceland, but opinion is divided as to whether it {{continues}} <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> mantle transition zone at roughly 600km depth. The velocities of seismic waves are reduced by up to 3% (P waves) and more than 4% (S waves), respectively. These values are consistent with a small percentage of partial melt, a high magnesium content of the mantle, or elevated temperature. It is not possible to unambiguously separate out which effect causes the observed velocity reduction.|$|E
25|$|The {{singular}} nave {{consists of}} a high-choir over stone pillars, a sillar of marble azulejo tile and stucco vaulted-ceiling. In addition, there is a baptistery, {{to the left of}} the altar, six lateral chapels and raised pulpit {{to the left of the}} altar. The concave chapels are designed within a Roman arch, and include gilded retables, are all covered in vegetal elements. The last altar, <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rest, includes imagery from the Last Supper and a ceiling painting of the Holy Spirit. A fence of wood separates the chapels from the rest of the nave.|$|E

25|$|Later in the book, Yulius Fuchik {{was spotted}} by an American P-3C Orion shortly after {{launching}} four Lebed class hovercraft from her cargo deck. After an SA-7 surface-to-air missile launched {{from the ship}} failed to hit the Orion, the American plane retaliated with a Harpoon anti-ship missile and called in two F-15s to strafe the ship with their 20 mm cannons. The damaged Yulius Fuchik eventually reached the port of Keflavik and, after running aground during the approach, slowly settled to the bottom next to the quay in water {{only a few feet}} <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> draught of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|The {{extraordinary}} size of Olympus Mons {{is likely}} because Mars lacks mobile tectonic plates. Unlike on Earth, the crust of Mars remains fixed over a stationary hotspot, and a volcano {{can continue to}} discharge lava until it reaches an enormous height. Like the basalt volcanoes on Earth, Martian basaltic volcanoes are capable of erupting enormous quantities of ash. The basalt found on Earth and Mars are very similar in composition. Due to the gravity on Mars, there are less buoyant forces on the magma {{rising out of the}} crust. Also, the magma chambers are thought to be much larger and <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> ones found on Earth.|$|E
25|$|In {{general and}} across cultures, public {{indications}} of sexual arousal are commonly regarded as embarrassing, {{both to the}} person aroused and the onlooker, {{and for this reason}} those parts of the human body that would indicate arousal are normally covered. Arousal is most evidently indicated by the sex organs and women's breasts, which are routinely covered, even when {{other parts of the body}} may be freely uncovered. Yet the nudity taboo may have meanings <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> immediate possibility of sexual arousal, for example, in the cumulative weight of tradition and habit. Clothing also expresses and symbolizes authority, and more general norms and values besides those of a sexual nature.|$|E

25|$|The first {{double acting}} icebreaking vessel, Azipod-equipped river {{icebreaker}} Röthelstein, was delivered in 1995. The vessel {{was designed to}} break apart ice ridges <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> vessel's draft when moving astern. It was followed by icebreaking platform supply vessels Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg, delivered in 1998, that were the first vessels to fully utilize the double acting ship concept by having the bow designed for operation in open water and light ice conditions. The vessels were designed {{to be capable of}} breaking level ice up to one meter in thickness when running astern and, with the help of two Azipod units, penetrate ice ridges that in the Caspian Sea sometimes reach to the seabed.|$|E
25|$|Oceanographers {{divide the}} ocean into {{different}} vertical zones defined by physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone includes all open ocean regions, {{and can be}} divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance. The photic zone includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most biodiverse. Because plants require photosynthesis, life found <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see marine snow) or find another energy source. Hydrothermal vents are the primary source of energy in {{what is known as the}} aphotic zone (depths exceeding 200m). The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the epipelagic.|$|E
25|$|The depth {{penetration}} of bomb tritium can be separated into 3 distinct layers. Layer 1 is the shallowest layer and includes the deepest, ventilated layer in winter; {{it has received}} tritium via radioactive fallout and lost some due to advection and/or vertical diffusion and contains approximately 28% of {{the total amount of}} tritium. Layer 2 is below the first layer but above the 26.81 isopycnal and is no longer part of the mixed layer. Its 2 sources are diffusion downward from the mixed layer and lateral expansions outcropping strata (poleward); it contains about 58% of the total tritium. Layer 3 is representative of waters that are <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> outcrop isopycnal and can only receive tritium via vertical diffusion; it contains the remaining 14% of the total tritium.|$|E
50|$|Tectonic {{activity}} in {{the central part of}} the zone is weaker and <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> on <b>the</b> Blanco Ridge.
