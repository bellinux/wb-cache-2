5|$|In the 20th century, {{the city}} opened {{one of the}} first {{commercial}} airports in the world, the precursor of today's Albany International Airport. During the 1920s a powerful political machine controlled by the Democratic Party arose in the state capital, connected to politics in New York City as well.

5|$|The Midwest {{remained}} {{the heartland of}} the Swedish-American community, but its position weakened in the 20th century: in 1910, 54% of the Swedish <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children lived in the Midwest, 15% in industrial areas in the East, and 10% on the West Coast. Chicago was effectively the Swedish-American capital, accommodating about 10% of all Swedish Americans—more than 100,000 people—making it the second-largest Swedish {{city in the world}} (only Stockholm had more Swedish inhabitants).|$|E
5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} that the race was close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, an increasing number of <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E
40|$|This counseling-practice {{oriented}} paper examines clinical {{challenges that}} therapists face {{in working with}} Asian <b>immigrant</b> women <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. Salient Asian cultural factors are discussed to help non-Asian therapists {{gain a better understanding}} of their Asian clients in a therapeutic relationship. A clinical case vignette is incorporated in the paper to illustrate how cultural factors influence Asian <b>immigrant</b> women <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families in therapy. A case-study method was employed in this present study as a method of data collection. The results reflect that cultural competence is greatly needed when working with Asian <b>immigrant</b> women <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families, taking into consideration the systemic nature of this population’s ways handling both individual and familial struggles with mental health issues. Lastly, the paper offers therapists/clinicians culturally sensitive therapeutic assessment and intervention strategies that are deemed effective in working with Asian <b>immigrant</b> women <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families struggling with mental health issues...|$|R

5|$|Canada is a {{multilingual}} {{and multicultural}} society home {{to people of}} many different ethnic, religious and national origins, {{with the majority of}} the population made up of Old World <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the rebellion, the government's National Policy to settle the north-west continued; by 1885, white {{settlers}} became {{the majority in the}} region as the railway brought in <b>immigrants,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> numbers almost doubled {{over the course of the}} 1890s. The establishment of the mounted police was increased to 1,000 men in the aftermath of the rebellion, officially in order to cope with the growing white population, but also to prevent any future uprising by the Métis and First Nations. Levels of crime were initially low, with the police's implementation of the law relatively informal, and focused on upholding the spirit, rather than the letter, of the law, but the force soon faced new challenges as the population grew.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{is home to}} many {{cultures}} and {{a wide variety of}} ethnic groups, traditions, and values. Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.|$|E

40|$|The {{emphasis}} on the individual in Western culture has blinded us to how social relation-ships affect literacy acquisition and, conversely, how literacy transforms these relation-ships. This article deals with the literacy practices, specifically, letter writing, of Lithua-nian immigrants who arrived in the United States during {{the end of the}} 19 th century. For these <b>immigrants,</b> reading <b>and</b> writing were collaborative activities, not the individ-ual, solitary acts that we often assume them naturally to be. Individuals often turned to more literate neighbors for assistance in tasks involving reading and writing, an exten-sion of the concept of talka, the Lithuanian tradition of collective assistance. Parents also frequently engaged the help of sons and, especially, daughters in writing letters to rela-tives in Lithuania. Letter writing thus not only fostered solidarity between <b>immigrant</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> relatives in Lithuania but also between Lithuanian <b>immigrant</b> parents <b>and</b> <b>their</b> increasingly literate, Americanized children...|$|R
5|$|As the 1948 Arab-Israeli War commenced, the neighbourhood's {{location}} between Israeli and Jordanian forces made it {{a combat}} zone, leading to the flight of both Jewish and Arab residents. On May 22, 1948 the US Consul, Thomas C. Wasson, was assassinated shortly after leaving the French Consulate in the Mamilla district. After {{the signing of the}} 1949 Armistice Agreements and division of Jerusalem, the western three-quarters of Mamilla were held by Israel and the eastern quarter became a no man's land of barbed-wire and concrete barricades between Israeli and Jordanian lines. The active and hostile border subjected Mamilla to Jordanian sniper and guerilla attacks, and even stones thrown by Arab Legionnaires from the Old City walls above. The neighbourhood was one of several border areas in the city to experience a sharp decline, and subsequently became home to families of new immigrants with many children and of weak financial abilities, as well as dirty light industry like auto repair. In Mamilla in this period, the residents were primarily Kurdish <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> Israeli children.|$|E
5|$|The Mangalorean Catholics {{constituted}} {{a small community}} widely scattered across the South Canara district. Rather than being a closely knit and united group, the Goan Catholic <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> progeny did not associate with the native Catholics on account of caste, origin, and language, and even among themselves were strongly divided by caste. The Hindus, including the indigenous Brahmins (mostly belonging to the Shivalli, Havyaka, and Kota sub-groups) and Bunts did not associate with the Catholics and would not admit them into their houses on account of their religion. However, a close contact was kept by the Catholics with the Hindus of the same caste who were refugees from Goa. Catholics would invite their Hindu cousins to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings, and funeral feasts. The Hindus accepted such invitations. Unlike his Hindu counterpart, a high-caste Mangalorean Catholic did not consider himself polluted upon physical contact {{with a member of}} the lower caste, but members of different castes did not fraternise or invite each other home for dinner.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservatism}} of the Liberal and Country League did {{not keep}} up with the expectations of a modern-day society. There was dissatisfaction with the restrictive drinking laws; environmentalists campaigned for more natural parks and more 'green' practices; police powers stood strong, 'no loitering' legislation remained in place; gambling was almost completely restricted. The constituents who loudly demanded changes were mostly <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> offspring, used to more libertine conditions in their countries of origin. Their homes, usually built by the Housing Trust, sprawled into 'rural' electoral districts that were controlled by the League. Labor pledged to introduce social legislation to meet their demands; Playford, who did not drink, smoke or gamble, had no interest in doing so. His own candidates knew that the 1965 election would be unwinnable if Playford did not budge. The economy was still going strong and incomes were still increasing, so the Premier did not change his position on social reform.|$|E

Data were collected through survey and interviews. A total number of 170 surveys were analyzed and nine pairs of Chinese <b>Immigrant</b> parents <b>and</b> <b>their</b> high school children were interviewed. The exploration into the participants revealed that Chinese <b>immigrant</b> parents <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children experienced conflicts in education, career choice, and daily behaviors because of cultural differences, different expectations in education and career, language barriers, different ways of thinking, child rebellion, generation gaps, and a lack of communication. These conflicts had made their children unhappy, depressed, angry, and stressed. When confronting conflicts, these parents and children often failed to remain calm or reasonable and tended to argue against each other. In describing an ideal parent-child relationship, almost all parents and children described respect, understanding, and communication as the most important factors...|$|R
5|$|Spokane {{has been}} criticized and {{sometimes}} derided for its lack of diversity and multicultural offerings, but the city has become more diverse in recent decades. People from countries in the former Soviet Union (especially Russians and Ukrainians) form a comparatively large demographic in Spokane and Spokane County, {{the result of a}} large influx of <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991. According to the 2000 Census, the number of people of Russian or Ukrainian ancestry in Spokane County was reported to be 7,700 (4,900 residing in the city of Spokane), amounting to two percent of the county. Among the fastest-growing demographics in Spokane is the Pacific Islander ethnic group, which is estimated to be the third largest minority group in the county, after the Russian and Ukrainian community and Latinos. Spokane was once home to a sizable Asian community, mostly Japanese, centered in a district called Chinatown from the early days of the city until 1974. As in many western railway towns, the Asian community started off as an encampment for migrant laborers working on the railroads. The Chinatown Asian community thrived until the 1940s, after which its population decreased and became integrated and dispersed, losing its Asian character; urban blight and the preparations leading up to Expo '74 led to Chinatown's eventual demolition.|$|E
