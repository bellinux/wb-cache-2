40|$|Abstract. Deep {{excavations}} release stresses in {{the earth}} and redistribute these stresses causing deformation. The pressure loss due to excavation {{may result in a}} base instability, where the soil flow beneath the sheeting into the excavation, producing a rise in the base elevation commonly termed as heave. The heave can lead the <b>foundation</b> <b>piles</b> casted before excavation to floating and being in tension, and even induce the tensile failure of pile in severe case. The characters of <b>foundation</b> <b>piles</b> in different excavation conditions, different location have been analyzed by a case study. The calculation results show that the deeper excavation, the larger vertical force acted on the <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> and the heave could induce the tensile failure of the <b>foundation</b> <b>piles.</b> So it is recommended that the tensile capacity of the <b>foundation</b> <b>piles</b> should be verified when the excavation is very deep...|$|R

50|$|Ground heat {{exchangers}} (GHEs), {{which are also}} called geothermal {{heat exchangers}}, have emerged as a promising and globally accepted way of exploiting shallow geothermal energy, for example ground-coupled heat pumps, ground heat storage. A GHE is essentially a pipe (e.g., U-, W-, or helical-shaped) in a vertical borehole or a <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> of a building, in which a circulating heat-carrying fluid absorbs (or discharges) heat from (or to) the ground.GHEs can have various configurations. This article discusses two kinds of closed loop GHEs, i.e., borehole and <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> GHEs. The borehole type is the most common. It consists {{of one or two}} U-shaped pipes that are inserted into a vertical borehole and connected to a heat pump or a heating system to form a closed loop. A U-shaped channel usually comprises two small-diameter high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes thermally fused to form a U-shaped bend at the bottom. The space between the wall of the borehole and the U-shaped tubes is usually grouted completely with grouting material or, in some cases, partially filled with groundwater. The depth of the hole (generally from 30 m to 200 m) depends strongly on local geological conditions and available drilling equipment.In a <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> GHE (or energy pile), the heat transfer tubes are inside the steel frame of a <b>foundation</b> <b>pile.</b> There are various possible shapes. <b>Foundation</b> <b>piles</b> are usually much shallower than boreholes and have a greater radius. Since energy piles generally require less land area, this technology is evoking increasing interest in the ground-source heat pumps community.|$|R

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} defective piles with stem shrinkage on the working behavior of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> under vertical loadings, a numerical model was set up for the analysis of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations.</b> A series of contrastive analyses were made to a group <b>piled</b> <b>foundations</b> including a <b>pile</b> with defect of stem shrinkage in a shallow or a deeper depth and a <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> with normal <b>piles</b> with a three dimensional nonlinear finite-infinite element method. The basic working behavior of the <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> with a defective pile of stem shrinkage was initially revealed by the results of the analyses; and the basic rules of the affects of pile stem shrinkage defect on the distribution of axial forces among piles and the bending moments in pile caps were obtained. The results of this research are not only helpful for the understanding and rational judgment of the working mechanism, but also of practical importance in the assessment of the bearing behavior of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> including defective <b>piles</b> with stem shrinkage and in the structural designs of piles and pile caps...|$|R

In this study, a finite element analysis has been performed to gain insight into the interactions between integral abutments, approach fills, <b>foundation</b> <b>piles</b> and <b>foundation</b> soils.

40|$|Design {{optimization}} {{is crucial}} {{to the development of the}} offshore wind turbine industry. This time consuming process is better to be done with a number of input parameters that is as short as possible. Whether the <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> part can be neglected in the design optimization process of an offshore wind turbine structure is a question need to be answer. In order to see the importance of the presence of the <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> in dynamic behavior of the whole structure, dimensions of the <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> must be determined basing on requirements in ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state in current design standards. Afterward, the differences in dynamic behavior between a fixed- at-seabed tower model and a tower with foundation model must be observed. Beam nonlinear Winkler Foundation model in addition to gapping and non-gapping behavior in pile-soil interface were used to model the foundation. With the chosen offshore wind turbine project of 7 MW and 115 m high to seabed, a <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> with a penetration length of 26 m, diameter of 6 m and wall thickness of 8 cm had been found. The dynamic behavior of the two models showed that it was not on the safe side if the foundation was neglected in design optimization process. And that the internal damping of the soil was the most important factor in behavior of the structure. These results will be useful for reconsidering parameters in design optimization process of monopile offshore wind turbines as well as choosing suitable methods to solve dynamic equations in the optimization procedure...|$|R

40|$|The {{technology}} of energy piles for heat storage involves turning the concrete piles buried beneath the ground into {{a part of}} the ground-source heat pump system and burying the heat-transfer tubes in the <b>foundation</b> <b>piles,</b> which are regarded as heat transfer wells. The heat transfer tubes are embedded in the concrete <b>foundation</b> <b>piles,</b> destroying the mechanical bearing capacity of the piles and damaging the safety of the buildings. Thus, considering the structural stability and the degree of heat transfer of concrete piles, as well as the selection of material for the <b>foundation</b> <b>piles,</b> the mixing ratio of the material of the energy piles is experimentally studied by the orthogonal method. The optimum mixing ratio of the energy pile is thus obtained. A concrete test block is used to conduct a static load test and splitting test to verify the mixing ratio of the concrete of the energy pile. The results show that steel fiber can be used to enhance the bearing capacity of the storage pile as a reinforcement material. Under a reasonable ratio, the reinforced pile can absolutely meet the original design requirements. Ordinary Portland cement or composite Portland cement can be used as cementitious materials for energy piles. Through an experiment, it is proved that the composite Portland cement can better meet the requirements of the concrete <b>foundation</b> <b>piles</b> than the cementitious material. As thermal conductivity materials, the addition of industrial graphite and scrap copper slag can improve the thermal conductivity of the pile, but it can also reduce the mechanical properties of the pile. It is necessary to control it in a certain range and not to add a large amount of graphite just to improve the thermal conductivity...|$|R
