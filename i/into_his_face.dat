5|$|The Siddheshwara {{temple in}} the Haveri {{district}} has sculptures of deities of multiple faiths. The temple {{may have been}} consecrated first as a Vaishnava temple, later taken over by Jains and eventually becoming a Shaiva temple. The hall in the temple contains sculptures of Uma Mahesvara (Shiva with his consort Uma), Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, Surya (the sun god), Naga-Nagini (the snake goddess), and the sons of Shiva, Ganapati and Kartikeya. Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the damaru (drum), the aksamala (chain of beads) and the trishul (trident) in three arms. His lower left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him with her right arm while gazing <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> The sculpture of Uma is well decorated with garlands, large earrings and curly hair.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Fourth Test, Loxton scored 51 {{and took a}} total of 4/43 in an innings victory over Derbyshire, but was less {{productive}} in his remaining three matches before the Fifth Test, totaling only four wickets and 17 runs in three completed innings. He retained his position for the final Test of the series, but {{had little to do}} in an innings victory. He was only required to bowl two overs in the first innings as the frontline pacemen cut down the hosts for only 52, and then scored 15 in Australia's reply of 389. In the second innings he bowled ten overs without taking a wicket. The Victorian all-rounder was not prominent in his four matches after the Tests, totaling only 112 runs and five wickets. His most successful returns were four wickets for the match in an innings victory over Kent, and a quickfire 67 not out in 75 minutes against the South of England. In the final match of the England leg of the tour—there were two matches in Scotland afterwards—he hit a ball from Freddie Brown <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> breaking his nose, thus forcing him to miss the final two matches in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In April and May 1794, seamen from Agamemnon, led by Nelson, helped {{capture the}} Corsican town of Bastia. The French {{surrendered}} on 21 May, after a 40-day siege. After this action, Agamemnon {{was forced to}} sail to Gibraltar to undergo urgent repairs, the ship having become very worn out after just 16 months at sea, despite having undergone a fairly extensive refit just prior to being recommissioned. Upon completion of her repairs, Agamemnon returned to Corsica, anchoring south of Calvi on 18 June. After Hood arrived with additional ships, Agamemnon contributed guns and men to the 51-day siege of Calvi, during which time Nelson lost the sight in his right eye when a French shot kicked sand and grit <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> The town surrendered on 10 August, Agamemnon having lost six men in the engagement. Shortly thereafter the inhabitants of Corsica declared themselves to be subjects of His Majesty King George III.|$|E

5|$|In {{the tour}} matches, Loxton {{sometimes}} opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller {{to save their}} energy for the Tests, and he occasionally batted above the middle-order. Loxton was the most economical, but the least incisive of the bowlers, and he never took more than three wickets in an innings. He played 22 first-class matches and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three centuries, and took 32 wickets at 21.71. He was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was productive when given an opportunity, ranking fifth in the Australian averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven frontline bowlers ahead of him took at least 50 wickets. Noted for his energetic and combative approach, Loxton was twice forced out of action for his troubles; he pulled a groin while searching for extra pace with the ball early in the tour, and {{towards the end of}} the season, he hit a ball <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and broke his nose.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall then struck Edrich on {{the hand}} with a short ball, {{provoking}} angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton {{found it difficult to}} position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall. The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top-edged <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33. Upon hearing the umpire’s call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} is eight minutes long. Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård plays Gaga's boyfriend. The video {{features}} a murderous plot line involving a doomed starlet who is constantly followed by photographers. The video {{opens with a}} shot of a seaside mansion, where Gaga and her boyfriend are shown lying on a bed talking in Swedish. They move to the balcony and start making out; however, when hidden photographers start taking pictures of them, Gaga realizes that her boyfriend has set the paparazzi to photograph her and tries to stop him. Her struggles nevertheless remain futile even when she punches him, and in a final frantic attempt at defense, she smashes a nearby bottle of liquor <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> The enraged boyfriend throws her over the balcony. Gaga lies {{on the ground in}} her own blood as the photographers continue take pictures of her bloody body and tabloid headlines proclaim that her career is over. According to Rolling Stone this scene pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball, and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. With 22 runs on the board, Johnston bowled Washbrook with a yorker, and six runs later, Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves. Lindwall bowled a series of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman attempted to hook another bouncer, but edged it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting, resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added. They reached lunch at 57/2. Upon the resumption, Crapp began to accelerate, hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson. Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37. Dollery took a single to get off the mark but then missed a yorker from Johnston and was bowled. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. After 170 minutes of slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught behind. At 119/5, Compton returned to the field, his wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. Yardley fell to Toshack for 22 with the score at 141/6, bringing Evans to the crease. Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans to leave England 216/7.|$|E

The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E

25|$|The tour {{ended with}} four more matches and Miller played {{in all of}} them. He scored 17 as Australia reached 8/226 before the match against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's was washed out with not even one innings completed. Johnson had let Miller captain the team in his final {{appearance}} at Lord's but it was marked by a black eye sustained when he edged a bouncer <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> He was eventually out hit wicket.|$|E
25|$|As an officer, Castro was not {{required}} to personally provide fire support to fellow soldiers in the exposed housetop position. Nonetheless, he volunteered for the mission and was accompanied by Sergeant Ralph Porras and Private First Class Justin Dreese. A mortar round landed {{a few feet away}} from him, killing Sergeant Porras and PFC Dreese and severely wounding Castro. Shrapnel tore through his body, damaging a shoulder, breaking an arm, fracturing facial bones and collapsing his lungs. The blast also drove the frame of his protective eyewear <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

She has barely begun her swim when Donati's rotting corpse rises from the water and collides with the nude girl.

He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. He puts on a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated {{into some sort of}} human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
25|$|After marrying, Joseph and Jessie Wilson {{moved to}} the Southern United States in 1851 and came to fully {{identify}} with it, moving from Virginia deeper into the region as Wilson became a minister in Georgia and South Carolina. Joseph Wilson owned slaves, defended slavery, and also set up a Sunday school for his slaves. Both parents identified with the Confederacy during the American Civil War; they cared for wounded soldiers at their church, and Wilson's father briefly served as a chaplain to the Confederate Army. Woodrow Wilson's earliest memory, {{from the age of}} three, was of hearing that Abraham Lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming. Wilson would forever recall standing for a moment at General Robert E. Lee's side and looking up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the discrete dominant periods, small-amplitude stochastic variations are seen.

[...] Nyeeruna generates fire-magic in his right hand (Betelgeuse) {{to gain access to the}} Yugarilya sisters of the Pleiades, but is prevented form doing so by the eldest sister Kambugudha (Hyades), who kicks sand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> causing his fire-magic to dissipate in his humiliation. This is described in the oral tradition as a cyclic process, with Nyeeruna's right hand brightening and fading over time.|$|E
