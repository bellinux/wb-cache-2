5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a <b>double</b> <b>bluff.</b> From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery, which then kept utterly still for a day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib was shocked to find itself being fired on by the massed 'dummy' guns.|$|E
6000|$|Thus this {{remarkable}} system depended for its growth on a <b>double</b> <b>bluff</b> or deception. On {{the one hand}} the laboring classes accepted from ignorance or powerlessness, or were compelled, persuaded, or cajoled by custom, convention, authority, and the well-established order of Society into accepting, {{a situation in which}} they could call their own very little of the cake that they and Nature and the capitalists were co-operating to produce. And on the other hand the capitalist classes were allowed to call {{the best part of the}} cake theirs and were theoretically free to consume it, on the tacit underlying condition that they consumed very little of it in practice. The duty of [...] "saving" [...] became nine-tenths of virtue and the growth of the cake the object of true religion. There grew round the non-consumption of the cake all those instincts of puritanism which in other ages has withdrawn itself from the world and has neglected the arts of production as well as those of enjoyment. And so the cake increased; but to what end was not clearly contemplated. Individuals would be exhorted not so much to abstain as to defer, and to cultivate the pleasures of security and anticipation. Saving was for old age or for your children; but this was only in theory,--the virtue of the cake was that it was never to be consumed, neither by you nor by your children after you.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} {{convergent}} evolution, the thylacine showed many similarities {{to the members}} of the dog family, Canidae, of the Northern Hemisphere: sharp teeth, powerful jaws, raised heels and the same general body form. Since the thylacine filled the same ecological niche in Australia as the dog family did elsewhere, it developed many of the same features. Despite this, it is unrelated to any of the Northern Hemisphere predators. They are easy to tell from a true dog because of the stripes on the back but the skeleton is harder to distinguish. Zoology students at Oxford had to identify 100 zoological specimens as part of the final exam. Word soon got around that, if ever a 'dog' skull was given, it was safe to identify it as Thylacinus on the grounds that anything as obvious as a dog skull had to be a catch.

40|$|The rationalistic {{theories}} of morality emphasize that reasoning {{plays an important}} role in moral judgments and prosocial behavior. Theory of mind as a reasoning ability in the mental domain has been considered a facilitator of moral development. The present study examined whether theory of mind was consistently positively associated with morality from middle childhood to late adulthood. Two hundred four participants, including 48 elementary school children, 45 adolescents, 62 younger adults and 49 older adults, completed theory of mind, moral judgment and prosocial behavior tasks. Theory of mind was measured with strange stories that tapped into an understanding of lies, white lies, <b>double</b> <b>bluffs,</b> irony and persuasion. Moral judgments were measured with variants of the trolley dilemma. Prosocial behavior was measured through participants’ performance in an interactive situation in which a helping request was made. The results indicated specific rather than similar developmental trajectories of theory of mind, moral judgments and prosocial behavior. There was a quadratic trend in theory of mind, a combination of quadratic and cubic trends in deontological moral judgments and a linear decline in helping behavior. It is thus suggested that theory of mind may not be associated with morality in an unchanging way during development. Further results indicated that theory of mind and deontological moral judgments were negatively correlated for children, adolescents and older adults but positively correlated for younger adults. Theory of mind and helping behavior were positively correlated for children but negatively correlated for adolescents. However, the relationships disappeared in adulthood. In sum, the present study reveals that theory of mind may be a nice tool for its facilitation of deontological moral judgments and prosocial behavior, but it may also be a nasty tool for its blocking of deontological moral judgments and prosocial behavior. Moreover, theory of mind may be a permanent tool for moral judgment development but a temporary tool for prosocial behavior development. Thus, the present study enriches the rationalistic {{theories of}} morality from a developmental perspective. Different relationships between theory of mind and morality from middle childhood to late adulthood are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Background: The sociocommunicative {{problems}} in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are traditionally linked to impairments in Theory of Mind (ToM), {{the ability to}} ascribe mental states to others. Although ToM impairments are consistently reported in young children with ASD, findings on more advanced ToM understanding in older individuals with high-functioning ASD (HFASD) are less straightforward. Therefore, we assessed the advanced ToM abilities of a large sample of school-aged children and adolescents with HFASD (n = 194; 6 - 20 years) and compared them to a typically developing (TD) comparison group (n = 60). Methods: Participants' advanced ToM was assessed with five social stories containing second-order false beliefs, display rules, <b>double</b> <b>bluff,</b> faux pas, and sarcasm. Results: Participants with HFASD performed equally well {{on each of the}} ToM stories as their TD peers. Consistent age effects were noticed with adolescents outperforming the children. Furthermore, advanced ToM was positively associated with participants' age, verbal abilities, and general reasoning abilities. Conclusions: Counter to what the ToM theory of ASD would predict, school-aged children and adolescents with HFASD {{seem to be able to}} master the theoretical principles of advanced mental state reasoning. However, they may still fail to apply these theoretical principles during everyday social interactions. © 2012 The Authors...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 University of Washington Abstract Chronology, Lithology and Paleoenvironmental Interpretations of the Penultimate Ice-Sheet Advance {{into the}} Puget Lowland, WA Kathy Goetz Troost Chair of Supervisory Committee: Dr. Derek B. Booth Earth and Spaces Sciences Stratigraphic {{nomenclature}} and chronology {{has been a}} problem for geologists seeking to understand the Quaternary history of the Puget Lowland of Washington State for over one hundred years. Accurate identification of deposits, and accurate age assignments for those deposits, can help us to better understand the paleoclimate of the region, the physical characteristics of deposits encountered during infrastructure projects, the timing of tectonic deformation and recent seismicity, and our geological history. Each of these has profound consequences on our daily lives. In this dissertation I have established a stratigraphic framework for the last million years of geologic history in the Puget Lowland, based on global climate patterns, abundant new absolute dates, and detailed mapping that synthesizes my work and the work of others over the last century. Two decades of detailed field mapping, absolute and relative dating, and analyses have identified new geologic units and clarified and expanded our understanding of many others that had been previously identified but imprecisely described or understood. The techniques I have made use of include luminescence dating, paleomagnetic correlations, radiocarbon dating, fission-track and Ar/Ar dating, palynology, macrofossil identification, provenance, and field-measured sections. My data suggest that the Vashon stade (representing the regional advance of the Marine Isotope Stage 2 ice sheet) ended quite abruptly, nearly simultaneously in the north and south Lowland. The prior MIS 4 ice sheet advance, named the “Possession glaciation,” was of similar extent to that of the Vashon stade, extending to within about 25 km of the Vashon limit. MIS 4 fine-grained glacial deposits are abundant in the Puget Lowland. The Whidbey Formation (MIS 5) and <b>Double</b> <b>Bluff</b> Drift (MIS 6), previously recognized only north of Seattle, have now been newly identified in the southern Puget Lowland, over 60 km from their type section on Whidbey Island. Newly identified stratigraphic units include deposits from the MIS 7 interglacial period, informally named the “Hamm Creek formation” for 200 -ka pumice deposits in Seattle; deposits from the MIS 8 glacial period, collectively named the “Defiance drift”; and the “Gig Harbor gravel,” which may be part of MIS 8 or even older. In addition, reversely magnetized deposits, assumed to be older than 780 ka based on limiting luminescence ages, have been identified in multiple locations along the Tacoma and Gig Harbor coastline. Many unconformities exist in the Pleistocene record of the Puget Lowland, making stratigraphic correlation difficult even with absolute dating. Each time-stratigraphic unit is an unconformity-bounded sequence with widely distributed but discontinuous deposits. Glaciotectonic and tectonic discontinuities further confound correlations. With diligence and knowledge, however, we can continue to improve our geologic understanding. Society’s future economic progress and human well-being in the Puget Lowland region depends in large measure on our ability to predict and plan for global climate changes, geologic hazards, and the complexity of the ground beneath us. Understanding the relatively recent geologic history of the region, of which this dissertation is a contribution, is a necessary step in that process...|$|E
