5|$|The Egyptian {{identification}} card controversy {{began in the}} 1990s when the government modernized the <b>electronic</b> <b>processing</b> of identity documents, which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bahá'ís were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national {{identification card}}s, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle. Without documents, {{they could not be}} employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships. Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list a dash in place of one of the three recognized religions. The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís under the new decree on 8 August 2009.|$|E

40|$|The {{tremendous}} impact of <b>electronic</b> data <b>processing</b> {{on the lives}} of the American people is being felt in every segment of our economy. Regardless of the area of activity, be it business, education, government, industry, or the service areas, <b>electronic</b> data <b>processing</b> is performing an increasingly· important function. The volume of paper work, the magnitude of government reports, and the demands of management for information, have created mammoth challenges for <b>electronic</b> data <b>processing.</b> These challenges are complex.

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1928 that Geiger and Walther Müller (a PhD student of Geiger) {{developed}} the sealed Geiger-Müller tube which developed the basic ionization principles previously used experimentally. This was relatively small and rugged, and could not only detect alpha and beta radiation such as prior models but also gamma radiation. Now a practical radiation instrument could be produced relatively cheaply, and so the Geiger-Muller counter was born. As the tube output required little <b>electronic</b> <b>processing,</b> a distinct advantage in the thermionic valve era due to minimal valve count and low power consumption, the instrument achieved great popularity as a portable radiation detector.|$|E
25|$|After Twitch, Jourgensen {{made the}} most {{significant}} change in Ministry's history when he resumed playing electric guitar. Jourgensen also brought bass guitarist Paul Barker of the Seattle band The Blackouts into the Ministry camp; Barker would remain Jourgensen's bandmate for many years {{when he was the}} only person credited {{as a member of the}} band other than Jourgensen. With the addition of The Blackouts drummer William Rieflin, Ministry recorded The Land of Rape and Honey (1988). The album continued their success in the underground music scene. The Land of Rape and Honey made use of synthesizers, keyboards, tape loops, jackhammering drum machines, dialogue excerpted from movies, unconventional <b>electronic</b> <b>processing,</b> and, in parts, heavy distorted electric guitar and bass.|$|E
