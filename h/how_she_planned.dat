They cared for wounded {{soldiers}} in a private hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo. According to Vyrubova, [...] "Tatiana was almost as skillful and devoted as her mother, and complained only that on account of her youth she was spared some of the more trying cases." [...] Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, who worked with her at the hospital, described in her journal <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> to boil silk while Tatiana was otherwise occupied, fearing that Tatiana would be too tired to help her. But Tatiana guessed what Chebotareva was doing. [...] "Why can you breathe carbolic acid and I can't?" [...] she asked Chebotareva and insisted on helping her with the work. In September 1914, she was named patron of a war aid committee known simply as the Tatiana Committee. Tatiana was strongly patriotic and apologized in a 29 October 1914 letter for saying something negative about the Germans in her mother's presence. She explained that she forgot her mother had been born in Germany because she thought of Alexandra as only Russian. The Tsarina responded that she did feel completely Russian and Tatiana had not hurt her feelings with her sharp words, but Alexandra was hurt by the actions of her former countrymen and by the gossip she heard about her own German connections.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{documents}} {{that support the}} fact that in this critical situation, Maria Feodorovna was involved in a planned coup d'état to depose her son from the throne in order to save the monarchy. The plan was reportedly for Maria to make a final ultimatum to the Tsar to banish Rasputin unless he wished for her to leave the capital, which would be the signal to unleash the coup. [...] Exactly <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> to replace her son is unconfirmed, but two versions are available: first, that Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia would take power in her name, and that she herself would thereafter become ruling empress; the other version further claims that Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia would replace the Tsar with his son, the heir to the throne, Maria's grandson Alexey, upon which Maria and Paul Alexandrovich would share power as regents during his minority. Maria was asked to make her appeal to the Tsar after Empress Alexandra had asked the Tsar to dismiss minister Polianov. Initially, she refused to make the appeal, and her sister-in-law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna stated to the French Ambassador: “It’s not want of courage or inclination that keeps her back. It's better that she don’t. She’s too outspoken and imperious. The moment she starts to lecture her son, her feelings run away with her; she sometimes says the exact opposite of what she should; she annoys and humiliates him. Then he stands on his dignity and reminds his mother he is the emperor. They leave each other in a rage.” [...] Eventually, she was however convinced to make the appeal. Reportedly, Empress Alexandra was informed about the planned coup, and when Maria Feodorovna made the ultimatum to the Tsar, the empress convinced him to order his mother to leave the capital.|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, the {{interactive}} whiteboard (IWB) {{has become a}} relatively common educational tool in Western schools. The IWB is essentially a large touch screen, that enables the user to interact with digital content {{in ways that are}} not possible with an ordinary computer-projector-canvas setup. However, the unique possibilities of IWBs are rarely leveraged to enhance teaching and learning beyond the primary school level. This is particularly noticeable in high school physics. We describe how a high school physics teacher learned to use an IWB in a new way, <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> and implemented a lesson on the topic of orbital motion of planets, and what tensions arose in the process. We used an ethnographic approach to account for the teacher’s and involved students’ perspectives throughout the process of teacher preparation, lesson planning, and the implementation of the lesson. To interpret the data, we used the conceptual framework of activity theory. We found that an entrenched culture of traditional white/blackboard use in physics instruction interferes with more technologically innovative and more student-centered instructional approaches that leverage the IWB’s unique instructional potential. Furthermore, we found that the teacher’s confidence in the mastery of the IWB plays {{a crucial role in the}} teacher’s willingness to transfer agency within the lesson to the students...|$|E

Clarkson's always-powerful voice still sets her apart from the club-pop pack. If there's a whiff of lite-FM maturity, it feels earned." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Popcrush gave the song three and a half stars out of five, she wrote: [...] "It’s her voice and the undulating beat that make this song a toe-tapper from the opening note to the closing one. The organic tone of Clarkson’s voice is what prevents the song from sounding too [...] "synthy" [...] or studio-created, which is often an issue with pop songs. There is no trickery here; it's all Clarkson being a vocal diva." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy remarked, [...] "As you might expect, [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] is a sunny, synth-laden pop jam that showcases Kelly's unreal set of pipes, and speaks to the difficulties that come with staying in the record industry." [...] Bené Viera of VH1 remarked, [...] "The song is celebratory in that it acknowledges she’s going to live her life the way that makes her happy. Her voice flows from a leveled alto to a high near-scream for the chorus." [...] On March 5, 2013, Billboard ranked the song #49 in its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time.|$|R
