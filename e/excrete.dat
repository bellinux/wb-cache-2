5|$|There are two kidneys located dorsally, {{near the}} roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of {{metabolic}} waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians <b>excrete</b> the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, <b>excrete</b> the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water <b>excrete</b> most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to ammonia {{and dump}} it via their gills, and <b>excrete</b> other wastes as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they <b>excrete</b> as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and Cylindraspis tortoises to eat palm fruits and <b>excrete</b> their seeds, which became food for the parrots. Anodorhynchus macaws depended on now-extinct South American megafauna in the same way, but now rely on domesticated cattle for this service.|$|E
5000|$|Roughly [...] of an oral dose of {{nitazoxanide}} is <b>excreted</b> as its metabolites in feces, {{while the}} remainder of the dose <b>excreted</b> in urine. Tizoxanide is <b>excreted</b> in the urine, bile and feces. Tizoxanide glucuronide is <b>excreted</b> in urine and bile.|$|R
50|$|After {{administration}} of ibutilide, it is quickly <b>excreted</b> by renal pathway with a half-life of approximately 6 hours. Approximately 82% of a 0.01 mg/kg dose is <b>excreted</b> {{in the urine}} during the trial. Among those, around 7% is <b>excreted</b> as unchanged drug. The reminder of the drug is <b>excreted</b> in feces (about 19%).|$|R
50|$|In humans, the {{metabolites}} mostly <b>excreted</b> in the bile, {{with only}} a small amount being <b>excreted</b> in the urine (less than 1%) and feces. In ruminants, however, 60-70% of the metabolites are <b>excreted</b> in the urine.|$|R
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and <b>excrete</b> it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also <b>excrete</b> creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Nutrients are transported {{throughout}} the coelom, including the mantle lobes, by cilia. The wastes produced by metabolism are broken into ammonia, which is eliminated by diffusion through the mantle and lophophore. Brachiopods have metanephridia, {{used by many}} phyla to <b>excrete</b> ammonia and other dissolved wastes. However, brachiopods have {{no sign of the}} podocytes, which perform the first phase of excretion in this process, and brachiopod metanephridia appear to be used only to emit sperm and ova.|$|E
5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and <b>excrete</b> waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E
50|$|A {{few minutes}} after ingestion, {{strychnine}} is <b>excreted</b> unchanged in the urine, and accounts for about 5 to 15% of a sublethal dose given over 6 hours. Approximately 10 to 20% of the dose will be <b>excreted</b> unchanged in the urine in the first 24 hours. The percentage <b>excreted</b> decreases with the increasing dose. Of the amount <b>excreted</b> by the kidneys, about 70% is <b>excreted</b> in the first 6 hours, and almost 90% in the first 24 hours. Excretion is virtually complete in 48 to 72 hours.|$|R
50|$|Alfaxalone {{is mostly}} <b>excreted</b> in the urine, though some is <b>excreted</b> in the bile as well.|$|R
5000|$|Elimination {{half-life}} in rats is 3.15 h for plasma, 4.07 h for liver, and 7.07 h for kidney. [...] However, FB1 {{is rapidly}} <b>excreted</b> mostly {{in its original}} form. Small amounts are <b>excreted</b> in urine; the most are <b>excreted</b> in feces.|$|R
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must <b>excrete</b> the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|All baleen {{whales are}} carnivorous; however a 2015 study {{revealed}} they house gut flora {{similar to that}} of terrestrial herbivores. Different kinds of prey are found in different abundances depending on location, and each type of whale is adapted to a specialized way of foraging. There are two types of feeding behaviors: skim-feeding and lunge-feeding, but some species do both depending on the type and amount of food. For example, Antarctic whales mostly feed on euphausiids; however, this is mainly effective for lunge-feeders, whereas skim-feeders, like the right whales, feed primarily on copepods. They feed alone or in small groups. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food, and their kidneys <b>excrete</b> excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can <b>excrete</b> excess salt.|$|E

50|$|Dibenzofuran is <b>excreted</b> 22% {{the daily}} intake of dioxins from meals is <b>excreted</b> from feces and 29% from sebum.|$|R
50|$|S. helianthus <b>excretes</b> stichodactyla toxin. It is {{believed}} that it <b>excretes</b> toxins mainly to protect itself from the spiny lobster.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to <b>excrete</b> large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to <b>excrete</b> soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The {{reason may be that}} osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} has a {{metabolic}} rate {{two or three}} times that of comparatively sized terrestrial mammals. It must eat an estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food each day to burn the calories necessary to counteract the loss of heat due to the cold water environment. Its digestive efficiency is estimated at 80 to 85%, and food is digested and passed in as little as three hours. Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater. Its relatively large kidneys enable it to derive fresh water from sea water and <b>excrete</b> concentrated urine.|$|E

50|$|HMB is {{eliminated}} via the kidneys, with roughly 10-40% of an ingested dose being <b>excreted</b> unchanged in urine. The remaining 60-90% of the dose is retained in tissues or <b>excreted</b> as HMB metabolites. The {{fraction of a}} given dose of HMB that is <b>excreted</b> unchanged in urine increases with the dose.|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that after injection of radioactive vitamin B 12 in man, {{there is a}} close correlation {{between the amount of}} radioactivity <b>excreted</b> and the amount of assayable vitamin B 12 <b>excreted,</b> and thus that the amount of radioactivity <b>excreted</b> is a true measure of the vitamin B 12 <b>excreted.</b> The possible reasons for this occurrence are discussed and it is suggested that in the body vitamin B 12 does not exist as such but as an analogue or active derivative...|$|R
5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water <b>excrete</b> the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E
5|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper {{at a level of}} about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to <b>excrete</b> some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E
5|$|Humans in {{good health}} <b>excrete</b> urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E
50|$|In healthy volunteers, 1.0 to 3.5% of an {{administered}} dose was <b>excreted</b> unchanged in the urine. The metabolites {{also are}} <b>excreted</b> unchanged in the urine.|$|R
50|$|Thiophene-2-carboxylic acid is {{the final}} major {{metabolic}} product. It is very hydrophilic and is <b>excreted</b> in urine. Methiopropamine and especially thiopropamine are also <b>excreted</b> renally, unchanged.|$|R

Vanillyl alcohol {{was found to be}} <b>excreted</b> during growth on vanillin. Several other intermediates like cis,cis-muconate, catechol, vanillate and 4 -hydroxybenzoate from the known bacterial catabolic pathways were <b>excreted</b> during growth on the model compounds.|$|R
5|$|Most spiders convert {{nitrogenous}} {{waste products}} into uric acid, {{which can be}} excreted as a dry material. Malphigian tubules ("little tubes") extract these wastes from the blood in the hemocoel and dump them into the cloacal chamber, from which they are expelled through the anus. Production of uric acid and its removal via Malphigian tubules are a water-conserving feature that has evolved independently in several arthropod lineages that can live far away from water, for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely {{different parts of the}} embryo. However, a few primitive spiders, the sub-order Mesothelae and infra-order Mygalomorphae, retain the ancestral arthropod nephridia ("little kidneys"), which use large amounts of water to <b>excrete</b> nitrogenous waste products as ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and <b>excrete</b> the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{mangrove}} trees {{exist in the}} region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves <b>excrete</b> salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges.|$|E
5000|$|Nitrogenous Excretory Products: Mainly {{three types}} of {{nitrogenous}} waste is <b>excreted</b> by living organisms; ammonia is a characteristics of aquatic life form, urea is formed by the land and water dwellers, uric acid is <b>excreted</b> by terrestrial life forms. A frog, in its tadpole stage <b>excretes</b> ammonia just like a fish. When it turns into an adult frog and moves to land, it <b>excretes</b> urea instead of ammonia. Thus an aquatic ancestry to land animal is established. [...] A chick on up to its 5th day of development <b>excretes</b> ammonia; from its 5th to 9th day, urea; and thereafter, uric acid. Based on these findings, Baldwin sought a biochemical recapitulation {{in the development of}} vertebrates with reference to nitrogenous excretory products.|$|R
50|$|After an oral dose, about 70% of {{the drug}} is <b>excreted</b> from the body within 24 hours. About 19% of that is <b>excreted</b> as the unmetabolised drug and the rest as various metabolites.|$|R
25|$|Nitrogenous {{waste is}} <b>excreted</b> {{in the form}} of ammonia through the body wall, and is not {{associated}} with any specific organs. However, the structures for <b>excreting</b> salt to maintain osmoregulation are typically more complex.|$|R
