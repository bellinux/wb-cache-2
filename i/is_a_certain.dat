5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, {{large areas of}} shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues and the end products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> critical size (about 0.5mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks does not occur and this provides a minimum size for sand grains.|$|E
5|$|Noisy {{binary search}} {{algorithms}} solve {{the case where}} the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array. For each pair of elements, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls {{the reliability of the}} yielded position. The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Alexandre Baudrimont's 40-page study Vocabulaire de la langue des Bohémiens habitant {{les pays}} basques français of 1862, the most {{extensive}} of the early accounts, covers both vocabulary and aspects of grammar. He worked with two female informants, {{a mother and her}} daughter from the Uhart-Mixe area near Saint-Palais, whom he describes as highly fluent. Unfortunately, he was only able to conduct a single session as the women were then told not to cooperate further for the fear of outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> degree of confusion in Baudrimont's publication—he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct forms were elicited. For example, most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack the verbal -tu ending and appear to be participles.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, Ua Conchobair {{convened a}} great assembly at Athboy. The Annals of the Four Masters states that 13,000 horsemen attended the meeting—1,000 {{of which were}} supplied from Dublin. One of the many rulers recorded to have attended this gathering <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> Ragnall mac Ragnaill, styled tigerna Gall ("lord of the foreigners"). The latter's name and title suggest that he was either an otherwise unattested brother of Ascall, or else an annalist's mistake for Ascall himself. Meanwhile, after his expulsion from Ireland, Mac Murchada sought out Henry on the Continent, and gained permission to recruit military aid from the latter's subjects. In the autumn of 1167, Mac Murchada and his English allies arrived in Ireland, where they established themselves at Ferns. Ua Conchobair responded by penetrating Uí Chennselaig in a campaign, recounted by the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach, that included military support from Dublin. With Mac Murchada temporally kept in check, a preoccupied Ua Conchobair allowed him to hold onto {{at least part of}} his patrimony.|$|E

Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing {{what it is like to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it is like to have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it is like to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it is like to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> F <b>is</b> recommended...|$|R

25|$|If an {{observable}} {{is measured}} {{and the result}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenvector {{is the state of}} the system immediately after the measurement. The act of measurement in matrix mechanics 'collapses' the state of the system. If one measures two observables simultaneously, the state of the system collapses to a common eigenvector of the two observables. Since most matrices don't have any eigenvectors in common, most observables can never be measured precisely at the same time. This is the uncertainty principle.|$|E
