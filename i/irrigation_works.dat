5|$|Most {{settlements}} in ancient Egypt were {{situated on the}} alluvium of the Nile floodplain. This moist environment was unfavorable for long-term preservation of papyrus documents. Archaeologists have discovered a larger quantity of papyrus documents in desert settlements on land elevated above the floodplain, and in settlements that lacked <b>irrigation</b> <b>works,</b> such as Elephantine, El-Lahun, and El-Hiba.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the kingdom}} was {{largely based on}} agriculture, the {{construction}} of <b>irrigation</b> <b>works</b> was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water supply in the dry zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably Vasabha and Mahasena, built large reservoirs and canals, which created a vast and complex irrigation network in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are {{an indication of the}} advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at Sigiriya; the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavana stupas, and other large stupas; large buildings like the Lovamahapaya; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks demonstrating the Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{archaeologists have}} {{unearthed}} Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia {{in the north}} to Yunnan in the south. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for tillage, the hoe for weeding, the rake for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen. Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron seed drill (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of casting them out by hand. While artwork of the Wei (220–265 CE) and Jin (265–420 CE) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25–220 CE). <b>Irrigation</b> <b>works</b> for agriculture included the use of water wells, artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and sluice gates.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt {{led to the}} {{tightening}} of Umayyad control over Iraq. Al-Hajjaj founded a permanent garrison for the Syrian troops at Wasit, situated between Basra and Kufa, and the Iraqis, regardless of social status, were deprived of any real power in the governance of the region. This was coupled with a reform of the salary (ʿaṭāʾ) system by al-Hajjaj: whereas hitherto the salary had been calculated based {{on the role of}} one's ancestors in the early Muslim conquests, it now became limited to those actively participating in campaigns. As most of the army was now composed of Syrians, this measure gravely injured the interests of the Iraqis, who regarded this as another impious attack on hallowed institutions. In addition, extensive land reclamation and <b>irrigation</b> <b>works</b> were undertaken in lower Iraq (the Sawad), but this was limited mostly to around Wasit, and the proceeds went to the Umayyads and their clients, not the Iraqi nobility. As a result, the political power of the once mighty Kufan élites was soon broken.|$|E

40|$|A {{general plan}} for the {{scientific}} investigation of the laws governing plant production as influenced by the application of irrigation water, was outlined in 1900 by Dr. John A. Widtsoe as Director of the Utah Experiment Station. The detailed plans were prepared by {{the heads of the}} Chemical, Agronomy and Irrigation Department, under whose cooperation the work was to be carried on. In 1903 the Office of Experiment Stations of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, by contributing funds to this work, became a party to the experiments. Since then the investigations have been under the joint supervision of the State and Federal governments. In the spring of 1906, the State Engineer, Hon. Caleb Tanner, became a party to the <b>irrigation</b> <b>work</b> in Morgan and Weber counties. During the season of 1904 the Drainage Expert of the Office of Experiment Stations and the Irrigation Engineer of the State Station made investigations upon the requirements for drainage throughout Utah, and during the same fall installed a drainage experiment in Cache County. As a result of the investigations and the favorable outlook for the drainage work instituted, it was decided to undertake drainage experiments in addition to <b>irrigation</b> <b>work.</b> During the past two years drainage has been {{an important part of the}} investigations of the Experiment Station...|$|R
25|$|Accounts of the Indus valley {{from the}} times of Alexander's {{campaign}} indicate a healthy forest cover in the region, which has now considerably receded. The Mughal Emperor Babur writes of encountering rhinoceroses along its bank in his memoirs (the Baburnama). Extensive deforestation and human interference in {{the ecology of the}} Shivalik Hills has led to a marked deterioration in vegetation and growing conditions.

25|$|These radically harmful {{changes in}} farming {{organization}} coincided with adverse weather patterns, including droughts and floods. In July 1959, the Yellow River flooded in East China. According to the Disaster Center, the flood directly killed, either through starvation from crop failure or drowning, an estimated 2 million people, while other areas were affected in other ways as well. Frank Dikötter argues that most floods were not due to unusual weather, but to massive, poorly planned and poorly executed <b>irrigation</b> <b>works</b> which {{were part of the}} Great Leap Forward.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>irrigation</b> <b>works</b> {{undertaken}} during East India Company's rule were {{begun in}} 1817. Consisting chiefly of extensions or reinforcements of previous Indian works, these projects {{were limited to}} the plains north of Delhi and to the river deltas of the Madras Presidency. A small dam in the Kaveri river delta, built some 1,500 years before, and known as the Grand Anicut, was one such indigenous work in South India. In 1835–36, Sir Arthur Cotton successfully reinforced the dam, and his success prompted more irrigation projects on the river. A little farther north, on the Tungabhadra river, the 16th century Vijayanagara ruler, Krishna Deva Raya, had constructed several weirs; these too would be extended under British administration.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Ministry of Water Resources, {{which had}} been part of the Ministry of Agriculture for a period until 2010, is {{responsible}} for large water resources development projects and water allocation between states. There are 12 River Basin Development Authorities under the Ministry, responsible for planning and developing water resources, <b>irrigation</b> <b>work</b> and the collection of hydrological, hydro-geological data. They also provide water in bulk to cities from dams. A Utilities Charges Commission was established in 1992 to monitor and regulate utility tariffs, including those of State Water Agencies.|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} no villages at {{the territory of}} the reserve; however, in the past it was populated, and the last village existed until World War II.

Small-scale timber production was continuing after the war as well, but the area was too remote to support the settlements. No <b>irrigation</b> <b>work</b> has ever been performed in the area, and the raised bogs remain intact. In 1994, both Rdeysky and Polistovsky Nature Reserves were established to protect the area.|$|R

25|$|The successors of Jayavarman II {{continually}} {{extended the}} territory of Kambuja. Indravarman I (reigned 877– 889) managed to expand the kingdom without wars, and he began extensive building projects, thanks to the wealth gained through trade and agriculture. Foremost were the temple of Preah Ko and <b>irrigation</b> <b>works.</b> Indravarman I developed Hariharalaya further by constructing Bakong circa 881. Bakong in particular bears striking similarity to the Borobudur temple in Java, which strongly suggests that it served as the prototype for Bakong. There must have been exchanges of travellers, if not missions, between the Khmer kingdom and the Sailendras in Java, transmitting to Cambodia not only ideas, but also technical and architectural details.|$|E
25|$|Born {{the son of}} Major Charles Frederick Napier, who {{was wounded}} at the {{storming}} of Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara) in Java on (26 August 1810) and died some months later, and Catherine Napier (née Carrington), Napier was educated at Addiscombe Military Seminary before being commissioned into the Bengal Engineers on 15 December 1826. He attended the Royal Engineer Establishment at Chatham with the rank of ensign from 7 June 1827 before being promoted to lieutenant on 28 September 1827 and being sent to India in November 1828. After commanding a company at Delhi, he was employed in the <b>irrigation</b> <b>works</b> of the Public Works Department until 1836 {{when he returned to}} England for leave on account of his poor health.

25|$|Until {{modern times}} {{there was no}} clear {{distinction}} between civil engineering and architecture, and the term engineer and architect were mainly geographical variations referring to the same occupation, and often used interchangeably. The construction of pyramids in Egypt (circa 2700–2500 BC) {{were some of the}} first instances of large structure constructions. Other ancient historic civil engineering constructions include the Qanat water management system (the oldest is older than 3000 years and longer than 71km,) the Parthenon by Iktinos in Ancient Greece (447–438 BC), the Appian Way by Roman engineers (c. 312 BC), the Great Wall of China by General Meng T'ien under orders from Ch'in Emperor Shih Huang Ti (c. 220 BC) and the stupas constructed in ancient Sri Lanka like the Jetavanaramaya and the extensive <b>irrigation</b> <b>works</b> in Anuradhapura. The Romans developed civil structures throughout their empire, including especially aqueducts, insulae, harbors, bridges, dams and roads.|$|E
50|$|Early Polynesian {{settlers}} {{brought along}} with them clothing, plants and livestock and established settlements along the coasts and larger valleys. Upon their arrival, the settlers grew kalo (taro), maia (banana), niu (coconut), and ulu (breadfruit). Meats were eaten less often than fruits, vegetables, and seafood. Some did import and raise pua'a (pork), moa (chicken), and ʻīlio (poi dog). Popular condiments included pa'akai (salt), ground kukui nut, limu (seaweed), and ko (sugarcane) which was used as both a sweet and a medicine. The non-native species may have caused various birds, plants and land snails to go extinct. Estuaries were adapted to fishing ponds (aquaculture). <b>Irrigation</b> <b>work</b> was also used to farm taro.|$|R
