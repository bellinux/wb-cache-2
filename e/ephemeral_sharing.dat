40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the need for}} ephemeral file sharing in proximity networks and explores the necessary requirements that a mobile distributed file system (M-DFS) should satisfy in order to operate properly under typical conditions of such networks. We chose an M-DFS design based on the widely deployed NFS because of its ease of portability, lightweight model and its use {{in the past as}} a basis for building distributed file systems. To identify NFS shortcomings in proximity networks using Bluetooth and 802. 11, we measured its performance under various bandwidth and delay combinations, network disconnections, low signal reception zones and in the presence of packet loss. Based on our observations, we present some proposals for the design of an M-DFS suitable for <b>ephemeral</b> <b>sharing</b> and describe a possible prototype implementation using an NFS loopback server approach.

30|$|<b>Ephemeral</b> {{information}} <b>sharing,</b> especially photo sharing, {{which allows}} a user to share photos in an ephemeral way choosing {{to have the}} photos disappear after a preset interval, has become increasingly popular.

Examples of such applications include the most famous Snapchat [5], Yovo [6], Privately [7] and Dstrux [8]. However, most current solutions to <b>ephemeral</b> photo <b>sharing</b> rely on a secure server to store the original image data and to enforce the access control.

40|$|Abstract. Low-latency key {{exchange}} (LLKE) protocols {{allow for}} the transmission of cryptographically protected payload data without re-quiring the prior exchange of messages of a cryptographic key exchange protocol, while providing perfect forward secrecy. The LLKE concept was first realized by Google in the QUIC protocol, and a low-latency mode is currently under discussion for inclusion in TLS 1. 3. In LLKE two keys are generated, typically using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The first key {{is a combination of}} an <b>ephemeral</b> client <b>share</b> and a long-lived server share. The second key is computed using an <b>ephemeral</b> server <b>share</b> and the same <b>ephemeral</b> client <b>share.</b> In this paper, we propose (relatively) simple, novel security models, which catch the intuition behind known LLKE protocols; namely that the first (respectively, second) key should remain indistinguishable from a random value, even if the second (respectively, first) key is revealed. We call this property strong key independence. We also give the first constructions of LLKE which are provably secure in these models, based on the generic assumption that secure non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) exists...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a lattice attack on DSA-like signature schemes {{under the assumption}} that implicit information on the ephemeral keys is known. Inspired by the implicit oracle of May and Ritzenhofen presented in the context of RSA (PKC 2009), we assume that the <b>ephemeral</b> keys <b>share</b> a certain amount of bits without knowing the value of the shared bits. This work also extends results of Leadbitter, Page and Smart (CHES 2004) which use a very similar type of partial information leakage. By eliminating the shared blocks of bits between the ephemeral keys, we provide lattices of small dimension (e. g. equal to the number of signatures) and thus obtain an efficient attack. More precisely, by using the LLL algorithm, the complexity of the attack is polynomial. We show that this method can work when <b>ephemeral</b> keys <b>share</b> certain amount of MSBs and/or LSBs, as well as contiguous blocks of shared bits in the middle. Under the Gaussian heuristic assumption, theoretical bounds on the number of shared bits in function of the number of signed messages are proven. Experimental results show that we are often able to go a few bits beyond the theoretical bound. For instance, if only 2 shared LSBs on each ephemeral keys of 200 signed messages (with no knowledge about the secret key) then the attack reveals the secret key. The success rate of this attack is about 90 % when only 1 LSB is <b>shared</b> on each <b>ephemeral</b> keys associated with about 400 signed messages...|$|R

Introduction In our enlightened age of public-key cryptography, passwords are still used everywhere, and people still can't remember passwords large enough to use as ordinary encryption keys. Dictionary attacks against many methods, including Kerberos [BM 89], are often taken for granted, and the concept of "good" and "bad" passwords is part of computer security folklore. What is often overlooked is that the quality of a password is largely determined by strength of the verification method. A bank teller machine uses a 4 -digit password in a strong way. Since the early 1990 's, the discovery of strong methods permits easily-memorized passwords to be verified over an insecure network, without using additional keys, and without fear of network dictionary attack. We describe new and modified protocols in this class, that verify a potentially low-entropy shared secret, and protect it as much as possible; The secret is not revealed to anyone who doesn't already have it. Our goal is also to gracefully handle passwords of large-entropy too. When considering theft of a host-stored hashed-password database, large passwords still provide more security than small, but strong methods don't fall to network attack when password entropy is less than optimal...|$|R

While such means are essential to overcome distances, using infrastructure services for location-based services may not be desirable. In this paper, we analyze a fully distributed variant of an <b>ephemeral</b> content <b>sharing</b> service, solely dependent on the mobile devices in the vicinity using principles of opportunistic networking. The net result is a best effort service for floating content in which: 1) information dissemination is geographically limited; 2) the lifetime and spreading of information depends on interested nodes being available; 3) content can only be created and distributed locally; and 4) content can only be added, but not explicitly deleted. First we present our system design and summarize its analytical modeling. Then we perform extensive evaluation for a map-based mobility model in downtown Helsinki to assess the operational range for floating content, which, {{at the same time}} also validate the analytical results obtained for a more abstract model of the system.

We present the general model for floating content and results from our on-going evaluation. Our results show that floating content systems are feasible in scenarios which correspond to typical urban settings, in terms of number of nodes and their density, node mobility, and device capabilities...|$|R
30|$|The GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) sector often {{deals with}} high-value digital art reproductions. In this domain, {{it is crucial}} that such {{artefacts}} can be protected, both in an active as well as in a passive way. For example, correct IPR signalling is paramount. It is a common practice to embed IPR information within the image metadata. However, currently, the information is not always embedded in a uniform way. This situation makes it complicated for applications to inform their users in a clear and consistent way. In addition, active protection is sometimes desired. For example, some metadata might only be accessible to certain users, or similar to the <b>ephemeral</b> photo <b>sharing</b> use case, a visual watermark can be added that can only be removed after proper authentication. GLAM Institutions might have within their collections images carrying ‘privacy-sensitive’ information, such as photographic material of identifiable individuals. For the exploitation of these images, the relevant legal framework concerning privacy and data protection must be taken into account. Finally, integrity and authenticity check should allow sharing as a trusted source as well as identification of potential modifications made to an artefact. An example framework targeting these scenarios is elaborated in the Section ‘IPR management for GLAM sector’ under ‘Example Applications’.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{dramatic}} progress on the enabling technologies for workstation-based multimedia teleconferencing applications. We expect that such applications will soon become an important component of many future social and business interactions. Teleconferencing applications have aspects of their state, such as membership, types of media being used, and encryption, that are under joint control. Much of this state is ephemeral, in that it is of importance only for the duration of a session, and does not have importance outside of the session itself. In this paper we focus on the specification and realization of policies for managing this <b>shared</b> <b>ephemeral</b> teleconferencing state. We first define a broad family of policies which has three dimensions: initiation, voting, and consistency. We then present a mechanism that implements this family of policies for two different communication models. 1 Introduction There has been much work in recent years on workstation-based [...] ...|$|R
3000|$|A {{simple way}} for the base station to deliver the root key to a {{particular}} target sensor node would be for it to use the target's public key to encrypt the root key. However, this is susceptible to capture and replay by an adversary at a later time, potentially allowing the attacker to revert the sensor nodes to an earlier code image. To protect against this, we implement an authenticated Diffie-Hellman exchange first to generate a secure channel, and then to use that channel for the root key transfer. The base station initiates the Diffie-Hellman exchange by sending a digitally signed message containing its ephemeral key component, and the target node responds correspondingly with its own signed ephemeral key component. The <b>shared</b> <b>ephemeral</b> key is then generated by each side by combining the received key component with its own key component.

40|$|Floating seaweed is {{considered}} to be an important habitat for juvenile fishes due to the provision of food, shelter, a visual orientation point and passive transport. The importance of the presence of the highly dynamical seaweed clumps from the North Sea to juvenile neustonic fishes was investigated by analysing both neuston samples (without seaweed) and seaweed samples concerning fish community structure, and length-frequency distributions and feeding habits of five associated fish species. While the neustonic fish community was mainly seasonally structured, the seaweed-associated fish community was more complex: the response of the associated fish species to environmental variables was species specific and probably influenced by species interactions, resulting in a large multivariate distance between the samples dominated by Chelon labrosus and the samples dominated by Cyclopterus lumpus, Trachurus trachurus and Ciliata mustela. The results of the stomach analysis confirmed that C. lumpus is a weedpatch specialist that has a close spatial affinity with the seaweed and feeds intensively on the seaweed-associated invertebrate fauna. Similarly, C. mustela juveniles also fed on the seaweed fauna, but in a more opportunistic way. The shape of the size-frequency distribution suggested enhanced growth when associated with floating seaweed. Chelon labrosus and T. trachurus juveniles were generally large in seaweed samples, but large individuals were also encountered in the neuston. The proportion of associated invertebrate fauna in their diet was of minor importance, compared to the proportions in C. lumpus. Individuals of Syngnathus rostellatus mainly fed on planktonic invertebrates but had a discontinuous size-frequency distribution, suggesting that some of the syngnathids were carried with the seaweed upon detachment and stayed associated. Floating seaweeds can therefore be regarded as <b>ephemeral</b> habitats <b>shared</b> between several fish species (mainly juveniles) that use them for different reasons and with varying intensity...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{operating}} systems create ephemeral virtual-to-physical mappings {{for a variety}} of purposes, ranging from the implementation of interprocess communication to the implementation of process tracing and debugging. With succeeding generations of processors the cost of creating ephemeral mappings is increasing, particularly when an <b>ephemeral</b> mapping is <b>shared</b> by multiple processors. To reduce the cost of ephemeral mapping management within an operating system kernel, we introduce the sf buf ephemeral mapping interface. We demonstrate how in several kernel subsystems — including pipes, memory disks, sockets, execve(), ptrace(), and the vnode pager — the current implementation can be replaced by calls to the sf buf interface. We describe the implementation of the sf buf interface on the 32 -bit i 386 architecture and the 64 -bit amd 64 architecture. This implementation reduces the cost of ephemeral mapping management by reusing wherever possible existing virtual-to-physical address mappings. We evaluate the sf buf interface for the pipe, memory disk and networking subsystems. Our results show that these subsystems perform significantly better when using the sf buf interface. On a multiprocessor platform interprocessor interrupts are greatly reduced in number or eliminated altogether. ...|$|R

40|$|Stimulated {{by finding}} a novel cytheroid {{ostracod}} {{in a piece}} of sunken wood retrieved from the sea-bed in the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, we have reviewed all previously published data on ostracods from similarly ephemeral deep-sea habitats (wood falls, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps). These data are placed in the context of all data on living, deep-sea ostracods from other environments. We confirm previous authors? conclusions that faunas from these ephemeral habitats are similar at the generic level, and include elements common to shallow and deep habitats. However, at the species level, endemism varies from zero at cold seeps, to 35 % in wood falls and 60 % at hydrothermal vents, which is an indication of the relative longevity of these habitats. Non-endemic species occur also in oligotrophic, deep-sea sediments but not in shallow environments. This is in contradiction to previous assumptions that these <b>ephemeral</b> faunas <b>share</b> more species and with shallow habitats than genera with the oligotrophic, deep-sea sediments. We agree with previous authors that the dispersal strategy of wood fall, vent and seep ostracods includes hitchhiking and we propose that it also includes the ability to survive ingestion by larger, more motile animals. The homogeneity of the faunas from ephemeral habitats collected off the American continent is {{in stark contrast to the}} highly endemic fauna found in Northwestern Pacific. This suggests that the ostracods may have biogeographical patterns similar to those previously proposed for other groups of benthos. However, any proposal for a global biogeographical scheme for ostracod distributions will have to await far more comprehensive coverage from presently unstudied regions. Finally, we describe and name a novel species of ostracod from the wood fall collected at a depth of 5229 m in the abyss east to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, Northwestern Pacific; erecting a new family Keysercytheridae fam. nov. and a new genus, Keysercythere gen. nov., to accommodate it, and name it, Keysercythere enricoi sp. nov.

40|$|The {{increasing}} interest in vehicular communications {{draws attention to}} scalability and network congestion problems and therefore on techniques to offload the traffic, typically carried through the infrastructure, to the Vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) network. Floating content (FC) represents a promising paradigm to <b>share</b> <b>ephemeral</b> content without direct support from infrastructure. It is based on constraining geographically within the Anchor Zone (AZ) the opportunistic replication of a given content among vehicles, {{in a way that}} strikes a balance between minimization of resource usage and content availability. Existing works on FC performance modeling are based on standard, homogeneous synthetic mobility models, and it is hence unclear how they actually fit in realistic mobility scenarios. Moreover, the approaches to FC dimensioning they propose assume users have full knowledge of Spatio-temporal mobility patterns, which is hard to achieve in practice. Finally, despite FC is an infrastructure-less communication paradigm, some form of infrastructure support could be available {{in the vast majority of}} those application scenarios for which it has been proposed. In this paper, we perform a first attempt at tackling these issues. We focus on how to dimension an Anchor Zone in a realistic vehicular scenario. We propose the first set of simple dimensioning strategies, based on the estimation of some key mobility parameters and of FC performance. We assess such strategies on measurement-based vehicular traces, providing a first indication of their relative performance, and of the feasibility of FC in practical scenarios...|$|R
40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of smartphones and their advanced connectivity capabilities, opportunistic networks have gained a lot of traction during the past years; they are suitable for increasing network capacity and <b>sharing</b> <b>ephemeral,</b> localised content. They can also offload traffic from cellular networks to device-to-device ones, when cellular networks are heavily stressed. Opportunistic networks can {{play a crucial role}} in communication scenarios where the network infrastructure is inaccessible due to natural disasters, large scale terrorist attacks or government censorship. Geocasting, where messages are destined to specific locations (casts) instead of explicitly identified devices, has a large potential in real world opportunistic networks, however it has attracted little attention in the context of opportunistic networking. In this thesis, we propose Geocasting Spray And Flood (GSAF), a simple but efficient and flexible geocasting protocol for opportunistic, delay tolerant networks. GSAF follows a simple but elegant and flexible approach where messages take random walks towards the destination cast. Messages that follow directions away from the cast are extinct when the device buffer gets full, freeing space for new messages to be delivered. In GSAF, casts do not have to be pre-defined; instead users can route messages to arbitrarily defined casts. Also, the addressed cast is flexible in comparison to other approaches and can take complex shapes in the network. DA-GSAF as the direction aware version of the GSAF is proposed as well which use location information to aid routing decisions in the GSAF. Extensive evaluation shows that GSAF and DA-GSAF are significantly more efficient than existing solutions, in terms of message delivery ratio and latency as well as network overhead...|$|R
40|$|An ethnographic {{approach}} {{is used to}} produce a nuanced investigation of {{the efforts of the}} Haida First Nation in British Columbia, Canada, to repatriate the human remains of their ancestors from collections around the world. The result is a contextualisation of Haida repatriation within values and structures of kinship—a position that stands in contrast to the frequent use of political or legalistic frameworks to understand repatriation issues. Incorporating Haida sensibilities toward kinship relations is necessary as analyses based in colonial or post-colonial encounters fail to account for the full range of motivating factors, which include the Haida value of yahgudangang (‘to pay respect’ and ‘to be fit for respect’) and the agency of ancestors after death. Furthermore, it is argued that kinship is the predominant structure through which Haidas experience identity, history and memory. Repatriation is therefore approached as a collective space in which kinship and memories are created, as well as a collective space in which remembering occurs. In order to understand how the individual elements comprising the repatriation process reflect and foster the construction of kinship, the expectations and obligations that exist within matrilineages and between moieties are traced, as is their material manifestation in objects, as well as tangible and <b>ephemeral</b> property. The <b>sharing</b> of embodied experiences between generations as a consequence of Haidas’ participation in the process of repatriation is shown to augment collective memory and family histories. The ways in which repatriation is incorporated within individual and collective narratives are explored as a further means of understanding the dynamic between the production of kinship, memory and identity. Avenues for expanding the current findings on repatriation, the connections between memory and kinship, and Northwest Coast scholarship more generally are presented.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesInterest in {{this topic}} {{was awakened by}} {{the rapid growth of}} Relay For Life in South Africa and its {{striking}} ability to bond people during mass cancer gatherings. Questions were raised about the generation of collective identities during these assemblies, the nature of the activated identities, and how these relate to the broader debates about cancer and identity. This inquiry investigates the unexplored intersection of cancer and identity {{in the context of a}} burgeoning solidarity movement that has found a strong following countrywide. A contemporary hermeneutic perspective allowed a dual focus on the micro-sociological dimensions and the structural elements that converge to generate collective identities at assemblies. A theoretical scheme was synthesized out of the work of theorists who deal with collective identity, spaces set aside for people in crisis, social interaction during focused gatherings and illness narratives. A non-comparative case study was used to investigate the phenomenon at 20 cancer assemblies. Short-term ethnography, focus group interviews, photographs and YouTube videos provided the data that was analysed using the hermeneutic circle of interpretation. The findings showed that personal illness identities and situation-specific role identities interact with a potent cocktail of elements - <b>ephemeral</b> space, a <b>shared</b> focus on cancer, collective action, illusion and emotions - to activate three symbolic identities: a dominant collective identity that relies on heroic warrior mythology, a secondary collective identity that draws upon a transformation ideal, and a hidden identity which has its roots in the notion of being wounded. It is argued that assemblies rely on a dominant collective identity which is symbolic in nature and imposed on participants by the cancer movement. Participants are portrayed as positive, hopeful heroic warriors tasked with vanquishing cancer. Although ubiquitous at cancer assemblies, the dominant collective identity is nevertheless sufficiently fluid to allow a measure of hybridization, inversion and contestation. This inquiry gives credence to other work on cancer and identity which recognizes that the dominant identity provides benefits not offered by a victim representation. It also expresses reservations about the wisdom of expecting affected people to maintain a brave exterior in the face of an illness that causes emotional disequilibrium...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although it is {{increasingly}} acknowledged that social networks are important to our understanding ofoverweight and obesity, there is limited understanding about the processes by which such networks shapetheir progression. This paper reports {{the findings of a}} scoping review of the literature that sought to identify the key processes through which social networks are understood to influence the development of overweight and obesity. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted. Forty five papers were included in the final review, the findings of which were synthesised to provide an overview of the main processes through which networks have been understood to influence the development of overweight and obesity. RESULTS: Included papers addressed a wide range of research questions framed around six types of networks: a paired network (one's spouse or intimate partner); friends and family (including work colleagues and people within social clubs); <b>ephemeral</b> networks in <b>shared</b> public spaces (such as fellow shoppers in a supermarket or diners in a restaurant); people living within the same geographical region; peers (including co-workers, fellow students, fellow participants in a weight loss programme); and cultural groups (often related toethnicity). As individuals are embedded in many of these different types of social networks at any one time, the pathways of influence from social networks to the development of patterns of overweight and obesity are likely to be complex and interrelated. Included papers addressed a diverse set of issues: body weight trends over time; body size norms or preferences; weight loss and management; physical activity patterns; and dietary patterns. DISCUSSION: Three inter-related processes were identified: social contagion (whereby the network in which people are embedded influences their weight or weight influencing behaviours), social capital (whereby sense of belonging and social support influence weight or weight influencing behaviours), and social selection (whereby a person's network might develop according to his or her weight). CONCLUSIONS: The findings have important implications for understanding about methods to target the spread of obesity, indicating that much greater attention needs to be paid to the social context in which people make decisions about their weight and weight influencing behaviours...|$|R
