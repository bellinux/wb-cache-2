These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim <b>is,</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.|$|E

500|$|Growing {{ties between}} church and state in Russia were a target of {{criticism}} and protest. The Russian Patriarch Kirill had openly supported Putin's 2012 re-election, calling Putin a [...] "miracle from God", who had [...] "rectified the crooked path of history". After the cathedral performance, members of Pussy Riot said the church was a [...] "weapon in a dirty election campaign" [...] and called Putin [...] "a man who <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> can be from God's truth". This performance led to the arrest and prosecution of three of their members.|$|E
500|$|In 1856, Tucker {{completed}} his four-volume History of the United States, From Their Colonization to the End of the 26th Congress, in 1841. Robley Dunglison commented as follows on the work: [...] "To aid {{him in the}} execution of his work, as [...] himself remarks, it had been his good fortune to have a personal knowledge of many, who bore a conspicuous part in the Revolution, and of nearly all those who were the principal actors in the political dramas which succeeded. The history extends to the elevation of General William Henry Harrison to the Presidency in 1841, which <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Tucker thought he could prudently go." [...] The work includes {{a brief review of}} slavery, in which Tucker took issue with Jefferson's decades-old view in his Notes on the State of Virginia (1781), that slavery still had a degenerative effect upon slaveholders.|$|E

2500|$|During the Ice Age, the {{sea level}} was some 200 metres {{lower than it}} is today.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to primetime, daytime dramas have different obstacles to developing innovative programming, with their advertising sponsors being more conservative, their audience smaller and [...] "genre restrictions that emphasize continuity {{and respect for}} history over innovation".
