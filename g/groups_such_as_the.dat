5|$|During his lifetime, List {{became a}} {{well-known}} figure among the nationalist and völkisch subcultures of Austria and Germany, influencing {{the work of}} many others operating in this milieu. His work, propagated through the List Society, influenced later völkisch <b>groups</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Reichshammerbund and Germanenorden, and through those exerted an influence on both the burgeoning Nazi Party and the SS. After World War II his work continued to influence an array of Ariosophic and Heathen practitioners in Europe, Australia, and North America.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, the ACLU's {{primary focus}} was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within the labor {{movement}} particularly.

5|$|Finite {{symmetry}} <b>groups</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Mathieu {{groups are}} used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.|$|E
5|$|<b>Groups</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Organization for Bat Conservation and Bat Conservation International aim to {{increase}} awareness of bats' ecological roles {{and the environmental}} threats they face.

50|$|The {{numerous}} {{subgroups of}} the large and variegated ethnic <b>group,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Kru, are defined by linguists referring to a taxonomy of the languages employed by its members.

5|$|Living mammals {{are divided}} into the Yinotheria (platypus and echidnas) and Theriiformes (all other mammals). There are around 5450 species of mammal, {{depending}} on which authority is cited. In some classifications, extant mammals {{are divided into}} two subclasses: the Prototheria, that is, the order Monotremata; and the Theria, or the infraclasses Metatheria and Eutheria. The marsupials constitute the crown group of the Metatheria, and include all living metatherians {{as well as many}} extinct ones; the placentals are the crown group of the Eutheria. While mammal classification at the family level has been relatively stable, several contending classifications regarding the higher levels—subclass, infraclass and order, especially of the marsupials—appear in contemporaneous literature. Much of the changes reflect the advances of cladistic analysis and molecular genetics. Findings from molecular genetics, for example, have prompted adopting new <b>groups,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Afrotheria, and abandoning traditional <b>groups,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Insectivora.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, some {{ethnic groups}} with smaller populations are {{classified}} together with another distinct ethnic <b>group,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{case with the}} Utsuls of Hainan being classified <b>as</b> part of <b>the</b> Hui minority {{on the basis of}} their shared Islamic religion, and the Chuanqing being classified <b>as</b> part of <b>the</b> Han majority.|$|R
