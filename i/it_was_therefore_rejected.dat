[...] University of Washington, 1997 The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to examine}} sensory integration (SI) as a frame of reference for the assessment and intervention of children with mild disabilities. A description of SI and SI dysfunction is provided, and SI is compared with other approaches used in the remediation of {{children with learning disabilities}} (LD). Controversial issues regarding the application of SI are discussed, SI research is critiqued, and the current practice of occupational therapists using SI is described. Models of SI dysfunction based on scores of children on the Sensory Integration and Praxis Tests (SIPT; Ayres, 1989) were examined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). The initial, hypothesized model tested was derived from previous multivariate analyses and consisted of five patterns of dysfunction including: (a) Bilateral Integration and Sequencing; (b) Somatosensory; (c) Somatopraxis; (d) Visuopraxis; and (e) Postural-ocular-motor patterns. An existing data base including the scores of 10, 475 children was used in the analyses, along with a sub-group of 995 children with LD. Using LISREL 8 (linear structural relations; Joreskog & Sorbom, 1993), CFA of the hypothesized model indicated a number of weaknesses with the model, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>rejected.</b> Further analyses aimed towards identifying a better fitting, more parsimonious model of SI dysfunction were then performed. A second-order, 4 -factor model which consisted of a general SI Dysfunction second-order factor, and Dyspraxia, Bilateral Integration and Sequencing Deficit, Visual Perceptual Deficit, and Somatosensory Deficit as first-order factors was believed to represent the best fitting model. The results of the CFA with this model indicated {{that it was a good}} fit for the data, and substantially improved upon the initial model. The second-order, 4 -factor model also held true when tested with the sub-sample of children with LD. Finally, interpretation of SIPT scores based on the new, proposed model of SI dysfunction is demonstrated through the presentation of a case study of a child with LD. Specific SI intervention strategies that can be used by occupational therapists to promote motor skills, appropriate behavior and the academic success of children with SI dysfunction working in both school and clinic settings are presented...|$|E
40|$|Very often, {{decision}} {{procedures in}} a committee compensate potential manipulations by {{taking into account}} the ordered profile of qualifications. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>rejected</b> the standard assumption of an underlying associative binary connective allowing the evaluation of arbitrary finite sequences of items by means of a one-by-one sequential process. In this paper we develop a mathematical approach for non-associative connectives allowing a sequential definition by means of binary fuzzy connectives. <b>It</b> will <b>be</b> then stressed that a connective rule should be understood as a consistent sequence of binary connective operators. Committees should previously decide about which connective rule they will be condidering, not just about a single operator...|$|R
40|$|Many theorists {{claim that}} if an agent {{benefits}} from an action that harms others, that agent has a moral duty to compensate those who are harmed, even if the agent did not cause the harm herself. In the debate on climate justice, this idea is {{commonly referred to as}} the beneficiary-pays principle (BPP). This paper argues that the BPP is implausible, both in the context of climate change and as a normative principle more generally. <b>It</b> should <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> <b>rejected...</b>|$|R

The inconsistency allegations had been a prominent feature of Marxian economics and the debate surrounding it since the 1970s. Andrew Kliman argues that, since internally inconsistent theories cannot possibly be right, the inconsistency charges serve to legitimate the suppression of Marx's critique of political economy and current-day research based upon it, {{as well as the}} [...] "correction" [...] of Marx's inconsistencies.|$|R
40|$|Human capital {{accumulation}} is introduced into a growth model with R&D-driven expansion in variety and quality and knowledge spillovers from both research activities. Economic growth is not longer uniquely tied to population growth as previous growth models without scale effects suggest. The model predicts that economic growth depends positively on {{the rate of}} human {{capital accumulation}} and positively or negatively on population growth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> harder to <b>reject</b> by empirical evidence. Long-run growth is compatible with a stable population. As in previous studies the market generates the optimal growth rate but possibly a suboptimal level of the growth path. I calibrate the model with U. S. data and investigate whether the market provides too little or too much R&D. ...|$|R
40|$|Scatter {{in medical}} imaging is {{typically}} cast off as image-related noise that detracts from meaningful diagnosis. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> typically <b>rejected</b> or removed from medical images. However, <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> found that every material, including cancerous tissue, {{has a unique}} X-ray coherent scatter signature {{that can be used}} to identify the material or tissue. Such scatter-based tissue-identification provides the advantage of locating and identifying particular materials over conventional anatomical imaging through X-ray radiography. A coded aperture X-ray coherent scatter spectral imaging system has been developed in our group to classify different tissue types based on their unique scatter signatures. Previous experiments using our prototype have demonstrated that the depth-resolved coherent scatter spectral imaging system (CACSSI) can discriminate healthy and cancerous tissue present in the path of a non-destructive x-ray beam. A key to the successful optimization of CACSSI as a clinical imaging method is to obtain anatomically accurate phantoms of the human body. This thesis describes the development and fabrication of 3 D printed anatomical scatter phantoms of the breast and lung. The purpose of this work is to accurately model different breast geometries using a tissue equivalent phantom, and to classify these tissues in a coherent x-ray scatter imaging system. Tissue-equivalent anatomical phantoms were designed to assess the capability of the CACSSI system to classify different types of breast tissue (adipose, fibroglandular, malignant). These phantoms were 3 D printed based on DICOM data obtained from CT scans of prone breasts. The phantoms were tested through comparison of measured scatter signatures with those of adipose and fibroglandular tissue from literature. Tumors in the phantom were modeled using a variety of biological tissue including actual surgically excised benign and malignant tissue specimens. Lung based phantoms have also been printed for future testing. Our imaging system has been able to define the location and composition of the various materials in the phantom. These phantoms were used to characterize the CACSSI system in terms of beam width and imaging technique. The result of this work showed accurate modeling and characterization of the phantoms through comparison of the tissue-equivalent form factors to those from literature. The physical construction of the phantoms, based on actual patient anatomy, was validated using mammography and computed tomography to visually compare the clinical images to those of actual patient anatomy.
