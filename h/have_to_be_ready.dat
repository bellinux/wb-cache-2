500|$|Nevada coach Ault said, [...] "I {{think the}} Maryland defense is as {{physical}} as Missouri's was." [...] Kaepernick said, [...] "You notice how disciplined {{and how hard}} they play. They're never out of alignment. If they're supposed to be somewhere, they're {{going to be there}} and they're going to be ready to make a play. When plays come their way, they make them. That's something we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for. We have to find a weakness and exploit it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2006 Jyllands-Posten Muhammad {{cartoons}} controversy, Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah {{declared in}} a speech aired on Al-Manar TV and Al-Jazeera TV [...] that: [...] "If {{there had been a}} Muslim to carry out Imam Khomeini's fatwā against the renegade Salman Rushdie, this rabble who insult our Prophet Mohammed in Denmark, Norway and France would not have dared to do so.

He advised the journalists that would be accompanying him on the flight: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> with your hand camera because this action can become very fast.

2500|$|Comanche raids were {{frequent}} in the San Antonio area, and Maverick {{joined the}} militia. [...] When an attack was noticed, the church bell would ring, and Maverick {{and his fellow}} militia members would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to leave within 15minutes. [...] They would chase the raiders with the hopes of recovering captives and any stolen goods. [...] Maverick participated in the Council House Fight on March 19, 1840, as the citizens of San Antonio attempted to capture or kill a band of Indians who had reneged on previous agreements to return captives.

[...] Before he could escort the goods to San Antonio, a band of Indians led by Buffalo Hump raided Linnville and destroyed all of the supplies.|$|E
2500|$|Napoleon had {{attempted}} to speedily catch the British and force them to fight. He led the French army [...] over 10 days by forced marches {{and in spite of}} winter blizzard conditions reached Astorga on 1 January with 80,000 men. Napoleon manoeuvred to cut Moore off from a retreat to Portugal. Moore had already planned that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to make a run for the coast. On 28 November Moore had ordered his Corunna contingent under Baird to embark from Vigo while the main British army was to fall back on Portugal but by 28 December he had decided to embark the whole army at Vigo. Abandoning Astorga on 30 December, he would manage to keep ahead of the pursuing French and avoid a major battle. Moore ordered Crawford and two brigades as well as the troop transport ships to the port of Vigo. Napoleon would write to his brother Joseph on 31 December: [...] When {{it was clear that he}} could not bring Moore to battle, Napoleon left the pursuit of the British to Soult's corps with Marshal Ney in support and took the bulk of the army, some 45,000 men, back to Madrid. Napoleon decided to leave Spain to attend to other pressing matters; the Austrians were about to declare war on France, and would soon invade Italy and Bavaria.|$|E

50|$|Notoriously, a tight loop that {{displayed}} points repetitively in {{one place}} on the screen would burn a permanent dark hole in the delicate phosphor in well under a minute; programmers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> hit the Stop lever fast if a very bright spot suddenly appeared because of a programming mistake.|$|R

6000|$|The doctor {{rose with}} a half apology. [...] "I must ask pardon for {{disturbing}} this pleasant party; I am called away on duty. Please don't let anybody move. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for these things, you know. Perhaps Mr. Treherne will admit that my habits are not so very vegetable, after all." [...] With this Parthian shaft, at which there was some laughter, he strode away very rapidly across the sunny lawn to where the road dipped down toward the village.|$|E
6000|$|... "Had I {{not better}} tell Tom Whyte to saddle the young horse for you?" [...] said his father, half ironically. [...] "No, no, boy; lie still {{where you are}} to-day, and get up if you feel better to-morrow. In the meantime, I've come to say goodbye, as I intend {{to go home to}} relieve your mother's anxiety about you. I'll see you again, probably, the day after to-morrow. Hark you, boy; I've been talking your affairs over again with Mr Grant, and we've come to the {{conclusion}} to give you a run in the woods for a time. You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to start early in spring with the first brigades for the north. So adieu!" ...|$|E

50|$|During the Second World War, {{he served}} as a Temporary Civilian Officer in the Admiralty's Naval Intelligence Division, from 1942 to 1945.

50|$|During {{construction}}, {{several things}} occur that the player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for. The {{first and most}} basic is winter.

5000|$|Despite {{their local}} celebrity, the Snowdens faced the same {{suspicion}} as other traveling performers and the racism directed toward blacks in general.
