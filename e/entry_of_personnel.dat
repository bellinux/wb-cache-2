40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{substantiate}} the methodical approach to determining the level of formation and provision <b>of</b> enterprise <b>personnel</b> security.

There justified the urgency of creating a comprehensive approach to evaluation <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> security that includes implementation of the following stages: defining a list of indices corresponding {{to the level of}} formation and provision <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> security {{with the help of the}} expert evaluation method; calculating integral indices <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> security for each component and the corresponding level by means of the taxonomic analysis; grouping enterprises by the level of formation and provision <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> security with the use of the cluster and discriminant analysis.
