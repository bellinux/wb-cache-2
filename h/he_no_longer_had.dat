The XLVI Motorised Corps encountered little resistance from the 4th Army, particularly from the 27th Infantry Division Savska and 40th Infantry Division Slavonska on its right, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating. Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th Infantry Division Savska due to suspicions that he was an Ustaše sympathiser, but could not identify a suitable replacement.|$|E
5|$|In the 1976–77 {{season the}} Flyers' win total slipped from 51 to 48, {{but they still}} managed a 0.700 winning percentage. This marked the fourth {{consecutive}} year of having a 0.700 or better win percentage – once again winning their division and finishing first in the Campbell Conference. In the post season the Flyers again reached the semi-finals, but lost to the Bruins in four straight games. The following season the Flyers' record fell to 45–20–15 finishing second to the Islanders in both the division and the Conference. Shero again led the Flyers to the semi-finals, where they lost to the Bruins once more. At {{the end of the}} season Shero, who had one more year left on his contract, submitted a letter of resignation stating that the Flyers needed a change whether they realized it or not. Flyers management had previously heard rumors about Shero wanting to leave Philadelphia and re-join the Rangers organization, and refused to accept his letter of resignation. Shero then signed a $250,000, five-year contract with the Rangers to be their new Head Coach and General Manager, believing <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> a contractual agreement to the Flyers. A few weeks after signing Shero, the Rangers gave the Flyers their first-round pick in the 1978 draft (Ken Linseman) and cash as compensation, allowing the Rangers to avoid tampering charges.|$|E

25|$|The {{creation}} of the Arrow Groups angered Kony, who began to feel that <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> {{the support of the}} population. In response the LRA mutilated numerous Acholi whom they believed to be government supporters. While the government efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.|$|E

He arrived back in England in January 1939.|$|E
25|$|Miles of Plancy {{was briefly}} bailli or regent during Baldwin IV's minority. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Count Raymond III of Tripoli, Amalric's first cousin, became regent. It is highly {{probable}} that Raymond or his supporters engineered the assassination. Baldwin reached his majority in 1176, and despite his illness <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> any legal need for a regent. Since Raymond was his nearest relative in the male line with a strong claim to the throne, there was concern {{about the extent of}} his ambitions, although he had no direct heirs of his own. To balance this, the king turned {{from time to time to}} his uncle, Joscelin III of Edessa, who was appointed seneschal in 1176; Joscelin was more closely related to Baldwin than Raymond was, but had no claim to the throne himself.|$|E

Frazier made millions of dollars in the 1970s, but the article cited mismanagement of real-estate holdings as a partial explanation for his economic woes. Frazier stated repeatedly that <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> any bitter feelings towards Ali. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has named the Joe Frazier's Gym in its 25th list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in 2012.
