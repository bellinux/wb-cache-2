Whether classrooms are Bring Your Own Device, have an iPad cart, or computer lab, there are many digital activities that can assist teachers with getting the year off to a great start, without adding extra stress. Participants will examine a variety of web-based tools (e. g. Google forms, Infuse Learning, Socrative, Tagxedo, Todaysmeet, Voki, Symbaloo, Kahoot, Powtoon, Padlet, Celly and Easel. ly), apps (e. g. Tellagami, Kodable, Art of Glow, Speakazoo, Evernote, Sketchlot, Showme, and Mindmeister), and Interactive White Board activities (e. g. SMART exchange and Gynzy) that students can use to create self-introductions, digital portfolios, games, screen-capture videos, do team-building exercises, give quick feedback, and go paperless. In addition, we will discuss a checklist for successfully using technology during the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> by being familiar with the technology infrastructure on campus, finding out what devices students have, selecting activities that can run on a variety of devices, and setting the expectations for your class on proper technology use.

[...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote [...] "...this episode manages to do what the show has always done, mix crazy, almost surreal humor with a genuine (not manufactured) heart." [...] TV Guide contributor Matt Mitovich enjoyed [...] "Do-Over", and enjoyed Jack's story of trying to reclaim his job, along with Jack and Liz pretending to be a couple in front of Kathy. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin opined that premiere episodes [...] "tend to be 30 Rocks Achilles Heel. But the show comes roaring out of the gate with 'Do-Over', a show that definitively breaks the premiere jinx." [...] He said that the [...] "frenetic farcical plotting" [...] of Megan Mullally's character—in which she endured a disastrous trip to the 30 Rock studios, bumped her head, and lost her memory—"felt a little sitcommy but the laughs kept coming".
