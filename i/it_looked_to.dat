25|$|Bradman {{had only}} made 28, {{when he played}} Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it {{high in the air}} in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> me sitting {{watching}} from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.|$|E

25|$|With {{the same}} tactics and strength, América de Cali went for their fourth star.

Under the management of Gabriel Ochoa Uribe, {{it seemed that the}} next star would once again be red. Ochoa, showing the country {{that he was one of}} the best coaches at the time, proved it by leading the team to various accomplishments.|$|E

25|$|The 'Reed' {{company name}} {{continued}} {{into the twentieth century}} long after Charles Reed's death, though under the proprietorship of Stephenson Blake & Co. who had bought Reed's business interests. At one time Reed's had been the larger of the two firms but it had difficulties in financing a modernisation programme as typography changed, and its once valuable equipment became out of date. Indeed, Stephenson Blake's acquisition was thought at the time to be very generous as <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> be buying little other than the Reed's name and reputation. Not long after, however, thorough cataloguing of Reed's typefaces proved to be a treasure trove. Designs such as the Clarendon typeface, which Charles Reed had originally acquired from Robert Besley & Sons of the Fann Street foundry, became very marketable once re-cast using new technology. Several of Reed's typefaces are now available for use in font collections on our computers, such as Clarendon, which is now owned by a German company (as a trademark of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG licensed through Linotype Library GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG).|$|E
25|$|The top 10 drivers {{set their}} early quick laps. Hamilton took the early lead with Vettel and Rosberg close behind. With only {{two minutes to}} go <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> be a close to who would take pole position. The top three were {{unchanged}} with Vettel very quick on track while Rosberg was going even quicker. However, Barrichello spun off and hit the wall hard, destroying much of {{the left side of}} his car, which brought out the yellow flags meaning anyone who was on a flying lap had to slow down unless they had already passed the scene of the accident. The red flag was brought out with 26 seconds remaining on the clock. As no other cars crossed the line, Hamilton took pole position ahead of Vettel, Rosberg and Mark Webber. Although Barrichello qualified fifth, he started the race tenth after his gearbox change. The session was restarted with only 26 seconds left there was no time to start a flying lap so no one rejoined the circuit. This session was the third of four to be red flagged during the weekend, only the third practice session was not interrupted.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{went into}} the US Open as the eighth seed, his lowest seeding at a major since Wimbledon 2008. In the first round he faced Robin Haase where he looked to be heading for a routine {{straight}} sets victory. However, early in the third set, Murray suffered a bout of cramp and Haase was able to claw his {{way back into the}} match. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> be going all the way to a deciding set but Murray was able to come back from a break down to take the match in four. In the second round Murray defeated qualifier Matthias Bachinger in straight sets to set up a first meeting with Andrey Kuznetsov in the third round. He came through that encounter in four sets to set up a third meeting of the season with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Murray won in straight sets to record his first win over a top 10 player since his 2013 Wimbledon final victory over Novak Djokovic. It was Djokovic who he faced at the quarter-final stage of the tournament. In their 21st meeting the Serb proved to be too much for Murray, taking the win in four sets in a late match that lasted over three and a half hours.|$|E

25|$|That was not all, however. The chase began very sedately, only Tushar Imran {{looking to}} take runs as he smashed Brad Hogg about, but Hogg got his revenge when Tushar was out for 24, lofting to Katich. Earlier, Nafees Iqbal had gone for 8, and with Javed Omar {{out as the}} third man to fall, for 19 off 51 balls, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> be {{business}} as usual for Bangladesh. But this match had more tricks up its sleeve. Hogg and Clarke leaked runs like a drain, six wides were bowled, and Mohammad Ashraful showed another glimpse of why he's been called Bangladesh's finest batsman. As he made the second ODI hundred in the Bangladesh team's history, he forged a massive 130-run partnership with Habibul Bashar, and had a great two hours at the crease (although dropped on 54) – before picking out Jason Gillespie at long on to be out for exactly 100. Bangladesh still needed 23 runs off 17 balls, but Aftab Ahmed continued his fine form from the Oval match with England, as he first took a leg bye off Ashraful, then gave the strike to Rafique, who smashed a cover driven four before taking another leg bye. A four and a dot-ball finished a 10-run over, meaning that Bangladesh now needed only 13 off 12 balls. A good over from McGrath followed, as he conceded only six runs – including an edged four from Rafique. With the last over, Bangladesh needed seven runs, and Ahmed swung the first ball of the over to midwicket for six. Thus, it became a formality – Bangladesh won with four balls and five wickets to spare, almost convincing in today's cricket, and the result meant that the Aussies needed a victory over England at Bristol the following day to have any chance of winning the group stage.|$|E

500|$|Although the Suspension Bridge {{proved that}} the {{suspension}} system could be safely used to carry railroads, no more suspension railway bridges were built. [...] The outbreak of the American Civil War diverted attention from such civil engineering ventures, {{and by the time}} attention was paid to building bridges again, cantilever bridges were in vogue for railway bridges. [...] Regardless, the Suspension Bridge's success made it a model for suspension railway bridges. [...] When the city of Quebec called for a structure to span the St. Lawrence River in 1850, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> the Suspension Bridge for inspiration. [...] Seventeen years later, the British journal Engineering called for a suspension railway to bridge the Straits of Messina and also referred to Roebling's bridge.

500|$|Formby's career {{received}} a further boost in July 1913 {{when he was}} one of seven acts to appear before GeorgeV and Queen Mary in a Royal Command Performance at Knowsley Hall, near Liverpool. The Times reported that Formby's [...] "broad humour succeeded with unexpected ease, and their Majesties praised him very highly after the performance." [...] Formby was embarrassed by his performance. His usual act partly consisted of a running patter with the orchestra conductor, which he again did on this occasion; behind the conductor sat the royal party, and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> some that Formby was speaking disrespectfully to them. The king understood to whom Formby was talking, however, and afterwards presented him with a tiepin. In October Formby appeared in his second Royal Command Performance of the year, [...] in a charity show organised by the French actress Sarah Bernhardt. He took part in two acts: [...] a performance of [...] "Ten Little Nigger Boys All in a Row", alongside other music hall entertainers [...] including Robey, Mark Sheridan, Cicely Courtneidge and George Graves, followed by a short solo piece.|$|E
