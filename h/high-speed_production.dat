This paper focused on studying and developing a machine vision inspecting system for on-line defects detection of PET caps without support rings.

For detecting the defect of surface foreign matters, the algorithm employed a mean filtering to estimate the background, then compared the inspected image with the background image by using dynamic threshold, as a result, the crack region was extracted. As to defect of link ring broken, the uneven gray-scale distribution in the RGB color space was extremely improved by HSV color space transform. Compared three components of HSV images, the gap feature between the cap and the link ring was more obvious in the saturation image.

30|$|Generally, {{the problem}} of {{determining}} production order sizes, their timing and sequencing with setup considerations is equivalent to a capacitated lot size problem. However, the change in business conditions as shown by shortened replenishment lead times, increased product variety, <b>high-speed</b> <b>production</b> equipment with more complex setup conditions, increased inventory turnover etc. calls {{for a change of}} paradigm. It appears that the industrial relevance of traditional lot sizing and scheduling models has shifted from discrete parts manufacturing to process industries, particularly, for applications with long processing times of campaigns in multi-stage production systems. Hence, it is more relevant in the multi-plant supply network planning stage than in detailed short-term scheduling of operations. In addition, in the chemical industry setup costs are often easier to determine in the form of direct costs mainly when after a product changeover output is temporarily produced, which does not meet the desired specifications (Chapter 5 of Schöpperl 2013), or excessive clean-out times occur as in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|E

30|$|In a {{discrete}} time-based lot-sizing model, {{particularly in a}} small-bucket model, a considerable but consistently ignored issue {{is the definition of}} the length of a time period. Intuitively, weeks are chosen for macro-periods and days for micro-periods. In a practical application, however, the period length must be defined based on minimum lot sizes imposed by technological conditions or by minimum customer order sizes. In a <b>high-speed</b> <b>production</b> environment, e.g. bottling of beverages, this often leads to just a few minutes needed to produce the minimum lot size while in a low-speed environment, e.g. steel production, a few hours suffice. Accordingly, the length of a time period should be defined in the order of minutes or hours depending on the particular application environment. Discrete time-based lot-sizing models in the academic literature typically cover only 2 – 12 periods corresponding to a time span of just a few hours or at most a full day. With a typical planning horizon of 4 – 12  weeks, these lot-sizing models had to be based on an extremely large number of periods to reflect the sequencing and timing of production lots. To overcome these difficulties, the use of a continuous time scale is appealing.|$|E

Electrical process testing in the form of MDA (Manufacturing Defects Analyzers) and ICT (In-Circuit Test) has long been the standard technique in PCB manufacturing used to detect and eliminate assembly and process errors prior to box build and system test. In order to address the inexorable loss {{of electrical}} access, various alternative electrical test techniques have been developed such as functional cluster test, boundary scan test, and BIST.

40|$|Between December 2000 and February 2001 the Irish {{soap opera}} Fair City ran an unprecedented, risky and {{controversial}} abortion storyline. This came before a looming {{referendum on the}} legality of abortion. Here, Fair City was not just offering entertainment, but provoking debate and discussion on a divisive issue in Irish society. In this case, and many others, it appears that soap opera, by promoting such discussion, {{may contribute to the}} formation of public opinion in contemporary civil society. Heretofore, most academic studies have overlooked the possible consequences of soap opera for civil society, public opinion and the democratic process. This study breaks with this by using Habermas’s concept of the public sphere to describe and explore the ways in which soap opera may affect social and political life. In a further departure from former studies that have studied audiences or soap operas texts, this work offers an in-depth investigation of Fair City’s production process. It explores the programme’s potential contribution to public life by uncovering how its production system shapes what social issues it can and cannot address and how it may address them. Habermas offers an underlying conceptual structure for the study. Production research, however, necessitates a conceptual model that can explain everyday production work and decisions within a complex globalised broadcasting environment. To this end, the study employs a Bourdieuian perspective as a middle-range theory. This allows Fair City to be understood as the emergent product of numerous struggles to define the show’s form and content. I argue that shows like Fair City are a necessity for smaller national broadcasters like RTÉ in a harsh and competitive global broadcasting environment. Such production line soap operas provide dramatic entertainment to large repeat audiences at the lowest possible cost. Soap opera’s competitiveness depends on a highly rationalised, factory-style of production. However, this low-cost, <b>high-speed,</b> <b>production</b> routine geared towards maximising audiences, constrains what Fair City can and cannot say. Accordingly, certain public issues simply cannot be introduced to the public sphere through soap opera. This may have significant consequences for discussion, debate and the formation of public opinion in democratic societies...|$|E
