5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E

Two years prior to the current story, her father fought against Kuraudo, a Blazer from Tonrou Academy, with their dojo on the line and ended up in a coma with the dojo being taken over by Kuraudo. After this event, Ayase constantly challenged Kuraudo, but to no avail. She hopes to enter the Seven Star Sword Art Festival to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the dojo back.|$|E

2500|$|Cheryl David (Cheryl Hines) – Cheryl is Larry's long-suffering wife (and later, ex-wife), {{who often}} expresses {{annoyance}} with his behavior, even in situations beyond his control. She often {{serves as a}} voice of reason for him and helps define the social guidelines {{that he may have}} overlooked. While her adventures never lead her far off from Larry, she has various activities outside day-to-day married life, including an acting stint, and, more sustainably, being an advocate of environmental issues, including becoming a member of and fundraiser for the NRDC. Her affection for Larry has been tested, even resulting in her leaving him for a time; upon learning that he had put together the Seinfeld reunion just to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back with her, she sees it as a sign of their [...] "belong together" [...] but soon decides to file for divorce when Larry concentrates on a coffee stain incident rather than {{the fact that they are}} back together, refusing yet again to listen to her.

Lying there behind the fallen tree, watching the fat hens walking about unsuspectingly just a little way from him, {{it seemed to him that}} he simply must rush out and catch one of them. But Reddy was smart enough to know that if he did this there would at once be such a screaming and squawking that some one would be sure to rush out from the farmhouse to find out what was going on. If he were discovered, there would be small chance for him to get another fat hen. Reddy is keen enough to make the most of an opportunity. He knew that if he could get one of these hens without frightening the others, he would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> another.
