60|$|Persecution came {{nearer to}} Rousseau and took more {{inconvenient}} shapes than this. A terrible libel appeared (Feb. 1765), {{full of the}} coarsest calumnies. Rousseau, stung by their insolence and falseness, sent it to Paris to be published there with a prefatory note, stating that it was by a Genevese pastor whom he named. This landed him in fresh mortification, for the pastor disavowed the libel, Rousseau declined to accept the disavowal, and sensible men were wearied by acrimonious declarations, explanations, protests.[164] Then the clergy of Neuchâtel were not able any longer to resist the opportunity of inflicting such torments as they could, upon a heretic whom they might more charitably have left to those ultimate and everlasting torments which were so precious to their religious imagination. They began to press the pastor of the village where Rousseau lived, and {{with whom he had}} hitherto been on excellent terms. The pastor, though he had been liberal enough to admit his singular parishioner to the communion, in spite of the Savoyard Vicar, was not courageous enough to resist the bigotry of the professional body to which he belonged. He warned Rousseau not to present himself at the next communion. The philosopher insisted that he had a right to do this, until formally cast out by the consistory. The consistory, composed mainly of a body of peasants entirely bound to their minister in matters of religion, cited him to appear, and answer such questions as might test his loyalty to the faith. Rousseau prepared a most deliberate vindication of all that he had written, which he intended to speak to his rustic judges. The eve of the morning on which he had to appear, he knew his discourse by heart; when morning came he could not repeat two sentences. So he fell back on the instrument over which he had more mastery than he had over tongue or memory, and wrote what he wished to say. The pastor, in whom irritated egoism was probably by this time giving additional heat to professional zeal, was for fulminating a decree of excommunication, but there appears to have been some <b>indirect</b> <b>interference</b> with the proceedings of the consistory by the king's officials at Neuchâtel, and the ecclesiastical bolt was held back.[165] Other weapons were not wanting. The pastor proceeded to spread rumours among his flock that Rousseau was a heretic, even an atheist, and most prodigious of all, that he had written a book containing the monstrous doctrine that women have no souls. The pulpit resounded with sermons proving to the honest villagers that antichrist was quartered in their parish in very flesh. The Armenian apparel gave a high degree of plausibleness to such an opinion, and as the wretched man went by the door of his neighbours, he heard cursing and menace, while a hostile pebble now and again whistled past his ear. His botanising expeditions were believed to be devoted to search for noxious herbs, and a man who died in the agonies of nephritic colic, {{was supposed to have been}} poisoned by him.[166] If persons went to the post-office for letters for him, they were treated with insult.[167] At length the ferment against him grew hot enough to be serious. A huge block of stone was found placed so as to kill him when he opened his door; and one night an attempt was made to stone him in his house.[168] Popular hate shown with this degree of violence was too much for his fortitude, and after a residence of rather more than three years (September 8-10, 1765), he fled from the inhospitable valley to seek refuge he knew not where.|$|E

In the face of climate change, a lack of understanding of how ephemeral systems function and their ecological resilience, the ability of the system to adapt to significant (directional) change, represent significant knowledge gaps.

To this effect, qualitative research method particularly case study method was employed. As a source of information, top, middle and lower-level actors, and teachers were included. Seven individuals have been participated in the discussion and interview sessions. Besides, document analysis was conducted for Ethiopian HE proclamation, strategic plan of BDU, Ethiopian education policy 1994, and BDU legislation. In order to validate the interview/discussion items, different capable persons including the research supervisor examined it and pertest was conducted; as a result, the necessary measures were taken. Data collected through the above strategies were presented descriptively followed by discussions and implications. HE proclamation, education policy, university legislation and strategic plan of the university describe that academic staff have the right to exercise their professional authority and academic freedom in shared decision-making procedures. All of the documents promote the implementation of shared governance by increasing the participation of academic staffs in both academic and administrative issues in the university as well as in their units. But, the practicality of most of these legal rights have been restricted by the university top and middle-level leaders’ direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>interferences.</b> The study showed that academic issue decision-making power tilts towards the university top management. The academic staffs’ role is limited to teaching the course contents which got approval from the course chairs and the middle-level leaders. They are not influential even if the issue at hand is about the teaching learning process. The influential decision makers are outsiders than insiders. College and departments have no a trend of setting their own agenda. Rather, the university prepare agenda based on the direction forwarded from federal government or MoE. Practically, the main areas where academic staffs make decision in the university are academic Staffs hiring, academic promotion and professional development with some interference from the top-level actors. In general, the governance system of the university seems top down rather than shared one. The university top leaders’ control over the teaching-learning endeavours made academic staffs to feel disrespected. This kind of governance system and other reasons (leaders’ behaviour, lack of transparent leadership, interference, lack of sense of ownership, less concern for quality education, inadequate interpersonal communication) are hindrances to the shared governance practices of the university. Finally, the university and its units need to reconsider the nature of HE in order to promote participation of their academic staffs and to resolve conditions that push academic staffs away from sharing roles in the governance processes...|$|R

As our recognition of the possible impacts increases, so does {{the need for more}} comprehensive model-based approaches to better assess long term impacts and plan precautionary interventions. Such models need to be integrated embracing both the morphological subsystem and the ecological subsystem, and their interactions in the coastal zone. By explicitly considering the "need for integration between different disciplines", this paper briefly describes possible approaches to modelling long-term dynamics of coastal morphology, particularly the modelling of coastal evolution in the typical situation: limited data and limited process knowledge, and further complicated by the variability of the coastal space cover and coastal space use. It is argued that progress in long-term modelling of coastal morphology will be further stimulated by adopting a conceptual framework which can embrace all the data, information, knowledge and experience concerning the coastal system of interest, whatever form they have. The objective can be accomplished by using a top-down modelling conceptual approach which helps to formalise knowledge and experience concerning the coastal area and integrate all the available data, information and models, including qualitative understanding. Qualitative modelling, which defines tendencies of evolution, offers an important tool for this goal.

Achieving data transport reliability on par with that of wired systems, however, can prove extremely challenging in practice. Fortunately, much {{progress has been made}} in developing standard WSN radio protocols for applications from non-critical home automation to mission-critical industrial process control. The relative performances of candidate protocols must be compared in representative aerospace environments, however, to determine their suitability for spaceflight applications. In this paper, we will present the results of a rigorous laboratory analysis of the performance of two standards-based, low power, low data rate WSN protocols: ZigBee Pro and ISA 100. 11 a. Both are based on IEEE 802. 15. 4 and augment that standard's specifications to build complete, multi-hop networking stacks. ZigBee Pro targets primarily the home and office automation markets, providing an ad-hoc protocol that is computationally lightweight and easy to implement in inexpensive system-on-a-chip components. As a result of this simplicity, however, ZigBee Pro can be susceptible to radio frequency (RF) interference. ISA 100. 11 a, on the other hand, targets the industrial process control market, providing a robust, centrally-managed protocol capable of tolerating a significant amount of RF interference. To achieve these gains, a coordinated channel hopping mechanism is employed, which entails a greater computational complexity than ZigBee and requires more sophisticated and costly hardware. To guide future aerospace deployments, we must understand how well these standards relatively perform in analog environments under expected operating conditions. Specifically, we are interested in evaluating goodput [...] application level throughput [...] in a representative crewed environment in the presence of varying levels of 802. 11 g Wi-Fi traffic. To do so, we use the NASA Johnson Space Center Wireless Habitat Testbed (WHT), a metallic, habitation-sized module designed for co-existence testing of wireless systems. In its quiescent state, the sealed WHT provides an RF-quiet environment to which we can selectively add interfering systems; it also provides a realistic level of multi-path self-interference for systems under investigation. In our test, we deploy two representative five node networks, configured in a star topology with all nodes reporting directly to a WSN gateway. Each ZigBee network WSN node is built using a Texas Instruments (TI) CC 2530 system-on-a-chip radio running TI's ZigBee Pro Z-stack. Each ISA 100. 11 a network node is built using a Nivis VersaNode 210 system-on-a-chip radio. In both cases, radios interface with TI MSP 430 -F 5438 microcontroller implementing a common test application. Interference is provided by a D-link 802. 11 g Wi-Fi router transporting traffic generated using the Iperf network testing tool. For the single-channel ZigBee network, effects of both direct and <b>indirect</b> Wi-Fi <b>interference</b> are evaluated. For the channel-hopping ISA 100. 11 a network, effects of interference from multiple Wi-Fi routers configured in non-overlapping 802. 11 g channels are evaluated.

Conversely, the more complex and costly ISA 100. 11 a network continues to perform well as Wi-Fi interference levels increase...|$|R

40|$|Etatism, one of {{the forms}} of state interventionism, is defined in the {{literature}} {{as a means of}} economic policy consisting in earring out by the capitalist state direct economic activity, with the state being an enterpreneur acting on its account and risk. While state interventionism denotes all possible forms of state intervention in economic processes, etatism is treated as a policy of active shaping the economic life by the state as an economic subject using direct means. Etatism still occupies an important place in political economy of capitalist countries, especially those being in the state-monopolistic stage. Despite this, in our economic literature (including university handbooks) and contrary to the situation in years 1918 - 1939, etatism is not called "by its name" and is tacitly identified with state interventionism. Furthermore, etatism is not reflected in classifications and characteristics of means of state interventionism. It makes it difficult or even impossible to understand the essence of etatism, its role in state interventionist policy and the results of its application in particular developmental stages of capitalism. Therefore, in the article an attempt to present in a historical perspective the process of applying etatism in economic policy of a capitalistic state has been undertaken. State property has existed in capitalism {{since the early days of}} that formation. In fact it was reduced (besides the period of the rise of capitalism within feudalism) to some spheres (to a so-called public utility sphere) and as such it played a passive role in the mechanism of functioning of economy. The formation of state property and etatism after the 2 nd World War in conditions of a structural crisis of monopolistic capitalism brought about the in elusion of the economic role of the state into the mechanism of functioning of the economy. The purpose of the state in state-monopolistic capitalism was to introduce structural, organizational and market changes in the economy through direct and <b>indirect</b> means of <b>interference.</b> In that process etatismy is the fullest expression of state interference in economic life. Attempts at reprivatisation carried out in recent years by conservative governments of some capitalist states do not mean any intention to return to liberal economy. They are mostly connected with the change in the structure of state property. The state continues to possess and develop those branches of economy which in its opinion have priority for a further economic developments The problem consists not in rejecting state interventionism, including etatism but in the scope and forms of state interference in economic processes.

40|$|Exotic plant invasion, the {{consequent}} displacement of indigenous flora and subsequent effects on ecosystem health has become of increasing concern to land managers, conservationists and government agencies. Despite the concomitant attention of ecologists and invasion biologists, our empirical {{understanding of the}} impacts and mechanisms of exotic plant invasion remains rudimentary and fragmented and further complicated by species and site specific effects. Exotic plant invasion is of paramount concern in Australia due to the high species endemism and the recent settlement of Europeans (in 1788) which has been paralleled by vast, rapid modification of the landscape. Large expanses of land have subsequently been cleared for agriculture, residential and industrial areas and many exotic species have been introduced, both intentionally and accidentally. As a result, exotic species invasion has become an issue of national significance. In attempt to further our ecological understanding of the impacts, and macro and micro-mechanisms of exotic plant invasion, I have focused my research on the bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera spp. rotundata (DC.) T. Norl.) invasion of the eastern Australian coastal dune systems. Bitou bush has been declared Australia 2 ̆ 7 s sixth worst weed based on its invasibility and impacts on the environment. However there is a paucity of quantitative evidence to support these claims with substantiation being primarily anecdotal. Therefore I aimed to investigate the plant demographic impacts and soil chemistry changes imposed by the invasion and determined whether allelopathy and <b>indirect</b> soil chemical <b>interference</b> are mechanisms facilitating bitou bush invasion in Australia. The demographic response of indigenous plants to the invasion of exotic woody plants has rarely been quantified. I therefore aimed to determine which life history stages of three indigenous plant species: Correa alba var. alba (Andrews; Rutaceae), Monotoca elliptica ((Sm.) R. Br.; Epacridaceae) and Lomandra longifolia (Labill.; Lomandraceae), were more susceptible to the invasion of bitou bush. I also assessed whether various morphological and physiological parameters of the mature stage of these species were affected {{by the presence of}} bitou bush. Populations of all three indigenous species in bitou bush invaded habitats had significantly fewer small individuals and a lower population density than populations in non-invaded habitats. The mean flower production, growth, ratio of reproductive: vegetative buds and physiological stress of mature individuals of each of these species in bitou bush invaded habitat did not differ from those in the non-invaded habitat. However, the flower production of C. alba was significantly more variable in the bitou bush invaded habitat which suggested plasticity in resource allocation in response to the invasion. Increased trait variability was not found for M. elliptica and L. longifolia suggesting mature plant tolerance to the new neighbour. We therefore propose that bitou bush affected indigenous plant populations primarily by preventing recruitment through the germination or seedling growth stages and that older plants typically tolerated the presence of the exotic. The reduction in indigenous plant recruitment is likely to create space that would facilitate bitou bush monoculture formation in the new host environment. A more detailed assessment of the physiological health of mature indigenous plants in invaded habitats was conducted to determine whether there was seasonal effect of the invasion. The photosynthetic efficiency of plants was adopted as an indicator of physiological health. The seasonal photosynthetic patterns of C. alba, M. elliptica and L. longifolia in invaded and non-invaded habitats were assessed using chlorophyll fluorescence. I also examined whether bitou bush altered the habitat physico-chemical parameters which may have lead to any observed changes in the physiological health of mature individuals. All three species exhibited photosynthetic maxima during winter and minima in summer, in contrast to most other Northern hemisphere studies on seasonal photosynthetic patterns. Winter photosynthetic maxima are likely to be facilitated by the autumn rains and cooler winter temperatures of the eastern Australian coast. Differences in the photosynthetic capacity of individuals of all three species among different sites were also detected. Although the invasion of bitou bush significantly altered the canopy cover of C. alba and M. elliptica and moderated the ground level microclimate, I detected no effect on the seasonal photosynthetic patterns of the three species studied, suggesting physiological tolerance to the invasion by mature plants. The reductions in ground incident light and daily maximum temperatures associated with the invasion were likely to be responsible for the reduction in variability of Fv/Fm (physiological stress parameter) detected in autumn for all species. Therefore, I suggest that the photosynthetic patterns of Australian native plants is a function of seasonal climatic and site variability, which was not significantly affected by the microhabitat changes induced by the invasion of bitou bush. Chemical interference is increasingly suggested as a mechanism facilitating exotic plant invasion. I therefore devised a comprehensive bioassay technique that promoted detection and differentiation of phytotoxicty, allelopathy and indirect soil effects of exotic plants by comparing extract inhibition with that of a dominant indigenous plant. Comparison of the bioactivity of comparable extracts from plant parts and soil was integral to the technique. Hydrophilic to hydrophobic solvent extracts of indigenous acacia and exotic bitou bush leaves and roots all exhibited differential phytotoxic effects on a range of indigenous plants. Chemical interference, or allelopathy, between co-evolved plants was found by the hydrophobic extracts of the roots and soil of acacia against a sedge, Isolepis nodosa (Rott.) R. Br. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic extracts of the roots and soil from the exotic bitou bush elicited allelopathic effects against four indigenous species. Additionally, the hydrophobic soil extracts of bitou bush inhibited the germination and growth of Banksia integrifolia and A. longifolia var. sophorae, while the acacia soil extract inhibited the germination of B. integrifolia and Lomandra longifolia. Therefore I suggest that both the indigenous acacia and exotic bitou bush have the potential to chemically inhibit the establishment of indigenous plants, with an additive effect. Eventual monoculture formation by bitou bush is likely to be facilitated by allelopathy against indigenous species and the residual soil inhibition of dominant A. longifolia var. sophorae establishment. To determine whether bitou bush exuded novel compounds into the soil that were not present in the acacia dominated indigenous system, I compared the root and soil chemical profiles of these species. I focused on the hydrophobic extracts of the roots and soil as these were found to be most inhibitory in the laboratory based bioassays. Using solvent based extraction and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, I detected three compounds that were exclusive to the bitou bush root and soil, and seven compounds that were common to the bitou bush and acacia roots but only present in the bitou bush soil. The compounds unique to the bitou bush invaded soil were all sesqui- and diterpenes. Several of these compounds were found to inhibit the seedling growth of a native sedge, Isolepis nodosa. Of particular interest were the sesquiterpenes: β-maaliene, α-isocomene, β-isocomene, δ-cadinene, 5 -hydroxycalamenene and 5 -methoxycalamenene which were found in high concentrations in the bitou bush root and soil and exhibited phytotoxic activity. To confirm that bitou bush alters the soil chemistry of the sand dunes of the eastern Australian coast, we also designed a novel technique to assess the field soil chemical profile. The technique employed adsorbent resin filled bags intended to trap hydrophobic compounds in-situ which were then tested for bioactivity in the laboratory. I compared the hydrophobic chemical profile of soil below bitou bush and acacia to that of unvegetated soil. Similar GC profiles were found to those detected via the solvent extraction method; however, the resin bag technique showed that the alkane series was present in both the bitou bush and acacia soils. Using the resin bag technique, the chemical profile of the bitou bush invaded soil was characterised by a high concentration of sesquiterpenes and was distinct from the indigenous plant soil and bare sand, which were similar except for the presence of a higher concentration of phenolic compounds in the acacia soil and a higher concentration of hexadecanoic acid in the un-vegetated soil. Bioassays of these hydrophobic mixtures showed that the soil inhabited by plants, whether exotic or native, was inhibitory to the growth of an indigenous sedge, compared to the unvegetated soil. Based on the series of experiments conducted, and described above, I suggest that the bitou bush invasion of the eastern Australian coast is likely to affect the recruitment limitation of indigenous species, rather than effects on fecundity and mature plant health. Bitou bush was found to induce a unique soil hydrochemical chemical profile, via two different techniques, which was characterised by high concentrations of several sesquiterpenes and low concentrations of a phenolic compound compared to the acacia profile. Although hydrophobic extracts both the bitou bush and acacia soils inhibited the growth of some indigenous species, the bitou bush inhibited more, including the dominant acacia, which is likely to result in the creation of vacant space and increased opportunities for bitou bush establishment and hence proliferation. Therefore, I suggest that allelopathy is a key mechanism driving the recruitment limitation of indigenous flora and invasion of bitou bush on the eastern Australian coast...|$|R
