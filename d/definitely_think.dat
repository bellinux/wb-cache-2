500|$|In January 2015, showrunners Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters {{confirmed}} that Agent Carter {{was not intended}} to be a miniseries, and that a possible second season would not necessarily be limited to eight episodes like the first. The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015, intended to debut in 2016 of the 2015–16 season during the midseason break of the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later in May, Hayley Atwell stated the season would consist of 10 episodes. Butters explained that this would probably not allow for any standalone episodes, [...] "but I <b>definitely</b> <b>think</b> it allows for more character, because we can have more personal stories built into the framework of the overall arching mystery".|$|E

The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given".

They had an actual case, rather than still setting up who these doppelgangers are." [...] HitFix writer Ryan McGee thought the initial twist over the brothers' identities [...] "was fun", though it [...] "grew old quickly". He praised the series for not [...] "dragging out" [...] Olivia {{discovering}} her true identity, explaining [...] "While episodes set Over There are delicious fun, having Olivia unaware for a long stretch would have strained credibility and perhaps damaged audience opinion of her character’s integrity." [...] Writing for Den of Geek, Billy Grifter commented, [...] "I have three words for the latest Fringe episode, and they're all 'brilliant'. Season three has moved gracefully, like a big cat stalking its prey, from the outset, playing a flipside game where we cleverly alternate between our universe and an alternate one where Olivia is currently resident." [...] Grifter praised the Ashmore brothers' acting as well as their characters' storylines, calling their switch [...] "a nice twist that's cleverly played".|$|E

It was {{sometimes}} hard for me to tell the difference as the editor, it was so close." [...] Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with Glamour for an article titled The Real Black Swan. After this interview, a Black Swan producer contacted her: [...] "He asked if I would please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half." [...] Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: [...] "I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her.

But notwithstanding that, in this hay-scented solitude, looking out of the great door upon the quiet landscape with the white clouds floating over it, he thought of Dora.

[...] I would love her to meet [...] and play golf with him and whup his ass. [...] Jeremy Dyson imagined her as a Bond villain — we filmed for two days in Chislehurst Caves, it was freezing and I was wearing pink, four-inch high heels. But I felt very powerful, and the crew were very much under my command. I think she will like it — {{she seems to have}} a good sense of humour." [...] The portrayal was lauded by viewers and critics alike as well as angering some SNP supporters. Singer Toyah Willcox implored Sturgeon to take the sketch in the right spirit.

It was quite a bizarre scenario. But I thought it was quite clever and quite witty." [...] In an interview for the Metro newspaper during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about Ullman's impersonation of her.

Indi is reluctant to take their relationship to the next level because of an unresolved issue from a previous relationship.

Weaving said that Indi avoids Romeo because she has not got closure over her past relationship.
