Physical and chemical properties, including intersolubility, cold flow properties, spray evaporation, oxidation stability, anti-corrosive property, cleanliness, fire reliability and heating value of twelve different EL–biodiesel–diesel blends were analyzed. The {{results show that the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>blends</b> that were in line with China's national standard for biodiesel <b>blend</b> <b>fuel</b> (B 5) have similar physical and chemical properties to pure diesel with improved cold flow properties. Optimized <b>fuel</b> <b>blends</b> based on grey relational analysis and analytic hierarchy process were selected to evaluate engine performance and emissions using an unmodified diesel engine test bench. The results show that engine power and torque with the <b>fuel</b> <b>blends</b> were in general similar to those with diesel (less than 3 % differences). Both brake specific fuel and energy consumption were lower with the <b>fuel</b> <b>blends</b> than with diesel, suggesting higher fuel conversion efficiencies for the <b>fuel</b> <b>blends.</b> HC (Hydrocarbon) and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions and smoke opacity reduced significantly with the <b>fuel</b> <b>blends</b> compared with diesel while NOx (nitrogen oxides) and CO 2 (carbon dioxide) emissions increased.

The engine was operated at two different engine speed and full load condition with pure diesel fuel, 5 % and 10 % (by vol.) ethanol and n-butanol <b>fuel</b> <b>blends.</b> The coefficient of variation of indicated mean effective pressure {{was used to evaluate}} the cyclic variability of n-butanol-diesel fuel and ethanol-diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>blends.</b> The results obtained in this study showed that effective efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption generally increased {{with the use of the}} n-butanol-diesel fuel or ethanol-diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>blends</b> with respect to that of the neat diesel fuel. The addition of ethanol or n-butanol to diesel fuel caused a decrement in CO and NOx emissions.

SCB-27A vessels utilized a pair of H 8 slotted-tube hydraulic catapults, while the later SCB-27C vessels were fitted {{with a pair of}} C 11 steam catapults, a British innovation (in fact the first four installed, on Hancock and Ticonderoga, were British-built). To accommodate the catapult machinery, the SCB-27C vessels were slightly heavier (43,060 vice 40,600 tons) and after bulging wider abeam (103 vice 101 feet) than their SCB-27A sisters.

5000|$|The {{domestic}} <b>fuel</b> <b>blending</b> {{market and}} the export market for ethanol remain difficult in Ethiopia for several reasons. The technical precision and regulation necessary for successful blending has prevented its success in Ethiopia; major petroleum sellers like Shell, Total, Mobil, and domestic companies such as National Oil resist the blending of ethanol in petroleum fuels because the fuel supply system is poorly regulated and the fuel is sometimes adulterated. [...] Fuel sellers cannot trust the integrity of their fuel if blended with ethanol, because the ethanol may take up water into the fuel and promote phase separation and worsened contamination. [...] As for the export market, Ethiopia’s ethanol production {{is too small to}} attract large international buyers and has only succeeded in selling ethanol at lower prices than other exporters. Ethiopia’s landlocked location also makes export difficult. The local selling of Finchaa’s ethanol, therefore, provides a sustainable opportunity for Ethiopia, with prices that are affordable but also competitive with the potential export market.|$|E

40|$|Urban public {{transportation}} sector {{in general is}} heavily dependent on fossil-oriented fuels, e. g., diesel. Given {{the fact that a}} major proportion of urban pollution and the consequent threats towards public health are attributed to this sector, serious efforts at both technical and political levels have been being made to introduce less-polluting fueling regimes, e. g., partial replacement of diesel with biodiesel. In line with that, the present study was aimed at evaluating the emissions attributed to 5 % blends of waste cooking oil (WCO) and poultry fat (PF) biodiesel fuels (i. e., B 5 -WCO and B 5 -PF <b>fuel</b> <b>blends)</b> when used in urban buses during idle operation mode. Moreover, the attributional and consequential environmental impacts of using these <b>fuel</b> <b>blends</b> were also investigated through a well to wheel life cycle assessment (LCA) by considering the real-world condition combustion data using ten urban buses. The findings of the ALCA revealed that the application of 1 L B 5 -WCO <b>fuel</b> <b>blend</b> could potentially reduce the environmental burdens in human health, ecosystem quality, and resources damage categories compared with using the B 5 -PF <b>fuel</b> <b>blend.</b> The situation was opposite for climate change damage category in which using 1 L B 5 -PF <b>fuel</b> <b>blend</b> had a lower impact on the environment. Overall, the environmental hotspots in the B 5 -WCO and B 5 -PF life cycles were identified as the combustion stage as well as the diesel production and transportation. From the consequential perspective, using 1 L B 5 -WCO <b>fuel</b> <b>blend</b> could potentially decrease the environmental burdens in human health, ecosystem quality, and resources damage categories. While, the situation was different for climate change damage category where using 1 L B 5 -PF <b>fuel</b> <b>blend</b> could have a lower impact on the environment.

50|$|Rautenbach’s {{greatest}} achievement to {{date has}} been in mobilizing investment towards bio-ethanol leading {{to the construction of}} the Green Fuel Chisumbanje ethanol plant modeled along the lines of Brazil’s biofuel cane industry. The ambitious project is a build, operate and transfer partnership between government represented by the Agricultural Rural Development Authority (Arda), Green Fuel Investments (headed by Billy Rautenbach) and two other investment partners - Rating Investments and Macdom Investments. The 20-year pact was signed in February 2009. The project is the biggest so far in Africa. Some sections of the media claim that the project was a land grab because of the huge tracts of land bought by the investors, however, repeated monitoring visits by officials from the Zimbabwean government, the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization qualified the industrial development as necessary for the poverty stricken district (see below - creation of jobs). The ethanol project has subsequently set records for Zimbabwe as being the first African country with flexi-fuel vehicle technology using blends of up to 85% ethanol and reducing the country's fuel import bill, creating over 4,500 jobs and leading Zimbabwe to a greener economy. By contributing to the production of ethanol based fuel, Green fuel has helped the country to save at least $2 million every month in fuel imports. However, the mandatory <b>fuel</b> <b>blending</b> imposed by the government on behalf of Green Fuel has been met with disdain and viewed as a symbol of Rautenbach's far reaching influence on the ZANU-PF led government.|$|E

In on-site sanitation technologies, <b>fuel</b> <b>blending</b> is proposed as a pre-treatment requirement to reduce moisture levels and improve the physiochemical properties of raw faeces prior to drying. This study investigates the co-combustion performance of wood dust: raw human faeces blends at varying air-to-fuel ratios in a bench-scale combustor test rig. It concludes with ash composition analyses and discusses their potential application and related problems. The study shows that a 50 : 50 wood dust (WD) : raw human faeces (FC) can reduce moisture levels in raw human faeces by ∼ 40 % prior to drying. The minimum acceptable blend for treating moist faeces without prior drying at a combustion air flow rate of 14 – 18 L/min is 30 : 70 WD: FC. For self-sustained ignition and flame propagation, the minimum combustion temperature required for conversion of the fuel to ash is ∼ 400 °C. The most abundant elements in faecal ash are potassium and calcium, while elements such as nickel, aluminium and iron are in trace quantities.
