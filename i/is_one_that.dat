5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> {{is lower than the}} mean free path of the photons. A long distance <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E

5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional. Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E

5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> occurs {{without an}} apparent cause {{and in the}} absence of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E

On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E

As defined by DART, a deferred station <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has been identified, but will not be constructed until land use changes warrant {{the construction of a}} station. In addition to the deferred stations, the network also features a single ghost station, the Knox–Henderson Station.

5|$|The {{difficulty}} for Defoe's contemporaries in assessing whether {{the work was}} ironic was {{the proximity of the}} speaker's voice to that of the High Anglicans whose views are being ridiculed. The pamphlet mixes both real observation and fabrication, and assumes the rhetorical style of his target. Defoe uses and imitates the language and metaphor of fanatical churchman, particularly Sacheverell's sermons; the speaker's comparison of the Dissenters to vipers <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> Sacheverell often made. Although The Shortest Way does not parody the genre of the Anglican sermon, it does deploy some of the same structures; the initial Aesopic fable of the Cock and the Horses is expanded upon in a way that parallels the use of a biblical quotation to initiate a sermon.|$|E

5|$|Austen's novels have {{resulted}} in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance, and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, The Bennets (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.|$|E

5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Harry and Ron, Hagrid left {{a set of}} {{instructions:}} {{to follow}} the spiders currently fleeing into the Forbidden Forest, which they do, {{only to find the}} monster blamed for the attacks fifty years before, a massive spider named Aragog, who explains to the duo that the real monster <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> spiders fear above all others. Hermione provides the last set of clues that inform them of the monster’s identity: It is a basilisk, (hence Harry’s ability to understand it,) that kills with a stare (although no one is dead because of various devices through which they indirectly saw the monster) and which spiders (such as Aragog and his offspring) fear above all others. Harry figures out from hints Aragog dropped that a student who died during the previous attacks is Myrtle, and when Ginny is apparently taken by the monster into the Chamber, they discover that the entrance is in the bathroom they’ve been using to make Polyjuice Potion. Harry, Ron, and Lockhart enter the Chamber, but the dunderheaded professor (who reveals that he’s a fraud) causes a rockfall upon attempt to modify the boys’ memories with Ron’s damaged wand, and Harry must enter alone. He arrives to find Ginny in a weakened state being watched over by a shadowy, ghostly Riddle, who explains that he is not only the heir of Slytherin, but also grew up to become Voldemort himself, before setting the basilisk upon Harry; Harry defeats the monster, with the help of Dumbledore's Phoenix, and the Sword of Gryffindor drawn from the Sorting Hat, and destroys the diary, which makes Riddle disappear.|$|E
5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E

5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of shoes were observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E

5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} {{incentives}} were virtually non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.|$|E
