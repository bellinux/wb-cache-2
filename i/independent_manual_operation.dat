40|$|AbstractManual tasks play an {{important}} role in social sustainable manufacturing enterprises. Commonly, <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> are used for low volume productions, but are not limited to. Operational models in manufacturing systems based on “x-to-order” paradigms (e. g. assembly-to-order) may require <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> to speed-up the ramp-up time of new product configuration assemblies. The implications of <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> in any production line may imply that any manufacturing or assembly process become more susceptible to human errors and therefore translate into delays, defects and/or poor product quality. In this scenario, virtual and augmented realities can offer significant advantages to support the human operator in <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> This research work presents the development of a mixed (virtual and augmented) reality assistance system that permits real-time support in <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> A review of mixed reality techniques and technologies was conducted, where it was determined to use a projection mapping solution for the proposed assistance system. According to the specific requirements of the demonstration environment, hardware and software components were chosen. The developed mixed reality assistance system was able to guide any user without any prior knowledge through the successful completion of the specific assembly task...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. In high-value {{manufacturing}} sectors, many manufacturing processes are still performed manually, such as polishing operations for small metallic parts. Increasing volume, {{the need for}} consistency in quality, and health and safety issues {{are some of the}} reasons for industry to search urgently for alternative solutions for manual polishing processes. This article reports the development of an intelligent automated polishing system to achieve consistent surface quality and removal of superficial defects from high-value components, such as those used in aerospace industry. The article reports an innovative method to capture manual polishing processes by skilled operators. The captured polishing parameters are then used to develop and control a robotic polishing system that can adopt various polishing patterns. A brief summary of existing fully and semi-automated polishing systems and their inadequacy for industrial applications are discussed. The need for building automation system based on <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> are explained and a systematic data capturing process for a specific aerospace-based component is defined. The development of the process capturing device is explained, the data analysis and interpretations are discussed and the migration from <b>manual</b> <b>operation</b> to an automated polishing system is reported. Further detailed information is given in relation with combining data from various sensors and building of an automated system based on learning from <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> The research results are also briefly discussed and conclusions are drawn regarding applicability of automated systems for highly skilled <b>manual</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceA simple {{assembly}} line balancing problem is considered provided that number m of working stations is fixed. In such a problem, denoted as SALBP- 2, {{it is necessary}} to minimize a cycle time for processing a partially ordered set of operations V = { 1, 2, [...] ., n} on a set of m linearly ordered (working) stations. An initial vector of the processing times t of the operations V is given. And for each automated operation, the processing time cannot vary during a life cycle of the {{assembly line}}. For each <b>manual</b> <b>operation,</b> the processing times may vary, since different workers may have different skill, experience, etc. We investigate a stability of the optimal line balance of the simple assembly line with respect to simultaneous variations of the processing times of the <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> An optimal line balance is stable if it remains optimal for any sufficiently small variations of the processing times of the <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> We propose an algorithm and a program in C++ for constructing all the stable optimal line balances for the problem SALBP- 2.

40|$|Camera {{calibration}} plays {{a critical}} role in 3 D computer vision tasks. The most commonly used calibration method utilizes a planar checkerboard and can be done nearly fully automatically. However, it requires the user to move either the camera or the checkerboard during the capture step. This <b>manual</b> <b>operation</b> is time consuming and makes the calibration results unstable. In order to solve the above problems caused by <b>manual</b> <b>operation,</b> this paper presents a full-automatic camera calibration method using a virtual pattern instead of a physical one. The virtual pattern is actively transformed and displayed on a screen so that the control points of the pattern can be uniformly observed in the camera view. The proposed method estimates the camera parameters from point correspondences between 2 D image points and the virtual pattern. The camera and the screen are fixed during the whole process; therefore, the proposed method does not require any <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> Performance of the proposed method is evaluated through experiments on both synthetic and real data. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve stable results and its accuracy is comparable to the standard method by Zhang...|$|R
