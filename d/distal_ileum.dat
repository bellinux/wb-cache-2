40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether 2 distinct chlamydial isolates recovered from the intestines and feces of diarrheic nursery pigs could cause intestinal lesions in gnotobiotic pigs. Both isolates share biological characteristics with Chlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydial isolates R 27 and R 19 were propagated in Vero cells or embryonated eggs, respectively, and suspended in sucrose-phosphate-glutamine buffer with 10 % fetal bovine serum for inoculation. Sham inocula were prepared from uninfected cell culture lysates and from uninfected eggs. Each piglet was fed 1 ml of inoculum or sham inoculum at 3 - 4 days of age. Ten piglets were each fed 109 inclusion-forming-units (IFU) and 14 piglets were each fed 106 IFU of isolate R 27; 5 control piglets were fed sham inoculum. Twenty piglets were each fed 105 IFU R 19; 5 control piglets were fed sham inoculum. All infected piglets developed diarrhea 4 - 5 days postinfection (DPI). Most piglets fed 109 IFU R 27 became anorexic, dehydrated, and weak and were necropsied 4 - 7 DPI. Piglets fed 106 IFU R 27 or 105 IFU R 19 were necropsied 4, 7, 10, 14, and 18 DPI. Diarrhea, although never profuse, persisted in the piglets fed 106 IFU R 27 or 105 IFU R 19 through 12 DPI. At necropsy, all diarrheic piglets had watery colonic contents with flecks of undigested curd. In small intestine, histologic lesions were seen most consistently in <b>distal</b> jejunum and <b>ileum.</b> <b>Distal</b> jejunum and <b>ileum</b> from piglets fed 109 IFU R 27 and necropsied 4 - 5 DPI were characterized by villus atrophy and multifocal necrosis of villi; necrosis was limited to the tips or apical one half of villi. Mild to severe villus atrophy, lymphangitis, and perilymphangitis were seen in the <b>distal</b> jejunum and <b>ileum</b> from all infected piglets 7 and 10 DPI. Colon from 1 infected piglet necropsied 10 DPI had mild focal serositis; significant colonic lesions were not seen in the other infected piglets. Immunostaining done on sections of <b>distal</b> jejunum and <b>ileum</b> revealed chlamydial antigen in villus enterocytes, occasional goblet cells, and occasional cryptal enterocytes and in foci of lymphangitis and perilymphangitis; the amount of detectable chlamydial antigen decreased after 4 DPI. In colon, sparse positive staining was seen in surface enterocytes and cryptal enterocytes. Ultrastructural examination of ileal villus enterocytes revealed chlamydiae, often together with glycogen particles, in vacuoles or occasionally free in the cytoplasm. The results indicated that the swine chlamydial isolates used in this study are intestinal pathogens in gnotobiotic pigs...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether a strain of Chlamydia suis shown previously to be an intestinal pathogen in gnotobiotic piglets could cause diarrhea and intestinal lesions in young weanling pigs. Pigs from 2 sows were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Group 1 included 13 pigs that were weaned at 24 hours of age and then housed in isolator units and fed milk replacer and unmedicated starter ration. Group 2 included 8 pigs that nursed their respective sows, consumed unmedicated starter ration, and were weaned at 21 days of age. Ten pigs in group 1 and 6 pigs in group 2 were inoculated orally with 4 x 10 S inclusion-forming units of C. suis strain R 27 at 21 days of age. Control pigs were inoculated with sham inoculum. The pigs were necropsied 5 – 14 days postinoculation (DPI). None of the Chlamydia-infected pigs developed diarrhea. Villus atrophy was seen histologically in sections of ileum from Chlamydia-infected pigs in both groups 5 and 7 days DPI. Lymphangitis and multiple lymphohistiocytic and neutrophilic aggregates were seen in the submucosa, tunica muscularis, and serosa of the <b>distal</b> jejunum, <b>ileum,</b> and colon from Chlamydia-infected pigs in both groups 5 – 14 DPI. Immunostaining of sections of <b>distal</b> jejunum, <b>ileum,</b> and colon from infected pigs revealed chlamydial antigen in intestinal epithelium and in foci of lymphangitis/inflammation. The results indicated that C. suis strain R 27 can cause intestinal lesions in young weanling pigs, and the lesions are similar to those seen in gnotobiotic piglets. The results also indicated that strain R 27 causes asymptomatic intestinal infections in young weanling pigs, at least under the conditions of this study...|$|R

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of T. suis is direct and does not require any {{intermediate}} host. Eggs are passed in feces from infected animals, but are single-celled and are not initially infectious. Infective J1 stage larvae develop within the shell in 3 weeks to 2 months, depending on environmental temperature. The infective J1 stage within the egg is highly resistant and can remain in this form for several years in favorable conditions. Once the infective J1 egg is ingested, the bipolar plugs are digested and the J1 larvae hatch in the small intestine and cecum. The J1 larvae penetrate the mucosa via the crypts of Lieberkühn in the <b>distal</b> <b>ileum,</b> cecum, and colon. During the next 5 weeks, the larvae undergo four molts (J2, J3, J4) to the adult stage (J5) within the mucosal layers. The adult’s thicker posterior one-third then emerges through the mucosal surface into the lumen while the thin anterior two-thirds remains embedded in the mucosal layers. Adults can be recovered anywhere from the <b>distal</b> <b>ileum</b> to the rectum, but most {{are located in the}} cecum and proximal colon. The prepatent period is 6 to 8 weeks and life span is 4 to 5 months.|$|E
40|$|Lysine {{transport}} by {{in vitro}} <b>distal</b> rabbit <b>ileum</b> {{has been investigated}} by determining (a) transmural fluxes across short-circuited segments of the tissue; (b) accumulation by mucosal strips; and (c) influx from the mucosal solution across the brush border into the epithelium. Net transmural flux of lysine is considerably smaller than that of alanine. However, lysine influx across the brush border and lysine accumulation by mucosal strips are quantitatively comparable to alanine influx and accumulation. Evidence is presented that the "low transport capacity" of rabbit ileum for lysine is due to: (a) a carrier-mediated process responsible for efflux of lysine out of the cell across the serosal and/or lateral membranes that {{is characterized by a}} low maximal velocity; and (b) a high "backflux" of lysine out of the cell across the mucosal membrane.

40|$|The topical {{effect of}} {{methotrexate}} (MTX) on small intestinal hexose and ion transport {{has been studied}} using an in vivo steady state jejunal perfusion technique in the rat, and short circuited rabbit terminal ileum in Ussing chambers in vitro.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{addition}} of actively transported sugars {{to the solution}} bathing the mucosal surface of an in vitro preparation of <b>distal</b> rabbit <b>ileum</b> results in a rapid increase in the transmural potential difference, the short-circuit current, {{and the rate of}} active Na transport from mucosa to scrosa. These effects arc dependent upon the active transport of the sugar per se and arc independent of the metabolic fate of the transported sugar. Furthermore, they arc inhibited both by low concentrations of phlorizin in the mucosal solution and by low concentrations of ouabain in the scrosal solution. The increase in the short-circuit current, A/e~, requires the presence of Na in the pcrfusion medium and its magnitude is a linear function of the Na concentration. On the other hand, A/co is a saturable function of the mucosal sugar concentration which is consistent with Michaclis-Mcntcn kinetics suggesting that the increase in active Na transport is stoichiomctrically related to the rate of active sugar transport. An interpretation of these findings in terms of a hypothetical model for intestinal Na and sugar transport is presented...|$|R

50|$|Gallstone ileus {{is a rare}} form {{of small}} bowel {{obstruction}} caused by an impaction of a gallstone within the lumen (small opening) of the small intestine. Such a gallstone is hypothesized to enter the bowel via a cholecysto-enteric fistula. The presence of large stones, >2.5 cm in diameter, within the gallbladder are thought to predispose to fistula formation by gradual erosion through the gallbladder fundus. Once a fistula has formed, a stone may travel from the gallbladder into the bowel and become lodged almost anywhere along the GI tract.

5000|$|GLP-1 is {{released}} in a biphasic pattern with an early phase after 10-15 minutes {{followed by a}} longer second phase after 30-60 minutes upon meal ingestion. As the majority of L-cells {{are located in the}} <b>distal</b> <b>ileum</b> and colon, the early phase is likely explained by neural signalling, gut peptides or neurotransmitters. Other evidence suggest that the amount of L-cells located in the proximal jejunum is sufficient to account for the early phase secretion through direct contact with luminal nutrients. Less controversially, the second phase is likely caused by direct stimulation of L-cells by digested nutrients. The rate of gastric emptying is therefore an important aspect to consider, as it regulates the entry of nutrients into the small intestines where the direct stimulation occurs. Interestingly, one of the actions of GLP-1 is to inhibit gastric emptying, thus slowing down its own secretion upon postprandial activation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract With {{functional}} evidence emerging that interstitial {{cells of}} Cajal (ICC) {{play a role}} in smooth muscle innervation, detailed knowledge is needed about the structural aspects of enteric innervation of the human gut. Conventional electronmicroscopy (EM), immunohistochemistry and immuno-EM were performed on the musculature of the <b>distal</b> human <b>ileum</b> focusing on ICC associated with the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) and intramuscular ICC (ICC-IM). ICC-DMP could be identified by EM but not by c-Kit immunohistochemistry. Immuno-EM revealed that ICC-DMP were innervated by both cholinergic and nitrergic nerves, and were the only cells to possess specialized synapse-like junctions with nerve varicosities and gap junction contacts with smooth muscle cells. c-Kit positive ICC near the deep muscular plexus were not ICC-DMP, but ICC-IM located in septa. ICC-IM were innervated by both cholinergic and nitrergic nerves but without special-ized contacts. Varicosities of both nerve types were also found scattered throughout the musculature without specialized contact with any ICC. No ICC showed immunoreactivity for neuronal nitric oxide synthase. As ICC-DMP form synapse-like junctions with cholinergic and nitrergic nerves and gap junction contacts with muscle cells, it is hypothesized that ICC-DMP hold a specialized function related to innervation of smooth muscle of the human intestine...|$|R
