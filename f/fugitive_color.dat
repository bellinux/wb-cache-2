50|$|Borate salts used in {{the past}} to fight {{wildfires}} have been found to sterilize the soil and be toxic to animals so are now prohibited. Newer retardants use ammonium sulfate or ammonium polyphosphate with attapulgite clay thickener or diammonium phosphate with a guar gum derivative thickener. These are not only less toxic but act as fertilizers to help the regrowth of plants after the fire. Fire retardants often contain wetting agents, preservatives and rust inhibitors and are colored red with ferric oxide or <b>fugitive</b> <b>color</b> to mark where they have been dropped. Brand names of fire retardants for aerial application include Fire-Trol and Phos-Chek.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of a lake pigment from madder {{seems to have been}} first invented by the ancient Egyptians. [...] Several techniques and recipes developed. Ideal color was said to come from plants 18 to 28 months old that had been grown in calcareous soil, which is full of lime and typically chalky. Most were considered relatively weak and extremely fugitive until 1804, when the English dye maker George Field refined the technique of making a lake from madder by treating it with alum and an alkali.The resulting madder lake had a less <b>fugitive</b> <b>color</b> and could be used more efficaciously, for example by blending it into a paint. Over the following years, other metal salts, including those containing chromium, iron, and tin, were found to be usable in place of alum to give madder-based pigments of various other colors.|$|E
40|$|Throughout Japanese textile history, Kyokechi or itajime shibori {{has been}} known as a resist dyeing process wherein a piece of folded cloth is {{sandwiched}} between wooden boards clamped tightly to protect selective areas of fabric from dye. This paper introduces a lesser known group of itajime textiles called beni ita, beni itajime, Kyo beni [...] fine, lightweight silks patterned by clamp resist using boards carved with pictorial designs of flowers, birds, etc. These silks were used exclusively for under layers [...] shitagi, an underkimono worn by women in the latter Edo Period (1603 - 1867) through the Meiji Period (1868 - 1912) and into early Showa (1926 - 89). Because they were under layers, these textiles have been overlooked and given little documentation or serious study until recently. Kyoto, the Imperial capital from 741 - 1869, was for centuries the center of fine silk dyeing. Certain fabrics were prized, like momi [...] a fine red silk dyed with beni, the precious red <b>fugitive</b> <b>color</b> from safflower petals, {{one of the most}} expensive dyes in history. Kyoto had a monopoly on production of beni itajime silk until the 18 th century. Then beni dyeing began in Takasaki in Gunma Prefecture which had long been a production center for lightweight silk. A recent discovery of an archive from a dyework in Takasaki revealed that in 1845 substitutes for safflower were used: sappan (Caesalpinia sappan L.) and turmeric (Curcuma longa L.). In 1875, newly introduced chemical red dyes were adopted. The manufacturing of red itajime silk began thereafter, capturing the popular market. This illuminating archive contains 74 carved boards and documentation that sheds significant light on the research of Japanese clamp resist dyeing methods...|$|E
6000|$|For a wild {{moment a}} strange fancy seized her usually sane intellect and stirred her {{temperate}} blood. The news they {{had told her}} was not true; he had been hung, and this was his ghost! He looked as white and spirit-like in the moonlight, dressed in the same clothes, as {{when she saw him}} last. He had evidently seen her approaching, and moved quickly to meet her. But in his haste he stumbled slightly; she reflected suddenly that ghosts did not stumble, and a feeling of relief came over her. And it was no assassin of her father that had been prowling around--only this unhappy <b>fugitive.</b> A momentary <b>color</b> came into her cheek; her coolness and hardihood returned; it was with a tinge of sauciness in her voice that she said:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Chrystos is a Lesbian- and Two-Spirit-{{identified}} writer, who {{is identified}} with the pronoun [...] "they". Born off-reservation in San Francisco, California {{as part of a}} group called Urban Indians, Chrystos was taught to read by their father, who was self-educated, and began writing poetry at age nine. English was not their first language, and the first version of English that they learned was Black American Street slang because of their residence in the projects, which they were later scolded and humiliated for. They also suffered sexual abuse by a relative. Chrystos experienced an emotional and abnormal childhood due to an abusive and depressed Euro-immigrant mother and a father who was ashamed of his Menominee heritage. At the age of seventeen, Chrystos was put into a mental institution for a summer, and claims that they may not have survived on the streets if that had not happened. They continued to put theirself {{in and out of the}} nuthouse for ten years until they realized that it was making the pain worse. Inspired by what they describe as the pain that white culture caused their father, their writing introduces a diverse mixture of characters and ideas and focuses on social justice issues, reaching towards a better understanding of how issues such as colonialism, genocide, class and gender affect the lives of women and Native people. Much of their childhood is evident in their writing about street life, gardening, nuthouses, incest, the Man, love, sex, and hate. Their work is mainly for First Nations people, people of color, and lesbians. They also try to raise awareness of Native American heritage and culture, while breaking down stereotypes. They have published many works including Not Vanishing, Dream On, In Her I Am, <b>Fugitive</b> <b>Colors,</b> Fire Power, Red Rollercoaster, and Wilde Reis, and self-illustrated many of the book covers. Their works are published by printing presses in Canada due to America's censorship and the [...] "very little support for writers". They edit minimally by reading the work aloud and sometimes removing words or changing the way that the lines appear. Breaths, thought, and correlation organize the lines of their poems, in which they use visuals to create orality. Chrystos claims that poetry and oral readings are not separate. They hide internal rhymes, puns, word play, and clich√©s in their poems. They describe themselves as a political poet. Numerous awards including NEA, Human Rights Freedom Of Expression, Sappho Award of Distinction from the Astrea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, Barbara Demming Grant, and they also won the Aude Lorde International Poetry Competition have been awarded to Chrystos Chrystos was inspired by the work of Audre Lorde, Joy Harjo, Elizabeth Woody, and Lillian Pitt, among others International novels are their preference, because they find the American publishing industry to be too nostalgic of white supremacy. Activism work by Chrystos includes working to free Norma Jean Croy and Leonard Peltier, and working for the rights of tribes such as Dine and Mohawk. They have lived on Bainbridge Island, Washington since 1980.|$|R
