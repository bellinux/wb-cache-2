40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the provision of}} networking facilities in a customisable operating system called Arena. Customisable operating systems allow applications to <b>determine</b> their <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> management, so that an application can execute optimally on a particular architecture. On distributed architectures there are opportunities for tailoring message passing, virtual shared memory and distributed persistent store abstractions for particular applications. However, in all these cases, the eciency of the network management is a critical determinant of performance. Arena seeks to balance exible distributed resource management with ecient network handling. Arena provides an optimised form of network message transfer which avoids unnecessary copying, and allows the application control over the processing of the message. Performance gures are given for Arena network transfer on a distributed store multicomputer, and are compared with results from a microkernel-based operating system on the same hardware...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} an agent-based model, {{in which}} agents set their prices to maximize profit. At steady state the market self-organizes into three groups: excess producers, consumers and balanced agents, with prices <b>determined</b> by their <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> level {{and a couple}} of macroscopic parameters that emerge naturally from the analysis, akin to mean-field parameters in statistical mechanics. When resources are scarce prices rise sharply below a turning point that marks the disappearance of excess producers. To compare the model with real empirical data, we study the relations between commodity prices and stock-to-use ratios of a range of commodities such as agricultural products and metals. By introducing an elasticity parameter to mitigate noise and long-term changes in commodities data, we confirm the trend of rising prices, provide evidence for turning points, and indicate yield points for less essential commodities.

2500|$|In {{response}} to this labor crisis, the AFL-CIO made many attempts to renew its labor movement in the 1980s, {{but none of them}} were successful. However, in 1988, an AFL-CIO organized teleconference of trade unionists recognized the potential of the nascent organizing model, gave it its name, and resolved to spread it throughout the trade-union movement: this was an element in the model's popularization. After the teleconference, the AFL-CIO, according to Hurd, established the [...] "Organizing Institute," [...] and the goal of the institute was [...] "...to train union organizers." [...] While, as Richard Hurd suggests, the attempts at reigniting the flame of union membership were largely unsuccessful, in 1995, former SEIU President John Sweeney was elected president of the AFL-CIO on the New Voice slate, on a platform of spreading the organizing model across the members of the federation. According to Richard Hurd, when Sweeney took over, he created an [...] "Organizing Department" [...] to enhance the strategy of employing the organizing model throughout the AFL-CIO, and he encouraged unions to begin [...] "...devoting 30% of their budgets to recruitment." [...] The extent of the success of this is disputed, with some suggesting that more rhetoric has changed than anything, but it did have at least some effect. Richard Hurd suggests that [...] "The reality is that the individual national unions <b>determine</b> their <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> allocations and develop their own organizing programs," [...] but [...] "Most unions have increased the funding of their organizing departments, and many have devoted substantial resources to the effort." [...] This is how the AFL-CIO tried to implement the organizing model in {{response to}} the membership crisis.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} serious criticisms of the status quo with respect to the EU budget {{represents}} the lack of a link between the EU policy and the system of <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> Strengthening the link between reaching smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the EU system of <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> by introducing tax-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> could contribute to decrease the existing sustainability gaps in taxation in the European Union. This research demonstrates that the introduction of the Common (Consolidated) Corporate Tax Base (hereinafter as C(C) CTB) could be an important contribution to close the existing sustainability gaps in tax regimes in the EU. To research the revenue potential of the C(C) CTB, a model based on a remittance system was designed. The system foresees the replacement of the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> (resp. GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resource)</b> through the transfer of a part of the corporate tax revenues based on the C(C) CTB raised on the national level to the EU budget. The results of the research show that the C(C) CTB-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> would be able to fully replace the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource,</b> with the only exception of Cyprus. However, the C(C) CTB-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> cannot be considered to be a sufficient resource to fully replace the GNI-base <b>own</b> <b>resource.</b> Therefore, we recommend C(C) CTB only in connection with the replacement of the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource.</b> FairTa...|$|R

40|$|Although  the  responsibility  for  realizing  the  Europe   2020  strategy  is  shared  between the EU and its 28 member states, {{the main}} {{criticism}} of the current EU budget relates {{to the lack of}} a link between the budget and Europe 2020  strategy.  Therefore a new  budget design as well as alternative revenue sources is currently explored within a  mid-term review. One of the possible candidates is a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT). To research FTT revenue potential, a model based on  a remittance system was designed. We analyse full or partial replacement of VAT- and GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> by the transfer of the tax revenues from a FTT raised on a national level to the EU budget. The research reveals that FTT-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> would be able to fully replace GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> and VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> only for some EU member states. However, the results also show that, from the EU 11 (28) perspective, the tax is sufficient to fully replace VAT- or GNI-contributions if levied on the EU 11 (28) level (not on the national level) as a direct payment to the EU budget without tracking the source Member State.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the EU financing reform, where the lump-sum tax is considered as an alternative source of revenue. The purpose of this study stems out of the current debate related to the EU budget reform, where tax-based own-resources are required to replace the current system of <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> of the EU budget. The novelty of this research arises from the evaluation of a hypothetical EU lump-sum tax as a future replacement of GNI and VAT-based EU budget own sources. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the potential of a lump-sum tax as a source of future EU funding. We consider lump-sum tax as an EU per capita charge applicable to all citizens of 28 EU member states. In order to assess the lump-sum tax potential we simulate five different lump-sum tax rates and compare the obtained yield to current EU <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> The results of the research show that a charge per capita in the EU does not have the capacity to fully replace GNI or VAT-based EU <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> Therefore, we consider the EU per capita charge as a form of complementary source to fund the EU own budget, with no real potential to fully replace the current EU <b>own</b> <b>resources...</b>|$|R
