40|$|Deactivation of glutamatergic {{signaling}} in {{the brain}} is mediated by glutamate uptake into glia and neurons by glutamate transporters. Glutamate transporters are sodium-dependent proteins that putatively rely indirectly on Na,K-ATPases to generate ion gradients that <b>drive</b> <b>transmitter</b> uptake. Based on anatomical colocalization,mutual sodiumdependency, and the inhibitory effects of theNa,K-ATPase inhibitor ouabain on glutamate transporter activity, we postulated that glutamate transporters are directly coupled to Na,K-ATPase and that Na,K-ATPase is an essential modulator of glutamate uptake. Na,K-ATPase was purified from rat cerebellum by tandem anion exchange and ouabain affinity chromatography, and the cohort of associated proteins was characterized bymass spectrometry. The 1 – 3 subunits of Na,K-ATPase were detected, as were the glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT- 1, demonstrating that glutamate transporters copurify with Na,K-ATPases. The link between glutamate transporters and Na,K-ATPase was further established by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization. Analysis of the regulation of glutamate transporter and Na,K-ATPase activities was assessed using [3 H]D-aspartate, [3 H]L-glutamate, and rubidium- 86 uptake into synaptosomes and cultured astrocytes. In synaptosomes, ouabain produced a dose-dependent inhibition of glutamate transporter and Na,K-ATPase activities,whereas in astrocytes, ouabain showedabimodal effectwhereby glutamate transporter activitywas stimulated at 1 M ouabain and inhibited at higher concentrations. The effects of protein kinase inhibitors on [3 H]D-aspartate uptake indicated the selective involvement of Src kinases, which are probably {{a component of the}} Na,K-ATPase/glutamate transporter complex.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that transmitter release facilitation at synapses is largely mediated by presynaptic Ca 2 + current facilitation, but the exact contribution of Ca 2 + current facilitation has not been determined quantitatively. Here, we determine the contribution of Ca 2 + current facilitation, and of an increase in the residual free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in the nerve terminal, to paired-pulse facilitation of transmitter release at the calyx of Held. Under conditions of low release probability imposed by brief presynaptic voltage-clamp steps, transmitter release facilitation at short interstimulus intervals (4 ms) was 227 ± 31 % of control, Ca 2 + current facilitation was 113 ± 4 % of control, and the peak residual [Ca 2 +]i was 252 ± 18 nm over baseline. By inferring the ‘local’[Ca 2 +]i transients that <b>drive</b> <b>transmitter</b> release during these voltage-clamp stimuli {{with the help of a}} kinetic release model, we estimate that Ca 2 + current facilitation contributes to ∼ 40 % to paired-pulse facilitation of transmitter release. The remaining component of facilitation strongly depends on the build-up, and on the decay of the residual free [Ca 2 +]i, but cannot be explained by linear summation of the residual free [Ca 2 +]i, and the back-calculated ‘local’[Ca 2 +]i signal, which only accounts for ∼ 10 % of the total release facilitation. Further voltage-clamp experiments designed to compensate for Ca 2 + current facilitation demonstrated that about half of the observed transmitter release facilitation remains in the absence of Ca 2 + current facilitation. Our results indicate that paired-pulse facilitation of transmitter release at the calyx of Held is driven by at least two distinct mechanisms: Ca 2 + current facilitation, and a mechanism independent of Ca 2 + current facilitation that closely tracks the time course of residual free [Ca 2 +]i...|$|R

The full array consists of twelve evenly spaced, identical current strap modules connected in pairs. Each pair is connected as a half-wave resonant loop and {{is intended to be}} <b>driven</b> by one <b>transmitter,</b> allowing rapid phase shift between transmitters. A decoupling network compensates for the mutual inductive coupling between adjacent current straps, effectively isolating the six transmitters from one another.

40|$|Abstract—Companding schemes {{are widely}} {{employed}} {{to reduce the}} peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This paper considers the classes of linear and nonlinear companding schemes and derives a sufficient condition under which the bit error rate (BER) performance of one is superior {{to that of the}} other. The high PAPR of the OFDM signal <b>drives</b> the <b>transmitter’s</b> power amplifier into its nonlinear region, thus causing nonlinear distortions. In the literature, signal companding is one of the widely used techniques for PAPR reduction. Furthermore, it has been claimed, based on simulation results, that linear companding performs better, in terms of BER, than nonlinear companding for an optimized set of companding parameters. In this paper, we derive sufficient conditions under which these claims are valid. The conditions derived also show that, in practice, nonlinear companding transforms perform better than linear companding transform. Our theoretical analysis is supported by simulation results.

For exemplification, three different resonant frequencies, namely 60 kHz, 100 kHz and 140 kHz, are selected to energize three DC motors.

This paper reports about an rf amplifier development, which should allow to improve the rf power level {{as well as the}} reliability significantly. An electron beam is directly coupled with one girder of an H-type structure by a two gap-array. In contrast to the bunch formation in klystrons a chopper technique is applied to get reasonable mechanical dimensions for the amplifier at frequencies below 400 MHz. A high perveance beam from a pierce-type electron gun is chopped in two steps by passage along the magnetic field of a solenoid and superposition of a transverse rf electric field (two harmonics) and of a transverse electrostatic field, respectively. The deflected particles are dumped in a depressed collector while the penetrating electron bunch may be post-accelerated additionally before entering the H-type cavity.

The system {{is composed of}} two units: a system-on-a-chip (SoC) transmitter (Tx) unit and a receiver (Rx) unit. In the Tx unit, the outputs are combined with marker signals and modulated into pulse widths after the neural signals are amplified and filtered by an array of low-noise amplifiers (LNA). The next step involves time-division multiplexing (TDM) of pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals. The TDM-PWM signal <b>drives</b> RF <b>transmitter</b> block and is transmitted by an antenna. To satisfy the needs of neuroscientists during animal experiments, the proposed WINeR system provides long-term recording with inductive powering and stimulus-artifact rejection for closed-loop operations, which requires simultaneous stimulation and recording. The Rx is another critical unit for wireless-link communication. To increase the area of wireless coverage, multiple antennas are used for the Rx. In addition, the automatic frequency-tracking method is used to track free-running Tx frequencies, and a smart time-to-digital conversion method is used to reduce noise and interference.
