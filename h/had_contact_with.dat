5|$|Birckenbuehl's son Charlie is kidnapped {{from his}} bedroom, again subdued with a cattle prod. Andrews and Black {{discover}} that the boy's goldfish had been poisoned with whiskey, which {{they believe to be}} another message like Comstock's number. The town's swimming instructor, Adam Burke (Brian Taylor) is interviewed, as he <b>had</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> both missing boys through his coaching. Black discovers that Burke's son had been killed in a hit-and-run accident; Black also receives post containing a paint swatch with the number 528 on it, but he is unsure of its meaning.|$|E
5|$|In Berlin Busoni was at {{the heart}} of the musical world of the Weimar Republic. His works, {{including}} his operas, were regularly programmed. He continued to perform whilst his health allowed it; problems of hyperinflation in Germany meant that he needed to undertake tours to England. His last appearance as a pianist was in Berlin in May 1922, playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. Amongst his composition pupils in Berlin were Kurt Weill, Wladimir Vogel and Robert Blum, and he also during these last years <b>had</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, Hermann Scherchen and others.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and {{it was probably the}} first time anyone had been tested for the presence of 210Po in their body. The poison was in Litvinenko's cup of tea. Those who <b>had</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Litvinenko may also have been exposed to radiation.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish <b>had</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> these societies, and {{established}} missions further north, near Lake Okeechobee. In the 18th century, invading Creeks incorporated the dwindling {{numbers of the}} Tequesta into their own. Neither the Tequesta nor Calusa tribe existed by 1800. Disease, warfare, and capture for slavery were {{the reasons for the}} eradication of both groups. The only evidence of their existence within the park boundaries is a series of shell mounds that were built by the Calusa.|$|E
5|$|Two races {{later at}} Twin Ring Motegi in Japan, Foyt {{had his first}} top-10 {{start of the season}} for the Indy Japan 300 when {{qualifying}} was rained out.

He was helped with some drivers ahead of him racing in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. Foyt <b>had</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the wall, forcing him to retire from the race early, with a 15th-place finish.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1919, the French Navy {{joined the}} Allied {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. Waldeck-Rousseau arrived in early 1919, flying the flag of Admiral Caubet. While in Odessa on 2629 April 1919, sailors aboard Waldeck-Rousseau mutinied; the ship, which had just arrived from France with a fresh crew, had not yet <b>had</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Russian revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the crew had quickly grown weary of poor living conditions and wanted to return to France. After three days, the unrest was suppressed and she returned to service, though Caubet was relieved of command for failing to control his crew. The Vietnamese communist Tôn Đức Thắng, who {{was at that time}} serving in the French Navy, claimed to have participated in the mutiny, but French records do not list him as having been aboard Waldeck-Rousseau at the time. At the same time, the crews of other French ships in Constantinople became restive, and so Admiral Jean-Françoise-Charles Amet refused to allow Waldeck-Rousseau to join the rest of the fleet there, owing to her crew's earlier mutiny.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid {{spent the}} next five years preaching to, and {{converting}} the pagan inhabitants of Sussex, the South Saxons. He also founded Selsey Abbey, on an estate near Selsey of 87 hides, given to Wilfrid by Æthelwealh, king of the South Saxons. Bede attributes Wilfrid's ability to convert the South Saxons to his teaching them how to fish, and contrasts it with the lack of success of the Irish monk Dicuill. Bede also says that the Sussex area had been experiencing a drought for three years before Wilfrid's arrival, but miraculously when Wilfrid arrived, and started baptising converts, rain began to fall. Wilfrid worked with Bishop Erkenwald of London, helping to set up the church in Sussex. Erkenwald also helped reconcile Wilfrid and Theodore before Theodore's death in 690. The mission was jeopardised when King Æthelwealh died during an invasion of his kingdom by Cædwalla of Wessex. Wilfrid previously <b>had</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Cædwalla, and may have served as his spiritual advisor before Cædwalla's invasion of Sussex. After Æthelwealh's death and Cædwalla's accession to the throne of Wessex, Wilfrid became one of the new king's advisors, and the king was converted. Cædwalla confirmed Æthelwealh's grant of land in the Selsey area and Wilfrid built his cathedral church near the entrance to Pagham Harbour, believed to be what is now Church Norton.|$|E

A couple of English language newspapers questioned whether the chorus members had infected locals, or rather the Boston youngsters picked up the disease in Costa Rica, as the chorus flew directly from the United States to Costa Rica.|$|E
