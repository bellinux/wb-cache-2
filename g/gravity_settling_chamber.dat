40|$|Using Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations, {{the flow}} in the new University of Sydney {{closed circuit wind tunnel}} has been {{analyzed}} prior to the construction of the tunnel. The objective was to obtain a uniform {{flow in the}} test section of the wind tunnel while keeping the pressure losses over the tunnel as low as possible.

The visibility of pore outlines is minimized by using mounting oil (Cargille Series A immersion oil, Certified Refractive Index, n D 25 °C 1. 5840 ± 0. 0002) with a refractive index matching that of the membrane material. We assessed the efficacy of this new method by comparing abundance and biomass estimates for ciliates in settled and filtered samples. Acceptable results were found for the most delicate of samples stored long-term in acid Lugol's. Some cell shrinkage occurred during the filtration and brief drying steps.

The potentials of microwave energy in demulsification of water-in-crude oil emulsions were investigated. In this study, stability tests, <b>gravity</b> <b>settling,</b> microwave heating and microwave separation were studied. Microwave demulsification was applied in 50 / 50 and 20 / 80 water-in-crude oil emulsions with microwave exposure time varied from 120 - 180 seconds. As the sludge is heated, viscosity is lowered, and rapid coalescence of liquid phases takes place. Once the liquid phases coalesce, separation occurs through natural gravity.

40|$|In {{the design}} of control system of a wind tunnel, it is {{important}} to understand the importance of operations of mechanical systems in order to ensure that any emergencies that may arise during the running of the wind tunnel are properly handled by the system. In the NAL 0. 6 m blowdown wind tunnel, it is proposed to incorporate a Variable Mach number Flexible Nozzle (VMFN), using which the tunnel 13; can be started at a low Mach number and the required test Mach number (up to 4) can be reached by continuously (on-line) changing the nozzle contour using an Electroservohydraulic drive. Before stopping the tunnel, the VMFN would be reverted to the initial low Mach number condition. During the entire operation of the tunnel in such a scenario, it is essential that the Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) maintains the specified or minimum stagnation pressure in the test section by following a safe trajectory. In order to determine a safe trajectory, a basic understanding of the variation of stagnation pressure in the <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> is called for, before the PRV control system is designed. In this paper, the problem is 13; formulated based on quasi-steady isentropic equations and programmed in C language to predict the timehistories 13; of <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure and storage tank pressure for a given trajectory of the opening of PRV, as the VMFN throat is changed from Mach 1 to Mach 4 condition and vice versa. In order to validate the present methodology, the PRV trajectory measured during an experiment in the NAL 0. 6 m 13; wind tunnel was used as input to the program and the measured time-histories of <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure and storage tank pressure are compared with the predicted values. Predictions of <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure and the storage tank pressure relevant to VMFN operation indicate that <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure rapidly builds up towards the storage tank pressure, apparently due to the constriction offered at the VMFN throat as VMFN throat is changed from M= 1 contour to M= 4 contour during the 13; start of the run. Minimum PRV opening area has been predicted to maintain the <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure 13; higher than the estimated minimum value at high Mach numbers. For smaller openings of the PRV (lt; 0. 065 m 2), the predicted pressure falls below the minimum and is hence unsafe. From the predicted time history of free-stream dynamic pressure (q), it is noted that alarming increase in q can occur during starting and stopping transients, which can damage a test model in the tunnel, balance and such other components.
