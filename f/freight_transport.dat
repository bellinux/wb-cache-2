5|$|Construction, {{such as the}} North-South Arterial Highway project, {{supports}} the public-sector job market. Although passenger and commercial traffic on the Erie Canal has declined greatly since the 19thcentury, the barge canal still allows heavy cargo to travel through Utica at low cost, bypassing the New York State Thruway and providing intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> with the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the North {{has been}} shaped by the Pennines, {{creating}} strong north-south axes along each coast and an east-west axis across the moorland passes of the southern Pennines. Northern England is a centre of <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> and handles around one third of all British cargo. Both passenger and freight links between Northern cities remain poor, which is a major weakness of the Northern economy.|$|E
5|$|The Østfold Line is {{the railway}} that connects Norway to Continental Europe, and 80% of all land-based, {{international}} <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> goes through Østfold. Until the Follo Line opens, there cannot be a capacity increase on international freight trains to Norway. The Rail Administration {{has set a}} goal of tripling the amount of rail freight by 2040, which for the South Corridor is equal to the removal of 750 trucks per day from European Route E18. The Follo Line will also allow freight trains to pass during rush hour.|$|E

30|$|TDM {{strategies}} have been employed in different circumstances which are primarily to manage traffic congestion and GHG emissions mitigation (Kahn Ribeiro et al. 2007). This countermeasure is implemented in both passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>transports</b> by using {{fuel economy standards}} in new vehicles, old car retirement, speed limits, work time management, and so on (OTP 2012). It is estimated that TDM can decrease travel demand by 5.02  % in both passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>transports.</b>|$|R
5|$|Granvin is a port on the Hardangerfjord and was {{the center}} for <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> in Hardanger. Hardanger is {{dominated}} by {{a small number of}} large industrial companies, primarily smelters, which were responsible for more than 80 percent of the line's cargo volume. While Hardanger in the 1980s had a population of 40,000, Granvin had a population of 1,000 {{and was the}} smallest municipality in Hardanger. Granvin served as a ferry hub for services by Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap (HSD), and in 1980 there up to two daily services with the local ferry services in Hardanger, in addition to fast ferries to both Bergen and Stavanger. Buses operated to Granvin from Norheimsund and Kvanndal.|$|E
5|$|Mobile {{is served}} by four Class I railroads, {{including}} the Canadian National Railway (CNR), CSX Transportation (CSX), the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS), and the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway (AGR), a Class III railroad, links Mobile to the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) at Amory, Mississippi. These converge at the Port of Mobile, which provides intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> service to companies engaged in importing and exporting. Other railroads include the CG Railway (CGR), a rail ship service to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, and the Terminal Railway Alabama State Docks (TASD), a switching railroad. The city was served by Amtrak's Sunset Limited passenger train service until 2005, when the service was suspended due {{to the effects of}} Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|MD150 {{is known}} as Eastern Avenue from just west of I-895 in Baltimore to the Back River between Dundalk and Essex. The highway is also named Eastern Avenue from Carroll Island Road in Middle River to the highway's eastern {{terminus}} in Chase. Between the two sections of Eastern Avenue, MD150 follows Eastern Boulevard through Essex and Middle River. The state highway is maintained by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation {{in the city of}} Baltimore and by the Maryland State Highway Administration in Baltimore County. MD150 {{is a part of the}} National Highway System as a rail-to-truck intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> connection from its western terminus at US40 to I-95 within Baltimore. The highway is also a National Highway System principal arterial from I-95 to Carroll Island Road in Middle River.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the {{concession}} for passenger transport between Voss and Granvin was transferred from NSB's bus division to HSD and Bergen–Hardanger–Voss Billag. At the same time, {{the number of}} weekly services increased from 14 to 34. This was largely {{a result of the}} 1975 declaration by Hordaland County Council to support the closure of the line. In 1980, the railway had 60,000 passengers. A halt was opened at Mala in 1981, but then all passenger traffic was terminated on 2 June 1985. Class 64 had remained in use until the end, and there existed no political desire to invest in new rolling stock. <b>Freight</b> <b>transport</b> was retained, at first using El9, and later shunting locomotives {{because of the lack of}} maintenance. From 1 March 1989, all transport on the line was terminated. NSB wanted to renovate the line and continue operations. Among the plans were to transport metal from the smelters in Hardanger via the Hardanger Line to Continental Europe. This would have required the axle load to be increased. Other plans were to extend some of the departures of the Bergen Commuter Rail from Voss to Granvin or operate commercially profitable tourist trains similar to the service provided on the Flåm Line.|$|E

Intermodal containers are primarily used to store and transport materials and products efficiently and securely in the global containerized intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> system, but smaller numbers are in regional use as well. These containers are known under a number of names, such as simply container, cargo or freight container, ISO container, shipping, sea or ocean container, container van or (Conex) box, sea or c can.|$|E
