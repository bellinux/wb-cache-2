30|$|It can {{complete}} {{the functions of}} safe and automatic control in a substation. Precisely, it can {{complete the}} under-frequency and under-voltage load shedding protection of the whole substation, strengthen the function of accurate load tripping based on traditional under-frequency and under-voltage load shedding protection, and realize comprehensive decision making with the combination of off-line strategy and on-line measurement information. It completes auto backup of the whole substation and overload <b>intertripping</b> of substation, integrate and realizes the power source automatic switching (PSAS) function of each voltage level in substation area protection and control device, optimizes the logic of PSAS, realizes the linkage of PSAS with section power flow and load state, and also realizes PSAS of complicated main wiring and the main wiring with small power supply outgoing line. Meanwhile, it can provide the functions like <b>intertripping</b> of loads upon main transformer overload, and equal division of loads on bus or main transformer, etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of wind energy in power system is growing dramatically world wide. Consequently, {{there are some}} new challenges appeared on power system. Smart demand technology involves new communication technologies to make sure actions can be fast enough to prevent instability situation of generators. Due to {{the high level of}} renewable energy in power system, flexible demand becomes a future option for wind intermittency situation. Intertrip is one of the automatic actions that can help release overload and stability situation. It is normally used for generations to be disconnected followed by a trip of circuit. It can also be used for demand side intertrip. This paper will show how demand disconnection and <b>intertripping</b> technology can improve power system stability. Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) will be used to define wind transfer corridor circuits. After the corridor is located, the sensitivity of individual demand will be calculated by using PTDF method. This sensitivity factor will be used to select demand intertrip accordingly. It is defined as smart intertrip controller in the paper. A reduced UK model will be used in the paper to prove how demand side intertrip technology can improve system stability during high wind scenario...|$|E
40|$|Eskom is {{experiencing}} {{problems in the}} field of protection maintenance and in-service breakdowns which negatively influence the quality of electrical supply to the consumer, an integral component of the utility business. These facts initiated the research into the further development of a generic relay to be implemented as a strategic spare for the replacement of several schemes operating within Eskomâ€™s southern region. These include the electromechanical, solid state and numerical distance protection relay and scheme failures on the 132 / 66 kV feeder network. Hence, the primary objective of the research is to develop, test and configure the strategic spare in terms of software and peripheral hardware for the input and output terminal connections, generic equations and settings for the purpose of the scheme replacements. The various schemes are assessed for stepped distance and permissive <b>intertripping</b> for three or single pole operation. This is done in conjunction with the internal and external circuit diagrams {{in order to understand the}} detailed operation of the scheme and to ensure the effective implementation of the strategic spare. The generic relay is configured for the emergency replacement of the various schemes during in-service breakdowns. This constitutes a temporary installation and therefore the downtime in essence, of all the distance protection schemes that require replacement, is limited to a minimum. This dissertation therefore explores the implementation of the strategic spare...|$|E
