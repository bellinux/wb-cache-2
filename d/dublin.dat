5|$|Echmarcach first {{appears on}} record in about 1031, {{when he was}} one of three kings in {{northern}} Britain who submitted to Knútr Sveinnsson, ruler of the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire. Echmarcach is recorded to have ruled over <b>Dublin</b> in 10361038 and 10461052. After losing <b>Dublin</b> for the final time, he appears to have been seated in the Isles on Mann. In 1061, about a decade after his final defeat in <b>Dublin,</b> Echmarcach appears to have been expelled from the Isles, and may have then fallen back into Galloway.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach's hold on <b>Dublin</b> was {{short-lived}} as the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach records that Ímar replaced him as King of <b>Dublin</b> in 1038. This annal-entry {{has been interpreted}} to indicate that Ímar drove Echmarcach from the kingship. There is reason to suspect that Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065) extended his presence into the Isles and the Irish Sea region at about this period. The evidence of Þórfinnr's power in the Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the <b>Dublin</b> kingship. In fact, Þórfinnr's predatory operations in the Irish Sea region {{may have contributed to}} Echmarcach's loss of <b>Dublin</b> in 1038.|$|E

5|$|In 1052, Diarmait drove Echmarcach from <b>Dublin.</b> The {{event is}} {{documented}} by the Annals of the Four Masters, the Annals of Tigernach, the Annals of Ulster, and Chronicon Scotorum. These annalistic accounts indicate that, although Diarmait's conquest evidently {{began with a}} mere raid upon Fine Gall, this action further escalated into the seizure of <b>Dublin</b> itself. Following several skirmishes fought around the town's central fortress, the aforesaid accounts report that Echmarcach fled overseas, whereupon Diarmait assumed the kingship. With Diarmait's conquest, Norse-Gaelic <b>Dublin</b> ceased to be an independent power in Ireland; and when Diarmait and his son, Murchad, died about twenty years later, Irish rule had been exercised over Fine Gall and <b>Dublin</b> in a degree unheard of before. In consequence of Echmarcach's expulsion, <b>Dublin</b> effectively became the provincial capital of Leinster, with the town's remarkable wealth and military power at Diarmait's disposal.|$|E
5|$|In 1052, Domnall's {{aforesaid}} grandfather {{conquered the}} Kingdom of <b>Dublin</b> from Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of <b>Dublin</b> and the Isles (died 1064/1065), {{and soon after}} appointed Murchad as King of <b>Dublin.</b> About a decade later, Murchad appears to have driven Echmarcach from Mann, after which he gained the kingship of the Isles. Diarmait's deep-rooted authority in Norse-Gaelic <b>Dublin</b> lasted for two decades, and was a remarkable achievement that no other Irish king had ever accomplished. Unfortunately for the Uí Chennselaig, two of Diarmait's sonsMurchad and Glún Iairnunexpectedly predeceased their father in 1070, and Diarmait himself fell in battle two years later.|$|E

5|$|Lǫgmaðr was one {{of three}} sons of Guðrøðr Crovan, King of <b>Dublin</b> and the Isles (died 1095). Guðrøðr first emerges into history in the mid {{eleventh}} century. Although his precise parentage is uncertain, he {{appears to have been a}} descendant of Óláfr kváran, King of Northumbria and <b>Dublin</b> (died 981). Guðrøðr's apparent Uí Ímair antecedents appear to have endowed him with ancestral claims to the Norse-Gaelic kingdoms to <b>Dublin</b> and the Isles. In the 1070s, he secured the kingship of the Isles through his conquest of Mann, and forcefully added <b>Dublin</b> to his realm in 1091. Guðrøðr's downfall came in 1094, when he was driven out of Ireland by the Uí Briain, and died the following year in the Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|The {{tour was}} subject to minor criticisms, at both the events {{surrounding}} the opening concerts in Barcelona, and the concerts in <b>Dublin.</b> When rehearsing for the tour in Barcelona, residents of the city complained about the band's noise after 10pm, which was the time until which the city allowed the band to rehearse. The setup of the band's stage for the Croke Park concerts in <b>Dublin</b> was criticised by fans for only allowing seating around part of the circular-shaped stage, taking away from the 360° seating configuration that was used at other venues. One fan claimed that only 270° of seating around the stage was being utilised for the three <b>Dublin</b> concerts, {{and that there was}} no reason that the stage could not be placed in the middle of the venue. Additional criticisms about the Croke Park shows arose from about 80 <b>Dublin</b> citizens, who protested against the <b>Dublin</b> City Council for allowing the band's crew to dismantle the stage in the middle of the night following the three concerts, due to the loud noises caused by the crew. The protest blocked several crew trucks from exiting the venue, putting the tour behind schedule, and tour promoter MCD Productions delivered a letter to the protesters informing them that they could be sued for any of the tour's financial losses due to the protest. In addition to the loudness of the band's crew, the <b>Dublin</b> City Council decided to withhold the band's €80,000 ($104,000) bond, after breaking the 75 decibel maximum volume at all three of the <b>Dublin</b> concerts.|$|E
5|$|Whatever the {{circumstances}} of Domnall's accession, the Uí Chennselaig regime in <b>Dublin</b> was short-lived. The Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of the Four Masters, and the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, all reveal that, within the year, Domnall died after a brief illness, with the latter two sources specifying that he succumbed after three nights of sickness. The Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of Ulster accord him the title King of <b>Dublin,</b> and make no mention of any connection with the Leinster kingship. Upon Domnall's demise, Toirdelbach had his own son, Muirchertach (died 1119), appointed King of <b>Dublin.</b> In so doing, Toirdelbach reinforced his authority in <b>Dublin,</b> and followed a precedent started by Domnall's grandfather, in which a claimant to the high-kingship of Ireland installed his own heir to the kingship of <b>Dublin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ímar mac Arailt (died 1054) was an eleventh-century {{ruler of}} the Kingdom of <b>Dublin</b> and perhaps the Kingdom of the Isles. He {{was the son of}} a man named Aralt, and appears to have been a {{grandson}} of Amlaíb Cuarán, King of Northumbria and <b>Dublin.</b> Such a relationship would have meant that Ímar was a member of the Uí Ímair, and that he was a nephew of Amlaíb Cuarán's son, Sitriuc mac Amlaíb, King of <b>Dublin,</b> a man driven from <b>Dublin</b> by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill in 1036.|$|E
5|$|Ímar's {{reign in}} <b>Dublin</b> spanned {{at least eight}} years, from 1038 to 1046. Although he began by seizing the kingship from Echmarcach in 1038, he {{eventually}} lost it to him in 1046. As king, Ímar is recorded to have overseen military operations throughout Ireland, and seems to have actively assisted the family of Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, King of Gwynedd overseas in Wales. After Echmarcach's final expulsion from <b>Dublin</b> 1052, Ímar {{may well have been}} reinstalled as King of <b>Dublin</b> by Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster. Whatever the case, Ímar died in 1054. He may have been an ancestor or close kinsman of Gofraid Crobán, King of <b>Dublin</b> and the Isles, the progenitor of a family that ruled in the Isles until the mid thirteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Domnall Gerrlámhach (died 1135), {{also known}} as Domnall Gerrlámhach Ua Briain, Domnall mac Muirchertaig, and Domnall Ua Briain, was an obscure twelfth-century Uí Briain dynast and King of <b>Dublin.</b> He {{was one of two}} sons of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. Domnall's father appears to have {{installed}} him as King of <b>Dublin</b> in the late eleventh- or early twelfth century, which suggests that he was his father's successor-designate. Although Domnall won a remarkable victory in the defence of the Kingdom of <b>Dublin</b> {{in the face of an}} invasion from the Kingdom of Leinster in 1115, he failed to achieve the successes of his father. After his final expulsion from <b>Dublin</b> at hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht, and the death of his father, Domnall disappears from record until his own death in 1135. He was perhaps survived by two sons.|$|E
5|$|From an {{administrative}} viewpoint, 21 of the {{counties in the}} republic are units of local government.
