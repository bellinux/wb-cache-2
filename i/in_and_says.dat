5|$|Days later, Spike belatedly relays {{a message}} from Anna. Will calls and she invites him to visit her at the Ritz Hotel. On arrival, Will is mistaken for a journalistin a panic he claims he works for Horse & Hound and is made to {{interview}} not only Anna, but the entire cast of her new sci-fi film, which he knows nothing about. Anna calls him back <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> she has cleared her evening. Will is exhilarated, before remembering that he is expected at his sister Honey's birthday party; Anna surprises him by offering to be his date.|$|E
5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a wait and see attitude, and look what {{happened}} to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> in a deep voice (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?”.|$|E
5|$|Mac {{shows her}} work to Beaver, which {{involves}} his new business project. Veronica, under a disguise, meets with the prom baby's temporary foster mom. Veronica learns that the baby's foster mother committed suicide {{and her father}} was in jail, hinting that the baby is Trina Echolls. Veronica talks to Trina and tells her the news of her parentage. Trina actually wants her story {{to go to the}} tabloids. However, a deaf lunch lady storms <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> that she's actually Trina's mother. The lunch lady says that Lianne was a friend who covered up her pregnancy to protect her. Trina's father is Principal Moorehead, and Trina confronts him about leaving her at the prom in front of many faculty. Veronica finds the dead rat that Keith picked up at the bus. Veronica finds out that Principal Clemmons deliberately gave Veronica her detention task so that she would find her mother's permanent file and frame Principal Moorehead. Veronica picks up Abel Koontz's (Christian Clemenson) belongings and walks into Meg's (Alona Tal) room and discovers that Meg is pregnant.|$|E

500|$|In the fifth-season finale [...] "Are You Better off?," [...] Andy {{is talking}} to Ron about a {{pregnancy}} test he found when Diane comes <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> she needs to talk to him, leaving the question if she is pregnant in a cliffhanger.|$|E
500|$|At the Source Awards, Tracy {{still does}} not want to host. Jack rhetorically asks him what Oprah would do, but Tracy misunderstands and starts acting like her. Backstage, Tracy shows Liz his gun, which she takes away from him. She fires it by {{accident}} and ends up shooting Steven in the buttocks. He thinks she shot him because he was going through her purse and calls her a racist. Following this, Ridikolous comes <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> that Jack has made a mockery of the award, adding: [...] "Wait until I tell Tupac about this!". This leads to a short awkward moment, but Jack insists he did not hear anything.|$|E
500|$|Ward {{was very}} happy with the episode. [...] He complimented {{storyboard}} artists Muto and Sugar, saying that the former [...] "has a hilarious slapstick set-up-the-punchline kind of style of comedy" [...] and the latter [...] "is amazing at executing these super romantic, emotional goosebump-kind of feelings". He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising. In that episode you're talking about, there is that rising action toward the end, and then LSP [...] cuts <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> 'drama bomb!' {{in the middle of it}} to sort of, like, cut its legs out. Which I think is a lot of fun." [...] The episode was later nominated for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program, although it did not win.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly,' said Geraldine, smiling. 'I {{could never}} walk stately <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Now, boys!"--and much they would {{care for it}} if I did.' ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{goes into}} {{northern}} Iraq and meets up with Ahmad Chalabi. He walks <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> I'm Saddam's [...] "Bombmaker". So {{they call the}} CIA and they say, [...] "we know who you are, you're not Saddam's [...] "Bombmaker", go sell your story to someone else." [...] And he was released, he was rejected by all intelligence services at the time, he's a fraud.|$|E
2500|$|Some Chapels, on {{the other}} hand, will allow {{practically}} anyone to participate who walks <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> {{that he is a}} Christian, based on the newcomer's profession of faith. Such assemblies are said to have an [...] "open table" [...] approach to strangers. Gospel Hall Brethren, {{on the other}} hand, generally believe that only those formally recognised as part of that or an equivalent assembly should break bread. Most Closed and some Open Brethren hold that association with evil defiles and that sharing the Communion meal can bring that association.|$|E
2500|$|The {{great thing}} about Kylie is that she differs from other celebrities. There is a {{separation}} between how celebrities perceive themselves and what the public wants to see. Most are concerned with reproducing a certain logo or caricature of themselves. They want to cling on to an image developed years ago which makes things difficult {{because there is no}} room to take a picture, you aren't really forced to improvise which is when the best things happen. Every photographer has their own very personal vision of her, and she lets them have it. That is the big difference with Kylie, that she walks <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> 'This is me, {{what are you going to}} do with it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you like}} me," [...] he asked hesitatingly, [...] "supposing I get away early--would {{you like me}} to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> good night to you later on?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Scott steps <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> Madison's baby is his, which surprises Ryan. Following the {{pregnancy}} mess, he and Greenlee exchange teary vows with Emma, Spike and Jackson Montgomery celebrating this joyous moment with them. Later, Annie comes {{in during the}} reception and takes Emma for an [...] "adventure." [...] Ryan finds out and tears ConFusion apart. Greenlee tries her best to calm down Ryan, but nothing she does helps. Ryan, JR, and Greenlee follow Annie's tracks to Montreal. Later, Jesse approaches them with a security photo of David and Annie together, taken {{the night of the}} wedding. While Ryan confronts David, Greenlee approaches Marissa and tells her of her father's involvement. Marissa does not initially believe her, but is convinced when Greenlee gives her some solid points and shows her the photos. Greenlee sympathizes with Marissa's anger and sadness at having fallen for her father's claims that he wanted to change.|$|E

6000|$|In this {{juncture}} {{it is that}} Lady Rockminster comes <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Upon my word, young people! Beck! leave the room. What do you want poking your nose in here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{you have}} to do is to go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> you want the ice cream that Mrs. Babbitt ordered {{yesterday}} by 'phone, and it will be all ready for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, Terence. I {{must say}} that I was afraid {{that we should not}} be moving until the spring. Shall we go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to our fellows?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't done {{anything}} of the kind. I come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'Hullo, Ernest!' <b>and</b> you <b>say</b> 'Hullo, Frank!' <b>and</b> then you help me tell {{the story about the}} Pullman car. A child could do your part of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{where is}} Mr. Robert? And Mr. Lucas?" [...] he went on. [...] "Fine young gentlemen all of them; but Mr. Allen is the pleasant-spoken one. Ain't he coming down soon? He always looks <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'I don't forget your good cider, Mr. Gould,'" [...] {{and there was}} a feeble chuckling laugh and old man's cough.|$|E
6000|$|Conventionality--that same {{strained}} {{sense of}} honour and duty--decreed that under certain mundane circumstances {{a man and}} woman should not mate. Differences of ancestry, of parentage, of birth and of country, divergence of taste, of faith, of belief--all these matter not one jot. But let the man be beggared and the woman rich, and convention steps <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "It shall not be!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I broke <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> I, 'Beg your pardon, Mr. Longfellow, if you'll {{be so kind}} as to {{hold your}} yawp {{for about five minutes}} and let me get this grub ready, you'll do me proud.' Well, sir, after they'd filled up I set out the jug. Mr. Holmes looks at it, and then he fires up all of a sudden and yells: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> good-by to Miss Pinkerton, Becky!" [...] said Miss Jemima to a {{young lady}} of whom nobody took any notice, and who was coming downstairs with her own bandbox.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{one must}} go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that Mr. Burland, of Harris & Burland, wishes to know at what time {{he can see}} the governor. I think you had better let Chetwode go, though." ...|$|R
6000|$|Anybody {{can come}} <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> “Oh, I caught fifteen dozen perch {{yesterday}} evening;” or “Last Monday I landed a gudgeon, weighing eighteen pounds, and measuring three {{feet from the}} tip to the tail.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Jill {{has just}} been <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> I ought to explain that Dick's name wasn't Dick. I do wish Jill would mind her own business. Of course it wasn't. His real name was the Reverend Stephen Richmond, but Jill and I always called him Dick behind his back; it seemed so jolly and venturesome, somehow, {{to speak of a}} {{minister}} like that. Only we had {{to be careful not to}} let Father and Mother hear us. Mother wouldn't even let Father call Dick [...] "Stephen"; she said it would set a bad example of familiarity to the children. Mother is an old darling. She won't believe we're half as bad as we are.|$|E
6000|$|... "As to the trials, {{they are}} no trials at all. One of their fellows comes <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'I heard this man abusing the authorities, and I accuse him also of being {{concerned}} in the escape of so and so.' It is no odds what the prisoner says. The fellow who acts as judge looks at the jury, who are all their creatures; they say 'Guilty 'and he says' Death!' and the accused are marched off again to the prison, to wait until their turn comes for the guillotine. Well you see, if this prison was broken into as you propose, and it was known that the sailors {{had a hand in}} it, the chances are that they would march a couple of hundred of us into the great square, which would be choke full of the National Guard and volunteers, and just shoot us down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And with that, away he went. You {{never see}} a bird work so since you was born. He laid into his work like a nigger, {{and the way he}} hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half {{was one of the most}} {{exciting}} and astonishing spectacles I ever struck. He never stopped to take a look anymore--he just hove 'em in and went for more. Well, at last he could hardly flop his wings, he was so tuckered out. He comes a-dropping down, once more, sweating like an ice-pitcher, dropped his acorn <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'NOW I guess I've got the bulge on you by this time!' So he bent down for a look. If you'll believe me, when his head come up again he was just pale with rage. He says, 'I've shoveled acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years, and if I can see a sign of one of 'em I wish I may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "People are leaving," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't {{know it was}} so late." [...] She stood irresolutely. [...] "I suppose I {{ought to}} go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> good-bye. But I don't think I can." ...|$|R
50|$|Tobe isn't... a take-charge sort of guy. If a {{question}} was asked and an answer wasn't immediately forthcoming, I'd jump <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> {{what we could}} do. Tobe would nod agreement, and that became the process of collaboration.|$|R
5000|$|... "How'd that happen?", a mock-incredulous {{reply to}} those to who write <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> they had certain (often sexual) things [...] "happen to" [...] them, {{as if they}} had no part or say in the incident, when they clearly did.|$|R
