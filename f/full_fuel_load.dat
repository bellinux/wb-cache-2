25|$|The {{prototype}} Harrier {{was tested}} at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A & AEE) at Martlesham Heath in November 1927, where, while it met {{the requirements of}} Specification 23/25 and had satisfactory handling, the geared engine meant that it was underpowered, and it had an inferior bombload to the Hawker Horsley, the aircraft {{it was meant to}} replace. It was therefore modified to carry a torpedo. On testing the modified aircraft, however, it was found to still be underpowered, being incapable of taking off with a torpedo, gunner and <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load.</b> It was therefore not considered further, the competition ultimately being won by the Vickers Vildebeest.|$|E
25|$|The Sentry {{was being}} {{operated}} by the 962nd Airborne Air Control Squadron and was scheduled for a training sortie with the callsign Yukla 27. The aircraft was to depart from runway 06 and was waiting while a Hercules transport aircraft took off ahead of it. With its crew unaware that the Hercules had disturbed a flock of Canada geese, the Sentry lined up and started its departure roll. As the E-3 rotated it ingested multiple birds into its number 1 and 2 engines. The crew started to dump fuel and initiated a turn to the left {{to return to the}} airfield, but with a <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> and having lost two engines on the same wing, it was unable to maintain altitude. After the aircraft reached 250 feet it descended and crashed into a hilly, wooded area, and exploded.|$|E

50|$|Reliability {{was found}} {{in the second half of}} the season, which allowed Piquet to {{eventually}} finish fifth in the title hunt. The saddest aspect was that the BT53 was, in Piquet and Teo Fabi's hands, regularly faster than the McLarens, as Piquet's nine pole positions throughout the season attested (Prost was the only McLaren driver to qualify on pole during 1984, doing so three times). The car was very quick in qualifying on light <b>fuel</b> <b>loads,</b> but its race pace was negatively affected particularly on <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>loads.</b> More reliability from the BMW turbo might have given Piquet a realistic chance of defending his championship. Indeed, of the first six races before scoring his win in Canada, Piquet retired from the first five races with either engine or turbo failure, and spun off into retirement in the wet at Monaco. Often early in the season when he retired, Piquet had either leading the race or was in a position to challenge for the lead.|$|R
2500|$|The Calidus has a {{take off}} {{distance}} of 10 to 70 metres and lands in 15 metres, or can land vertically in some circumstances. Flying speeds range from [...] to [...]. An optional heater makes cold-weather flying feasible; but although navigation lights may be fitted, night flying is not permitted. The payload is 230kg for versions with the Rotax 912, so even with a <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> of 54kg, two crew of up to 88kg each can be accommodated.|$|E
2500|$|The Camel soon {{gained an}} unfortunate {{reputation}} with pilots. Some inexperienced pilots crashed on take-off when the <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> pushed the aircraft's {{centre of gravity}} beyond the rearmost safe limits. When in level flight, the Camel was markedly tail-heavy. Unlike the Sopwith Triplane, the Camel lacked a variable incidence tailplane, so that the pilot had to apply constant forward pressure on the control stick to maintain a level attitude at low altitude. The aircraft could be rigged so that at higher altitudes it could be flown [...] "hands off". A stall immediately resulted in a dangerous spin.|$|E
2500|$|On June 27, Maitland and Hegenberger {{made the}} short hop from Crissy Field {{to the newly}} opened Oakland Municipal Airport, whose [...] runway was much {{preferable}} for the takeoff roll with <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load,</b> and departed the next morning just after 7 a.m. for Wheeler Field, Oahu, with Maitland as pilot and Hegenberger as navigator. Although assisted as planned by the Signal Corps beacon on Maui, the directional radio receiver in the C-2 operated only intermittently before cutting out altogether. The earth inductor compass on the C-2 failed just after takeoff, and despite increasingly cloudier weather, Hegenberger navigated most of the charted Great Circle route by dead reckoning, using a magnetic compass and driftmeter supplemented by celestial navigation observations. Contact with several ships at sea was used to verify their position and adjust the original flight plan.|$|E
500|$|Another {{program that}} the Air Force is {{considering}} is the [...] "Avionics Modernization Program" [...] (AMP). AMP would equip the E-3s with glass cockpits. The Air Force also wants modified E-3s with jet engines {{that are more}} reliable than the original ones, and also with at least 19% higher fuel efficiencies. New turbofan engines would give these E-3s longer ranges, longer time-on-station, and a shorter critical runway length. If the modification is carried out, the E-3s could take off with <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> using runways only [...] long, and also at higher ambient temperatures and lower barometric pressures, such as from bases in mountainous areas. Now that the E-8 Joint STARS are being fitted with the new Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 turbofans, which are stated as having one-half {{the cost of the}} competing engine, the CFM56, the Air Force is again studying the possibility of replacing the E-3's original turbofan engines with more-efficient ones.|$|R

500|$|The B-1B's maximum {{takeoff weight}} was {{increased}} to [...] from the B-1A's [...] The weight increase was {{to allow for}} takeoff with a <b>full</b> internal <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> and for external weapons to be carried. Rockwell engineers were able to reinforce critical areas and lighten non-critical areas of the airframe, so the increase in empty weight was minimal. To deal {{with the introduction of}} the MiG-31 equipped with the new Zaslon radar system, and other aircraft with look-down capability (which reduced the B-1s low-flying advantage), the B-1B's electronic warfare suite was significantly upgraded.|$|R
2500|$|One such {{advantage}} {{of the new system}} was put to good use by Gerhard Berger after he suffered a fiery high speed crash at the San Marino Grand Prix. His car hit the wall at the Tamburello curve at close to [...] and with an almost <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> burst into flames, leaving the Austrian (who was knocked unconscious) with burns on his hands. His injuries kept him out of the next race in Monaco, and would normally have kept him out for longer, but being able to make gear changes without his hands leaving the steering wheel he was able to return in Mexico, just two races after his crash. Berger and team boss Cesare Fiorio told the press in Mexico that had the Ferrari not been equipped with Barnard's revolutionary gearbox, Berger's injuries would not have allowed him to return to racing so soon.|$|E
2500|$|The runway of Crissy Field, {{situated}} {{beside the}} bay {{on the grounds}} of the Presidio, was approximately [...] in length but was too short for a fully loaded C-2 to acquire lift speed during its takeoff roll. On June 27, Maitland and Hegenberger flew the Bird of Paradise across San Francisco Bay to the newly opened Oakland Municipal Airport, whose 7000 foot (2,100 meter) runway was acceptable for the anticipated gross weight of [...] with <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load.</b> The aircraft was parked near Smith and Carter's Travel Air 5000, City of Oakland, (see [...] ) and given a final service check by its support crew. Gen. Patrick also inspected the C-2 and approved a takeoff for the next day. The airplane took on [...] of gasoline, [...] of oil, and had an inflatable rubber raft, tinned beef, hardtack, and [...] of water stowed on board for survival if they came down in the ocean as had the PN-9 in 1925. Parachutes, however, were not provided.|$|E
2500|$|In mid August the Crusader was {{dismantled}} {{and shipped}} to Venice. Here it was fitted with the race engine, but since it was obviously slower than the other aircraft entered, {{it was intended to}} use it solely as a practise aircraft. On 11 September Schofield took off in the aircraft: since the aircraft with <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> was heavy on takeoff, he held the aircraft close to the water to build up speed. It is probable that the aircraft encountered a thermal caused by the hot weather, for suddenly the right wing lifted. Schofield attempted to correct this, but the control wires to the ailerons had been crossed during reassembly, so that the aileron movement was reversed. The aircraft continued the roll, and hit the water at a speed of [...] The fuselage broke in half at the cockpit and Schofield was thrown clear, sustaining serious bruises but no broken bones. The aircraft sank into the lagoon and was recovered a week later, when examination of the wreckage clearly established the cause of the crash.|$|E
25|$|The KC-10A was {{originally}} {{designed for the}} support of NATO in Europe by the USAF. In the case of armed conflict, with a <b>full</b> jet <b>fuel</b> <b>load,</b> the KC-10A is capable of flying from a base on the east coast of the US or Canada, flying nonstop to Europe, transferring a considerable amount of fuel in air-to-air refueling, and then returning to its home base, all without landing anywhere. This could have been very useful in the Cold War era when numerous European bases would (probably) have been disabled by Warsaw Pact strikes in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The B-1B's maximum {{takeoff weight}} was {{increased}} to 477000 lb from the B-1A's 395000 lb. The weight increase was {{to allow for}} takeoff with a <b>full</b> internal <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> and for external weapons to be carried. Rockwell engineers were able to reinforce critical areas and lighten non-critical areas of the airframe, so the increase in empty weight was minimal.

50|$|Fighter-bomber {{version of}} Yak-9D (factory {{designation}} Yak-9L) with four vertical tube bomb bays aft {{of the cockpit}} with capacity for up to 4 × 100 kg (220 lb) FAB-100 bombs or 4 PTAB cassettes with 32 × 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) bomblets each, although normally only 200 kg (440 lb) of weapons were carried in the front bomb bays. Poor handling with a <b>full</b> bomb and <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> and lack of special aiming equipment limited combat usefulness.|$|R
2500|$|The {{new type}} was {{intended}} {{from the beginning}} to replace the B.E.2, which was already attracting widespread criticism, and an attempt was made to address each of the earlier type's failings. [...] The more powerful motor was intended to improve the feeble speed and climb of the B.E.2 and to allow a better payload. This permitted the type to operate as a true two-seater, since the observer no longer had to be left at home when bombs or a <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> were carried, {{there was no need for}} his seat to be at the centre of gravity – as a result he could now be seated behind the pilot, in the proper position to operate a defensive machine gun. It was also possible to allow for a pilot's gun. The new wings had already proved themselves on the B.E.2e, maintaining the stability of the B.E.2c while providing rather better manoeuvrability, although the long extensions on the upper wing looked as if they might collapse if the aircraft was dived too sharply, which did not improve the trust in which they were held by some pilots. The new tail, as originally fitted, had a much smaller fin, which it was hoped would improve rudder control and allow the new type to turn more easily without seriously affecting stability.|$|E
2500|$|The Mk I PR Type D (also {{called the}} Extra Super Long Range Spitfire) {{was the first}} PR variant {{that was not a}} {{conversion}} of existing fighter airframes. The Type D carried so much fuel that it was nicknamed [...] "the bowser." [...] The D shaped wing leading edges, ahead of the main spar, proved to be an ideal location for an integral tank. Accordingly, in early 1940, work started on converting the leading edges, between rib four through to rib 21, by sealing off the spar, outer ribs and all skin joins allowing 57 gal (259 l) of fuel to be carried in each wing. Because the work was of low priority, and with the urgent need for fighters the first two, hand-built prototypes of the PR Type Ds were not available until October. In addition to the leading edge tanks these prototypes also had a 29 gal (132 l) tank in the rear fuselage. An additional 14 gal (63 l) oil tank was fitted in the port wing. The cameras, two vertically mounted F24s with 8inch (20.3cm) or 20inch (50.8cm) lens or two vertically mounted F8s with [...] lens, were located in the rear fuselage. With the <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> the center of gravity was so far back the aircraft was difficult to fly until the rear fuselage tank had been emptied. Despite these difficulties the type quickly proved its worth, photographing such long distance targets as Stettin, Marseilles, Trondheim and Toulon.|$|E
50|$|From 2010, {{refuelling}} is {{no longer}} permitted during the race: every car starts with a <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load.</b> The 2010 season cars were about 22 cm longer than 2009 cars to accommodate the enlarged fuel tank this necessitated.|$|E
50|$|The {{gas turbine}} fuel oil {{supplies}} {{were held in}} five vertical main oil storage tanks, with a total capacity of 4,440 tonnes - equivalent {{to little more than}} 130 hours continuous generating at <b>full</b> <b>load.</b> <b>Fuel</b> was delivered by rail to the station's own siding located off the Hastings to Ashford Railway line, a few hundred metres north east of Ore Railway Station.|$|R
50|$|A rolling takeoff, {{sometimes}} with a ramp (ski-jump), reduces {{the amount of}} thrust required to lift an aircraft from the ground (compared with vertical takeoff), and hence increases the payload and range {{that can be achieved}} for a given thrust. For instance, the Harrier is incapable of taking off vertically with a <b>full</b> weapons and <b>fuel</b> <b>load.</b> Hence V/STOL aircraft generally use a runway if it is available. I.e. Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) or Conventional Take-off and Landing (CTOL) operation is preferred to VTOL operation.|$|R
5000|$|China {{has also}} {{developed}} a carrier-based fighter aircraft, the Shenyang J-15 from the Russian Sukhoi Su-33, but featuring Chinese technologies and avionics from the J-11B program. On 25 November 2012, {{it was announced that}} at least two Shenyang J-15's had successfully landed on Liaoning. The pilot credited with having achieved the first landing was Dai Mingmeng (...) [...] According to Chinese media reports, the J-15 cannot take off Liaoning with a <b>full</b> weapons and <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> exceeding 12 tons, being unable to get off the carrier’s ski jump ramp. The Shenyang J-31 is a fifth generation fighter aircraft being developed by China that may in future be adopted for carrier use.|$|R
50|$|The 400's maximum {{take-off}} weight is 3600 lbs (1633 kg) and the maximum landing weight is 3420 lbs (1551 kg). A typical empty weight without deicing equipment is 2575 lbs (1168 kg). With a <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> this leaves 413 lbs (187 kg) for crew and baggage.|$|E
5000|$|The Griffin Mark III has {{a typical}} empty weight of 840 lb and a gross weight of 1500 lb, giving a useful load of 660 lb. With a <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> of [...] the payload for pilot, {{passenger}} and baggage is 438 lb. The seats are fully adjustable and removable.|$|E
50|$|For {{spacecraft}} the payload fraction {{is often}} less than 1%, while the useful load fraction is perhaps 90%. In {{this case the}} useful load fraction is not a useful term, because spacecraft typically can't reach orbit without a <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>load.</b> For this reason the related term propellant mass fraction, is used instead. However, if the latter is large, the payload can only be small.|$|E
2500|$|The LaGG-3 proved immensely unpopular with pilots. Some {{aircraft}} {{supplied to}} the front line were up to 40km/h (25mph) slower than {{they should have been}} and some were not airworthy. This happened less because of the added weight with <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> and weapon <b>loads</b> in combat conditions, but specifically to the poor finishing in rushed industrial production, due to the German invasion. In combat, the LaGG-3's main advantage was its strong airframe. Although the laminated wood did not burn, it shattered when hit by high explosive rounds. [...] The Soviet pilots nicknamed the plane Lakirovanny Garantirovanny Grob, (which translates as: [...] "varnished guaranteed coffin").|$|R
5000|$|The second {{prototype}} Sling 2 {{was flown}} on a westerly global circumnavigation in 2009. Blyth and Pitman departed from South Africa flying up through Western Africa, across the Atlantic to Brazil and Guyana, {{up through the}} US Virgin Islands and the East Coast of the United States to Oshkosh, Wisconsin for EAA AirVenture Oshkosh 2009. After the air show they flew across the United States to Los Angeles, then on to Hawaii, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Seychelles, and finally back to South Africa. They completed the whole journey in 40 days. The aircraft used for the circumnavigation was a standard production Sling, but with larger [...] fuel tanks, strengthened landing gear, seats that lie flat for sleeping and removable control sticks. After being modified, the aircraft had an endurance at standard cruise of approximately 24 hours. The aircraft cruised at 89 knots Indicated airspeed (IAS) (98 knots True airspeed (TAS)) with almost <b>full</b> <b>fuel.</b> When more nearly empty, it would cruise at 96 knots IAS (105 knots TAS). With <b>full</b> <b>fuel,</b> fully <b>loaded</b> with crew the Sling weighed approximately 1,984 Lbs (900 kg), or about 600 pounds overweight. At sea level the aircraft would climb slowly, {{at a rate of}} 350 feet per minute.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a l/ 19 -scale model of the North American T- 28 C airplane to determine the spin and recovery characteristics. The T- 28 C airplane {{is similar to the}} T- 28 B airplane except for slight modifications for the arresting hook. The lower rear section of the fuselage was cut out and, consequently, {{the lower part of the}} rudder was removed to make a smooth fairing with the fuselage. The T- 28 B airplane had good recovery characteristics; but these modifications, along with the addition of gun packages on the wings, led to poor and unsatisfactory spin-recovery characteristics during demonstration spins of the T- 28 C airplane. Model test results indicated that without the gun packages installed, satisfactory recoveries could be obtained if the elevators were held full back while the rudder was fully reversed and the ailerons were held neutral. However, with the addition of gun packages to the wings and the corresponding change in loading, recoveries were considered unsatisfactory. Recoveries attempted by using a larger chord or larger span rudder were improved very slightly, but were still considered marginal or unsatisfactory. Strakes placed on the nose of the model were effective in slowing the spin rotation slightly and, in most instances, decreased the turns for recovery slightly. Recovery characteristics were slightly marginal for the <b>full</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> when strakes and the extended-chord rudder were installed; but with the wing fuel partly used, recovery characteristics were again considered unsatisfactory or, at least, definitely on the marginal side. The optimum control technique for recovery is movement of the rudder to full against the spin with the stick held full back (elevators full up) and the ailerons held neutral, followed by forward movement of the stick only after the spin rotation ceases. Inverted-spin test results indicate that the airplane will spin steep and fast and that recovery by full rudder reversal will be satisfactory if the ailerons are held neutral...|$|R
50|$|While {{attempting}} {{to take off}} fully fueled and overloaded from N'Dolo Airport's short runway, the An-32B did not achieve sufficient speed to bring its nose up, yet began to lift.
