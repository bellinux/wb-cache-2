50|$|Lastly, {{there are}} {{surfaces}} {{which do not}} admit a surface normal at each point with consistent results (for example, the Möbius strip). If such a surface is split into pieces, on each piece a parametrization and corresponding surface normal is chosen, and the pieces are put back together, {{we will find that}} the normal vectors coming from different pieces cannot be reconciled. This means that at some junction between two pieces we will have normal vectors pointing in opposite directions. Such a surface is called non-orientable, and on this kind of surface one cannot talk about <b>integrating</b> <b>vector</b> fields.|$|E
50|$|For {{integrals}} of vector fields {{things are}} more complicated, because the surface normal is involved. It can be proven that given two parametrizations {{of the same}} surface, whose surface normals point in the same direction, one obtains the same value for the surface integral with both parametrizations. If, however, the normals for these parametrizations point in opposite directions, {{the value of the}} surface integral obtained using one parametrization is the negative of the one obtained via the other parametrization. It follows that given a surface, we do not need to stick to any unique parametrization; but, when <b>integrating</b> <b>vector</b> fields, we do need to decide in advance which direction the normal will point to and then choose any parametrization consistent with that direction.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue is}} that {{sometimes}} surfaces do not have parametrizations which cover the whole surface; {{this is true for}} example for the surface of a cylinder (of finite height). The obvious solution is then to split that surface in several pieces, calculate the surface integral on each piece, and then add them all up. This is indeed how things work, but when <b>integrating</b> <b>vector</b> fields one needs to again be careful how to choose the normal-pointing vector for each piece of the surface, so that when the pieces are put back together, the results are consistent. For the cylinder, this means that if we decide that for the side region the normal will point out of the body, then for the top and bottom circular parts the normal must point out of the body too.|$|E

The diseases that are the focus of this toolkit are malaria, lymphatic filariasis, dengue, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, human African trypanosomiasis and schistosomiasis.

The piggyBac transposon represents an alternative <b>integrating</b> <b>vector</b> for in vivo gene transfer. We hypothesized that this system could achieve persistent gene {{transfer to the}} liver when administered systemically. We report that a novel hyperactive transposase generated higher transposition efficiency than a codon-optimized transposase in a human liver cell line. Hyperactive transposase-mediated reporter gene expression persisted at levels twice that of codon-optimized transposase in the livers of mice for the 6 -month study. Of note, expression persisted in mice following partial hepatectomy, consistent with expression from an integrated transgene. We also used the hyperactive transposase to deliver the human α 1 -antitrypsin gene and achieved stable expression in serum. To determine the integration pattern of insertions, we performed large-scale mapping in human cells and recovered 60, 685 unique hyperactive transposase-mediated insertions. We found that a hyperactive piggyBac transposase conferred an altered pattern of integration from that of insect piggyBac transposase, with a decreased frequency of integration near transcription start sites than previously reported.

BACKGROUND: Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{is caused}} by a defect in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity, often resulting in an incurable airway disease. Gene therapy into the conducting airway epithelium is a potential cure for CF; however, most gene vectors do not result in long-lived expression, and require re-dosing. Perversely, intrinsic host immune responses can then block renewed gene transfer. METHODS: To investigate whether persistent gene expression could be achieved after a single dosing event, thus avoiding the issue of blocking host responses, we used a gene transfer protocol that combined an airway pretreatment using lysophosphatidylcholine with a human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotype) derived lentiviral vector to test whether an <b>integrating</b> <b>vector</b> could produce gene expression able to last for a substantial part of the lifetime of the laboratory mouse. RESULTS: We found that a single dose of LV-LacZ produced immediate as well as lifetime mouse airway expression, confirming our hypothesis that use of an <b>integrating</b> <b>vector</b> extends transgene expression. Importantly, LV-CFTR dosing achieved at least 12 months of CFTR expression, representing partial functional correction of the CFTR defect in CF-null mice.

A total of 327 transformants were screened by CHEF gels of intact chromosomal DNA. Transformants with homology to the vector at particular chromosomal bands were then screened by Southern analysis with several restriction enzymes to confirm telomeric locations. CHEF gels of NotI and/or SfiI digests were also analyzed to determine left or right arm locations. In some cases allelism of marked telomeres was determined genetically. Transformation was performed by lithium acetate and electroporation with varying results. Electroporation resulted in 50 % (75 / 150) of the integrants at the internal URA 3 location rather than telomeres. There were also two rearrangements involving URA 3 and the telomere of another chromosome. Lithium acetate transformation resulted in fewer integrants at the internal URA 3 location (5 / 84) and no rearrangements. All telomeres were marked with approximately the same efficiency ranging from 0 to 11 hits in the first 240 transformants. These marked telomeres can be used to complete the physical maps of chromosomes in which the telomere regions are absent. The marked telomeres can be cloned with the appropriate restriction enzymes, thus completing the cloning of individual chromosomes for sequencing projects.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{permanent}} {{integration of}} genes into the cellular genome using retroviral vectors holds promise for the correction of diseases caused by single gene defects. However, the semi-random pattern of integration {{is complicated by}} the risk of transactivation of cellular proto-oncogenes in close proximity to the integration site. Adverse events resulting from vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis have been documented in clinical and preclinical gene therapy studies and clearly indicate the need for improved safety mechanisms.; We have chosen to investigate two cis-regulatory elements, whose incorporation into an <b>integrating</b> <b>vector</b> may reduce vector-mediated genotoxicity. As the strong enhancer-promoter of the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) has been implicated in the process of insertional mutagenesis, we sought to identify promoters with low transactivation potential. Results from reporter gene expression assays revealed that the risk of transactivation is positively correlated with the transcriptional strength of a promoter, making it difficult to identify an element which may improve vector safety without sacrificing expression of the therapeutic transgene.; A second cis-regulatory element with the potential to improve vector safety is the insulator, which is defined by enhancer-blocking activity. The incorporation of an insulator into an <b>integrating</b> <b>vector</b> may isolate the neighboring cellular genome from any strong enhancer-promoter elements contained within the integrated provirus. However, direct evidence for the effectiveness of insulators within vectors is limited and no systematic comparison has been performed to identify the most active elements. Our studies have identified two insulators, the murine Igf 2 /H 19 imprinting control region and the murine T-cell receptor alpha/delta HS 1 ' element, with the capability to abolish enhancer-promoter interactions within a standard gene expression assay. However, we caution that these insulators are complex, relatively uncharacterized, elements which must be further analyzed {{in the context of an}} integrating vector.; Finally, using zinc finger nuclease technology to achieve site-specific integration within the cellular genome, we have begun to re-examine the transactivation potential of LTRs within the native genomic environment.
