John Luoni [...] The ACLU filed a suit on Sierra's behalf on December 9, 2001 against the school district and Mann, but the suspension was immediately upheld in the Kanawha County circuit court. Sierra's pro bono lawyers claimed that Mann was responsible for disruption, and that he could have taken the opportunity to teach his students about tolerance and constitutional rights instead of making misleading and incendiary comments in the media. The defense countered by saying constitutional rights did not apply equally to adults and students, with the latter not having the same latitude with regards to freedom of speech. Judge James Stucky rejected Sierra's request for a preliminary injunction on November 2, citing her voluntary withdrawal from the county school system, but scheduled a jury trial for her lawsuit for June 24. Stucky ruled that while Sierra was free to believe what she wanted and to express those beliefs, those rights were [...] "not absolute" [...] in a school setting and that the disruption she had caused there overrode her right to free speech. Stucky further declared that he could not guarantee her safety at Sissonville High School. The West Virginia Supreme Court voted 3-2 on November 27 against considering Sierra's petition to prevent the lower court from [...] "continuing to deny her freedom of speech".|$|E
5000|$|The episodes {{received}} {{criticism for}} inaccuracy. Sue Jacob, {{a teacher at}} the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said EastEnders presented a [...] "poor picture of midwifery practice". During Janet's birth, Honey was refused an epidural while in pain, and later she was told that her baby had Down's syndrome alone, without her partner or family there to support her. Jacob commented, [...] "Women are vulnerable after giving birth and they need support systems in place ... The person caring for her is repeatedly referred to as a nurse in the episode but {{there is no way that}} a nurse would be in charge after birth. The midwife would also have been open and honest and said 'We need to get the baby checked out and we will get your partner' ... What the soaps do is set scenes which prompt people to talk about things which are affecting their lives. We are concerned people will wrongly think this Down’s syndrome story shows what really happens, and that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> there is no one there to support you. Showing something like this is not helpful." [...] Furthermore, Jacob noted that Honey was left alone for a long time to worry about the baby, which appeared rigid, and not floppy, as Down's syndrome babies do. In Jacob's opinion, a midwife would have been repeatedly in and out of the room to check on the mother. Additionally, one episode showed a health visitor reprimanding Honey for refusing Down's syndrome screening and Karen Reay, director of the Community Practitioners’ and Health Visitors’ Association called the episode [...] "insensitive and patronising". She added that the episode contained [...] "glaring anomalies", giving new mothers a [...] "fictitious and misleading" [...] view of health visitors, which could [...] "damage relationships with health professionals".|$|E
5000|$|After {{the prayer}} Reid (himself of a {{minority}} faith - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) rose to defend the choice of Zed especially during debates about war. Reid went over all of Zed's involvement in causes around Reno and Nevada, and spoke of his own encounters with students from India while he was attending Utah State. He remembered giving car rides to these students and being invited with his young wife to a traditional Indian feast when it was near his time to graduate which he recalled fondly. During this feast the Indian students gave him gifts including a hand carved statue of Gandhi which Reid said [...] "I have protected and saved that all these years. It is in my office. I have always had it there. The reason I mention that is that if people have any misunderstanding about Indians and Hindus, {{all they have to}} do is think of Gandhi. Here is a man who changed the world, a man who believed in peace. We heard the prayer: Peace, peace, peace. If there was ever a time, with this international war on terror that we are fighting now, where people have to understand how important peace is, think of Gandhi, a man who gave his life for peace, a tiny little man in physical stature but a giant in morality. Gandhi is the man that Martin Luther King, Jr., followed. ...I think it speaks well of our country that someone representing the faith of about a billion people comes here and can speak in communication with our heavenly Father regarding peace. I am grateful he is here. I am thankful he was able to offer this prayer of peace in the Capitol. I say to everyone concerned, think of Gandhi. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in the world, think what this great man has done to bring peace and nonviolence to a troubled world." ...|$|E

5000|$|About {{the sound}} of gunshots in the chorus - [...] "If you’re an {{immigrant}} you left somewhere {{and most of the}} time you fled a war. Gun sounds are a part of our culture as an everyday thing. If you’ve been exposed to gunfights and violence and bombs and war then I can use those sounds backing my thoughts, ya know? Look, I’ve been shot at so I’m quite comfortable with gunshot sounds. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with it, go and talk to the people who were shooting at me."Asked about its relation to paper planes and the lyric - [...] "I fly like paper, get high like planes/ if you catch me at the border I got visas in my name/ if you come around here I make ‘em all day" [...] - [...] "We make our own visas ...A paper plane is the visa itself." [...] - M.I.A. talking to The Daily Beast about [...] "Paper Planes". She added that she felt that listeners could interpret the gunshots and cash register ringing in the song's chorus as coming from any gun-toter, telling an interviewer [...] "You can either apply it on a street level and go, oh, you’re talking about somebody robbing you and saying I’m going to take your money. But, really, it could be a much bigger idea: someone's selling you guns and making money. Selling weapons and the companies that manufacture guns - that's probably the biggest moneymaker in the world." [...] Acknowledging that her heavily politicized lyrics in all of her compositions were [...] "a bit of a jump for people", she told Carolyn E. Davis of MTV in April 2005 that not talking about her experiences in her songs would disqualify her as an artist, noting that [...] "the other point I was making referencing the violence I had seen in Sri Lanka is, if we're going to invest so much money in creating wars around the world, that's quite a given thing. If you've seen somebody get shot and if you've seen a bomb go off, then you've given me total access to talk about it - because you've made that a part of my life. I didn't ask for nobody to bomb my school, but if they did, I would have the right to talk about it. And if people are uncomfortable, then they should think twice before they go off and hit random buildings." [...] M.I.A has expressed surprise at the song's wide commercial success, telling Rolling Stone in October 2008, [...] "I always took pride in being a little underground - it really is a very unlikely record to cross over." [...] She also commented that it was intended to parody fear of immigrants: [...] "It's about people driving cabs all day...appearing really threatening to society. But not being so. Because, by the time you've finished working a 20-hour shift, you're so tired you (just) want to get home to the family." ...|$|E
50|$|Libya {{responded to}} Bolivia {{statement}} in saying it had overcome a dictatorship. Though {{it did not}} initially attach significance at first to the statement, viewing it as propaganda by one party to another, Morales had asked two specific questions and was entitled to obtain an answer. The questions were: Who had Libyan oil and who owned Libyan oil today. The representative {{went on to the}} allege that Libyan oil belonged to Muammar Gaddafi and his family and distributed to members of international forum to fight imperialism, what he called a terrorist organisation founded by Gaddafi to finance leaders of alleged “terrorist organisations.” He accused Morales of being familiar with it as he was a part of it and a leading member of it. As such he suggested Morales laments Gaddafi’s “dictatorship” as he had lost an excellent source of financing. The delegate also suggested revenue from the oil was distributed by Gaddafi to his assistants and the corrupt around the world to sow chaos and kill innocent people. He claimed to have chosen his words fairly as he said he was not unfair to the tyrant Gaddafi. He also suggested that is he was not believed one could see videos that show Libyan oil was not for funding salaries but to spread the philosophy of Gaddafi’s Green Book. The delegate then added that those were corrupt ideas of a single individual who attempted to destroy state institutions and that was how money was spent in the “reign of this tyrant.” He alleged that today it belongs to the Libyan people to repair what he alleged was destroyed by Gaddafi for decades and to provide basic services to its citizens. He claimed he did not offend Morales as the latter probably knew Libya was one of the richest African states but perhaps did not know or needed to know that over quarter of Libyans were allegedly below the poverty threshold, that Libyan civil servants had amongst the lowest salaries, that the education was the lowest in the region, Libya was corrupt state and that most towns did not have sanitation systems and no public transport—neither within nor between cities. He further claimed that Libya was the only country with no post office or postal code and that most streets did not have street names. He {{went on to say that}} Morales was Gaddafi’s friends as revenue from Libyan oil was distributed outside Libya while people were in poverty and basic services were worsening. Morales spoke of the shelling of Libya, but, the delegate claimed, “no Libya was not shelled or bombed. The international community helped Libya and bombed the troops of the despot who were bombing the town and villages and killing innocent people indiscriminately” and that it was “regrettable that Morales still does not want to acknowledge atrocities committed by his friend Gaddafi's troops against innocent people. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with a state or a party don’t use Libya to harm others. The Libyan people know who helped them and who helped their executioner.” As such the “Libyan people would extend their hand to all those who respect their friendship.|$|E

40|$|This course outline {{is longer}} and more complex than those you’ll have for other courses this year. We thought we should start by {{explaining}} why, and by giving you a brief summary of what’s in it. We want every student to perform as well as s/he possibly can in Legal Rhetoric, {{and we think that}} we can help this happen if we take a great deal of care with the educational quality of the course, the consistency with which it’s taught, and the fairness with which students in the course are treated. So this course outline sets out {{everything you need to know}} about the course, from what we’ll cover in every class, through the policies and procedures that apply to students taking the course, to the things you need to do to get the best grade possible and learn the most you can about fundamental lawyering skills during the first year of law school. It’s important that you make yourself familiar with what’s in this course outline because it will affect the quality of your experience in the course and how well you are able to perform. If you work consistently and follow the rules set out here, you’ll achieve the best results you’re capable of. The course outline is divided into 11 main parts: • a checklist of what you need to do before classes start and in the first week of classes; • a table of contents; • general information about and an introduction to Legal Rhetoric; • a detailed week-by-week program; • a checklist of essential dates that lists the deadlines you need to meet in Legal Rhetoric; • the rules and procedures you’ll need to follow to succeed in Legal Rhetoric; • a list and contact information for Legal Rhetoric Faculty, Staff, and Dean’s Fellows (upper class students who work as teaching assistants); • details about how we accommodate students with disabilities; • TWEN (The West Education Network) – the virtual classroom we use in Legal Rhetoric; • how to get extra help with the course if you need it; • what to do <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> that you need solved, suggestions you want to make, or issues you want to raise...|$|E
