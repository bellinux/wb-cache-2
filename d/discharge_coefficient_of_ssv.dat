40|$|A seal is a {{component}} {{used in a}} turbomachine to reduce internal leakage of the working fluid and to increase the machine's efficiency. The stability of a turbomachine partially depends upon the rotodynamic <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the seal. The integral control volume based rotodynamic coefficient prediction programs are no more accurate than {{the accuracy of the}} leakage mass flow rate estimation. Thus an accurate prediction of the mass flow rate through seals is extremely important, especially for rotodynamic analysis of turbomachinery. For labyrinth seals, which are widely used, the energy dissipation is achieved by a series of constrictions and cavities. When the fluid flows through the constriction (under each tooth), a part of the pressure head is converted into kinetic energy, which is dissipated through small scale turbulence-viscosity interaction in the cavity that follows. Therefore, a leakage flow rate prediction equation can be developed by comparing the seal to a series of orifices and cavities. Using this analogy, the mass flow rate is modeled as a function <b>of</b> the flow <b>coefficient</b> under each tooth and the carry over coefficient, which accounts for the turbulent dissipation of kinetic energy in a cavity. This work, based upon FLUENT CFD simulations, initially studies the influence of flow parameters, in addition to geometry, on the carry over <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> a cavity, developing a better model for the same. It is found that the Reynolds number and clearance to pitch ratios have a major influence and tooth width has a secondary influence on the carry over coefficient and models for the same were developed for a generic rectangular tooth on stator labyrinth seal. The <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> the labyrinth seal tooth (with the preceding cavity) was found to be a function <b>of</b> the <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> a single tooth (with no preceding cavity) and the carry over <b>coefficient.</b> The <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> a single tooth is established {{as a function of the}} Reynolds number and width to clearance ratio of the tooth and a model for the same is developed. It is also verified that this model describes the <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> the first tooth in the labyrinth seal. By comparing the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> of compressible flow to that of incompressible flow at the same Reynolds number, the expansion factor was found to depend only upon the pressure ratio and ratio of specific heats. A model for the same was developed. Thus using the developed models, it is possible to compute the leakage mass flow rate as well as the axial distribution of cavity pressure across the seal for known inlet and exit pressures. The model is validated against prior experimental data...|$|R

40|$|<b>Discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> are an {{important}} parameter in the prediction of the air displacement performance of ventilation outlets and in the design <b>of</b> ventilation ducts. <b>Discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> a wooden ventilation duct 8. 54 metres in length and of a constant 0. 17 m$ sp 2 $ cross sectional area were measured. Four different outlet shapes and 3 aperture ratios of each shape were tested. A split plot experimental design {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of outlet shape, outlet size, and distance from the fan on <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The relationship between duct performance characteristics and <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> was examined. A mathematical equation to predict the <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> was developed and tested. <b>Discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> values measured ranged from 0. 19 to 1. 25 depending on the aperture ratio and distance from the fan. Outlet shape had no significant effect. The apparent effects of aperture ratio and size are due to the effects of head ratio. The equation predicting the <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> had a maximum error of 5 percent for the aperture ratios of 0. 5 and 1. 0, and 15 percent at an aperture ratio of 1. 5...|$|R
40|$|Author deduced the new formula on the <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> the {{complete}} submerged flow over the broad-crested weir. On {{account of the}} examination of the propriety of this new formula, the comparison with Honma's and Francis formula was made. As the result, author showed that the new formula is agree with other formulas within the limits of the application of Honma's formula and it is better to use the new one beyond the limits of the application of Honma's formula. Moreover, he showed that the error of the dimensions have no effect on the new formula...|$|R
