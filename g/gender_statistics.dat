40|$|Issues {{related to}} the gender digital divide have been {{prominent}} in discussions of the information society. However, the paucity of statistical data on the subject makes it difficult, if not impossible, {{to make the case}} for the inclusion of gender issues in ICT policies, plans, and strategies to policymakers, particularly those in developing countries. This paper surveys available <b>gender</b> ICT <b>statistics</b> and indicators and makes recommendations for filling the gaps that exist. Few <b>gender</b> ICT <b>statistics</b> are available because many governments do not collect ICT statistics consistently and regularly, and rarely are the data disaggregated by sex. The best practices are generally found in developed countries, with most developing countries lagging behind. Recent work that sheds light on women, gender, and the information society includes a major six-country study on the gender digital divide in francophone countries of West Africa and Orbicom's 2005 research on women in the information society. Although major composite ICT indices do not publish <b>gender</b> and ICT <b>statistics,</b> the potential remains for them to do so, and some indices encourage others to enrich their work with gender data.

30|$|It {{is argued}} by some authors that {{cultural}} factors {{play a major}} role in the acceptance, maintenance, and underreporting of family violence in certain Asian communities that share particular cultural norms and/or beliefs (Bennett et al. 2011; Tse 2007; Xu et al. 2005; Yoshihama 2000; Yoshioka and Dang 2000). For instance, pervasive patriarchal belief systems that engender male dominance, authority, and economic control may promote submission in women, and underlie the controlling nature of family violence (Dempsey and Day 2011; Hunnicutt 2009). The pervasiveness of such patriarchal belief systems may be indirectly evidenced by markedly skewed male/female gender ratios at birth in countries such as China (118 / 100; 2009), South Korea (106.7 / 100; 2010), and Vietnam (111.2 / 100; 2010) (Guilmoto 2012).

40|$|Abstract: Women’s work {{continues}} to be {{an important part of the}} national debate. We argue that although the focus in 2011 was on policy consolidation rather than new initiatives, a policy platform relating to women, work and family has been set in Australia. A shift to recognizing the implications of policy for men’s work and care roles is also discernible. The year 2011 was the 100 th anniversary of the first International Women’s Day but, while celebrated around Australia, gender inequities remain. Coming onto the agenda with greater force in 2011 were the gender-related issues of an ageing workforce, growing elder care needs and sexual harassment. This article reviews selected <b>gender</b> <b>statistics</b> and then moves to the matters that were prominent in 2011 : mature workers, care, pay equity, women in the defence forces, and legislative reform relating to sex discrimination, the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 and paid parental leave...|$|E
40|$|The {{essence of}} the state gender policy at the present stage in the Republic of Belarus is substantiated. The {{regional}} peculiarities of {{the implementation of the}} state program document «The National Plan of Action for Ensuring Gender Equality for 2017 - 2020 » are disclosed. The experience of designing a regional plan for the implementation of the state gender policy of the Minsk City Executive Committee for 2017 - 2020 is shown on the example of the Academy of Management under the President of the Republic of Belarus.   In the broad sense, gender policy is understood as one of the strategic directions of social policy. At the same time, gender policy is aimed at overcoming discrimination based on gender, gender asymmetry in the sphere of power relations, gender imbalance in the labor market, employment. Gender policy in the context of international legislative acts takes into account the national identity, the features of the political system, and the socio-economic development of a concrete state. With all existing differences, gender policy in its narrow meaning is a purposeful, dynamic, adaptive process of public administration, regulation, coordination, control in the sphere of gender relations on three bases: political doctrine; state ideology; program priorities and values of gender equality. The interdisciplinarity of gender policy integrates it with other areas of social policy. Thus, gender policy is implicit in goals, the content of state family policy, demographic, educational, youth, protection of maternity and childhood. Formation and implementation of gender policy is based on analysis, interpretation of statistical data (social policy directions), which are disaggregated by sex, in the dynamics of indicators. Based on the UN used methodology, taking into account the national speciﬁcs of the Belarusian society, has been created relevant <b>gender</b> <b>statistics</b> and it is developing as an information resource for decision-making. <b>Gender</b> <b>statistics</b> in Belarus are used by authorities, practitioners-managers and scientists.  Practice conﬁrms that the use of a gender approach in public administration contributes to the procuring of the women rights, freedoms, and opportunities. It increases their social and political statuses both within societal institutions and at the state level.

40|$|The book {{develops}} {{ideas and}} tools {{to meet the}} Swedish government’s aim to mainstream the policy of equal opportunities into all policy areas. To apply the gender perspective {{at the level of}} strategic planning, instead of at a detailed level, is stressed. To start, concepts such as equal opportunities and gender perspective are elaborated in relation to the field of planning. Through applying gender theory it is shown how conventional planning may contribute to gender inequality by neglecting and disregarding women’s traditional experiences. By using concepts such as everyday life and social reproduction, strategic planning can improve the possibilities for women and men to live “equal” lives. The book illustrates different ways to theoretically and practically – such as through the use of time geography, <b>gender</b> segregated <b>statistics</b> and public participation – develop the knowledge base for gender aware planning. Planning areas where the gender perspective is of special importance are social infrastructure (location of day care centres, schools etc), location of shopping facilities, transport facilities as well as safety and security.
