5|$|Marshall {{considered}} {{returning to}} Columbia City after leaving office, but instead bought {{a home and}} opened a law practice in Indianapolis, where he believed there would be better business opportunities. Harding nominated him {{to serve on the}} Lincoln Memorial Commission in 1921, and then to a more lucrative position on the Federal Coal Commission in 1922; Marshall resigned from both commissions in 1923. He spent over a year writing books on the law and his Recollections, a humorous memoir. The latter book was completed in May 1925 and subsequent historians have noted it as unusual, even for <b>its</b> <b>time,</b> <b>for</b> not disclosing any secrets or attacking any of Marshall's enemies. Marshall remained a popular public speaker, and continued to travel to give speeches. The last he delivered was to high school students in the town of his birth.|$|E
25|$|As {{they reached}} the tunnel with Cerberus waiting for them, Hercules starts to lose his courage in front of Emma, Mary Margaret and Regina. Hades then appears and tells the women that Cerberus was the {{creature}} responsible for killing Hercules (who happens to be Hades' nephew), then gives Emma Hook's bloodied hook as a gift. Back at the apartment, Mary Margaret believes <b>its</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Hercules, who regretted fighting Cerberus alone, to fight the creature as a team. When Cerberus enters the apartment, everyone splits up, leaving Hercules, Mary Margaret, and the woman trapped inside the library. Hercules suddenly gives the woman his dagger, then grabs a pipe for himself, and Mary Margaret readies her arrows. The trio then use their weapons on Cerberus and successfully kill the creature. The woman faints and Hercules catches her, and when she comes to they introduce each other, as she revealed to Hercules her name is Megara, or as her friends called her, Meg.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{from the}} first, Yiddish theater drew {{a level of}} theater {{criticism}} comparable to any other European theater of <b>its</b> <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> example, Bercovici cites a [...] "brochure" [...] by one G. Abramski, published in 1877, that described and gave critiques of all of Goldfaden's plays of that year. Abramski speculated that the present day might be for Yiddish theater a moment comparable to the Elizabethan era for English theater. He discussed what a Yiddish theater ought to be, noted its many sources (ranging from Purim plays to circus pantomime), and praised its incorporation of strong female roles. He also criticized where he saw weaknesses, noting how unconvincingly a male actor played the mother in Shmendrik, or remarking of the play Di shtume kale (The Mute Bride) — a work that Goldfaden apparently wrote to accommodate a pretty, young actress who in the performance was too nervous to deliver her lines — that the only evidence of Goldfaden's authorship was his name.|$|E

In the words of Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of <b>its</b> <b>time,</b> <b>for</b> all time." [...] Richard Austin, of Sotheby's auction house, said: [...] "Before the release of Like a Rolling Stone, music charts were overrun with short and sweet love songs, many clocking in at three minutes or less.

500|$|The Monadnock {{belongs to}} the Printing House Row District, a National Historic Landmark which {{includes}} the Manhattan Building, the Old Colony Building, and the Fisher Building, some of Chicago's seminal early skyscrapers. The Manhattan Building, built by William LeBaron Jenney in 1890, was the first building in Chicago with a complete steel skeleton or [...] "Chicago" [...] construction, an innovation Jenney had introduced in the Home Insurance Building in 1884. The first 16-story building in America, {{at the time it}} was [...] "regarded with awe and fear". Jenney's masterpiece, the Manhattan was considered a technical triumph in construction. The 17-story Old Colony, built by Holabird & Roche in 1894, was considered one of the structural masterpieces of <b>its</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> its revolutionary portal form of bracing. It is the only survivor of a group of Chicago school buildings with rounded corner bays. The Fisher Building, built by Burnham in 1894, was an engineering miracle—the first tall commercial building to be built almost entirely without bricks. Its steel frame and thin terracotta curtain wall allowed two-thirds of the surface to be covered with glass.|$|E
500|$|The chamber opera Savitri (1908) {{is written}} for three solo voices, a small hidden female chorus, and an {{instrumental}} {{combination of two}} flutes, a cor anglais and a double string quartet. The music critic John Warrack comments on the [...] "extraordinary expressive subtlety" [...] with which Holst deploys the sparse forces: [...] "...he two unaccompanied vocal lines opening the work skilfully convey the relationship between Death, steadily advancing through the forest, and Savitri, her frightened answers fluttering round him, unable to escape his harmonic pull." [...] Head describes the work as unique in <b>its</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> its compact intimacy, and considers it Holst's most successful attempt to end the domination of Wagnerian chromaticism in his music. Dickinson considers it a significant step, [...] "not towards opera, but towards an idiomatic pursuit of [...] vision". Of the Kālidāsa texts, Dickinson dismisses The Cloud Messenger (1910–12) as an [...] "accumulation of desultory incidents, opportunistic dramatic episodes and ecstatic outpourings" [...] which illustrate the composer's creative confusion during that period; the Two Eastern Pictures (1911), in Dickinson's view, provide [...] "a more memorable final impression of Kālidāsa".|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was redesigned and these modifications {{were introduced in}} the sequential new models of the Metalplane called the H-45 and H-47. [...] The aircraft now could accommodate passengers and mail. [...] To do this, they had to specifically change the aircraft such as: moving the wing above the fuselage so six seats could be added; enclosing the cockpit and adding windows and leather padding {{the interior of the}} aircraft for the passengers' comfort. [...] Offering different type of radial engines that could be incorporated per the customers' request (both Wright and Pratt & Whitney) and different types of landing gear that could be fitted too (such as skis, wheels and pontoons). Since most of the Hamilton Metalplanes used most of the products generated from the other Hamilton factory it was a cheaper than the Ford Tri-Motor. [...] The Hamilton Metalplane was definitely a plane of <b>its</b> <b>time,</b> <b>for</b> it was the era when airlines were being developed with cargo/mail in mind instead of passengers. [...] Both the Hamilton Metalplane and the Ford tri-motors started to change this trend. [...] Northwest Airlines started by purchasing a number of Hamiltons to be used in their first passenger run throughout their routes in the Northwest. [...] Ralph Sexton bought a number of Hamiltons to be used for his Panamanian airline called Isthmian Airways. A few went to Alaska and Canada for use in the Arctic. [...] As with Hamilton's earlier aircraft in Seattle, it is not known the exact figure of how many Hamiltons were built but it is estimated to be between 27 and 40 aircraft. Unfortunately, the Hamilton Metalplanes were not as successful as the Ford Tri-Motors. [...] For Ford was successful at their marketing strategy of stating it is safer to fly on three engines than on one. [...] For this reason, the Hamilton Metal plane struggled in the market, for it was a good airplane developed ahead of its time.|$|E
