40|$|AbstractTo {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} formation of cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles, RNA- 2 -encoded precursor proteins were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Processing of the 105 K and 95 K polyproteins in trans to give the mature Large (L) and Small (S) coat proteins required both the 32 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase</b> cofactor and the 24 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase</b> itself, while processing of VP 60, consisting of the fused L–S protein, required only the 24 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase.</b> Release of the L and S proteins resulted {{in the formation of}} virus-like particles (VLPs), showing that VP 60 can act as a precursor of virus capsids. Processing of VP 60 expressed in plants also led to efficient production of VLPs. Analysis of the VLPs produced by the action of the 24 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase</b> on precursors showed that they were empty (RNA-free). This has important implications for the use of CPMV VLPs in biotechnology and nanotechnology as it will permit the use of noninfectious particles...|$|E

40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of the RNA genome of pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV) was deter-mined from cloned cDNA and by direct sequencing of viral RNA. The PSbMV genomic sequence was determined tobe 9924 nucleotides in length excluding the poly(A) tract. The RNA contained an open readiog frame (ORF) of 9618 nucleotides {{with the potential to}} encode a polyprotein with a calculated Mr of 364000 (364 K). The ORF was flanked by a 5 ' untranslated leader sequence of 143 nucleotides and a 3 ' untranslat-ed region of 163 nucleotides. A comparison of the PSbMV polyprotein with the polyproteins of the potyviruses tobacco etch virus (TEV), tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV), plum pox virus (PPV) and potato virus Y (PVY) showed that PSbMV had a similar genome organization. The polyproteins had a high level of amino acid identity except in the N-terminal region, which varied in both sequence and length. Putative proteolytic leavage sites were identi-fied in the polyprotein of PSbMV by comparison with those identified for other potyviruses. The cleavage site between the 6 K protein and the 49 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase</b> is proposed to occur at the C-terminal side of glutamic acid and not at the C-terminal side of glutamine as in other potyviruses. In addition to the five proteolytic cleavage sites for the 49 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase</b> identified pre-viously, a sixth putative cleavage site was identified internally in the 49 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase</b> of PSbMV, {{as well as in the}} 49 K proteinases of TEV, TVMV, PPV, PVY and soybean mosaic virus. Cleavage at this site in the 49 K proteinases of TEV, TVMV and PPV would result in an N-terminal protein of 22 K to 24 K, which is similar in size to the size determined for their VPgs...|$|E

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} four rapid DNA extraction methods to provide DNA for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from routinely fixed, paraffin wax embedded archival tissues. METHODS [...] Eighteen blocks of various tissues, 18 blocks of cervical cancer specimens, and nine blocks of B cell lymphomas were investigated. Both normal and biopsy specimen sized tissues were studied. DNA was extracted using four methods: boiling for 20 minutes in distilled water; boiling for 20 minutes in 5 % Chelex- 100 resin solution; 3 -hour <b>proteinase</b> <b>K</b> digestion; and 3 -hour <b>proteinase</b> <b>K</b> digestion, followed by boiling in 5 % Chelex- 100. Different exons of the p 53 gene, human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) sequence, and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement were amplified from the extracts. RESULTS [...] The Chelex boiling, <b>proteinase</b> <b>K</b> digestion, and <b>proteinase</b> <b>K</b> digestion-Chelex boiling methods produced DNA suitable for amplification {{in all of the}} 45 samples. Boiling in water yielded insufficient template for the PCR in three of the 45 cases (7 %), and in six of 42 positive cases (14 %) much fainter bands were observed, mostly when the processed material was either biopsy specimen sized or a B cell lymphoma sample. Fragments of the p 53 gene were successfully amplified up to 408 base pairs in water boiled extracts, up to 647 in Chelex boiled preparates, and up to 984 in <b>proteinase</b> <b>K</b> digested and <b>proteinase</b> <b>K</b> digested-Chelex boiled samples, although with decreased sensitivity in the last case. All of the templates were reusable after 3 months of storage at - 20 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS [...] Chelex boiling, <b>proteinase</b> <b>K</b> digestion, and <b>proteinase</b> <b>K</b> digestion followed by Chelex boiling produce suitable templates for the PCR from a large variety of paraffin wax embedded tissues. As the simple 20 minute boiling method in 5 % Chelex- 100 solution requires minimal manipulation and time, it could be useful, especially in the routine processing of large amounts of material...|$|R

40|$|The {{invasion}} {{strategy of}} many viruses involves {{the synthesis of}} viral gene products that mimic {{the functions of the}} cellular proteins and thus interfere with the key cellular processes. Here we show that adenovirus infection is accompanied by an increased ubiquitin-cleaving (deubiquitinating) activity in the host cells. Affinity chromatography on ubiquitin aldehyde (Ubal), which was designed to identify the deubiquitinating proteases, revealed the presence of adenovirus L 3 23 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase</b> (Avp) in the eluate from adenovirus-infected cells. This proteinase is known to be necessary for the processing of viral precursor proteins during virion maturation. We show here that in vivo Avp deubiquitinates a number of cellular proteins. Analysis of the substrate specificity of Avp in vitro demonstrated that the protein deubiquitination by this enzyme could be as efficient as proteolytic processing of viral proteins. The structural model of the Ubal-Avp interaction revealed some similarity between S 1 -S 4 substrate binding sites of Avp and ubiquitin hydrolases. These results may reflect the acquisition of an advantageous property by adenovirus and may indicate the importance of ubiquitin pathways in viral infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{full-length}} {{transcript of}} {{grapevine fanleaf virus}} (GFLV) RNA 2 produces a primary product of 122 K when translated in the rabbit reticulocyte system. This 122 K polyprotein is completely processed in vitro by the RNAl-encoded 24 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase.</b> The positions of the cleavage sites within the polyprotein have been mapped and the genome organization of GFLV-F 13 RNA 2 has been established.

These proteins represent the final cleavage products of the 122 K polyprotein. A 66 K protein which yields 28 K and 38 K proteins constitutes the major maturation intermediate. Microsequencing of the amino extremity of radioactively labelled 38 K protein allowed identification of the Cys 257 /Ala 258 site as the cleavage site recognized by the GFLV proteinase between the 28 K and the 38 K proteins in the 66 K protein {{in addition to the}} Arg 6 ° 5 /Gly ~° 6 site between the 38 K protein and the coat protein...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{topology}} of the H+,K+-ATPase {{has been}} studied after proteolytic degradation of the protein by proteinase <b>K.</b> <b>Proteinase</b> K had access to either the cytoplasmic part of the protein or to {{both sides of the}} membrane. Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy indicated that membrane-associated domain of the protein represented about 55 % of the native protein, meanwhile the cytoplasmic part represented only 27 % of the protein. The secondary structure of the ATPase and of its membrane-associated domains was investigated by infrared spectroscopy. The secondary structure of the membrane-associated structures and of the entire protein was quite similar (alpha-helices, 35 %; beta-sheets, 35 %; turns, 20 %; random, 15 %). These data were in agreement with 10 alpha-helical transmembrane segments but suggested a participation of beta-sheet structures in the membrane-associated part of the protein. Polarized infrared spectroscopy indicated that the alpha-helices were oriented nearly perpendicular to the membrane plane. No preferential orientation could be attributed to the beta-sheets. Monitoring the amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics demonstrated that the membrane associated part of the ATPase molecule is characterized by a relatively high accessibility to the solvent, quite different from that observed for bacteriorhodopsin membrane segments.

40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) -based hybrid comoviral RNA- 2 {{molecules}} have been constructed. In these, the region encoding both the large (L) and small (S) viral coat proteins {{was replaced by}} the equivalent region from bean pod mottle virus (BPMV). The hybrid RNA- 2 molecules were able to replicate in cowpea protoplasts in the presence of CPMV RNA- 1. Though processing of the hybrid polyproteins by the CPMV-specific 24 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase</b> at the site between the 58 / 48 K and L proteins could readily be achieved, no processing at the site between the L and S coat proteins could be obtained even when the sequence of amino acids between the two coat proteins was made CPMV-like. As a result, none of the hybrids was able to form functional virus particles, and they could not infect cowpea plants. Comparison with the processing of the L–S site in cis in reticulocyte lysates demonstrated that the requirements for processing are more stringent in trans than in cis. The results suggest that the L–S cleavage site is defined by more than just a linear sequence of amino acids and probably involves interactions between the L–S loop and the β barrels of the viral coat proteins...|$|E

40|$|The TolQ and TolR {{proteins}} of Escherichia coli {{are required}} for the uptake of group A colicins and for infection by filamentous phages. Their topology in the cytoplasmic membrane was determined by cleavage with aminopeptidase <b>K,</b> <b>proteinase</b> K, and trypsin in spheroplasts and cell lysates. From the results obtained, it is proposed that the N terminus of TolQ {{is located in the}} periplasm and that it contains three transmembrane segments (residues 9 to 36, 127 to 159, and 162 to 191), a small periplasmic loop, and two large portions in the cytoplasm. The N terminus of TolR is located in the cytoplasm and is followed by a transmembrane segment (residues 21 to 40), and the remainder of the protein is located in the periplasm. A tolQ mutant, which rendered cells resistant to group A colicins and sensitive to cholate, had alanine 13 replaced by glycine and was lacking serine 14 in the first transmembrane segment. The membrane topologies of TolQ and TolR are similar to those proposed for ExbB and ExbD, respectively, which is consistent with the partial functional substitution between ExbB and TolQ and between ExbD and TolR. The amino acid sequences of these proteins display the highest homology in the transmembrane segments, which indicates that the membrane-spanning regions {{play an important role in}} the activities of the proteins...|$|E

40|$|Background & objectives: Among cell surface proteins, biofilm-associated protein (Bap) {{promotes}} biofilm {{development in}} Staphylococcus aureus strains. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate proteinase-mediated biofilm dispersion in different isolates of S. aureus. Methods: Biofilm assay was done in 96 -well microtitre plate to evaluate the effect of proteinase K on biofilms of bovine mastitis S. Aureus isolates. Extracellular polymeric substances were extracted and evaluated for their composition (protein, polysaccharides and extracellular DNA), before and after the proteinase K treatment. Results: Biofilm assay showed that 2 μg/ml proteinase K significantly inhibited biofilm development in bap-positive S. aureus V 329 as well as other S. aureus isolates (SA 7, SA 10, SA 33, SA 352), but not in bap-mutant M 556 and SA 392 (a weak biofilm-producing strain). Proteinase K treatment on S. aureus planktonic cells showed that there was no inhibition of planktonic growth up to 32 μg/ml of proteinase <b>K.</b> <b>Proteinase</b> K treatment on 24 h old preformed biofilms showed an enhanced dispersion of bap-positive V 329 and SA 7, SA 10, SA 33 and SA 352 biofilms; however, proteinase K did not affect the bap-mutant S. aureus M 556 and SA 392 biofilms. Biofilm compositions study before and after proteinase K treatment indicated that Bap might also be involved in eDNA retention in the biofilm matrix that aids in biofilm stability. When proteinase K was used in combination with antibiotics, a synergistic effect in antibiotic efficacy was observed against all biofilm-forming S. aureus isolates. Interpretation & conclusions: Proteinase K inhibited biofilms growth in S. aureus bovine mastitis isolates but did not affect their planktonic growth. An enhanced dispersion of preformed S. aureus biofilms was observed on proteinase K treatment. Proteinase K treatment with antibiotics showed a synergistic effect against S. aureus biofilms. The study suggests that dispersing S. aureus by protease can be of use while devising strategies againstS. aureus biofilms...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described in}} this thesis were designed to unravel {{various aspects of the}} mechanism of gene expression of cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). For this purpose full-length DNA copies of both genomic RNAs of CPMV were constructed. Using powerful invitro transcription systems RNA transcripts closely resembling the viral RNAs were prepared from these clones, which were efficiently translated invitro and were able to infect cowpea protoplasts. Mutations were introduced in specific regions in the cDNA clones using methods for site-direced mutagenesis. Investigation of the effect of these mutations on viral gene expression has increased our insight in the multiplication cycle of CPMV. Most of the mutagenized cDNA clones {{described in this}} thesis were designed to study the proteolytic processing of the CPMV polyproteins. The proteolytic processing of CPMV lends itself very well to be studied invitro because it reliably mimicks the processing invivo upon translation of the viral RNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Pelham, 1978; Franssen etal., 1984). The results obtained here clearly indicate that the B RNA encoded 24 K polypeptides is the proteinase involved in all cleavage reactions in the CPMV polyproteins. The question remains however how to processing of the CPMV polyproteins is regulated invivo. Some cleavage reactions which occur slowly invitro occur so rapidly invivo, that the precursor polypeptides cannot be detected. In the proteolytic processing of the M RNA encoded polyproteins. the 32 K polypeptide also plays a role. because in its absence the glutamine-methionine site is cleaved very oorly by the 24 <b>K</b> <b>proteinase</b> (chapter 6). Furthermore {{it is not clear whether}} the 24 K polypeptide is proteolytically active in infected cells in the form one or mroe of the precursor polypeptides: the 170 K, 110 K and 84 K polypeptides or as a free protein. It may therefore be expected that the proteoytic cleavages invivo are strictly regulated depending on the different processes in the life cycle of the virus, like RNA multiplication and virus assembly. The only way to gain more insight in the regulation of the proteolytic cleavage reactions is to study the expression of specifically modified cDNA clones invivo. In view of that the expression of RNA transcripts of fulllength cDNA clones in cowpea protoplasts is very promising. The expression of such transcripts in protoplasts was successful, but their infectivity in comparison to viral RNA was rather low and therefore the usefulness of these transcripts at this moment is limited. Besides the infection of whole cowpea plants could not be achieved. It is obvious that the infectivity of the RNA transcripts needs to be improved to increase their applicability. The difference in infectivity between viral RNA and the invitro synthesized RNA sent originate from the different properties of the RNA molecules. Compared to viral RNA the invitro synthesized RNAs lack the genome-linked protein VPg and have two additional nucleotides at the 5 ' end and 4 to 5 extra nucleotides to the 3 ' end of the RNA. The invitro synthesized RNA transcripts of full-length cDNA clones of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and bromo mosaic virus (BMV) have a relatively high level of infectivity (Damson etal., 1986; Meshi etal., 1986; Ahlquist etal., 1984), but these transcripts have exactly the same 5 ' end as the viral RNAs; i. e. a cap structure. Using one of the currently known invitro transcription systems it seems difficult to synthesize invitro transcripts from DNA copies of CPMV RNA, which have exactly the same 5 ' end as the viral RNAs. It may be hoped that the infectivity of the transcripts will increase if the number of extra nucleotides at the 5 ' end is reduced, but the synthesis of such transcripts will most likely be less efficient (Kang and Nu, 1987; Dunn and Studier, 1983). It in also possible that the extra nucleotides at the 3 ' end affect the infectivity, although in case of other viruses for which the invitro transcription of cDNA clones has been reported sofar a limited number of extra nucleotides added to the 3 ' end did not significantly influence infectivity (Ahlquist etal., 1984 : Van der Werf etal., 1986; Dasmahapatra etal., 1986; Meshi etal., 1986; Dawson etal., 1986). It should be possible to construct cDNA clones, which allow the invitro synthesis of RNA transcripts terminating in a poly(A) tail without extra nucleotides at the 3 ' end using a restriction enzym for linearization of the template DNA, which restricts the DNA upstream of its recogntion sequence like e. g. BspM 1. The possibilities for investigating the various aspects of the multiplication cycle of CPMV and of virus-host interaction will increase significantly when RNA transcripts can be synthesized which are much more infectious than the present ones. Since B RNA replicates independently in cowpea protoplasts because it encodes all proteins necessary for replication of the viral RNAs and proteolytic processing of the polyproteins. various mutations can be introduced in M RNA transcripts without affecting the multiplication and expression of B RNA. The infection of cowpea protoplasts with B RNA transcripts together with specifically modified K RNA transcripts may lead to a better understanding of the proteolytic processing of the M RNA encoded polyproteins invivo and to the elucidation of sequences involved in viral RNA replication. ...|$|E
