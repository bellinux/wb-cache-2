Concerning its systematic position, KOLLIKER himself considered to be intermediate between <b>Gorgonacea,</b> Alcyonacea and Pennatulacea, but did not suggest a family affiliation. A few later authors treated this genus have attributed it to the Telesto-allies, though it is suspectable that they referred wholly to KOLLIKER's original description. The outstanding characteristics that a colony has a single axial polyp which alone has the gastric cavity extending {{to the base of the}} colony as a distinct axial canal, short lateral polyps imbedded in the spiculiferous coenenchyme, no axis and no creeping stolon decline to ascribe Pseudogorgia godeffroyi to any Octocorallian taxa currently diagnosed.

It has been harvested for millennia with ever evolving harvesting methods, that, as in most fisheries, have become over-efficient. Today there is overwhelming evidence that almost all known red coral stocks are overexploited (FAO 1983, FAO 1988, Santangelo et al. 1993 b, Santangelo and Abbiati 2001, Tsounis et al. 2007). However, management and conservation options are still being debated between the industry, decision makers and even ecologists. Although harvesting pressure, slow growth and isolation of the populations create an unfavorable situation, the threat of species extinction is not clear. On the other hand, local extinction of shallow water populations due to overharvesting and mass mortality events is likely, and economic extinction is certain to occur if management measures are not revised.

Coral conservation measures previously implemented include trawl closure areas and a prohibition on commercial harvests. Because other fishing gears (e. g., longlines and pots) also impact corals, a prohibition of all gear types in areas of high coral concentration was proposed and evaluated. The proposal was tabled because available scientific data on coral distribution was at too large of a scale to define discrete locations of coral colonies. Additionally, many fishermen using longline and pot gear were concerned about being displaced from areas they had previously fished, and many felt that their gear caused less damage to corals than trawl gear. Involvement of stakeholders at the local level will allow for better information exchange, including information on coral distribution, fishing gear impacts, and development of appropriate management measures...|$|R
40|$|Coral-grounds are reef {{communities}} that colonize rocky substratum {{but do not}} form framework or three-dimensional reef structures. To investigate why, we used video transects and underwater photography to determine the composition, structure and status of a coral-ground community located {{on the edge of}} a rocky terrace in front of a tourist park, Xcaret, in the northern Mesoamerican Reef tract, Mexico. The community has a relatively low coral, gorgonian and sponge cover (, 10 %) and high algal cover (. 40 %). We recorded 23 species of Scleractinia, 14 species of <b>Gorgonacea</b> and 30 species of Porifera. The coral community is diverse but lacks large coral colonies, being dominated instead by small, sediment-tolerant, and brooding species. In these small colonies, the abundance of potentially lethal interactions and partial mortality is high but decreases when colonies are larger than 40 cm. Such characteristics are consistent with an environment control whereby storm waves periodically remove larger colonies and elevate sediment flux. The community only survives these storm conditions due to its slope-break location, which ensures lack of burial and continued local recruitment. A comparison with similar coral-ground communities in adjacent areas suggests that the narrow width of the rock terrace hinders sediment stabilization, thereby ensuring that communities cannot escape bottom effects and develop into threedimensional reef structures on geological time scales...|$|R

[...] 4 pages, 2 figuresManagement {{approaches}} {{based on a}} detailed knowledge of specific population demographic features are fundamental to ensure long-term exploitation sustainability (Knittweis et al. 2009). Demography focuses on the specific dynamics of each population, allowing to project population structure over time. This approach allows setting out local conservation strategies for wildlife and for exploited species structured into discrete local populations, such as the Mediterranean red coral (Abbiati et al. 1993). Regarding corals, long-term studies are scarce due to their slow growth and longevity (Connell 1997; Garrabou and Harmelin 2002). Because of its high economic value, the precious Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum (Cnidaria, Octocorallia, <b>Gorgonacea)</b> has been harvested for more than 2000 years and its shallow-water populations (living between 20 and 70 m depth), indicate a regression and even a partial economic extinction (Tsounis et al. 2007).

This second part deals with a large number of these octocorals, belonging to the orders Telestacea, Alcyonacea and <b>Gorgonacea</b> (suborder Scleraxonia). The majority of the specimens reported upon are now in the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden; their register numbers are preceded by the abbreviation RMNH. A few specimens collected by Dr. J. H. Stock now form part of the collection of the Zoölogisch Museum, Amsterdam; their register numbers are preceded by the abbreviation ZMA. I want to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. G. J. Vrijmoeth for making the excellent photographs, and to Mr. W. ter Spill for revising my manuscript.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that gorgonians produce secondary metabolites that act as chemical defenses against predators and pathogens in the reef environment. While there have been investigations of the <b>gorgonacea</b> of the Western Atlantic which have shown that these organisms do contain defensive chemistry, the chemical ecology of Indo-Pacific gorgonians has not been investigated. The goal of this thesis research was to investigate the ecological role of Indo-Pacific gorgonian secondary metabolites in mediating interactions with potential predators and pathogens and to identify and describe the secondary metabolites responsible for observed activity. This dissertation concerns Indo-Pacific gorgonian chemical defenses against predation by the generalist reef fish Thalassoma lunare and Halichoeres melanurus, and against the growth of fungi isolated from gorgonian tissues, including the known gorgonian pathogen Aspergillus sydowii. The identification and characterization of novel secondary metabolites from gorgonians is also presented in this dissertation. The information gathered in these surveys led to projects involving gorgonian species of particular interest, with the aim of revealing the compound or compounds responsible for observed activities. Each project is described both biologically and chemically. The biological aspects described are the taxonomic identification of gorgonians and fungal strains. and the testing of extracts and pure compounds in assays. The chemical studies involve the isolation and structure elucidation of known and novel gorgonian secondary metabolites.

40|$|Deep-sea bamboo corals (order <b>Gorgonacea,</b> family Isididae) {{are known}} to record changes in water mass {{chemistry}} over decades to centuries. These corals are composed of a two-part skeleton of calcite internodes segmented by gorgonin organic nodes. We examine the spatial variability of bamboo coral organic node 13 C/ 12 C and 15 N/ 14 N from 13 bamboo coral specimens sampled along the California margin (37 – 32 ° N, 792 – 2136 m depth). Radiocarbon analyses of the organic nodes show {{the presence of the}} anthropogenic bomb spike, indicating the corals utilize a surface-derived food source (pre-bomb D 14 C values of ∼− 100 ‰, post-bomb values up to 82 ‰). Carbon and nitrogen isotope data from the organic nodes (δ 13 C = − 15. 9 ‰ to − 19. 2 ‰; δ 15 N = 13. 8 ‰ to 19. 4 ‰) suggest selective feeding on surface-derived organic matter or zooplankton. A strong relationship between coral δ 15 N and habitat depth indicates a potential archive of changing carbon export, with decreased δ 15 N values reflecting reduced microbial degradation (increased carbon flux) at shallower depths. Using four multi-centennial-length coral records, we interpret long-term δ 15 N stability in the California Current. Organic node δ 15 C values record differences in carbon isotope fractionation dictated by nearshore vs. offshore primary production. These findings imply strong coupling between primary production, pelagic food webs, and deep-sea benthic communities...|$|R

In contrast to the high diversity of gorgonians in the West Indies and the Indo-West-Pacific, the faunal list in Hawaii must still be considered depauperate. This is especially true in shallow water < 75 m), where only one species is known. Although climatic deterioration during the Pleistocene could account for the scarcity of gorgonians in shallow water at the present time, this factor is unlikely to have affected deeper species. Furthermore, one would expect to find a modern complement of an ancestral faun a in shallow water if it had existed, as is true in the case of reef corals. The paucity of gorgonians in Hawaii may be due to isolation, which {{appears to have been a}} particularly effective barrier in shallow water. It is suggested that the only accessible route to Hawaii for gorgonians has been in deep water where, in the past, there were numerous stepping stones that may have aided dispersal. Moreover, chemical and physical gradients in deep water are relatively low. Why more deepwater species have not migrated into shallow water in Hawaii may be a reflection of their stenotypic character...|$|R
40|$|An {{initiative}} for the worldwide conservation of gorgonian corals {{of the family}} Coralliidae (Anthozoa, <b>Gorgonacea)</b> was attempted at the 14 th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties of CITES at The Hague (CoP 14) through a proposal to place members of this family on Appendix- II of the Convention (Anonymous 2007; Pala 2007; WWF 2007). Ultimately the proposal was defeated in a secret ballot, although the decision was taken to organize topical workshops devoted to upgrading knowledge of precious corals, which are all grouped in the two extant genera Corallium and Paracorallium. This call resulted in two workshops focusing on Pacific and Mediterranean precious corals, held in 2009 in Hong Kong and Naples, respectively (IAPPCS 2009; Anonymous 2009). In the meantime the request for inclusion of the Coralliidae in Appendix-II of CITES is in all likelihood going to be proposed for consideration at the forthcoming CoP 15 in Qatar, scheduled for the year 2010. Corallium rubrum colonizes a variety of sublittoral habitats generally between a few meters depth down to 120 m in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic Ocean (e. g. Bayer 1964; Carpine and Grasshof 1975; Zibrowius et al. 1984; Chintiroglou et al. 1989; Cattaneo-Vietti and Cicogna 1993; Abbiati et al. 1993; Garrabou and Harmelin 2002; Torrens et al. 2008; Rossi et al. 2008; Tsounis et al. 2006). The bright red calcitic axis of this species has been prized in the jewelry trade from antiquity {{to the present day}} (Cattaneo-Vietti and Cicogna 1993; Tsounis et al. 2007).

40|$|Gorgonian corals {{commonly}} {{occur in}} great numbers and	diversity inthe Caribbean, east Pacific and Indo-Pacific. Previous natural pro­duct investigations of Caribbean gorgonians have yielded a	plethora of structurally and	biologically unique compounds. These include diter­penes, sesquiterpenes, sterols and prostaglandins. Prior to this inves­tigation, very little was known about the natural products composition of the east Pacific <b>Gorgonacea.</b> This dissertation reports the isolation and	structure elucidation of twenty-seven natural products from fifteen species of east Pacific gorgonians. Twenty of the compounds described are new and seven were previously known from other marine and terres­trial sources. The gorgonians studied were collected off the	coast	of southern California and Pacific Mexico, and in the Gulf of California. The structures {{of all of the}} compounds were elucidated by combined chem­ical and spectroscopic methods. Examination of the extracts of four Lophogorgia species resulted in the isolation of a new neuromuscular toxin, lophotoxin, and six related furanocembrenolide compounds. Lophotoxin acts specifically and irreversibly at low concentrations to block indirect nerve stimulated muscle contraction. One of the Lophogorgia species	studied, L. alba, also contained three new 1, 4 -diketone cembrenolides. Eugorgia forreri, collected in the Gulf of California, possessed two cembrane-diterpenes which were previously isolated from a soft coral collected in Canton Atoll. An investigation of the natural products composition of five Pacifigorgia species yielded seven sesquiterpene-derived metabolites. Six of the seven compounds possessed familiar germacrane, cadinane and guaiane ring systems. The remaining sesquiterpene contained a novel linear carbon skeleton. Extracts of two Mexican Muricea species, M. fungifera and M. austera, contained three known germacrane derivatives, which had previ­ously been isolated from a terrestrial plant. A comparative natural products investigation of two local	Muri­ species yielded the known sterol, ergosterol peroxide, from both Muricea californica and Muricea fruticosa. In addition, only the less fouled Muricea fruticosa contained four new esterified aminosugar sapo­nin derivatives. These compounds inhibit the growth of	 the marine diatom, Phaedactylum tricornutum, at concentrations comparable to those found in the gorgonian tissue. This result may indicate possible roles for these compounds in preferentially reducing fouling on the surfaces of Muricea fruticosa...|$|R

Microfiche. xxi, 166 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmIn Hawaii deep-sea (- 350 m) corals are {{collected}} commercially {{for the production}} of jewelry. Maui Divers, Inc. operates the manned minisubmersible Star II in the Makapuu beds found in the Molokai Channel off the island of Oahu. Although a large number of deep-sea corals are found in Hawaii, gold coral (Gerardia sp.) and pink coral (Corallium sp.) are commercially two of the most important in the production of gems. Gerardia sp. (Family Parazoanthidae, Order Zoanthidea, Subclass Zoantharia, Class Anthozoa, Phylum Cnidaria) is a yellow-colored animal with a hard, golden endoskeleton, and is bioluminescent in its deep-sea environment. [l] Two new fluorescent nitrogenous pigments, derivatives of tetrazacyclopentazulene, have been isolated from this organism. The major constituent, 2 -amino- 3 -methyl- 5 -dimethylamino- 3 H-pseudozoanthoxanthin (1), is a yellow solid whose structure was established by spectral and chemical means, as well as by X-ray diffraction. [2, 3] The minor constituent of Gerardia sp., 2 -amino- 3 - methyl- 5 -methylamino- 3 H-pseudozoanthoxanthin (2),differs from 1 by the absence of a methyl group according to the 1 H NMR spectrum and mass spectrum. The structure of 2 was proven by transformation of 2 to 1 via methylation. [3] Norpseudozoanthoxanthin (3), isolated from Parazoanthus axinellae by Prota and coworkers, [4, 5] is typical of previously isolated pseudozoanthoxanthins which differ from 1 and 2 in the relationship between the nuclear N-methyl and the ring C-methyl. Pink coral (Corallium sp., Family Coralliidae, Order <b>Gorgonacea,</b> Subclass Alcyonaria, Class Anthozoa, Phylum Cnidaria) has yellow and orange polyps, and a hard pink endoskeleton. Four new diterpenoids containing a nine-membered carbocyclic ring fused to a δ-lactone were isolated from this organism. The structure of the major metabolite, coraxeniolide-A (4), was established by chemical and spectral means and confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The structures of the remaining lactones were obtained by correlation with 4. Corbohcin (5), a minor constituent of Corallium sp., contains a nine-membered ring and a single acetate; its structure was elucidated by spectral means. Paragorgia sp., another deep-sea gorgonian, appears to contain the identical five diterpenoids found in Corallium sp. Schmitz and co-workers [6] suggested the name xeniane for the carbon skeleton found in the coraxeniolides and corbohcin, upon isolation of xenicin (6) from the soft coral Xenia elongata. Related diterpenoids have been isolated from other species of soft corals belonging to the genus Xenia, {{as well as from the}} brown algal family Dictyotaceae...|$|R
40|$|The alcyonarian fauna of the West Indies is {{prolific}} and conspicuous and {{has been}} known for many years, with the natural result that a great many more species have been described than actually exist. The deep-water fauna, which received little attention prior to the work of VERRILL, was thoroughly reviewed by DEICHMANN in 1936. The shallow-water and reef fauna {{was the subject of a}} series of extensive papers by KUKENTHAL and his collaborators, KUNZE, MOSER, RIESS, BIELSCHOWSKY, and TOEPLITZ, but this ambitious study appears to have been based upon inadequate collections and its usefulness is seriously limited by the number of synonyms and misidentifications that it contains. No comprehensive survey of the fauna exists, and there is no satisfactory guide for the identification of specimens. This paper, which was prepared at the request of Dr. P. WAGENAAR HUMMELINCK, Secretary of the Stichting ‘Natuurwetenschappelijke Studiekring voor Suriname en de Nederlandse Antillen’ (Foundation for Scientific Research in Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles), forms such a guide and at the same time reviews the fauna to the extent permitted by the collections in hand and the literature. With Dr. HUMMELINCK’S collection of West Indian octocorals serving as a nucleus, the pertinent material in the collections of the U. S. National Museum was critically revised and correlated with the literature in order to gain an accurate picture of the known fauna. As a result of this study, it was possible to recognize 75 species of alcyonarians belonging to the orders Telestacea, Alcyonacea, <b>Gorgonacea,</b> and Pennatulacea inhabiting the reefs and shallow waters of the warm western Atlantic. An additional 21 species from deeper water are also included for comparative purposes or because they inhabit the transitional zone just below the region of active reef growth. Seventeen species and a few growth forms are described as new to science. Each species is diagnosed and illustrated with drawings of the details of spiculation and, in the case of new or especially common species, photographs of the colonial form. Taxonomic keys with couplets illustrated for clarity are provided to facilitate the identification of specimens. The species described in this paper are arranged as indicated in the Table of Contents (p. 3 — 7). A total of 96 species are described from the region including the Bermudas, the southeastern coast of the United States, the Bahamas and Antilles, and the east coast of South America south to the reefs of Brazil. Of these, 52 species occur in the reef habitat proper or closely associated with it, and another 23 species occur in depths of 25 fathoms or less. The orders Telestacea, Alcyonacea, and Pennatulacea are togehter represented by only 13 species within the bathymetric limits set forth, the remaining 83 belonging to the order <b>Gorgonacea.</b> The littoral and reef-dwelling representatives of the last-named order belong for the most part to the two families Plexauridae and Gorgoniidae, which include 35 and 34 species respectively. When the shallow-water alcyonarian fauna is added to the deep-water fauna as reported by DEICHMANN, a total of 196 species is revealed for the area. This is a fauna of only modest proportions when compared with that of the East Indies, where some 445 species (exclusive of Pennatulacea) were obtained by the ‘Siboga’ Expedition, but nevertheless, the gorgonians are the dominant sessile animals on many of the reefs of Florida, the Bahamas, and the Antilles. This dense population consists chiefly of about a dozen species, all the others being rare or of local occurrence, so it appears that the reef fauna is rich in individuals but poor in species. The distribution of alcyonarians is influenced by a variety of factors, among them salinity, temperature, illumination, depth of water, and character of the bottom. It is not possible to single out any one factor as the most important, since they all interact closely, but there is no doubt that temperature is one of the most influential. Although temperature requirements and tolerations have not been determined experimentally for alcyonarians, they can reasonably be assumed to parallel more or less closely those of the principal reef-formers. It has been observed that formation of reefs does not take place in waters that drop below 68 °F. for any appreciable period during the winter. Since active growth of reefs occurs at Bermuda, the northernmost limit of the West Indian fauna, its annual minimum temperature of 66 °F, may be taken as the limit for reef formation in the West Indian area. Tropical alcyonarians occur up to this minimum isotherm of both coasts of Florida. Most alcyonarians are stenohaline and require salinities within the range found in the open sea. However, the occurrence of a few species, such as Leptogorgia setacea of the southeastern coast of the United States, in the brackish inshore waters of bays and river mouths indicates that a limited degree of euryhalinity does occur in the Octocorallia. A rough and solid bottom is apparently as necessary for the attachment of gorgonian planulae as it is for those of madrepores, and the importance of this requirement is clearly demonstrated on the west coast of Florida, where reef communities gain a foothold only on the scattered solid outcrops on an otherwise broad, sandy shelf. A few species of <b>Gorgonacea</b> are known to live unattached, the colonies apparently doing so in some cases because no suitable objects were available for attachment, in others because they were broken loose from their original solid support but continued to live in a prone position. Certain deep-water gorgonacean groups (families Chrysogorgiidae and Isididae) that inhabit areas with a scarcity of solid material are able to adapt the form of their holdfast to the conditions present at the time of metamorphosis, producing either a calcareous basal disk for attachment to shells and stones, or a branched, rootlike process for anchoring the colony firmly in a muddy bottom. The pennatulaceans, which are adapted for life on soft bottoms, require either sand or mud and therefore are not found closely associated with reef communities. The octocorals of the reefs are restricted bathymetrically to the upper 25 fathoms of water, perhaps because of their symbiotic zooxanthellae, which require sunlight for the process of photosynthesis, but the physiological relationships of zooxanthellae and their coelenterate hosts are in general less clearly understood in the octocorals than in the madrepores, so the cause of the bathymetricphotic correlation cannot be stated in general terms. Obviously, the vertical distribution of those octocorals that are dependent upon their zooxanthellae for nutrition is governed by the physiological requirements of the algae. In those octocorals that are nutritionally independent of their zooxanthellae (as appears to be generally the case among scleractinian corals) other ecological factors must limit bathymetric distribution. In the West Indies, almost all of the shallow-water octocorals, which represent 38 % of the total known fauna, belong to the two families Plexauridae and Gorgoniidae. Very few members of these families extend downward below 25 fathoms, and very few members of the deep-water families venture into water shallower than this. In the East Indies, where a rich tropical alcyonarian fauna exists, 59 % of the species taken by the ‘Siboga’-Expedition lived in depths shallower than 50 meters, but this fauna is inordinately rich in groups poorly represented in the West Indies, where 85 % of the species are gorgonaceans. In both regions, somewhat more than 40 % of the gorgonaceans occur in depths less than 50 meters. The alcyonarians are an important component of the reef community, perhaps more so in the West Indies than elsewhere in the tropics because of the great profusion of a few conspicuous forms in the reef habitat. They provide shelter and sustenance for a wide array of casual associates, epizoa, commensals, and parasites, ranging from other coelenterates to fishes. Moreover, when they die they liberate great quantities of calcareous spicules which are then available for incorporation into the general mass of the reef. The alcyonarian fauna of the warm parts of the western Atlantic shows a high degree of endemism and only indistinct subdivision into smaller faunal regions. It is possible to distinguish a Carolinian fauna occupying the southeastern coast of the United States, with part of its species occurring only along the Atlantic coast and part of them with isolated populations in the northern Gulf of Mexico. At least three species follow the continental coast more or less continuously from the Carolinas to Brazil. This is basically a continental fauna and its species do not range out into the West Indian islands. The fauna of the West Indies is essentially an insular fauna and it suffers depletion wherever it invades continental coasts. The largest number of reef dwelling species seems to occur in the northern islands of the Lesser Antilles, the Greater Antilles, and the Florida Keys. At the present time, more species are known from the last-named locality than from the islands of the Greater Antilles, but it has certainly been more thoroughly explored. Intensive collecting will probably reveal an even larger number of species in the northeastern part of the Antilles. Antillean species extend along both coasts of Florida northward to about the 66 °F. minimum surface isotherm, but their number is sharply diminished. A small group of the hardiest species reaches Bermuda, which is the northernmost outpost of the West Indian fauna. Records indicate that the Antillean fauna becomes attenuated also toward the southern islands of the Lesser Antilles, and the Leeward Group along the coast of South America has a fauna comparable in many respects with that of Bermuda. However, the fauna of Bermuda is restricted by the low temperature of the water during midwinter (66 °F), a limiting factor that does not exist at the low latitude of the Leeward Islands. The fauna must instead be restricted by other ecological factors, perhaps imposed by the proximity of the continental coast. The alcyonarian fauna of the reefs of Brazil, although composed largely of West Indian genera — Plexaurella, Muriceopsis, Lophogorgia — shares few species, perhaps no more than three or four, with the Antillean region to the north, and is probably the most distinct of the subregions of the western Atlantic. Within the broad limits of the warm western Atlantic fauna 1 region, extending from Bermuda south to Brazil, we can distinguish an insular Antillean fauna centered in the northeastern part of the Antilles; a continental Carolinian fauna along the southeastern Atlantic seabord, some of its species with disjunct populations in the Gulf of Mexico and some following virtually the entire coastline from the Carolinas to Brazil; and a Brazilian fauna extending northward along the South American coast as far as Trinidad. The presence in the West Indies of Alcyonarian genera known also in the tropical Indo-West Pacific can be explained only on the basis of former faunal continuity. The presence of a small amphi-American element clearly points to the existence of a continuous East Pacific-West Atlantic (or trans-American) fauna during the past, and the high level of endemism in the West Indian region suggests a subsequent rapid development of a new fauna from remnants of the old, left behind after closure of the Central American seaways. The distribution of modern alcyonarians corroborates the former existence of a great equatorial sea, the Tethys, that permitted circumtropical distribution of marine animals, which geology tells us existed during much of Earth’s history between the Cambrian and the Tertiary...|$|R
