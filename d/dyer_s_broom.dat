40|$|Publisher's copy made {{available}} {{with the permission}} of the publisherIt has been suggested that the appropriate length of insertion for double-lumen tubes can be estimated by external measurement. This study examined the accuracy of external measurement in estimating the actual length of insertion required in 130 patients. It also examined the relationship between the length inserted and the patient’s height in 126 patients and their weight in 125 patients. Although there was a fair correlation between the measured external length and the final inserted length (r= 0. 61), the 95 % confidence intervals of slope and intercept allowed a large variation and the prediction was too wide to be clinically useful. Height was reasonably well correlated with the final length (r= 0. 51) but an equally wide 95 % confidence interval rendered it of little clinical value. There was no correlation between weight and final tube length. It is concluded that external measurement alone is not adequate to predict a clinically acceptable position of the double-lumen tube. R.

40|$|The {{provision}} of care is an increasingly pressing {{issue in the}} Global North. With an ageing population and policies encouraging women into the labour market, {{there is a growing}} need for workers to undertake paid caring. This poses important and urgent questions about the social organisation of labour markets. Care work typically is low paid and undertaken in precarious, informal, or temporary situations. Many posts are filled by economic migrants, raising concerns about a care deficit in sending countries. In this paper we examine the 'caring work' undertaken by migrant workers in a West London hospital. We employ a twofold characterisation of caring work. Like other bottom-end service sector work, this work is characterised by the face-to-face 'emotional labour'. However, it also requires 'body work': close and often intimate physical contact between carers and those they care for. We argue that both of these aspects are important in understanding how caring work is constructed as poorly regarded and low paid. We show how these features play out in particular ways for migrant workers employed in such caring work.

Placental insufficiency, {{resulting}} in restriction of fetal substrate supply, {{is a major}} cause of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and increased neonatal morbidity. Fetal adaptations to placental restriction maintain the growth of key organs, including the heart, but the impact of these adaptations on individual cardiomyocytes is unknown. Placental and hence fetal growth restriction was induced in fetal sheep by removing the majority of caruncles in the ewe before mating (placental restriction, PR). Vascular surgery was performed on 13 control and 11 PR fetuses at 110 – 125 days of gestation (term: 150 ± 3 days). PR fetuses with a mean gestational PO 2 135 days), fetal hearts were collected, and cardiomyocytes were isolated and fixed. Proliferating cardiomyocytes were counted by immunohistochemistry of Ki 67 protein. Cardiomyocytes were stained with methylene blue to visualize the nuclei, and the proportion of mononucleated cells and length and width of cardiomyocytes were measured. PR resulted in chronic fetal hypoxia, IUGR, and elevated plasma cortisol concentrations. Although {{there was no difference in}} relative heart weights between control and PR fetuses, there was an increase in the proportion of mononucleated cardiomyocytes in PR fetuses. Whereas mononucleated and binucleated cardiomyocytes were smaller, the relative size of cardiomyocytes when expressed relative to heart weight was larger in PR compared with control fetuses. The increase in the relative proportion of mononucleated cardiomyocytes and the relative sparing of the growth of individual cardiomyocytes in the growth-restricted fetus are adaptations that may have long-term consequences for heart development in postnatal life.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new method to test efficiently for cospeciation in tritrophic systems. Our method utilises an analogy with electrical circuit theory to reduce higher order systems into bitrophic data sets that retain the information of the original system. We use a sophisticated permutation scheme that weights interactions between two trophic layers based on their connection to the third layer in the system. Our method has several advantages compared to the method of Mramba et al. [Mramba, L. K., S. Barber, K. Hommola, L. A. <b>Dyer,</b> J. <b>S.</b> Wilson, M. L. Forister and W. R. Gilks (2013) : “Permutation tests for analyzing cospeciation in multiple phylogenies: applications in tri-trophic ecology,” Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol., 12, 679 – 701. ]. We do not require triangular interactions to connect the three phylogenetic trees and an easily interpreted p-value is obtained in one step. Another advantage of our method is the scope for generalisation to higher order systems and phylogenetic networks. The performance of our method is compared to the methods of Hommola et al. [Hommola, K., J. E. Smith, Y. Qiu and W. R. Gilks (2009) : “A permutation test of host–parasite cospeciation,” Mol. Biol. Evol., 26, 1457 – 1468. ] and Mramba et al. [Mramba, L. K., S. Barber, K.

40|$|Insects {{have evolved}} {{morphological}} and physiological adaptations {{in response to}} selection pressures inherent to their ecology. Consequently, visual performance and acuity often significantly vary between different insect species. Whilst psychophysics has allowed for the accurate determination of visual acuity for some Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, very {{little is known about}} other insect taxa that cannot be trained to positively respond to a given stimulus. In this study, we demonstrate that prior knowledge of insect colour preferences can be used to facilitate acuity testing. We focused on four psyllid species (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Aphalaridae), namely Ctenarytaina eucalypti, Ctenarytaina bipartita, Anoeconeossa bundoorensis and Glycaspis brimblecombei, that differ in their colour preferences and utilization of different host-plant modules (e. g. apical buds, stems, leaf lamellae) and tested their visual acuity in a modified Y-maze adapted to suit psyllid searching behaviour. Our study revealed that psyllids have visual acuity ranging from 6. 3 to 8. 7  deg. Morphological measurements for different species showed a close match between inter-ommatidial angles and behaviourally determined visual angles (between 5. 5 and 6. 6  deg) suggesting detection of colour stimuli at the single ommatidium level. Whilst our data support isometric scaling of psyllids' eyes for C. eucalypti, C. bipartita and G. brimblecombei, a morphological trade-off between light sensitivity and spatial resolution was found in A. bundoorensis. Overall, species whose microhabitat preferences require more movement between modules appear to possess superior visual acuity. The psyllid searching behaviours that we describe with the help of tracking software depict species-specific strategies that presumably evolved to optimize searching for food and oviposition sites.

40|$|The Perching Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (PUAV) is a 9 -inch {{diameter}} ducted vertical takeoff {{and landing}} reconnaissance vehicle with {{the capability of}} fast-forward cruise flight. Currently in the development stage, the program is envisaged to yield a man-portable craft that a foot soldier can use to provide over-the-hill observation. Several prototypes have been constructed and tested, with mixed results. Concerns regarding duct aerodynamics led to the proposal for further aerodynamic study to investigate effects of inlet lip radius and surface area, diffuser area ratio, blade tip clearance and rotor position on thrust, power and efficiency. This report covers the theory of rotorcraft and ducted propeller aerodynamics, and outlines the tests performed and results obtained. It also presents specifications of the test vehicle and methods {{that can be used}} in future ducted aircraft studies. Large angle diffusers tested showed reduced thrust and efficiency and increased power compared to smaller diffusers, contrary to theory. Reverse flow within the core appears to disrupt uniform exit flow and yields a conically divergent turbulent wake. Results of this study will be used in the redesign of a duct core fairing, which will act to control the airflow and reduce the tendency for reverse flow at the center where blade thrust is absent. Future studies will also consider twisted, cambered and tapered rotor blades in an effort to better address spanwise thrust distribution and optimized airflow. The test apparatus and methods developed for this report, in addition to results of initial testing, will be instrumental to further development of small ducted UAVs. Findings and methods are not limited to exact duplicates of PUAV-like aircraft, but can be used in a wide range of applications including lift and thrust-producing ducts. by Kyrilian <b>Dyer.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

40|$|This article {{frames the}} intersections of {{medicine}} and humanities as intrinsic to understanding the practice {{of health care in}} Africa. Central to this manuscript, which draws on empirical findings on the interplay between HIV and AIDS and alternative medicine in Zimbabwe is the realisation that very limited research has been undertaken to examine ‘HIV/AIDS patient behaviour’ with respect to choice of therapy on the continent [Bene, M. & Darkoh, M. B. K. (2014). The Constraints of Antiretroviral Uptake in Rural Areas: The Case of Thamaga and Surrounding Villages, Botswana. SAHARA-J: Journal of Social Aspects of HIV/AIDS, 11 (1), 167 – 177. doi: 10. 1080 / 17290376. 2014. 972057; Chavunduka, G. (1998).

As such, a social approach to health-seeking behaviour questions how decisions about alternative therapies including herbal remedies, traditional healing and faith healing are made. The paper unpacks the realities around how people living with HIV and AIDS – who span different age groups and profess various religious backgrounds, faced with an insurmountable health challenge against a background of limited resources and no cure for the virus – often experience shifts in health-seeking behaviour. Grappling with seemingly simple questions about ‘when, where and how to seek medical attention’, the paper provides pointers to therapy choices and health-seeking behaviour; and it serves as a route into deeper and intense healthcare practice explorations. In conclusion, the paper proposes that medicine and the humanities should engage seriously with those social aspects of HIV and AIDS which call for an integrated approach to healthcare practice in Africa. If combined, medicine and the humanities might achieve what neither would alone...|$|R

This {{collection}} included laboratory strains and clinical isolates of human origin with diverse clinical and geographical origins. Biological diversity was further increased by including 32 strains isolated from the oral cavities of nine different animal species. Genomic fingerprints of the 129 strains were generated as random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) by the technique of PCR amplification with a single primer of arbitrary sequence. Four nonameric oligonucleotides were used as single primers, and the banding patterns of the DNA products separated on agarose gels were compared after ethidium ethidium bromide staining. Distance coeffients based on {{the positions of the}} major DNA fragments were calculated, and dendrograms were generated. We identified 102 clonal types (CTs) that could be assembled into three main groups by cluster analysis by the unweighted pair group method with mathematic averages. Group I (n = 79 CTs) included all 97 human strains and 6 monkey isolates. The strains in group II (n = 22 CTs) and III (n = 1 CT) were strongly differentiated from those in group I and included only strains of animal origin; they likely represent two cryptic species within the present P. gingivalis taxon. We observed that strains from Old World monkeys clustered together with the human genotype, whereas strains from New World monkeys clustered with the animal genotype. Our results with human strains also indicated that (i) the population structure is basically clonal, (ii) no dominant or widespread CT could be observed, and (iii) no relationship could be established between specific clusters of CTs and the periodontal status of the host.

The original publication {{is available at}} [URL] alien species can have serious adverse impacts on both {{the environment and the}} economy. Being able to predict the impacts of an alien species could assist in preventing or reducing these impacts. This study aimed to establish whether there are any life history traits consistently correlated with the impacts of alien birds across two continents, Europe and Australia, as a first step toward identifying life history traits that may have the potential to be adopted as predictors of alien bird impacts. A recently established impact scoring system was used in combination with a literature review to allocate impact scores to alien bird species with self-sustaining populations in Australia. These scores were then tested for correlation with a series of life history traits. The results were compared to data from a previous study in Europe, undertaken using the same methodology, in order to establish whether there are any life history traits consistently correlated with impact across both continents. Habitat generalism was the only life history trait found to be consistently correlated with impact in both Europe and Australia. This trait shows promise as a potential predictor of alien bird impacts. The results support the findings of previous studies in this field, and could be used to inform decisions regarding the prevention and management of future invasions. [URL] versio...|$|R
40|$|The enterprise-customer {{relationships}} {{analysis is}} one of the most important themes in marketing literature (Dwyer, Schurr, Oh, 1987; Morgan, Hunt 1994; Gummesson, 1999), particularly referring to the role that these relationships have in obtaining a competitive advantage (<b>Dyer,</b> <b>Sing,</b> 1998; Morgan, Hunt, 1999; Vicari, Bertoli, Busacca, 2000). Among the various changes occurred the last decades, technological development was the one that, without doubt, determined, referring to the enterprise-customer relationships, the most significant modifications (Varaldo, 2004), showing to enterprises the importance of building competitive strategies focused on every single costumer (Peppers, Rogers 1999; Rust Zeithaml, Lemon, 2000; Vandenbosch, Dawar, 2002; Vandermerwe, 2004; Gulati, Oldroyd, 2005; Rogers, 2005). From such first considerations evidently appears that the evolutionary dynamics in progress lifts new questions in the conceptualization, in the analysis and in the management of the enterprise-costumer relationships (Pettinao, 2007), causing that the management of such relationships becomes a critical factor of success in hypercompetitives contexts (D’Aveni, 1994) as that actual, characterized by an ample variety and variability of problems and market demands as well as from a strong tension toward the innovation of the offering system.

(1993) noticed as the advent of mass personalization set the accent on the necessity to assume productive unities coordination models based on loosed coupled (Weick, 1976) that conferred to the structure a certain grade of flexibility and the possibility to quickly coordinate itself with the market demands assisting the generation of new forms of organizational learning (Albertini, 1990; Ferrero, 2000). Following these lines of reflection, clearly appears that the possibilities for an enterprise to survive and develop itself could be as greater as more profitable and intense are the relationships that it establishes both with the present remarkable other system in the environment (Golinelli, 2000) and with her subsystems (Usai, 2002). Considering these observations, with the present paper we propose ourselves to delineate a possible key reading in terms of expansion and evolution of the enterprise-costumer relationships. The goal is to explore the possibility of application of the sensemaking (Weick, 1969, 1995) studies to the analysis of the enterprise-costumer relationships and to verify the support that IT technologies can offer to the creation of a dialogue space with the client. The application of the sensemaking presuppositions requires, however, to attribute a particular importance not only to the IT technologies use but also to the existence of some important organizational requisite as the knowledge, the identification and the organizational integration. The analysis is conducted with reference to a specific sector and, specifically, to the financial intermediation one. Such choice is particularly important because, although many studies have been conducted regarding different aspects of the business banking, the close examination of the impact that IT technologies can have on this sector starts only at the end of 1990 (Devil, 1995; Buhl, Will, 1998; Yan, Paradi, 1998; Liao, Cheung, 2002; Scruggs, 2002; King, Liou, 2004; Yousafzadi, Pallister, Foxall, 2005). For a long time, in fact, the majority of the banks only made small adjustments of their own operational and managerial formalities without modifying them in a remarkable way (Dematté 1997). Nevertheless, currently the extreme competition, the glut of the financial markets and the increasing answer of products and services through the new technologies pushed the banks to quickly modify their own models of business (Methlie, Nysveen, 1999; Jun, Cai, 2001; Bradley, Stewart, 2003) and differentiate their own organization in function of the final costumer. With the creation of “markets” (corporate, retail, private banking) a lot of banks intended to give diversified solutions to diversified need, modifying the old strategy hinged on the product “omni-comprehensive”. This is coherent with the statement that the costumers don’t look for generics goods or services but for solutions that, resolving their problems, (Levitt 1983) allows them to create value (Gronroos 2002). The study of products designed to specific markets involves the management of a multiplicity of distributive channels and sets the banks in the condition to elaborate precise politics to assure the harmonious coexistence among the different structures preceded to the direct relationship with the costumers (De Marco, Sorrentino, 1999). This paper brings theory and practice together by synthesising the existing literature with real-life experience of an Italian bank. The aim is that to tie the indications that results from the marketing studies regarding the evolution assumed by the enterprise-client relationships with those inferred by the organizational studies regarding the inside relationships management and the increasing importance assumed by the human subjects in the organizational trials. Two principal questions motivate the search. In first place we try to verify the strength use of the IT technologies to the enterprise-costumer relationships support and consolidation in the financial intermediation sector. Hereafter, we want to investigate on the organizational factors that makes efficient and competitive the banking use of IT technologies. The investigation is conducted with specific reference to the Corporate segment, which the existing searches on are, without doubt, extremely inferior in comparison to those about the Retail segment, that constitutes the prevailing area of the national banking activity. A case study research approach was used (Yin, 1994; Dubois, Gadde 2002) to investigate marketing and organizational factor in Corporate e-banking. This methodology is particularly proper to develop the theory through the deep comprehension of the empirical phenomena and the context in which they take place...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} that distinguishes between alternative conceptualizations of the risky decision making process. Two studies investigate whether cross-situational differences in choice behavior {{should be interpreted}} in the expected utility framework as differences in risk attitude (as measured by risk-averse vs. risk-seeking utility functions) or as differences {{in the perception of}} the relative riskiness of choice alternatives as permitted by risk-return interpretations of utility functions, leaving open the possibility of stable cross-situational risk preference as a personality trait. To this end, we propose a way of assessing a person's inherent risk preference that factors out individual and situational differences in risk perception. We document that a definition of risk aversion and risk seeking as the preference for options perceived to be more risky or less risky, respectively, provides the cross-situational stability to a person's risk preference that has eluded more traditional definitions. In Experiment 1, commuters changed their preferences for trains with risky arrival times when the alternatives involved gains in commuting time rather than losses. However, changes in preference coincided with changes in the perception of the riskiness of the choice alternatives, leaving the perceived risk attitudes of a majority of commuters unchanged. Experiment 2, a stockmarket investment task, investigated changes in risk perception, information acquisition, and stock selection as a function of outcome feedback. Investors' stock selections and their perception of the risk of the same stocks were different in a series of decisions in which they lost money than in a series in which they made money. As in Experiment 1, differences in choice and in risk perception were systematically related, such that the majority of investors had the same preference for perceived risk in both series of decisions. Our results provide empirical support for the usefulness of recent risk-return conceptualizations of risky choice (Bell [Bell, D. E. 1995. Risk, return, and utility. Management Sci. 41 23 [...] 30. ], Jia and Dyer [Jia, J., J. <b>S.</b> <b>Dyer.</b> 1994. A standard measure of risk and risk-value models. Working paper, University of Texas at Austin. ], M.

40|$|Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea {{are closely}} related necrotrophic plant {{pathogenic}} fungi notable for their wide host ranges and environmental persistence. These attributes have made these species models for understanding the complexity of necrotrophic, broad host-range pathogenicity. Despite their similarities, the two species differ in mating behaviour {{and the ability to}} produce asexual spores. We have sequenced the genomes of one strain of S. sclerotiorum and two strains of B. cinerea. The comparative analysis of these genomes relative to one another and to other sequenced fungal genomes is provided here. Their 38 – 39 Mb genomes include 11, 860 – 14, 270 predicted genes, which share 83 % amino acid identity on average between the two species. We have mapped the S. sclerotiorum assembly to 16 chromosomes and found large-scale co-linearity with the B. cinerea genomes. Seven percent of the S. sclerotiorum genome comprises transposable elements compared to < 1 % of B. cinerea. The arsenal of genes associated with necrotrophic processes is similar between the species, including genes involved in plant cell wall degradation and oxalic acid production. Analysis of secondary metabolism gene clusters revealed an expansion in number and diversity of B. cinerea–specific secondary metabolites relative to S. sclerotiorum. The potential diversity in secondary metabolism might be involved in adaptation to specific ecological niches. Comparative genome analysis revealed the basis of differing sexual mating compatibility systems between S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea. The organization of the mating-type loci differs, and their structures provide evidence for the evolution of heterothallism from homothallism. These data shed light on the evolutionary and mechanistic bases of the genetically complex traits of necrotrophic pathogenicity and sexual mating. This resource should facilitate the functional studies designed to better understand what makes these fungi such successful and persistent pathogens of agronomic crops. Fil: Ten Have, Arjen.

40|$|Tutkin väitöskirjassani yhden 1900 -luvun pianismin suurnimen, Glenn Gouldin (1932 - 1982) musiikillista ja eettistä ajattelua hänen kirjoitustensa pohjalta. Gouldin musiikkia ja sen tulkintaa koskevaa ajattelua tarkastelen ympäröivän kulttuurin ja taidemusiikin {{tradition}} konteksteissa sekä osana musiikin esteettisen ajattelun historiaa. Gouldin musiikkiteknologiaa koskevia ajatuksia yritän työssäni hahmottaa osana 1960 - ja 1970 -luvuilla Kanadassa ja Yhdysvalloissa käytyä informaatioteknologian potentiaalia ja merkitystä pohtinutta keskustelua. Gouldista paljastuu työssäni uusia puolia - häntä ei tule tarkastella pelkästään muusikkona vaan intellektuellina, joka argumentoi musiikista soittonsa ja kirjoitustensa kautta. Gould on myös yksi harvoista länsimaisen taidemusiikin muusikoista, joka on löytänyt tiensä niin kirjallisuuden kuin populaarikulttuurinkin merkityskenttään ja kuvastoon. Tekijä tarkastelee Gouldin levytysten ja ja kiehtovan hahmon vastaanottoa niin elokuvassa, kirjallisuudessa kuin kuvataiteessakin. Laajempi teoreettinen ja metodologinen päämäärä työssäni on argumentoida sellaisen musiikkinäkemyksen puolesta, jossa muusikkous nähdään aktiivisena ja parhaimmillaan kriittisen intellektuaalisena musiikillisen maailmassaolemisen muotona - ei siis vain säveltäjän teoksilleen antamien merkitysten välittämisenä. Tällaisesta muusikkoudesta esimerkki on juuri Gould: kiistanalainen, provokatiivisia mutta usein myös briljanssissaan ylittämättömiä tulkintoja toteuttanut taiteilija, joka ei koskaan väsynyt etsimään musiikin merkitystä uusista näkökulmista. The {{topic of}} my doctoral thesis is the musical thought of Canadian pianist Glenn Gould (1932 - 1982). My interest in Gould is twofold: on one hand, I {{have been interested}} in finding out what values, norms, and ideals Gould s musical worldview consists of. On the other hand, my aim has been to scrutinize these three aspects against larger historical and cultural horizons. In other words, my goal has been to produce a historically and culturally informed reading of Gould s ideas about music and musical interpretation. I regard the historical and cultural frameworks as hermeneutic and methodological tools through which it becomes possible to gain a wider and more thorough perspective {{on one of the most}} significant musicians of 20 th-century art music. Of all the various potential perspectives on Gould, I have chosen three. First, I discuss Gould s ideas on music technology within the context of the larger North American discourse on the potential of electronic technology in modern life. This discourse was particularly lively in the 1960 s and 1970 s, and intellectuals such as Marshall McLuhan, Gould s personal friend, were much involved in it. Second, I analyze Gould s ideas regarding the ontology of music and musical interpretation against the backdrop of 19 th-century aesthetics as exemplified by writings of Eduard Hanslick and Friedrich Nietzsche. Third, I compare Gould s arguments on behalf of the recording of music with those of three 20 th-century intellectuals who wrote a great deal on the technical reproduction of art: Walter Benjamin (1892 ­ 1940), Theodor W. Adorno (1903 ­ 1969), and Gianni Vattimo (1936 ­). As far as the first of the aforementioned perspectives goes, I am interested in how Gould s views on recording as the primary means of interpreting music fit in with McLuhan s notion that technology changes the ways in which we experience the world outside. These two men, in their different mediums, put forth basically the same argument: information technology is not only the medium but also the message ­ the technological mediation of music, in and of itself, changes music and our experience of it. Since Gould was well versed in McLuhan s writings, a McLuhanesque reading of Gould s ideas not only seems appropriate but also has the effect of adding a whole new perspective onto Gould s technological vision ­ a perspective onto a mind very much embedded in the intellectual world outside and well up on what was in the air at the time. Another important Canadian influence on Gould s technological thought was the media philosopher and theologian Jean Le Moyne. Gould seems to have adopted Le Moyne s idea of the charity of the machine almost too well: whereas Le Moyne s philosophy emphasizes the progress that technology has brought about throughout history, Gould simplifies Le Moyne s thought and interprets it as arguing for the overall goodness of technology itself. Gould cites Le Moyne s ideas out of their larger context to support his untenable argument on, for instance, the immorality of live concerts (it also seems that technology, for Gould, was about distance: concerts and other collective forms of experiencing art were, in Gould s mind, immoral since an objective, balanced,and distanced position was lacking). As regards the intellectual history of art music, I contrast Gould s views on the ontology of music and musical interpretation with the norms embedded in the 19 th-century idea of Wertreue ­ an idea which emphasizes the view of a musical work as an autonomous aesthetic object, the interpretation of which is bound by the composer s intentions. One of Gould s strongest aesthetic tenets, on the contrary, is the view of interpreting music by literally recomposing it. This unwavering conviction of Gould s was entangled with other ideas that he held dear: for instance, his vision of technologically enhanced creative listening ­ a future mode of listening in which the listener, enabled by technology, is able to radically modify, remix, and even recompose the music he or she is listening to. It is obvious that these kinds of visions were simply utopian in Gould s days but have since become reality for millions of listeners through the development of mp 3 -technology and the spread of the world wide web. In this context, I have brought some of Gould s ideas into the present moment. The Italian media philosopher Gianni Vattimo s concept of homeless artworks ­ the very electronic and polymorphous mediation rendering them homeless through making them lose their ties to any particular time, place, and author ­ also captures very well Gould s ideas regarding the potential of technology for the future of music. My third larger hermeneutic framework creates a discourse between Gould s ideas and those of three cultural critics active in the 20 th century, all of whom have discussed the reproduction of art throughout their writings. Walter Benjamin wrote as early as the 1930 s about the aura, the here-and-now aspect of art, and about the ontological changes that the mechanical reproduction of artworks brings to our conceptions and ideas about art. The notion of aura, in particular, is useful in conceptualizing Gould s ideas theoretically, in spite of the fact that Benjamin was writing about visual arts and cinema, not music. I make the argument that it is the aura of musical works that Gould wanted to get rid of with the help of technology ­ that is, the historicity of musical works, the real-time nature of musical interpretation in concert situations, and the personification of musical works as belonging to a particular author and his/her biographical context. A belief in the democratizing potential of technology for art, its potential for disseminating art to a large public without respect to levels of affluence or social position, is also something that both Gould and Benjamin shared. Adorno s philosophy, in its turn, provides a hermeneutical window onto Gould s musical interpretation as criticism ­ as an intellectual undertaking that is not only about bringing about a sonic realization of the score, but also about making an analytical judgment on it. I propose a view of Gould s musical interpretation as pianistic criticism, which was, at times, motivated by primarily intellectual rather than aesthetic goals. Such is the case in Gould s controversial recordings of Mozart s sonatas. I also view Gould s rejection of the institution of public concerts in the context of Adorno s concept of the culture industry, which also aptly covers the criticisms that Gould wielded towards art music culture in his writings. I also touch on the reception given Gould and his music in Canadian literature and two Hollywood movies. The Canadian aspect of Gould is also something that I focus on more generally: I am interested in Gould s national iconicity as it is constructed in biographical writings on Gould. I am also interested in the idea of north which Gould wrote about in many of his writings and which also has a long history in the cultural history of Canada. I also try to grasp, supported by Richard <b>Dyer</b> <b>s,</b> Lawrence Kramer s and Janne Mäkelä s writings, Gould s stardom theoretically, as a phenomenon more commonly associated with pop culture. The primary research material in my work consists of almost all the writing Gould ever published: articles, essays, interviews, and liner notes for his recordings. In addition to this, I have had at my disposal 350 pages of unpublished material from the Gould archive in Ottawa, Canada. The methods of my study are those commonly employed in other scholarship in the humanities: in a nutshell, through a close reading of Gould s writings, followed by a contextualizing interpretation, my goal here is to gain a more thorough understanding of Gould s musical thought and its cultural and historical afffinities. Another goal of my thesis has been to bring fresh perspectives onto Gould s exceptional musicianship and his significance to 20 th-century musical performance history. It has also been my aim to contribute to future musicology by producing a theoretical and methodological model through which musicianship can become a more common research topic in musicological scholarship...|$|R

40|$|How can we {{do things}} {{differently}} in Aboriginal health? The same challenges seen through new eyes  Editorial by Carmen Parter and Kim Browne. Full Text | 	 								 PDF (172 KB) There are currently about 156   000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in New South Wales (NSW), representing 2. 3 % of the total NSW population, and equating to 29 % of the total Australian Aboriginal population. In this special issue of the NSW Public Health Bulletin, in accordance with NSW Health policy, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people {{are referred to as}} Aboriginal in recognition of the fact that Aboriginal people are the original inhabitants of NSW. It is well known that Aboriginal people continue to experience poorer health than the general population. When the new state government took office in March 2011, they gave a commitment to continue to work on closing the gap in Aboriginal health inequity. This commitment specifically mentioned that the NSW Government would: develop a 10 -year Aboriginal Health Plan for NSW hold an Aboriginal Health and Wellbeing forum in their first year of office hold, each year, an annual progress meeting with Aboriginal community-based organisations and NSW Health representatives produce an annual progress report that measures the performance of the health system against the Closing the Gap agenda. It is now a year since that commitment was provided. So where are we up to, what successes have we seen, and {{where do we go from}} here? This special issue of the Bulletin provides an opportunity to take stock, and offers a number of perspectives on working in Aboriginal health and doing it better in the future. We discuss the intentions behind the Aboriginal Health Plan that is currently in development and note the themes emerging from the consultation and how closely these mirror the themes in each of the papers presented in this issue.
