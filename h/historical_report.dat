25|$|The main {{difference}} between a hadith and a <b>historical</b> <b>report</b> (khabar) is that a hadith is not concerned with an event as such, and normally does not specify a time or place. Rather the purpose of hadith is to record a religious doctrine as an authoritative source of Islamic law. By contrast, while a khabar may carry some legal or theological implications, its main aim is to convey information about a certain event.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of the {{preceding}} sort are of ambient air - that is, air where people might breathe it and not in workplaces. These measurements are usually reliable and available. A possibly trickier measurement is of where the pollution comes from, often a question addressed by emissions inventories. In BC and other Canadian jurisdictions facilities are required to report to Environment Canada {{on an annual basis}} their releases of toxic substances to the air. There is a natural tendency in self reporting to under-report, notwithstanding which the inventory resulting tracks releases in an interesting way. At the NPRI we can see a complex example in the <b>historical</b> <b>report</b> summary of Canfor's NPRI reporting in recent years. Criticisms of such reporting has been done by Scott Vaughan, Commissioner for Sustainable Development and the Environment in his Fall 2009 report.|$|E

2500|$|Elizabeth {{was aware}} of the {{political}} ramifications of the story of Richard II: according to a well-known but dubious anecdote, in August 1601 she was reviewing historical documents relating to the reign of Richard II when she supposedly remarked to her archivist William Lambarde, [...] "I am Richard II, know ye not that?" [...] In the same <b>historical</b> <b>report</b> the Queen is said to have complained that the play was performed forty times in [...] "open streets and houses" [...] but there is no extant evidence to corroborate this tale. At any rate, the Chamberlain's Men do not appear to have suffered for their association with the Essex group; but they were commanded to perform it for the Queen on Shrove Tuesday in 1601, the day before Essex's execution. She knew they had favoured Essex, but, then, so had she, once.|$|E
