25|$|At 6:00 am, a United Nuclear Corporation {{employee}} {{noticed the}} breach and suspended further discharge of tailings {{solution to the}} <b>holding</b> <b>pond.</b> By 8:00, a temporary dike had stopped the flow of residual tailings solution.|$|E
25|$|The dam {{formed the}} {{southern}} wall {{of one of}} the mill's three holding ponds, which were used to evaporate tailings solution until the remaining solid waste could be buried. During its operation from 1967 to 1982, the mill produced 3.5 million tons of tailings at the rate of 4,000 tons a day. The 35-foot-high embankment was constructed on a deposit of collapsible clayey, silty sand a hundred feet deep. United Nuclear used a new design, recommended by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that used earth rather than tailings themselves as building material. The <b>holding</b> <b>pond</b> was not lined, in violation of standards in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 that required that holding ponds be impermeable. This lack of lining allowed tailings solution to seep into the ground, weakening the foundation of the dam and contaminating the groundwater.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} cracks formed {{along the southern}} part of the embankment, allowing the acidic tailings solution to penetrate and weaken the embankment. A sand beach was constructed to protect the face of the embankment from the tailings solution, but it was not properly maintained. Prior to the collapse, the level of the tailings solution in the <b>holding</b> <b>pond</b> had risen two feet higher than the dam's designed limit, and the sand beach no longer provided the dam protection. The United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded in its report to Governor Bruce King of New Mexico that the principal cause of failure was differential settlement of the foundation beneath the dam wall, and the report commissioned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission corroborated this conclusion. Critical variations in tailings pond operation practice from approved procedures contributed further to the dam failure. United Nuclear's Chief Operating Officer, J. David Hann, blamed the failure of dam on the pointed shape of the bedrock beneath the embankment, which he said acted as a fulcrum and weakened the dam.|$|E

40|$|Collection, storage, and {{ultimate}} land disposal of livestock feedlot runoff {{is becoming a}} more common practice {{as a result of}} increasing state and federal regulations prohibiting uncontrolled discharge of runoff. As a result of chemical, physical, and biological actions during the storage phase, the runoff applied to land from storage is often greatly different from that entering storage directly from the feedlot. This study was designed to observe those changes in the runoff during storage, and to evaluate their effect on land disposal practices. Six concrete paved feedlots with runoff control systems were studied, with emphasis on variations in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in <b>holding</b> <b>ponds</b> used for storing runoff. Seasonal variations in nutrient content of the <b>holding</b> <b>ponds</b> result from precipitation patterns, nutrient losses, and other factors. Early spring dewatering of the <b>holding</b> <b>ponds,</b> followed by frequent summer dewatering if possible, will result in the best conservation of nutrients.

The low hydraulic conductivity soils at Feedyard A provided a very quiescent environmental system to evaluate the resistivity array’s inherent measurement stability. Seasonal changes could easily be accounted for by variation in seasonal soil temperatures. The Feedyard B site was typified by coarse textured parent material that had high hydraulic conductivity properties. This site experienced dynamic changes week to week and throughout the season.
