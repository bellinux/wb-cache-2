The genius of this faction is easily discerned, by observing with what a very different eye they have viewed the late foreign revolutions.

The state of Poland was such, that there could scarcely exist two opinions, but that a reformation of its Constitution, even at some expense of blood, might be seen without much disapprobation. No confusion could be feared in such an enterprise; because the establishment to be reformed was itself a state of confusion.

40|$|Motivation. The new {{solvency}} regimes now emerging, {{insist that}} capital requirements align with the underlying (insurance) risks. This paper explains how a stochastic model built on basic assumptions {{is used to}} monitor insurance risk {{in order to get}} a clear insight in the aligned economic capital including prudence margins for loss reserves. Method. The <b>incurred</b> <b>loss</b> of an insurer consists of payments on claims and reserves for claims that have been reported. As all claims are settled eventually, the cumulative paid and incurred losses for a given loss period become equal. Therefore, a joint model for the paid and <b>incurred</b> <b>loss</b> arrays is constructed, following a multivariate normal distribution, conditioned on equality of the total paid and incurred losses for a given loss period. A new class of functions is designed specifically to model development curves. Results. A simulation experiment proved that a joint model for both paid and <b>incurred</b> <b>loss</b> arrays as described under Method, leads to a more accurate prediction of loss reserves. While the standard way of estimating percentiles for the reserve is biased, the alternative method of bootstrapping will lead to more accurate outcomes. Conclusions. Modeling paid and incurred losses jointly leads to a considerable improvement in loss reserving in terms of accuracy of predictions, as well as specification of percentiles. Availability.
