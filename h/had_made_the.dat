5|$|Abir re-established their {{headquarters}} at Basankusu in 1893 and its {{position at the}} confluence of the Maringa and Lopori allowed Abir to expand along the rivers and their tributaries, establishing new posts along the way. Progress was slow as the Free State's activities <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> population in the west hostile to colonisation and the east remained in the control of the Manyema and the Zanzibari slavers. The company's first post on the Lopori River had to be relocated because of threats from locals and rubber collection at Befori began only after a series of bloody conflicts between the villagers and Abir's men.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program.

Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, {{extensive}} docks {{had grown}} up around the Citadel and in 1802 the surrounding land was granted to the Hull Dock Company. The Citadel remained in military use until 1848, by when developments in military technology <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> fortification obsolete. In 1858 there were proposals to turn the site into a public park, but instead the Citadel, including Hull Castle and the South Blockhouse, was demolished in 1864 {{to make way for}} an expansion of the docks.|$|E
5|$|Carson rose {{within the}} Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 {{becoming}} chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson {{was working on}} material for a second book, and <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.|$|E
5|$|Conflicting reports {{initially}} made {{it impossible}} to determine who <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> first kill, which would be the first North Korean plane shot down by the United Nations forces in the war.

The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E

5|$|Despite the near-debacle, the {{commitment}} of the Sa'iqa, along with the paratroopers of the 85th Battalion, had actually reinforced Egyptian defenses and helped defeat the Israeli attack. The battle continued south of Lake Timsah in see-saw fashion, raging back and forth, but by nightfall on October 20 the Israelis had made no progress, and the Egyptian paratroopers were firmly in control of Touscan. According to Trevor N. Dupuy, by this time Israeli artillery fire <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> main Cairo-Ismailia road unusable.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit with}} his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland; Rudbeck <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> journey in 1695, but the {{detailed}} results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded {{a grant from the}} Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the supreme}} {{director}} Juan Martín de Pueyrredón appointed {{a commission to}} discuss the case of Saavedra. By this time, the Congress of Tucumán <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> Argentine Declaration of Independence {{a couple of years}} before. The commission restored Saavedra with the military rank of brigadier, and ordered the payment of all the wages he did not receive during the time he was demoted. A second commission ratified the ruling. The payment was not enough to compensate Saavedra's losses, but he considered it a token of his restored prestige. He was appointed then to help with the protection of the frontier with the natives at Luján.|$|E

5|$|González and Olid {{had arrived}} at an uneasy accord, neither wishing to openly clash with the other. However, Olid's men outnumbered those of his rival, and González <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> mistake of {{dividing}} his forces when he had left most of his companions {{on the banks of}} the Dulce river; Olid sent one of his captains, Pedro de Briones, to attack one portion of González' forces, while Olid made ready his ships to sail along the coast and attack other detachments. Briones swiftly weakened González' position and captured about half of his men. At this point, Las Casas' fleet appeared off the coast.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Anning {{discovered}} a second, much more complete plesiosaur skeleton, specimen BMNH 22656. When Conybeare presented {{his analysis of}} plesiosaur anatomy to {{a meeting of the}} Geological Society in 1824, he again failed to mention Anning by name, even though she had possibly collected both skeletons and she <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation. Conybeare's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur Megalosaurus and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles. The second fossil was named and described as Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus and is the type specimen (holotype) of this species, which itself is the type species of the genus.|$|E
