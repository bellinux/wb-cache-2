Isolation of a particular time delay is accomplished by the conversion of a time delay point into a corresponding spatial frequency by the use of appropriate optics.

Here we propose a novel <b>integrated</b> Fock state <b>optical</b> sensor architecture {{that can be used for}} force, refractive index and possibly local temperature detection. In this scheme, two coupled cavities behave as an "effective beam splitter". The sensor works based on fourth order interference (the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect) and requires a sequence of single photon pulses and consequently has low pulse power. Changes in the parameter to be measured induce variations in the effective beam splitter reflectivity and result in changes to the visibility of interference. We demonstrate this generic scheme in coupled L 3 photonic crystal cavities as an example and find that this system, which only relies on photon coincidence detection and does not need any spectral resolution, can estimate forces as small as $ 10 ^{- 7 }$ Newtons and can measure one part per million change in refractive index using a very low input power of $ 10 ^{- 10 }$W.

40|$|My thesis {{research}} has focused on means of <b>integrating</b> <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> into microfluidic chips, specifically for the creation of lab-on-a-chip flow cytometers. The benefits of microfluidics are perhaps most often applied to biological assays, which frequently employ optical readout of fluorescence or light scatter. By <b>integrating</b> the <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> onto the microfluidic chip, we can facilitate chip interfacing while ensuring optical alignment to a tiny sample. <b>Integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> also offer the ability to collect light from a localized area, allowing for the collection of true angular light scatter (which carries much information about cells) and can furthermore significantly improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) relative to simple fiber or waveguide based approaches to integrated light collection. This work explores both the unique challenges and advantages encountered when creating <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> <b>integrated</b> with mold-replicated microfluidic devices. The first contribution presented is the demonstration of fluid- filled lenses integrated alongside microfluidic channels using a slab waveguiding structure. The use of fluid represents an important tradeoff between lens power and Fresnel reflections. The creation of a slab waveguiding structure is critically important to control light losses when utilizing lens systems for light collection. The second contribution in this work is the demonstration of a microfluidic chip emplying a number of lenses to perform both localized excitation of the samples as well as light collection from localized areas defined by a specific angular range. Sample coefficients of variation (CVs) ranged from 9 - 16 % for a single bead population, far exceeding previously-published CVs of 25 - 35 %. The last contribution is an atypical approach to <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> based on the unique advantages offered by microfabricated architectures, namely small sizes and close proximities to the sample.

40|$|Expanding {{far beyond}} {{traditional}} applications in optical interconnects at telecommunications wavelengths, the silicon nanophotonic integrated circuit platform has recently proven its merits {{for working with}} mid-infrared (mid-IR) optical signals in the 2 - 8 μm range. Mid-IR <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> are capable of addressing applications including industrial process and environmental monitoring, threat detection, medical diagnostics, and free-space communication. Rapid progress {{has led to the}} demonstration of various silicon components designed for the on-chip processing of mid-IR signals, including waveguides, vertical grating couplers, microcavities, and electrooptic modulators. Even so, a notable obstacle to the continued advancement of chip-scale systems is imposed by the narrow-bandgap semiconductors, such as InSb and HgCdTe, traditionally used to convert mid-IR photons to electrical currents. The cryogenic or multi-stage thermo-electric cooling required to suppress dark current noise, exponentially dependent upon the ratio Eg/kT, can limit the development of small, low-power, and low-cost <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> for the mid-IR. However, if the mid-IR optical signal could be spectrally translated to shorter wavelengths, for example within the near-infrared telecom band, photodetectors using wider bandgap semiconductors such as InGaAs or Ge could be used to eliminate prohibitive cooling requirements. Moreover, telecom band detectors typically perform with higher detectivity and faster response times when compared with their mid-IR counterparts. Here we address these challenges with a silicon-integrated approach to spectral translation, by employing efficient four-wave mixing (FWM) and large optical parametric gain in silicon nanophotonic wires...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} dynamic optical processing for the control of phased array antennas. The significant result presented is the demonstration of a continuously variable photonic RF/microwave delay line. Specifically, it is shown that by applying spatial frequency dependent optical phase compensation in an optical heterodyne process, variable RF delay can be achieved over a prescribed frequency band. Experimental results which demonstrate {{the performance of the}} delay line with regard to both maximum delay and resolution over a broad bandwidth are presented. Additionally, a spatially <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> is proposed for control of phased array antennas. The integrated system provides mechanical stability, essentially eliminates the drift problems associated with free space optical systems, and can provide high packing density. This approach uses a class of spatial light modulator known as a deformable mirror device and leads to a steerable arbitrary antenna radiation pattern of the true time delay type. Also considered is the ability to utilize the delay line as a general photonic signal processing element in an adaptive (reconfigurable) transversal frequency filter configuration. Such systems are widely applicable in jainmer/noise canceling systems, broadband ISDN, spread spectrum secure communications and the like. ...|$|E

The results show that the delay time error of +/- 0. 1 ns in the optical delay module, the uniform distribution of sub-beams with the delay time precision of +/- 0. 03 ps and isocon descending energy in the beam division delay and attenuation modules, and pulse broadening of similar to 22 % in the whole system are achieved. In the meantime, the experiment results display the sweep speed of 1. 2 ps/pixel in a streak camera and the dynamic range of 131 in a framing camera.

40|$|Three optical {{components}} of a fly’s eye determine the angular sensitivity of the photoreceptors: the light diffracting facet lens, the wave-guiding rhabdomere and the light-absorbing visual pigment in the rhabdomere. How the <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> of the fly eye shapes the angular sensitivity curves is quantitatively analyzed in five steps: (1) scalar diffraction theory for low Fresnel-number lenses is applied to four different facet lenses, with diameter 10, 20, 40, and 80 µm, respectively, assuming a constant F-number of 2. 2; (2) optical waveguide theory {{is used to calculate}} waveguide modes propagating in circular cylindrical rhabdomeres with diameter 1. 0, 2. 0, and 4. 0 µm, respectively; (3) the excitation of waveguide modes is studied with the tip of the waveguide positioned in the focal plane as well as outside this plane; (4) the light absorption from the various propagated modes by the visual pigment in the rhabdomere is calculated {{as a function of the}} angle of the incident light wave; and (5) the angular sensitivity of the photoreceptor is obtained by normalizing the total light absorption. Four wavelengths are considered: 300, 400, 500 and 600 nm. The analysis shows that the wavelength dependency of the lens diffraction is strongly compensated by that of the waveguide modes, an effect which is further enhanced by the decrease in light absorption when the mode number increases. The angular sensitivity of fly photoreceptors is robust to defocus and largely wavelength independent for all except very slender rhabdomeres. ...|$|E

The main focus of this work involves the optical properties of displays based on these bistable structures. In the investigations, the display is considered as an <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>system,</b> containing not only the liquid crystal cell, but also components such as polarizers and retardation films. The specific aim of the thesis was to derive new optical modes of the reflective single-polarizer bistable twisted nematic device using the Jones matrix method to study {{the interaction between the}} polarization of light and the optically anisotropic media. The electro-optical properties of the derived modes have been studied and evaluated both theoretically and experimentally. The modes possess excellent brightness and high contrast ratio. By introducing a quarter-wave retardation film into the optical configuration, the contrast ratio can be significantly increased by preventing spectral leakage of light in the dark state. To experimentally realize the derived optical modes, special layers for the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules on the cell substrate surface have been proved needed. Therefore, also the photo-alignment technology of nematic liquid crystals on novel alignment materials has been studied with the aim to control liquid crystal cell parameters such as pretilt angle and anchoring energy, both critical for the bistable switching.

40|$|Hypothesis / aims {{of study}} There {{are not much}} data on in vivo biomechanical {{measurements}} of the vaginal wall. Epstein et al (1) examined the relationship of in vivo biomechanical properties of the vaginal wall in patients with and without prolapse. In that study, as having prolapse were considered patients in whom the leading edge descended beyond the hymenal ring. Measurements were done on a single point on the lateral vaginal wall 2 cm above the hymenal ring. They used the commercially available DermaLab skin probe (Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark; dimensions: 2. 0 * 1. 5 cm). During measurement, the vaginal wall is subjected to an increasing aspiration pressure. It registers {{the time it takes}} the vaginal epithelium to pass through a 10 mm aperture as evidenced by an infrared light beam. This device however is not purposely designed for intravaginal use. It has a large aperture, so that compliant tissue could fill the cup prior to measurement. Also measurements are done at a single point, which on itself is not a reference point of the clinical POP-Q score (2). Herein we aimed to perform site specific in vivo biomechanical properties with a purpose-designed suction device, derived from the Cutometer MPA 580 (Courage and Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany). This device is designed for intravaginal use, has a length of 20 cm and the largest diameter of the device is 3 cm and a 6. In essence, it records vaginal wall displacement (strain) under a fixed aspiration pressure (stress) through an <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>system.</b> Study design, materials and methods A total of 48 patients, in which we could obtain at least one recording, were included in this study. These were women referred for pelvic floor ultrasound examination for a variety of reasons. First, the degree of prolapse was staged according to the POPQ-classification, and categorized as stage I or less (not prolapsed) or stage II or more (prolapsed). Then vaginal biomechanical properties were measured using the device. One typical vaginal elasticity measurement consisted of a single cycle with an aspiration pressure of 300 mbar, an aspiration pressure comparable to dermal measurements. Both suction and relaxation time consist of 5 sec after an initial 10 sec pretime without aspiration. The measurements were taken at four places: two on the anterior vaginal wall, at point Aa and 5 cm above the hymenal ring (=Aa- 2 cm), and two on the posterior wall, at point Ap and 5 cm above the hymenal ring (=Ap- 2 cm). The Cutometer MPA 580 software displays a series of plots and parameters (=recording), among which R 0 : firmness of the vaginal wall; R 2 : overall elasticity and R 7 : ratio of elastic recovery to the total deformation, which are representative for the entire measurement. After measurement, the recording was judged to be interpretable or not, based on its quality. If not, up to three attempts were made to obtain a better recording. In its absence, the entire measurement for this location was classified as failed. Further their medical records were searched for history of prolapse surgery. Descriptive statistics and factor analysis were done using, JMP® 7 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 2007). Factor analysis allows to determine which experimental conditions affect the measurements in a significant way and which experimental conditions could be considered as irrelevant. Results The mean age of patients was 64, 27 years (range: 28 - 82 yrs). The summary statistics of these are displayed in Table 1. None of the correlations between clinical prolapse scores and the biomechanical measurement values (R 0, R 2, R 7) were significant (p values not shown). Measurements within the same patient, at different sites, were significantly correlated (p> 0. 05). Further we observed that measurements in patients previously operated for prolapse, as compared to those never operated for prolapse, were significantly different as demonstrated in table 2. Of note is that measurements in patients with a previous operation, measurements of all sites, even if unoperated, were comparable. However that number of sites was so low that no further statistics were run on it. status: publishe...|$|E

The retro-reflection optics necessary for forming the lattice are bonded {{directly to the}} atom chip, enabling a compact and robust on-chip <b>optical</b> lattice <b>system.</b> After achieving Bose-Einstein condensation in a magnetic chip trap, we load atoms directly into a vertically oriented 1 D optical lattice and demonstrate Landau-Zener tunneling.

This is mainly due to the possibility to use low-cost techniques for fabrication as solution-processing, suitable also to flexible substrates, and to tailor the material properties for specific applications. In the field of optoelectronics, {{the use of such}} materials for the realization of light sources (OLED, Organic Light-Emitting Diode, or OTFL, Organic Thin-Film Lasers), photo-diodes and solar cells has already been demonstrated. In this context, the combination of different organic devices for <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>systems,</b> can pave the way to new applications in the field of data communication, sensing application, imaging and solar energy.

40|$|Microoptical and <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> are {{increasingly}} <b>integrated</b> into devices produced in higher batch sizes. On the one hand, conventional optical components {{are replaced by}} miniaturized systems. These have a higher reliability at increasing function scope. Additionally, high integrated or monolithic elements combining functions of several classical components lower the manufacturing costs. On the other hand, new fields of application are opened {{by the use of}} active and passive elements of microoptics and integrated optics. Simultaneously, the complexity of this systems increases and with that the demands for accuracy and quality. Currently, the majority of micro <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> is still assembled manually. The high demands on the microsystems can often only be met with considerable expenditure of work, time and costs.

40|$|Suppressing {{the effect}} of dis et a f Unive ed for e 28 Photonics and Nanostructures – Fundamentals anIn <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> <b>systems,</b> nonreciprocal {{elements}} are indispensable devices that eliminate multi-path reflection between components. To miniaturizing these devices down to a single-wavelength scale, we study nonreciprocal effects in point defects of magneto-optical photonic crystals. The nonreciprocal effect splits degenerate mode pairs and its strength is maximized by spatially matching the magnetic domain pattern with a modal cross product. The resultant eigenmodes are a pair of counter-rotating states that lack time-reversal symmetry. Based upon these eigenmodes, we propose a micro-cavity four-port circulator constructed by coupling a magneto-optical cavity with two waveguides, where each rotating state supports light tunneling along a different direction. In the presence of strong magneto-optical couplings, due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, {{the performance of the}} isolator is fundamentally protected from {{the effect of}} small structural fluctuations. Numerical calculations demonstrate a four-port circulator with a 26 dB isolation and a roughness tolerance on the order of 0. 1 a, where a is the lattice constant of the crystal...|$|R
