50|$|A £104 million {{engineering}} project {{known as}} the Colchester to Clacton Resignalling Project {{took place on the}} line between December 2006 and July 2009. Life-expired signalling equipment was replaced and a new control system was installed; 170 modern LED signals were installed and eight manual level crossings were upgraded to <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> crossings with security cameras. The line was closed every weekend and on public holidays, with bus replacement services provided.|$|E
50|$|On 1 November 2007, {{the rest}} of the line was also {{connected}} to the electronic signalling centre. At the same time, all older level crossings were upgraded to {{the state of the art}} with flashing lights. The crossing at Bahnhofstraße in Holzheim had been equipped with a <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> and a gatekeeper who visually checked whether the tracks were free of vehicles; this is now done with a radar scanner.|$|E
2500|$|Most level {{crossings}} (spoorwegovergang in Dutch) have half barriers, mechanical or electrical bells, and double (or sometimes single) red lights. The lights flash alternately, {{as do the}} ones on the barriers. Those for pedestrians with an active warning system have <b>full</b> <b>barriers.</b> Three {{level crossings}} are operated remotely by staff from a traffic control center, using cameras; these have <b>full</b> <b>barriers</b> and no bells. Two level crossings for vehicles have <b>full</b> <b>barriers,</b> with a system to detect a vehicle been trapped; in this case the exit barriers are opened. Crossings with little road traffic and/or little rail traffic have no alarm, just warning signs. There are no level crossings where trains routinely run at over 140km/h. Level crossings have a sign saying [...] "WACHT" [...] (WAIT).|$|R
25|$|Most level {{crossings}} in Indonesia have sirens. They also have 2 red lights (usually) and <b>full</b> <b>barriers.</b> Level crossings {{appear to be}} rare. Some {{level crossings}} in Indonesia have been removed.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{the levels}} of upgrade of the {{crossing}} in the rail improvements project {{were based on the}} risk analysis. The improvements included flashing light protection, automatic <b>full</b> <b>barriers</b> protection, and pedestrian gates crossings. The project also introduced the use of rubber panels at the crossings.|$|R
5000|$|Manual {{semaphore}} signalling {{complete with}} a block post at Prudhoe Signalbox beside the station and level crossing continues to operate. The <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> level crossing is signalman worked {{and because of the}} adjacent single track Ovingham Bridge over the River Tyne and the frequent train services, there are often long road queues. From 1859 until 1915 there was another station less than a mile west, known as [...] "Mickley".|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two modes}} of gameplay. The player {{controls}} either Professor Proteus in his battlesuit, or Cyborasaurus, a truly devastating Robosaur. Capsules that Robosaurs drop {{can help to}} keep these two entities alive. Capsules labeled [...] "E" [...] will fully replenish the player's energy. Capsules labeled [...] "B" [...] give the player a <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> meter. Any damage taken will deplete the barrier meter before affecting the energy meter.|$|E
50|$|In March 2006, {{the line}} was between Grevenbroich and Neuss-Holzheim was {{converted}} to the new Ks-signals, controlled from the electronic siganalling centre in Duisburg. On 1 November 2007, the rest of {{the line was}} also connected to the electronic signalling centre. At the same time, all older level crossings were upgraded to {{the state of the art}} with flashing lights. The crossing at Bahnhofstraße in Holzheim had been equipped with a <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> and a gatekeeper who visually checked whether the tracks were free of vehicles; this is now done with a radar scanner.|$|E
50|$|On {{the section}} of the line that is still in {{operation}} there are now 37 crossings, eleven with <b>full</b> <b>barriers,</b> 18 with half barriers and three which just have a flashing light, which means that there is an average of just over one kilometre between each crossing. A special feature is the railway crossing in Gelsenkirchen-Beckhausen, where this line crosses a narrow-gauge railway operated by BOGESTRA at an at-grade crossing.|$|R
2500|$|In Hungary, level {{crossings}} mostly {{do not have}} audible tones, and some also do not have lights. <b>Full</b> <b>barriers</b> usually don't have lights, but have an audible warning. Crossings equipped with lights are common. The newest, and best solution is [...] a crossing equipped with half-barriers and LED-lights. A unique type of {{level crossings}} in Hungary have a sign saying [...] "10 percen túl is zárva tartható" [...] (can be kept closed for more than 10 minutes).|$|R
5000|$|The Shrewsbury to Newport railway line {{passes through}} the village {{and there is a}} level {{crossing}} for vehicles and pedestrians. In 2014 Network Rail proposed closing this crossing, as part of improvements to signalling and safety on the line, but potentially effectively dividing the village community. In 2015 it was however announced that, following a public consultation, the level crossing would be upgraded (with <b>full</b> <b>barriers</b> replacing the existing [...] "half" [...] barriers) instead of being closed.|$|R
50|$|The station lies in {{the centre}} of Farncombe, a {{northern}} suburb of Godalming. Nowadays it is served by South West Trains on the main line from Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour. It was served by the old Southern Railway. Farncombe station is staffed most of the time, and has a café on platform 1. As well as the ticket office, Farncombe has two ticket machines, both of them on platform 1. There are two <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> level crossings at Farncombe, one {{at each end of}} the station. The two platforms are connected by an old, metal, bridge. There is a carpark located by the exit of platform 1, this is pay and display and is open all day, 7 days a week.|$|E
30|$|Adult male C 57 BL/ 6 and {{transgenic}} mice expressing GFP, ubiquitously {{under control}} of the chicken b-actin promoter with the cytomegalovirus enhancer (C 57 BL/ 6 -Tg[CAG-EGFP]), were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The ages of the mice ranged from 6 to 8  weeks. The mice were maintained in a <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> facility until experimental use, {{and all of the}} experiments received institutional approval.|$|E
30|$|Although the {{usefulness}} of <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> precautions outside the ICU was challenged recently [23], the standard of care for CR-BSI prevention must continue to {{include the use of}} sterile gloves, a long-sleeved sterile gown, a mask, a cap, and a large sterile drape during catheter insertion [24]. Aqueous alcoholic hand rubs improve adherence to and tolerance of hand-cleansing rules and are probably at least as effective as surgical hand washing [25].|$|E
50|$|The line to Rochlitz left Waldheim {{in a long}} {{curve in}} a {{north-western}} direction. After crossing under the Waldheim bypass road it passed Richzenhain and crossed the road between Waldheim and Hartha on a level crossing that was equipped with halfway gates {{in the last years}} of the operation. It continued to Hartha at a distance of about 50 m from State road S 36 and crossed another road (now K 7533) at the station entrance on a level crossing with <b>full</b> <b>barriers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Irish level {{crossings}} (crosaire comhréidh in Irish) {{are similar to}} UK {{level crossings}}, {{in the fact that}} they have a preliminary amber light before the red lights start flashing and the barriers descend (one example at Wexford does not have an amber light). Crossings are the same on the whole island of Ireland, and are either of the old gated variant, or are automatic. Ireland does have automatic crossings that have <b>full</b> <b>barriers,</b> which are not seen in the UK. The audible alarms are unique to the country.|$|R
50|$|The goods shed survives, as {{does the}} Great Northern Railway signal box, which is now used only to monitor a number of level {{crossings}} in the vicinity. Helpston level crossing itself carries the Helpston to Glinton road over the four tracks of the ex-GNR line and the two tracks of the ex-MR line. This was previously two separate level crossings, controlled by two separate signal boxes. There was space for two cars between the level crossings. The crossings were merged and converted from gates to <b>full</b> <b>barriers</b> in the 1970s.|$|R

40|$|Central line-associated {{bloodstream}} infection (CLABSI) {{is one of}} the most common infectious complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To prevent this complication, international guidelines recommend the implementation of the CLABSI 'prevention bundle' consisting of hand hygiene, <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> precautions, cleaning the insertion site with chlorhexidine, avoiding femoral sites for insertion, and removing unnecessary catheters. The aim of this survey was to analyze to what extent European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) centers have included the CLABSI prevention bundle in practice...|$|E

The aim of this survey was to analyze to what extent European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) centers have included the CLABSI prevention bundle in practice. A questionnaire used for data collection was sent to the 545 EBMT centers worldwide, 103 of which responded. All 5 components of the CLABSI prevention bundle were recorded in 28 % of the centers' standard operating procedures (SOP), and 21 % of the centers answered that they used all of the bundle components in clinical practice. The most common recommendation absent from the SOP was specification of all the components of <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> precautions (43 % of the centers did not include at least 1 component). Skin disinfection with chlorhexidine before catheter insertion was reported by 66 % centers. CLABSI rates were monitored in 21 % of centers. Although most of the centers lacked 1 or more of the CLABSI prevention bundle components in their SOP, improvements could easily be made by updating the centers' SOP. The first important step is introduction of CLABSI rate monitoring in this high-risk patient populatio...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2012 an Internet {{petition}} {{called for}} the level crossing to be replaced with a bridge. Network Rail subsequently {{announced that it was}} considering either converting the crossing to <b>full</b> <b>barriers</b> or a bridge. In March 2014, Network Rail stated that it [...] "remained on course" [...] to replace the level crossing [...] "by mid-2014 or 2015". West Berkshire Council approved plans for a road bridge in August 2015, and preparatory work began the following month. On 18 April 2016, Network Rail held an official ceremony as construction began. The bridge was officially opened on 16 December 2016.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{very busy}} level {{crossing}} further along the same line on Easthampstead Road at Star Lane. BR installed automatic half-barriers (AHB) on it in about 1964. In 1997 Railtrack upgraded it to <b>full</b> <b>barriers</b> and equipped it with CCTV. BR equipped Waterloo Crossing with AHBs in 1965, and they remain in use today. BR also converted Amen Corner level crossing to AHBs, but in 1982 the A329 road was re-routed and two bridges were built to replace the Level crossing. The diverted road uses an overbridge nearer Wokingham station, and a pedestrian footbridge occupies {{the site of the}} former crossing.|$|R

30|$|The {{experience}} at Mine A demonstrated both {{the advantages and}} limitations of the two Utah longwall pillar design techniques. While the yield pillar system used {{on the first two}} panels typically performs well at depths up 600  m or so, it concentrates the load on the tailgate corner of the longwall face, and this can make it unworkable at greater depths. After the interpanel barrier method was introduced at Mine A, it was adopted at several other Utah longwalls (Gilbride and Hardy 2004). In some cases, rather than leave a <b>full</b> <b>barrier,</b> these mines elected to make mid-panel moves around the area of deepest cover, thus providing a local interpanel barrier for the next panel (Maleki 2006).|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{cases of}} {{gastroenteritis}} caused by Escherichia coli 0142 K 86 H 6 are described. Ten {{of these cases}} were clearly involved in an outbreak of cross infection. The other two cases yielded interesting information on infection with E. coli. 0142. Five cases, two being fatal, required repeated intravenous infusion, and one further infant required parenteral replacement therapy on a single occasion only. Cross infection occurred at the primary site—a ward partitioned into cubicles—despite <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> nursing techniques. Infection spread also to two other wards, and resulted from transfer of latently infected cases. Illness in several infants was protracted and debilitating because of the relapsing nature of the infection. The pathology of the two fatalities is reported briefly...|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, for {{the first}} time, the {{conventional}} conductance method was used to study the buffer traps in the Al 2 O 3 /GaN MOS device with <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> removal. The bulk traps with a single energy level and uniformly distributed in GaN buffer {{that leads to a}} single Gp/ω peak were detected by f-dependent conductance measurements in the deep depletion region. On the other hand, the interface traps with wide energies were measured in the subthreshold region, which corresponds to the multiple Gp/ω peaks observed in the f-dependent conductance measurements. Due to the different f-dependent conductance response originating from the different energy and spatial distributions, the demonstrated approach is much easier to be used to investigate the physics of the bulk traps in GaN buffer.|$|E
50|$|A level {{crossing}} named 'Havensmouth' by Network Rail is in operation at Normans Bay, which was upgraded to automatic <b>full</b> length <b>barriers</b> in February 2015 in co-operation with the upgrading {{of part of}} the East Coastway Line.|$|R
30|$|The {{coverage}} {{problem is}} one of the fundamental issues in wireless sensor networks, evidenced by many works contribute to this field in recent years. It can be classified into three categories: <b>full</b> coverage, <b>barrier</b> coverage, and sweep coverage.|$|R
2500|$|A dual {{carriageway}} with grade-separated junctions and which meets other requirements may be upgraded to motorway standard, denoted by an (M) added after the road number (e.g. [...] "A1(M)" [...] or [...] "A38(M)"). Unlike in Ireland, {{there was no}} official terminology for 'high-quality {{dual carriageway}}s' until April 2015, when in England a new standard was set to designate certain high-quality routes formally as [...] "Expressways". Many roads such as the A1, the A14, the A19 and the A42 are built to a high quality, with grade-separated junctions, <b>full</b> <b>barriers</b> at roadside and central reservations and, in some cases, three lanes of traffic. They may still fall short of motorway standard in terms of hard shoulders, the height of overpasses or the quality of intersecting junctions.|$|R
40|$|After the {{discovery}} of the double-humped potential barrier, researchers have derived a host of expressions for the probability of tunnelling through such a barrier. It is generally believed that the penetrabilities obtained by using the various methods do not differ sufficiently to have significant effects on the analysis of experimental data on fission. However, some have expressed doubts concerning the use of the usual JWKB method and have offered improved approximate and Exact methods for developing penetrability expressions. This thesis is devoted to the quantitative comparison of penetrabilities from these expressions, and to the investigation of effects various methods will have on spontaneous and isomeric fission half-lives. Results from the penetrability expressions are compared in relation to the pure vibrational state energy levels, level heights, resonance widths, and the probability of penetrating the <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> from its ground-state deformation...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} multi-purpose {{finite element}} model of a 1994 Chevrolet C- 1500 pick-up truck was developed at the FHWA/NHTSA National Crash Analysis Center. The model {{is the first of}} its kind developed specifically to address vehicle safety issues, including front and side performance, as well as road side hardware design. The former application typically involves large regional deformation with impact durations of no more than 150 msec. The latter encompasses damage along a larger portion of the vehicle, and due to longer interaction time between the vehicle and impacted device coupled with the need to observe post impact dynamics, requires simulations that could last as long as 1 second. This paper describes the results of a non-linear finite element computer simulation using this model for frontal <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> and median highway barrier impacts. These simulations are conducted in support of research studies undergoing at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Single-crystal {{epitaxial}} MgO {{thin films}} were grown directly onto high-quality Fe single crystal and Fe whisker substrates {{and covered with}} Fe/Au layers. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction and low-energy electron diffraction patterns and scanning tunneling microscopy images showed that the growth of MgO proceeded pseudomorphically in a nearly layer-by-layer mode up to six monolayers. A misfit dislocation network is formed for MgO layers thicker than six monolayers. The thin MgO films were characterized electrically by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The tunneling barrier in MgO was found {{to depend on the}} MgO layer thickness, starting from 2. 5 eV at two monolayer thickness to the expected <b>full</b> <b>barrier</b> of MgO of 3. 6 eV at six monolayers. A small fraction of the scanned area showed randomly placed spikes in the tunneling conductance. Tunneling I-V curves at the defects showed a lower tunneling barrier than that in the majority of the MgO film. The total tunneling current integrated over areas of 100 × 100 nm 2, however, was not dominated by spikes of higher conductance. These local defects in the MgO barrier were neither related to atomic steps on the Fe substrates nor to individual misfit dislocations. Magnetic anisotropies and exchange coupling in Fe/ MgO(001) and Fe/MgO/Fe(001) structures were studied using ferromagnetic resonance and Brillouin light scattering...|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the second}} tier of high speed roads below Motorways are {{typically}} dual carriageways. Many roads {{such as the}} A1, the A14, the A19 and the A42 are built to a high quality, in many places they are only intersected by grade-separated junctions, have <b>full</b> <b>barriers</b> at both the road side and the central reservations {{and in some cases}} three lanes of traffic, however for at least one reason they fall short of motorway standard. They may lack some features that a motorway would have, such as hard shoulders, and may have tighter bends and steeper gradients than would be allowed on a motorway or have established rights of way that cannot be removed. The standard motorway speed limit for cars of 70 mph also applies to many dual carriageways.|$|R
25|$|Until 2005, many {{motorways}} and dual carriageways in Ireland did {{not have}} crash barriers in the central reservation, the policy being to use a wider median instead. Crash barriers are now mandatory for such routes, and wire cabling or <b>full</b> crash <b>barriers</b> (depending {{on whether or not}} the route is a motorway, and median width) have been fitted to existing routes.|$|R
