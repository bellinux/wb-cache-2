50|$|Shower {{doors are}} doors used in {{bathrooms}} that help keep water inside a shower or bathtub and are alternatives to shower curtains. They {{are available in}} many different styles such as framed or frameless, sliding or swing. They are usually constructed of aluminium, clear glass, plexi-glass or tempered glass. Shower doors can come in many different <b>hardware</b> <b>finishes</b> and glass patterns that can match other bathroom hardware such as faucets and shower heads. There are also shower doors that are in a neo angle design for use on shower pans that have the neo design as well. The design of the shower pan is extremely important as the shower door must be the type required for the pan in order to work. A shower door requires plastic lining {{along the edges of}} the door to protect against water leaking out.|$|R
50|$|The neck is {{an extra}} thin U shape (think {{somewhere between a}} C and D shape) with 24 XJ or extra jumbo frets and proved supremely easy {{to play with a}} profile that was {{comfortable}} and fast thanks to the 25.5 in scale and large fret size - perfect for modern, technically demanding styles! Shark tooth style inlays enhance the technical look of the instrument and the M-1000 logo inlaid at the 12th fret adds an element of class to the aesthetics. Hardware is all high spec with Grover Tuners, locking nut, Original Floyd Rose bridge and a pair of EMG 81 pickups in bridge and neck positions. A three-way switch is accompanied by volume and tone knobs with all <b>hardware</b> <b>finished</b> in black nickel, contrasting very nicely with the See-Thru Black finish on the body and matching headstock.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{the rate}} of aged people is {{continuously}} increasing in Japan: in ten years, around 30 % of the Japanese population will be aged more than 65 years old. These people often need some help from caretakers, and this causes {{a problem for the}} caretakers: it takes a very big burden for caretakers, for example, to lift people from their bed, when they need to go to toilets. So, a system to help caretakers would be needed: This is a master-slave unit exoskeleton, which helps the caretaker while loading the patient. It is moved by a Hydraulic Bilateral Servo system, whose master cylinders are moved by servo-motors. Presently, the conceptions of the body and <b>hardware</b> are <b>finished.</b> We are developing the servo-loop system and the driving software for the system, and more specially the pulse generation software for the motor of the master part of the exoskeleton.

50|$|From the beginning, {{the show}} was {{intended}} to be a place for owners to both show off their boats, and for them to be judged. Over the show's years, the judging system has been refined, and first-place boats are considered world-class. The judging system consists of a 100-point judging rubric, in which every aspect from <b>hardware,</b> to <b>finish,</b> to wiring and upholstery are thoroughly examined. Points are taken off for things such as incorrect wiring (from original), incorrect varnish color, imperfections in the finish, incorrect upholstery color, and hardware that isn't correct for the boat. Boats, unlike cars, need not their original engine, but must have an engine that is correct for that boat model, that year; if it was an option that year for a Hemi, but the boat originally has a Chevrolet engine, so long as everything has been restored as the boat would be configured with the Hemi, it will not face a deduction. Because of the 100-point system, there may be multiple first-place boats for that class, or there may only be second or third-place boats. As the prestige of the show has grown, and restorations get better, it is said by many judges and experts that some first-place boats may be restored to a condition better than it would have had exiting the factory.|$|R
40|$|The Scaled Centrifugal Compressor, Collector and Running gear Program was {{conducted}} in support of an overall NASA strategy to improve small-compressor performance, durability, and reliability while reducing initial and life-cycle costs. Accordingly, Garrett designed and provided a test rig, gearbox coupling, and facility collector for a new NASA facility, and provided a scaled model of an existing, high-performance impeller for evaluation scaling effects on aerodynamic performance and for obtaining other performance data. Test-rig shafting was designed to operate smoothly throughout a speed range up to 60, 000 rpm. Pressurized components were designed to operate at pressures up to 300 psia and at temperatures to 1000 F. Nonrotating components were {{designed to provide a}} margin-of-safety of 0. 05 or greater; rotating components, for a margin-of-safety based on allowable yield and ultimate strengths.

40|$|In {{this project}} a four phase {{switch-mode}} DC/AC inverter was designed, built and evaluated. From Etteplantech and Chalmers University of Technology a common {{need for a}} well behaving and versatile inverter in the medium power range was found. The final product was targeted {{to be able to}} deliver up to 7 kW of power, with an input DC voltage of 600 V. The finished product managed to operate a 4 kW induction machine to its limits, with a maximum tested switching frequency of 18 kHz. This must be seen as a success. A larger strain on the inverter was not done due to lack of a larger machine, but individually the 600 V supply voltage and the 10 A per phase output current was tested successfully. The resulting inverter is very versatile; with the right control system it’s capable of operating any electrical machine. The input control logic can handle both 3. 3 and 5 V signals, while the input DC voltage can be in the 25 to 600 V range. Basic simulations done during the project shows that an RC-snubber would be able to lower the EMI by lowering the dv/dt during switching, while introducing extra losses in the snubber circuit without lowering the losses in the IGBTs, only moving them from turn-off to turn-on. In the <b>finished</b> <b>hardware,</b> the snubber circuit was therefore only prepared for, not implemented...|$|R
40|$|Hot {{structures}} made {{of ceramic}} matrix composites (CMC) for space reentry vehicles {{play a key}} role regarding the feasibility of advanced and reusable future space transportation systems. Thus realization of applicable flight hardware concerning hot primary structures like a nose cap or body flaps and thermal protection systems (TPS) requires system competence w. r. t. sophisticated know how in material processing, manufacturing and qualification of structural components and in all aspects from process control, use of NDI techniques, arc jet and hot structure testing. However, the most important issue to realize hot primary structures for operational space reentry vehicles is validation of materials and design concepts via real flight testing due to limitations of any existing ground based testing facility or validation methodology. So this has been the strategy of DLR since one decade and multiple reentry flight tests with samples and structural components have been performed until now. Coated and uncoated C/C-SiC specimens were integrated into the ablative heat shield of Russian FOTON capsules and they were tested during two missions in 1992 and 1994. Following on, a hot structure experiment called CETEX which principally was a kind of a little nose cap had been developed and tested during the EXPRESS mission in 1995. These three flight tests were the first ones in Europe carried out with such a kind of material and hot structural concept and many lessons were learned w. r. t. material behaviour and structural design performance under the severe environmental conditions of ballistic capsule reentry. Within an ESA program called FESTIP we developed a new design concept for a rigid surface TPS based on CMCs which should be adaptable to the outer side of a cryogenic tank structure of a future SSTO vehicle. Special TPS concept features are (flat) integrally stiffened CMC panels, hot CMC fasteners for outside attachment capability, thermal displacement compensation, sealing and insulation, provision of a purge gap etc. Based on this concept a flight experiment was realized featuring all principal design aspects mentioned before and adding three different anti oxidation coating systems. The experiment again will be integrated into the heat shield of a Russian FOTON capsule and the mission is planned for October 2002. On the longer run we started to follow a new approach based on the idea of using flat panels for a TPS instead of trying to realize continuous shaped surfaces which is todays design. So the vehicles surface will look facetted and various questions w. r. t. design, manufacturing, heat loads at edges, change of the vehicles aerodynamic properties etc. arise. Just now a flight experiment called SHEFEX (SHarp Edge Flight EXperiment) is in the definition phase and flight is scheduled to 2004. The nose cap development for NASAs X- 38 would have been the most ambitious flight experiment until now and our flight <b>hardware</b> was <b>finished</b> and installed successfully to the flight vehicle V 201 in October 2001. However as the X- 38 project has been stopped just now and other publications already described the development of the nose cap system it will not be focused on within this paper. Highlighting the most important technical issues and achievements of the flight experiments performed so far and reporting about ongoing plannings finally will provide a good insight into DLRs past and future development road map w. r. t. CMC hot structures and TPS for space reentry vehicles...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of new {{machines}} or {{in the development of}} new concepts, mankind has often observed nature, looking for useful ideas and sources of inspiration. The design of electronic circuits is no exception, and a considerable number of realizations have drawn inspiration from three aspects of natural systems : the evolution of species (Phylogenesis), the development of an organism starting from a single cell (Ontogenesis), and learning, as performed by our brain (Epigenesis). These three axes, grouped under the acronym POE, have for the most part been exploited separately : evolutionary principles allow to solve problems for which it is hard to find a solution with a deterministic method, while some electronic circuits draw inspiration from healing process in living beings to achieve self-repair, and artificial neural networks have the capability to efficiently execute a wide range of tasks. At this time, no electronic tissue capable of bringing them together seems to exist. The introduction of reconfigurable circuits called Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), whose behavior can be redefined as often as desired, made prototyping such systems easier. FPGAs, by allowing a relatively simple implementation in hardware, can considerably increase the systems' performance and are thus extensively used by researchers. However, they lack plasticity, not being able to easily modify themselves without an external intervention. This PhD thesis, developed in the framework of the European POEtic project, proposes to define a new reconfigurable electronic circuit, with the goal of supplying a new substrate for bio-inspired applications that bring all three axes into play. This circuit is mainly composed of a microprocessor and an array of reconfigurable elements, the latter having been designed during this thesis. Evolutionary processes are executed by the microprocessor, while epigenetic and ontogenetic mechanisms are applied in the reconfigurable array, to entities seen as multicellular artificial organisms. Relatively similar to current commercial FPGAs, this subsystem offers however some unique features. First, the basic elements of the array have the capability to partially reconfigure other elements. Auto-replication and differentiation mechanisms can exploit this capability to let an organism grow or to modify its behavior. Second, a distributed routing layer allows to dynamically create connections between parts of the circuit at runtime. With this feature, cells (artificial neurons, for example) implemented in the reconfigurable array can initiate new connections in order to modify the global system behavior. This distributed routing mechanism, one of the major contributions of this thesis, induced the realization of several algorithms. Based on a parallel implementation of Lee's algorithm, these algorithms are totally distributed, no global control being necessary to create new data paths. Four algorithms have been defined implemented in hardware in the form of routing units connected to 3, 4, 6, or 8 neighbors. These units are all identical and are responsible for the routing processes. An analysis of their properties allows us to define the best algorithm, coupled with the most efficient neighborhood, in terms of congestion and of the number of transistors needed for a <b>hardware</b> realization. We <b>finish</b> the routing chapter by proposing a fifth algorithm that, unlike the previous ones, is constructed only through local interactions between routing units. It offers a better scalability, at the price of increased hardware overhead. Finally, the POEtic chip, in which one of our algorithms has been implemented, has been physically realized. We present different POE mechanisms that take advantage of its new features. Among these mechanisms, we can notably cite auto-replication, evolvable hardware, developmental systems, and self-repair. All of these mechanisms have been developed {{with the help of a}} circuit simulator, also designed in the framework of this thesis...|$|R
