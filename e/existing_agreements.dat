The Maritime Boundary Treaty, signed in 1997, finalised the border in areas not already addressed by <b>existing</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 18th century, Hungary had an {{agricultural}} economy that employed 90 percent of the population. The nobles failed to use fertilizers, roads were poor and rivers blocked, and crude storage methods caused huge losses of grain. Barter had replaced money transactions, and little trade existed between towns and the serfs. After 1760 a labor surplus developed. The serf population grew, pressure on the land increased, and the serfs' standard of living declined. Landowners began making greater demands on new tenants and began violating <b>existing</b> <b>agreements.</b> In response, Maria Theresa issued her Urbarium of 1767 to protect the serfs by restoring their freedom of movement and limiting the corvée. Despite her efforts and several periods of strong demand for grain, the situation worsened. Between 1767 and 1848, many serfs left their holdings. Most became landless farm workers because a lack of industrial development meant few opportunities for work in the towns.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{popular music}} was used {{throughout}} the production to evoke {{the feel of the}} year in which each episode was set. The BBC's <b>existing</b> <b>agreements</b> with various music publishers and record labels meant that the production team was easily able to obtain the rights to use most of the desired songs. A particular piece of synchronicity occurred in the final episode, 1995, which Cellan Jones had decided to close with the song [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] by Oasis. While the serial was in production, it was just another track from their (What's the Story) Morning Glory? album. However, during transmission of Our Friends in the North, it was released as a single, and to Cellan Jones's delight, it {{was at the top of}} the UK Singles Chart in the week of the final episode's transmission.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of micro-task crowdsourcing, each task is usually {{performed}} by several workers. This allows researchers to leverage measures of the agreement among workers on the same task, to estimate the reliability of collected data and to better understand answering behaviors of the participants. While many measures of agreement between annotators have been proposed, they are known for suffering from many problems and abnormalities. In this paper, we identify the main limits of the <b>existing</b> <b>agreement</b> measures in the crowdsourcing context, both by means of toy examples {{as well as with}} real-world crowdsourcing data, and propose a novel agreement measure based on probabilistic parameter estimation which overcomes such limits. We validate our new agreement measure and show its flexibility as compared to the <b>existing</b> <b>agreement</b> measures...|$|R

The objective of the article is to examine whether the new text has indeed delivered on its promise, namely to improve the <b>existing</b> <b>agreement</b> and to eliminate any remaining discriminatory measures and practices. To that aim the article presents the critique that has been leveled against {{the provisions of the}} existing GPA and examines to what extent the flaws detected by this critique have been rectified in the new text. The article concludes with a scorecard of the new text assessing its overall strengths and weaknesses. Oxford University Press 2009, all rights reserved, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} independence, Bulgaria became increasingly militarized and was {{often referred to as}} [...] "the Balkan Prussia", with regard to its desire to revise the Treaty of Berlin through warfare. The partition of territories in the Balkans by the Great Powers without regard to ethnic composition led to a wave of discontent not only in Bulgaria, but also in its neighbouring countries.
