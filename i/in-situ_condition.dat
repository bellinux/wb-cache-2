After evaluation of the hydraulic conductivity, it is possible to determine the ability of the investigated fillers to entrap the stormwater flow. The hydraulic conductivity tests can indicate which fillers of stormwater filters may influence the more effective stormwater cleaning.

Irregularities of the wheels and rails induce substantial dynamic loads {{that have to be}} accounted for in the procedure of designing the railway track.

A typical finite element model of the concrete sleeper is established that focuses on analyzing the behavior of a concrete sleeper during a train passage. A finite element model of a pre-stressed concrete sleeper is established for static load conditions. The studies done with the sleeper model showed that the train load has great impact at the rail seat positions at the two ends of the sleeper maintained at broad gauge distance i. e. 1. 76 m.

The I- 35 W bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota collapsed {{as a result of an}} overstressed (under-designed) gusset plate. Currently, the analytical tools used to assess the adequacy of gusset plates depend on assumed loading based on the intended design configuration of the bridge and conventional tools such as strain gages.

The birefringence measurement evaluates the normalized velocity difference of orthogonally polarized shear waves propagating through the plate. The birefringence varies proportionally as a function of strain in the steel. For verification, laboratory and field test were undertaken to compare ultrasonic stress measurements with stress measurements obtain via conventional strain gages.

The sample quality of Toyoura sands obtained from 48 mm and 75 mm samplers are scrutinized based on void ratio, dynamic strength and deformation properties through model and cyclic undrained triaxial tests. A conventional method for estimating in-situ dynamic strength and deformation properties of sand samples utilizing density changes is examined and {{the applicability of the}} proposed method is discussed for the samples obtained from Niigata sand deposits.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Euro IV legislation [1, 2], Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology using liquid urea injection is (one of) the primary methods for NOx reduction in many applications. Ammonia (NH 3) is the reagent and key element for the SCR system and its control calibration to meet all operational requirements. TNO and Horiba are highly motivated to facilitate a correct interpretation and use of emissions measurement data. Different hypotheses were defined to investigate the impact of temperatures and flow rates on urea decomposition. These parameters are known to strongly affect the urea decomposition process, and thus, the formation of NH 3. During a test campaign, different SCR catalyst feed gas conditions (mass flow, temperature, species and dosing quantities) were applied. Three Horiba FTIR gas analyzers were installed to simultaneously sample either all upstream or all downstream of the SCR brick. Both steady-state and dynamic responses were evaluated. When undecomposed urea is present, the application of sampling system conditioning above the thermolysis temperature of 133 Â°C can result in additional conversion of urea into NH 3. The NH 3 concentration reading then does not correctly represent the <b>in-situ</b> <b>condition.</b> It is concluded that a lower sampling system temperature {{will result in the}} more accurate and physically sound NH 3 measurement.

A numerical model that can predict such injuries in crash simulation {{is essential to the}} process of designing a safer motor vehicle. The focus {{of this study was to}} develop a numerical model to predict lung response and injury in side impact car crash scenarios. A biofidelic human body model was further developed. The geometry, material properties and boundary condition of the organs and soft tissues within the thorax were improved with the intent to ensure stress transmission continuity and model accuracy. The thoracic region of the human body model was revalidated against three pendulum and two sled impact scenarios at different velocities. Other body regions such as the shoulder, abdomen, and pelvis were revalidated. The latest model demonstrated improvements in every response category relative to the previous version of the human body model. The development of the lung model involved advancements in the material properties, and boundary conditions. An analytical approach was presented to correct the lung properties to the <b>in-situ</b> <b>condition.</b> Several injury metric predictor candidates of pulmonary contusion were investigated and compared based on the validated pendulum and sled impact scenarios. The results of this study confirmed the importance of stress wave focusing, reflection, and concentration within the lungs. The bulk modulus of the lung had considerable influence on injury metric outcomes. Despite the viscous criterion yielded similar response for different loading conditions, this study demonstrated that the level of contusion volume varied with the size of the impact surface area. In conclusion, the human body model could be used for the analysis of thoracic response in automotive impact scenarios. The overall model is capable of predicting thoracic response and lung contusion.

40|$|The Load and Resistance Factor Rating (LRFR) is a reliability-based rating {{procedure}} complementary to the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD). The {{intent of}} LRFR {{is to provide}} consistent reliability for all bridges regardless of <b>in-situ</b> <b>condition.</b> The primary difference between design and rating is the uncertain severity and location of deterioration, including the potential future loss of strength for an element already evidencing deterioration. Ostensibly, these uncertainties are accounted for by applying an additional strength reduction factor: the condition factor, ϕc. Currently, condition factors are nominally correlated to {{the condition of the}} member, which can be Good, Fair, or Poor. However, definitions of these condition categories are deferred to inspection documents, which themselves lack clear, objective definitions. Furthermore, lack of guidance to account for the location and extent of deterioration exacerbates confusion in the methodology to appropriately assign condition factors. These ambiguities cause incoherence between inspection and rating processes by introducing additional uncertainty. The additional uncertainty skews load ratings, sometimes producing ratings with unintended conservativism, and sometimes overestimating the safe load-carrying capacity of a bridge. This study presents a calibration of ϕc to be used with steel girder bridges, accounting for uncertainty due to non-uniform deterioration throughout transverse sections, lack of knowledge of the longitudinal location(s) of the deterioration, and the likelihood of further deterioration over the next inspection cycle for ranges of section loss for each condition. Section loss rangers are proposed to define each condition state for potential implementation by inspectors. The proposed condition state definitions and implementation methodology can improve uniformity in the inspection process and produce bridge load ratings that are more consistent with the target reliability intended by the rating procedure.

40|$|Rock block {{strength}} {{is one of}} the predominant factors controlling rock mass behaviour and the response of the structural elements used as rock reinforcement. In uniaxial compression, the strength of rock blocks {{has been shown to be}} size dependent but due to practical difficulties in performing large-scale triaxial compression tests it is very difficult to quantify their in-situ confined strength. For that reason, a numerical study was performed to develop a framework for estimating the confined strength of rock blocks considering scale effects and in-situ heterogeneity (i. e. intensity of structural microdefects and degree of weathering). Grain boundary models using the Voronoi tessellation scheme within UDEC have been used to simulate the results of small (lab) and large (field) scale compression (unconfined and triaxial) and indirect tensile (Brazilian) tests on a series of progressively larger in size and degrading in quality numerical specimens. Accordingly, relationships that link rock block strength with its volume and <b>in-situ</b> <b>condition</b> were developed for the preliminary estimation of scaled Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown parameters. The results from the scaling analysis generally suggest that cohesion decreases with both increasing scale and degrading sample condition in a manner similar to the scale/condition dependant reduction of uniaxial compression strength (UCS), while the friction angle shows only minor variation with no apparent trend. The measured peak confined strength values were also fitted to the Generalized Hoek-Brown criterion and a new block-scale Geological Strength Index parameter is introduced named micro GSI (mGSI) which was also linked to the scale/condition dependant reduction of UCS. By using the proposed linear and non-linear approaches, once the UCS reduction due to scaling effects is known, the confined strength of rock blocks could be then defined and can be used to carry out preliminary rock engineering calculations and especially to run discontinuum numerical models where rock blocks are simulated explicitly and represent an essential element of the analysis...|$|E
