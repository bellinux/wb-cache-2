40|$|ABSTRACT-Tumor {{histogenesis}} and progression {{were studied}} in UV-irradiated albino (Skh:hairless- 1) and lightly pigmented (Skh:hairless- 2) hairless mice. A strongly carcinogenic dose of UV light was used, producing 100 % tumor incidence by 35 weeks. The light source emitted mainly UV radiation {{in the range}} of 280 - 320 nm and the less energetic UV radiation up to 400 nm. The resulting epidermal changes and neoplasms resembled those seen in the actinically damaged skin of humans. Microscopic lesions included benign hyperplasia, actinic keratoses, and squa-mous cell carcinoma in situ and with microinvasion. Clinical tumors were epithelial papillomas, fibropapillomas, keratoacan-thomas, cystic <b>keratomas,</b> benign pigmented maculas, cutaneous hornlike growths, exophytic and endophytic squamous cell car-cinomas of several cytologic types, and fibrosarcomas. Even with this high dose of UV radiation, not all of the small tumor...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is {{a disease}} of unknown {{etiology}} and pathogenesis. <b>Keratomas</b> grow slowly for years. Their number grows significantly with age in some patients, resulting in cosmetic defect, while separate elements remain in others not disturbing them subjectively. Details of the cell cycle destruction by the SK are not revealed despite a number of studies. It is controversial whether tumor suppressor protein p 16 influences growth {{and development of the}} tumor elements. Materials and Methods: An immunohistochemistry test with monoclonal antibodies to p 16 was accomplished, 20 SK served as a material for the test, which were obtained from patients with multiple SK – 10 people, and single SK (not more than 10 elements on the skin) – 10 people. Clinical examination of patients was being conducted, using data from the anamnesis of concomitant somatic pathology. Results: Intense cytoplasmic and nuclear staining of tumor cells was revealed by individuals with multiple SK in 70...|$|R

This thesis describes a study for the classification of skin abnormalities using oblique incident diffuse reflectance spectroscopy as part of the goal to provide a computer-assisted tool to dermatologists for lowering the number of benign biopsies. The first goal of this thesis was to improve the separability between the skin abnormalities. These skin abnormalities were divided by their melanocytic condition into two groups: (i) group 1 consisting of <b>keratomas</b> (benign), warts (benign), and carcinomas (malignant), and (ii) group 2 consisting of common nevi (benign), compound nevi (benign), junctional nevi (benign), against dysplastic nevi (pre-cancerous) and melanoma (cancerous). For each group a bootstrap based Bayes classifier was designed to separate benign from cancerous abnormalities. Genetic Algorithm was used to obtain the most effective set of image features for each classifier. A total of 584 images from 65 cases, 23 cases in group- 1 and 42 cases in group- 2, were used to train the classifiers. A blind study consisting of 222 images from 37 cases, 14 cases in group- 1 and 23 cases in group- 2 which were different from the ones used in the training part, was carried out to test the classifiers. The second goal of this thesis was to use the OIR data to compute the absorption spectra ([][]) and the reduced scattering spectra ([][]') and then use them to extract appropriate physiological parameters. This study was meant to provide an understanding of the physiological origins associated with different types of abnormalities...|$|R
50|$|The use of maggots {{to clean}} dead tissue from animal wounds {{is part of}} folk {{medicine}} {{in many parts of}} the world. It is particularly helpful with chronic osteomyelitis, chronic ulcers, and other pus-producing infections that are frequently caused by chafing due to work equipment. Maggot therapy for horses in the United States was re-introduced after a study published in 2003 by veterinarian Dr. Scott Morrison. This therapy is used in horses for conditions such as osteomyelitis secondary to laminitis, sub-solar abscesses leading to osteomyelitis, post-surgical treatment of street-nail procedure for puncture wounds infecting the navicular bursa, canker, non-healing ulcers on the frog, and post-surgical site cleaning for <b>keratoma</b> removal.|$|E
5000|$|Hoglan and Popson met back in 2004 while Jason {{was selling}} T-shirts for Meshuggah {{while they were}} on tour with Strapping Young Lad. Popson was {{taking a break from}} touring with Mushroomhead where he was known as J-Mann. He never {{mentioned}} that he was Mushroomhead’s frontman and it wasn't until late in the tour that Hoglan found out. Originally, the group was intended to be similar to Probot with Popson as the vocalist and a revolving door of guitarists and drummers. When Popson was finally ready to record, though, the only one who was not busy was Hoglan. In January 2007, Hoglan flew to Ohio and he and Popson wrote and recorded Absentee in 10 days. Guitarist Rob Reinard (NDE) was brought in by studio engineer Bill Korecky. Bassist Craig Martini was also brought in for the band. Popson and Martini are longtime friends and have performed in bands in the past, including Unified Culture, State of Conviction and The Alter Boys. Shortly after finishing recording [...] "Absentee" [...] Martini left the band in good terms, relocating to Nevada and was replaced by Steve Rauckhorst, who Popson had previously known from the Cleveland scene and his time in Integrity. They played their first show in nearly six months at Peabody's in Cleveland. On May 5, 2011, Pitch Black Forecast announced Tom Shaffner of <b>Keratoma</b> fame would be their new second guitarist. The band's name was originally [...] "Absentee" [...] before switching it to Pitch Black Forecast and using the former as the name of the first album. The first track that was record, which Popson titled [...] "Revolve" [...] and included on his Melvins Tribute album, We Reach: The Music of the Melvins, was released Popson's record label Fractured Transmitter.|$|E
40|$|This {{case report}} shows that keratomas {{can occur in}} both hind feet of equine {{patients}} and {{should be considered as}} a diagnosis for long-standing, intermittent lameness localised to the hooves. A Thoroughbred racehorse presented with long-standing abscessation of the right hind hoof. Owing to the long-standing nature, the abscess draining tract was surgically explored. A focal mass was found within the solar horn. Histopathology revealed the mass to be a <b>keratoma.</b> A similar mass was removed from the left hind hoof a few months later after similar presenting signs. This case shows that keratomas can occur in more than one hoof within a short period and should be considered a differential diagnosis for long-standing lameness localised to the hoof...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of damages inside the equine hoof capsule, such as <b>keratomas,</b> cracks and infections is sometimes hard with the methods available today. A non-invasive technique that {{aids in the}} search for these conditions would be of great help in order to find these conditions without causing unnecessary damage to the horse. This study investigates a possible application for an already existing thermal transport measurement technique known as the Hot Disk Method. In this technique, a spiral shaped sensor is pressed against the surface of the material while heated by an electrical current. By measuring the resulting temperature change in the sensor, information on the underlying material’s thermal properties can be obtained. The method is quick, compact and non-invasive since the total temperature increase is limited to a maximum of 5 K. Furthermore, the technique has shown capability of detecting structural changes within a material by probing the variation of thermal conductivity perpendicular to the sensor surface. Previously, tests have been conducted on conserved horse hooves where the layered structure of the hoof is detectable. This study focuses on gathering data from live, healthy horses without any known hoof conditions in order to start building up a database of information. It is a crucial step towards the development of a possible new tool which could become an aid in the work of veterinarians and farriers in the future. Short tests to obtain information about the thermal properties of the hooves are conducted, as well as longer tests to probe the conductivity variation to see whether structural difference is also detectable in live horse hooves. Furthermore, some short measurements are conducted on conserved hooves in a controlled laboratory environment for comparison. In addition, a COMSOL model of a horse hoof is constructed, with a heat source corresponding to the Hot Disk sensor, for numerical simulation of the conductivity vs. probing depth measurements...|$|R
40|$|Six out {{of eight}} {{epidermal}} papillomas, induced with tar in mice of homogeneous strain, have grown after {{transfer to the}} subcutaneous tissue of sucklings and weanlings. Five {{of them have been}} thus maintained for nearly or quite a year and a half, and in seven to nine successive groups of mice. The tumor studied longest has been kept going in five parallel lines since its primary implantation. The papillomas have all grown progressively in most instances, and proved fatal. None has altered except through the occurrence of derivative cancers, but these have arisen so often as only to be excluded on transfer by a rigorous selection of grafts. Histologically the papillomas have been of a single, completely unaggressive kind, yet transfer has disclosed great differences in their abilities. The tumors they form are of unique sorts. The cells of some are able-bodied (Type A), capable of spreading along bare connective tissue and keratinizing like normal, reparative epidermis. They line graft pockets, differentiate into the free space these provide, and form cysts densely packed with keratin. The papilloma is thus turned outside in. The cysts become huge as keratin accumulates in them, and eventually they rupture with result either in subcutaneous dissecting cysts or keratinizing surface growths that are often prodigious in size and fantastic in shape, but sometimes are completely like the cutaneous papillomas ordinarily induced by carcinogens, and tend, when small, to regress or come away as these frequently do. One growth of Type A was placed in the peritoneal cavity or in the liver, spleen or lung, and at all these situations it formed introverted cysts resembling the subcutaneous. The cells of other papillomas are more or less crippled (Type C). In extreme instances they are unable to spread laterally, and produce relatively little keratin. They fail to line graft pockets, but their keratin inflames the exposed connective tissue, extravasation ensues, and a continually enlarging, fluid-filled cyst forms, with walls that are bare except where a stalked or cauliflower papilloma exists, projecting inwards. At last the cyst ruptures and a second dissecting cyst forms, also devoid of papilloma tissue; or else the overlying skin undergoes pressure necrosis, the cyst fluid escapes through a rent, and fatal infection ensues. All gradations exist between Type A and Type C. The cancers derivative from both exhibit a marked disability,—though invasive they are almost or quite unable to extend along bare connective tissue. The papillomas that are possessed of this faculty spread beyond them along the cyst wall, and kill the host through their unceasing activity. In collateral work a papilloma was transplanted that was found protruding from the external auditory canal of a mouse which had received an intramuscular injection of methylcholanthrene many months previously. The tumor is now in its 5 th generation, after 15 months. The growths it forms are of Type A. All of the papillomas are functioning tumors, with their own cells as the functioning product. Their papilliferous shape, when on the skin, is due solely to inability of their cells to gain space in other ways. Intrinsically they are <b>keratomas.</b> The papillomas do well after transfer to deep situations because the growth of their cells is indirectly promoted, through favoring local conditions. No direct promotion takes place like that when the cells of prostatic and mammary tumors are stimulated to multiply by hormones. Doubtless many agents act in both ways, that is to say by dual promotion...|$|R
40|$|True cholesteatomas {{developing}} medial to {{the labyrinth}} and facial nerve with extension into the petrous apex are uncommon lesions.

Advantages, disadvantages, and complications of both methods are presented and guidelines for selecting a particular approach are suggested...|$|E
40|$|SQUAMOUS cell {{carcinoma}} is a malignant neoplasm reported in {{many species of}} birds, whereas avian keratoacan-thoma (or <b>keratoma)</b> is a benign follicular tumour, synonym-ous in poultry with dermal squamous {{cell carcinoma}} (Reavill and Schmidt 2000). This latter condition is reported to occur only in young domestic fowl (Gallus gallus formadomestica), and affects only the dermis, with no metastasis (Hafner and Goodwin 1997). The mechanism of metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma in birds has not been elucidated, particularly because most species lack lymph nodes. Domestic fowl are the species most commonly diagnosed with either of these conditions (Weinstock and others 1995), but several species of psittacine birds have also {{been reported to be}} affected by squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour has been described at numerous sites on budgerigars (Melo...|$|E
40|$|Background: Carvajal {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive disorder, manifesting with dilated cardiomyopathy, woolly hair, and palmoplantar <b>keratoma.</b> Additional manifestations can be occasionally found. Carvajal syndrome {{may be due}} to mutations in the desmocollin- 2, desmoplakin, or plakophilin- 2 gene. Methods and results: We report a family with Carvajal syndrome which additionally presented with hypoacusis, noncompaction, recurrent pharyngeal infections, oligodontia, and recurrent diarrhoea. Father and brother were also affected and had died suddenly, the father despite implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Genetic studies revealed the novel pathogenic mutation c. 1678 A > T in the desmoplakin gene resulting in the amino acid change Ile to Phe at position 560 in the index case and her brother. The index case underwent ICD implantation recently. Conclusion: Phenotypic manifestations of Carvajal syndrome are even broader than so far anticipated, the number of mutations in the desmoplakin gene responsible for Carvajal {{syndrome is}} still increasing, and these patients require implantation of an ICD as soon as their diagnosis is established...|$|E
40|$|An eight {{year old}} quarterhorse gelding used mostly for weekend {{pleasure}} riding {{was presented to}} the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine with chief complaints of intermittent left forelimb lameness, a deformity in the hoof wall of the left fore and a swelling at the coronet of the left fore. The left forelimb lameness and hoof wall deformity were first detected by the owner 1. 5 years ago. Examination by a local veterinarian which included radiographs failed to determine the cause of the lameness and hoof wall deformity. Approximately two months prior to presentation the owner detected a swelling at the coronet just proximal to the hoof wall deformity. This swelling seemed to rapidly increase in size during the two month period prior to presentation. Lameness examination and radiographic examination at the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine lead to the presumptive diagnosis of mass lesion in the left front foot. The mass was removed via partial hoof wall resection. A definitive diagnosis of <b>keratoma</b> was made based upon the results of histopathological examination. The clinical aspects of keratomas including diagnosis, surgical removal and aftercare will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION A cholesteatoma (sometimes {{called a}} <b>keratoma)</b> is an {{abnormal}} growth of squamous epithelium {{in the middle}} ear and mastoid. 1 It may progressively enlarge to surround and destroy the ossicles, resulting in conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss also may occur if the cholesteatoma obstructs the eustachian tube orifice, leading to middle ear effusion. Surgical therapy is required for most cholesteatomas. The extent and effectiveness of surgery depends upon {{the size of the}} cholesteatoma. Early diagnosis is crucial to an optimal outcome In children this disease is more aggressive and complex and leads to many complications and the treatment is mostly surgical. 2 This study is chosen because the incidence of recurrence and residual disease is higher in children and its management is very challenging. OBJECTIVE To study the clinical features, disease process. spread and management of cholesteatoma in paediatric age group (less than 16 years). MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective study was conducted at Govt. ENT Hospital over a period of two years that included 50 cases of cholesteatoma in paediatric age group. RESULTS Surgical treatment by Mastoidectomy was done in all cases. Out of 50 cases after surgery 33 patients had dry ear and improvement in hearing 7 patients had recurrence of disease 8 patients had cavity problems like discharge from the ear and 2 patients developed neurological complications. CONCLUSION Childhood cholesteatoma has an aggressive nature with tendency for complications hence its treatment is very challenging. Eradication of disease and restoration of hearing should be the primary goal of treatment. Long term follow up is important to monitor the disease recurrence. ...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{awareness}} among dermatologists {{as well as}} {{the development}} of dermoscopy and sequential dermoscopy have contributed significantly toward an increase in the diagnostic accuracy of pigmented melanoma and even of amelanotic melanoma. However, the dermatologist's nightmare is the small group of melanomas that present as common skin diseases, often associated with a significant delay in diagnosis and hence a poor prognosis. The study was carried out to prospectively assess the number of melanomas lacking any clinical suspicion of melanoma and to describe their clinical and histological features over a 6 -year observation period in an University Tertiary Skin Cancer Center. Out of 502 cases of newly diagnosed cases of melanoma, seven (1. 4 %) nonpigmented and nonamelanotic cases of melanoma were identified. The mean age of the patients was 69 years (two females/five males). All cases were discovered by chance on a punch biopsy. The clinical diagnostic suspicions were basal cell carcinoma, fungal intertrigo, keratoacanthoma, lichenoid <b>keratoma,</b> diabetic foot ulcer, eczema, and necrotic pressure ulcer. Dermoscopy, performed after the punch biopsies, was only partially contributive. The mean histological thickness was 2. 7 [*]mm, the mean number of mitoses was 7 /mm, local micrometastases were present in 5 / 7 (71 %), the mean Ki 67 count was 18. 9 %, and a positive sentinel lymph node was observed in 4 / 6 (66 %) cases. Nonpigmented and nonamelanotic melanomas are rare, are at high risk, and have a poor prognosis because of a delayed diagnosis. Dermoscopy is only of partial diagnostic aid. Treatment resistance or atypical behavior of the above-mentioned lesions should lead to biopsy. Peer reviewe...|$|E
