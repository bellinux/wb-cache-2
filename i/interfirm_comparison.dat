The first part is an extensive literature review regarding the conventional <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparison</b> (IFC) scheme accepted widely in many countries outside the United States. Then, the conceptual framework is laid for the development of methodologies of the productivity <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparison,</b> which are amenable to measurement, evaluation, and planning phases of the productivity cycle of each participating firm. The following relationships are realized {{in the process of developing}} the underlying methodologies: 1. Mathematical relationships between productivity and other significant ratios which represent static properties of the production system of the industry concerned. 2. Causal relationships between productivity and other significant ratios which represent dynamic properties of the system. A pyramid productivity ratio structure is developed for the measurement of important factors of the production system utilizing the mathematical relationships. Then, a systematic interfirm evaluation procedure is designed, utilizing both mathematical and causal relationships, to provide a means to identify areas of weak productivity performance for individual firms. Finally, causal relationships are utilized to construct a multiple regression model to derive analytic information that identifies the most influential factors for achieving productivity improvement. These tools can help individual firms understand the interplay of interfirm factors in a production system, and to gain insights regarding viable management actions to achieve productivity improvement. These methodologies are demonstrated by application to a productivity-oriented <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparison</b> program conducted by the Northwest Food Processors Association. Although many practical restrictions existed in the course of the application, the outcome indicates the applicability of the methodologies to the program, and suggests further benefits when applied with more data availability. In light of the potential benefits expected, the following areas are particularly recommended for further research. 1. Development of a pyramid productivity ratio structure for a specific PIC scheme, which is amenable to the general pyramid model, and techniques to persuade potential participants to implement it. 2. Development of techniques to enhance the statistical reliability of PIC methodologies in descriptive statistics and correlation/regression analyses...|$|E

The method is aimed at removing a number of disadvantages of the usual, ratio based methods of <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparison.</b> Models are specified for all major items of the income statement and balance sheet. The specification is partly based on financial and other theory, but also on practical experience in small business. Together, these models enable a fairly detailed and complete assessment of small business performance.

The development of <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparisons</b> in Britain, Australia, and Canada is discussed. <b>Interfirm</b> <b>comparisons</b> {{have also been}} conducted in the United States {{under the auspices of}} various trade associations. However, in the United States these comparisons are the exception and not the rule. Any nation needs to improve productivity if it is to become or remain competitive in the market place. Accurate measurement is a pre-condition for productivity improvement. This study establishes a measure that can be employed by small businesses to determine their own productivity standing. The Weighted Ratio Productivity Index (WRPI) is that measure, Research was conducted at Electro Scientific Industries (ESI), an electronics firm located in Portland, Oregon. A five year period of financial and production data (1976 - 1980) were collected and analyzed. The versatility of the Weighted Ratio Productivity Index is a tremendous benefit of its development. The WRPI can be modified to suit many types of industry. A benefit for ESI is the creation of the WRPI. Prior to this study a comprehensive method of productivity measurement did not exist in this company. The firm will use the method in this thesis for future productivity measurement. From this research a Total Productivity Index could be developed with the use of an aggregate weighted ratio productivity index similar to the WRPI.

Prequalification of too many bidders, although lowering client costs, increases risks and causes an excessive overhead on the bidding process. A method of assessing the relative cost and risk implications associated with individual bidders is proposed. This involves calculating the percentage that bids are above the lowest bid in previous auctions, termed C-competitiveness. It is argued that selecting only the lowest and most consistent C-competitive bidders for a proposed contract auction will reduce client costs, risks and bidding overheads. bidding competitiveness <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparisons</b> performance ratios prequalification risk...|$|R

However, in practice, the comparative evaluation and ranking of companies is usually based on the consideration of a single measure of corporate success. But the definition of the most appropriate measure gave rise to a considerable debate. This paper tries to utilise the results of a multicriteria analysis, applied to a large sample of Greek pharmaceutical industries, in order to indicate how suitable some common financial ratios are as indices of the firm's overall performance. The results show that profitability constitutes the most representative measure for the differentiation and ranking of companies. Labour productivity and market share are the best indicators of the business' success, while business' failure is more closely related to ratios indicating long- and short-term solvency. This means that a sound capital structure is a necessary but not a sufficient enough condition to ensure the profitable and effective operation of the firm. <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparisons</b> financial ratios ratio analysis multicriteria analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{globalization of}} markets witnessed {{in recent years}} has been paralleled by growing research attention upon the internationalization of small and medium sized firms. In industrialized nations, a significant degree of dormant export potential has been identified in this firm size sector. The proliferation of extant literature can explain structural, behavioural and process-based aspects of export expansion. However, it remains that limited conceptual and empirical insights exist that explain the phenomena underlying pre-export decision making and behaviour. The present inquiry addresses this issue and investigates those obstacles that act upon domestic firms' intentions to enter overseas markets via the export channel. Specifically, the empirical study documented here establishes significant differences in the extent to which exporting obstacles discourage export engagement amongst varied groups of domestic firms considered in terms of their export intention. It also draws a similar comparison between such groups of non-exporting firms and those already engaged in export operations. The findings are interpreted and discussed in the light of current knowledge and attention is paid towards pertinent implications for export management and future research. exports implementation <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparisons</b> internationalization marketing strategy...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Productivity <b>Interfirm</b> <b>Comparison</b> (PIC) is {{a simple}} method used to improve {{productivity}} at the firm level, where a number of firms operate in the same product line so that performance information on the firms can be compiled and compared.

The main point relates to the interpretation of variety in technology and behaviors and how it can be ascertained by looking essentially at empirical, quantitative differences in the real world. This basic idea is that in <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparisons,</b> some way has to be found of meaningfully separating the innovative variety of a more behavioral (strategic) nature, from more "structural" (permanent) differences due to different markets and selection contexts in which firms operate. Empirical evidence is provided in order to show that not all observable diversity in performances reflect behavioral differences. Often such differences reflect differences in some key dimensions related to the i) industries, ii) technologies and iii) environmental conditions which define different contexts of competition between firms. The main implication for empirical research is that in the analysis of innovation-performance relationships in inter- firm comparisons the notion of variety is useful {{only to the extent that}} there are defined criteria for the selection of the firms. This in turn requires the previous identification of: i) the key dimensions defining the boundaries to firm strategies, and consequently ii) the level of aggregation at which at inter-firm similarities and differences of more strategic-behavioral nature can emerge...|$|R

40|$| and, like {{physical}} sciences, {{to want to}} go {{from the}} particular to the general seems unfruitful. The dimensions of a decision in the firm being quite difficult to apprehend, it is necessary, in a first step, to go far above reality because decisions must help the firm to come nearer and nearer to the theoritical ideal. In a second step, the managers must turn to a model which considers at the same time theory and practice. NECESSITY FOR AN OPERATIONAL MODELThe more abstract is a theory, the better it explains the essential of a phenomena {{and on the other hand}} the less it explains the detail of it. That is at the same time its force and weakness. The traditional theory gives the managers the main guide lines but is not sufficient for their concrete decisions. It is often said that conventional marginalism, concerning the allocation of resources on a market, does not help much the managers in their decisions. Coase 7 states however that « the firm is the supersession of the price mechanism » and that « the main reason why it is profitable to establish a firm would seem to be that there is a cost of using the price mechanism ». On the other hand, Peter Drucker 8 defines the main challenge of the entrepreneur as being the discovery of new possibilities. We could also state many other opinions all more or less different as the other. Admitting that the manager partially substituted the market as the key element, following the idea of Cleland, it is not allowed to go from one extreme to the other and deny that the market forces influence sometimes very much the decisions of the firms which, after all, buy the factors of production and also sell their products on the market. But fundamentally such a discussion on the exact relative importance of the market and of the manager leads nowhere since everybody recognizes decision making as the main function of the manager, and decision implies freedom of action i. e. the choice of an alternative among many. It is sure that this liberty is active within the limits determinated by the market. For example, the price of a certain hour of work goes from $ 2. 00 to $ 3. 00. That is why the manager must know the price mechanism. He must thus know that an increase in the price of a product leads to a fall in its demand. Therefore the manager needs to know how the allocation of resources on the market is done. He also needs an operational model which can be drawn from theoritical teachings but which sticks to the managerial reality and more particularly to the decision making process. ESSAY OF DEFINITIONIt is now possible to formulate a tentative definition of managerial economies: a model of optimal choice among the alternatives considered by the managers and evaluated in terms of the objective that they themselves define. The attempt may seem ventured at a time when nobody has yet defined managerial economies. This is unfortunate and perhaps explains greatly the confusion which presently exists in this field. In fact it is almost impossible to find two books dealing with the subject and using the same terms of reference. On the one hand, one will find works presenting popularization of the traditional theory, while on the other hand some authors explain techniques and methods in one or more specific areas of management. The model is an attempt to represent the links between the activities and the objective of a firm. It simplifies complex operations thus facilating its management by establishing the main significant relations. Everybody considers the decision process as being the main function of an executive. Moreover, managers must optimize their choice i. e. choose the best alternatives conducive to the achievement of the objective previously defined. Considering the fact that managers do not have perfect knowledge, it is impossible for them to inventory all the alternatives. They will rather study a few of them which seem to be the most promising. They must also evaluate the effects of the alternatives kept for study in order to facilitate the choice of the best one. It is in their interest to quantify each outcome the best they can. For planning and control to be efficient, they must compare the forecasted outcomes of a decision with its actual results: this method is called management by results. For sure the evaluation of the latter may present as many difficulties as the former. But at least the effort of evaluation leads the managers to a better preparation of their decisions, thus contributing to their improvement. Finally, the proposed definition implies that it is the responsability of the manager to finally define the objective. However, if one assumes a rational behavior on the part of the manager, he is led to accept long-run maximization as the objective of the firm. MODEL FOR IMPROVING DECISIONSSo far, it has been argued that the traditional theory offered the manager a weak help but a necessary one for their decisions, thus showing its limited validity in managerial economies. The necessity of an operational model that can be useful to the managers was also pointed out. The model for improving decisions must now be explained. Fortunately, what has been said earlier probably foresees the essential. In fact, faced with the great complexity of management, one must give up the direct application of the theory as such; but one notes at the same time the necessity of following its main guide-lines. One must therefore pass suitably from theory to practice. Nemmers 9 writes « that the typical college graduate with major in economics is, unfortunately, ill-equipped to go into business after graduation ». He proposes precisely the teaching of managerial economies which would serve as a bridge between theory and practice. Unfortunately this bridge does not exist. That is what Scitovsky 10 deplored when he spoke of the « unbridged gulf » twenty five years ago. One could probably explain its absence by the difficulty to use theory which finally leads to a set of qualitative propositions not quantifiable. The qualitative aspect of theory was mentioned in the preceding pages. What shall be done then? The manager cannot act only by intuition or with confidence to the traditional analysis. The only way to get out of the deadlock is to settle the question a little to the manner of the Gordian knot. We thus find afterwards on one side the qualitative propositions of the theory and on the other side the complex decision making process involved in the task of managing. An adequate model must fulfill in the best manner possible two fundamental requirements: to conform to theory and stick to reality. Everyone recognizes the complex, aleatory and generally uncertain character of firm management. One will never be able to apprehend all the dimensions of a decision neither will be able to predict the future so to speak. Therefore we must turn to a model which offers some chances of improving decisions. We could explain it by refering on the one hand to the definition of the firm or managers' objective and on the other hand to the evaluation of alternatives to choose in the search for the objective defined by the managers. Definition of the ObjectiveThe traditional theory only sets forth the purpose of profit maximization, obtained by equating marginal cost and marginal revenue, supposing the perfect rationality of the entrepreneur-owner. The profit could thus be maximized in a theoretical sense only if the entrepreneur fully desires it and if he possesses a complete information of all the alternatives in terms of the profit objective. Hence everybody denies the possibility of profit maximization. Many authors proposed other particular purposes aimed at by the firm such as the maximization of the sales volume or the share of the market, the satisfying profit; the firms give an increasing importance to human relations and assign large sums of money to valorize their image in the public; above all, they want to survive and maximize utility. In such a case, it is necessary to suppose, on one hand, a certain willingness on the part of the managers to act rationnally thus striving for profit maximization in the theoritical sense and, on another hand, to accept that the practice of management inevitably keeps managers away from the theoritical ideal. This process allows one to suppose that managers search for maximum profit on the long period taking into account a long series of constraints such as the survival of the firm, the share of the market, the sales volume, the variety of products, research and development, human and public relations, etc [...] However, it seems quite difficult to define profit in a way that it could be properly measured. The accounting concept is one of the best known and the most used especially because of its possibility to measure profit objectively against rules which are conveniently applied to the exploitation of a firm. The economic concept has a much more superior significance but its use is difficult and very precarious when <b>interfirm</b> <b>comparisons</b> are made because of the strongly subjective content of its measure. It seems however necessary to keep the economic concept in mind in managerial economies. First, let us say that a workable definition is in order: the increase (or loss) of the present value of future receipts during a given period represents the economic profit (or decrease) of a firm. We meet here just about the same problem as the one found when figuring out the profitability of investments. We finally get to the same idea of Peter Drucker 11 i. e. that the major challenge for the entrepreneur consists in finding and using new possibilities. In fact it is a matter of deciding to invest once and for all. But the profitability of a firm can change with time. The calculation of this profitability gives at the same time the measure of the economic profit and of the success of managers to innovate. Concerning the length of the period, it depends mainly upon the capacity of forecasting. Certain firms can trust certain predictions of five years, others of seven years and others of ten years. For example, we agree on the fact that managers plan more precisely, with greater confidence and on a longer period the needs of floor area then the sales of a particular product. On the same manner it is surely easier to estimate the demand for newspaper than for women's hat. In fact it does not seem rational for the manager to pursue another profit objective than a maximum one over a long period. Any other concept does not tend toward the optimization of decisions for there exists then an area of indetermination in the choices. So, to fix as objective a satisfying profit has two meanings: either one acts irrationnally in rejecting the best alternative in terms of profit, ceteris paribus; or one makes the optimal choice in terms of the most satisfying profit, given the limited information available. In this latter sense, the satisfying profit is the same thing as the maximum profit hereby proposed. In other words, the satisfiers' school speaks of satisfying profit when considering the impossibility of maximizing profit in the theoretical sense i. e. the impossibility to be aware of all the alternatives and to evaluate them in terms of the final objective. In addition to this, it is often said that optimal decisions are made in terms of two objectives, the short and the long period for example. However, when one wants to classify a group of objects, he would use only one criterion; also he should do the same thing when measuring an alternative against an objective. In the logics of managing which implies foreseeing in the long run, it seems to be impossible to speak of short-run objective which in this case, appears more like a budgetary forecast. To say that a sales volume is determined for the following year in a given amount can not be construe...|$|R
