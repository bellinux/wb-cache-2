60|$|Laverick {{took the}} bottle from the <b>ice-pail</b> by his side, but the sommelier darted forward and served them.|$|E
60|$|The room got hotter and the cigar-smoke was thick. Sometimes Stannard {{went to the}} <b>ice-pail</b> {{and mixed}} a cooling drink. Jimmy meant to use caution, but his luck had turned, and {{excitement}} parched his mouth. By and by Stannard, who was dealing, stopped.|$|E
60|$|At midnight the supper-rooms {{were thrown}} open and we formed into little parties of six, each having a table, nobly served with plate, a lackey in attendance, and a gratifying <b>ice-pail</b> {{or two of}} {{champagne}} to egayer the supper. It was no small cost to serve five hundred people on silver, and the repast was certainly a princely and magnificent one.|$|E
6000|$|... "The old rogue, {{where does}} he expect to go to? It came from the public-house," [...] Wagg said. [...] "It {{requires}} two men to carry off that sherry, 'tis so uncommonly strong. I wish I had a bottle of old Steyne's wine here, Pendennis: your uncle and I have had many a one. He sends it about to people where {{he is in the}} habit of dining. I remember at poor Rawdon Crawley's, Sir Pitt Crawley's brother--he was Governor of Coventry Island--Steyne's chef always came in the morning, and the butler arrived wit the champagne from Gaunt House, in the <b>ice-pails</b> ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood at}} the {{sideboard}} in a white waistcoat with large gold and onyx buttons, watching his valet screw the necks of three champagne bottles deeper into <b>ice-pails.</b> Between the points of his stand-up collar, which--though it hurt him to move--he would on no account have had altered, the pale flesh of his under chin remained immovable. His eyes roved from bottle to bottle. He was debating, and he argued like this: Jolyon drinks a glass, perhaps two, he's so careful of himself. James, he can't take his wine nowadays. Nicholas--Fanny and he would swill water he shouldn't wonder! Soames didn't count; these young nephews--Soames was thirty-one--couldn't drink! But Bosinney? ...|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps, after all,--who knows?--Veneering {{may find}} this dining, though expensive, remunerative, {{in the sense}} that it makes champions. Mr Podsnap, as a {{representative}} man, is not alone in caring very particularly for his own dignity, if not for that of his acquaintances, and therefore in angrily supporting the acquaintances who have taken out his Permit, lest, in their being lessened, he should be. The gold and silver camels, and the <b>ice-pails,</b> and the rest of the Veneering table decorations, make a brilliant show, and when I, Podsnap, casually remark elsewhere that I dined last Monday with a gorgeous caravan of camels, I find it personally offensive to have it hinted to me that they are broken-kneed camels, or camels labouring under suspicion of any sort. 'I don't display camels myself, I am above them: I am a more solid man; but these camels have basked in the light of my countenance, and how dare you, sir, insinuate to me that I have irradiated any but unimpeachable camels?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a gala {{night with}} me," [...] John replied, his tone raised {{no more than}} usual, but shaking with some new quality. [...] "Drink {{a glass of wine}} with me, prince," [...] he invited, taking the bottle from the <b>ice-pail</b> and filling a tumbler upon the table. [...] "Wish me luck, won't you? I am engaged to be married!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some more ice, Clem,' said Wilmet; but Clement {{looked up}} from the <b>ice-pail</b> in despair, for all was melted; and she could only steep {{handkerchiefs}} in the water and in eau-de-cologne, and lay them on the head, while Clement wondered if he could find a shop; but where was the use at three in the morning? and poor Lance rolled round wearily, sighing, 'Oh, I did not know one's head could ache so!' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{turned from}} the path on to another strip of lawn, which they gained by {{rounding}} a large lilac bush. Here a small table was laid with the whitest of cloths and the most dazzling of silver. An attentive waiter was already arranging an <b>ice-pail</b> in a convenient spot. From here the gardens sloped gently to the river, which was barely forty yards distant. Although it was scarcely twilight, {{the men on the}} gondola were lighting the lamps.|$|E
60|$|Another {{objectionable}} circumstance is, {{that the}} pokey unknowns {{support each other}} in being unimpressible. They persist in not being frightened by the gold and silver camels, and they are banded together to defy the elaborately chased <b>ice-pails.</b> They even seem to unite in some vague utterance of the sentiment that the landlord and landlady will make a pretty good profit out of this, and they almost carry themselves like customers. Nor is there compensating influence in the adorable bridesmaids; for, having very {{little interest in the}} bride, and none at all in one another, those lovely beings become, each one of her own account, depreciatingly contemplative of the millinery present; while the bridegroom's man, exhausted, {{in the back of his}} chair, appears to be improving the occasion by penitentially contemplating all the wrong he has ever done; the difference between him and his friend Eugene, being, that the latter, in the back of HIS chair, appears to be contemplating all the wrong he would like to do--particularly to the present company.|$|R
60|$|They {{were both}} seated on low folding-chairs {{out on the}} open moorland, {{only a few yards}} away {{from the edge of the}} rugged line of cliffs against which, many {{hundreds}} of feet below, the sea was breaking with a low monotonous murmur. Close behind them, on a level stretch of springy turf, a roughly improvised table, covered with a cloth of dazzling whiteness, was laden with deep bowls of lobster salad, p√¢tes de foie gras, chickens, truffled turkeys, piles of hothouse fruit, and many other delicacies peculiarly appreciated at al fresco symposia; and, a little further away still, under the shade of a huge yellow gorse bush, were several <b>ice-pails,</b> in which were reposing many rows of gold-foiled bottles. The warm sun was just sufficiently tempered by a mild heather-scented breeze, and though it flashed gayly upon the glass and silver, and danced across the bosom of the blue water below, its heat was more pleasant than oppressive. The two women who sat there looked delightfully cool. Helen Thurwell especially, in her white holland gown, with a great bunch of heather stuck in her belt, and a faint healthy glow in her cheeks, looked as only an English country girl of good birth can look--the very personification of dainty freshness.|$|R
6000|$|Supper-time in a {{small room}} at [...] "The Gascony" [...] on Derby Day. [...] Through the windows of a broad corridor, out of which the door [...] opens, is seen the dark blue of a summer night. The walls are [...] of apricot-gold; the carpets, curtains, lamp-shades, and gilded [...] chairs, of red; the wood-work and screens white; the palms in [...] gilded tubs. A doorway that has no door leads to another small [...] room. One little table behind a screen, and one little table in [...] the open, are set for two persons each. On a service-table, [...] above which hangs a speaking-tube, are some dishes of hors [...] d'ouvres, a basket of peaches, two bottles of {{champagne}} in [...] <b>ice-pails,</b> and a small barrel of oysters in a gilded tub. ARNAUD, [...] the waiter, slim, dark, quick, his face seamed with a quiet, [...] soft irony, is opening oysters and listening to the robust joy [...] of a distant supper-party, where a man is playing the last bars [...] of: [...] "Do ye ken John Peel" [...] on a horn. As the sound dies away, he [...] murmurs: [...] "Tres Joli!" [...] and opens another oyster. Two Ladies with [...] bare shoulders and large hats pass down the corridor. Their [...] talk is faintly wafted in: [...] "Well, I never like Derby night! The [...] boys do get so bobbish!" [...] "That horn--vulgar, I call it!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was five}} minutes to eight, and dinner had been laid at a little round table {{in the center of}} the room. There was a bowl of pink roses--Sophy's {{favorite}} flower--sent in from the florist's; the table was lighted by a pink-shaded lamp. John went around the room, turning out the other lights, until the apartment was hung with shadows save for the little spot of color in the middle. An unopened bottle of champagne stood in an <b>ice-pail,</b> and two specially prepared cocktails had been placed upon the little side-table. There were no more preparations to be made.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have tasted {{insects in}} South America which were delicious," [...] Selingman assured them. [...] "There--leave your parasol over the salad, and, Maraton, move the <b>ice-pail</b> {{a little more}} into the shade. Now, while they set the luncheon, we will walk in that little flower garden, and I will tell you, if you like, a story of mine I once wrote, {{the story of two}} roses. I {{published}} it, alas! It is so hard to save even our most beautiful thoughts from the vulgarity of print, in these days where everything--love and wine, and even the roses themselves--cost money. Bah!" ...|$|E
