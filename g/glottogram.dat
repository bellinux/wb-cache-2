40|$|In {{contrast}} with the traditional dialect atlas, the <b>glottogram</b> simultaneously displays geographical differences and age differences in language usage. 1 There are two techniques for ascertaining the absolute chronology of linguistic change: real time and apparent time techniques. The typical technique for the apparent time is the comparison of two dialect maps of different age groups. There is another technique for considering geographical and age differences at the same time. This technique, called the “glottogram”, has the merit of offering clues for the speed of diffusion. In this paper, several examples of dialect maps and glottograms showing speed of diffusion will be observed. The speed of diffusion within one community may be somewhat more than three generations or around 100 years. In {{the same period of}} one century, the changes typically proceed 100 km from the community...|$|E
40|$|<b>Glottogram</b> is {{the term}} for a graph which crosses speakers’ ages with {{geographical}} factors. Glottograms were conceived and developed {{in the realm of}} Japanese geolinguistics. The first collection of multiple glottograms appeared in the 1980 s. By the 1990 s, there was {{a significant increase in the}} production of glottograms for various regions of Japan. Glottograms can show us the dynamics of language contact and language change, in great detail. Although in Germany generational differences in dialects have been presented in map form, in general the concept of a “location X age” graph does not exist in the West. In fact, in the West little value seems to be placed on Japanese glottograms. But it was out of dissatisfaction with the limitation of maps only being able to represent data on a plane,that glottograms were conceived of in the first place, and this led to their use as a supplementary tool to maps, and as a model for construction theories...|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of}} so-called distorted tones, {{commonly used in}} singing rock music, are analysed in one experiment. The results revealed that dist tones contain aperiodicity. SPL @ 0. 3 m varied between 90 and 96 dB, produced by a subglottal pressure {{in the range of}} 20 to 43 cm H 2 O, approximately. A doubling of subglottal pressure yielded, on average, an SPL increase of 2. 3 dB. In another experiment, the associated vocal fold vibration patterns were recorded by digital high-speed imaging. Inverse filtering of the simultaneously recorded audio signal showed that the aperiodicity was caused by a low frequency modulation of the flow <b>glottogram</b> pulse amplitude. This modulation was produced by an aperiodic or periodic vibration of the supraglottic mucosa. This vibration reduced the pulse amplitude by obstructing the airway for some of the pulses produced by the periodically vibrating vocal folds. The supraglottic mucosa vibration can be assumed to be driven by the high airflow produced by the elevated subglottal pressure...|$|E
40|$|Gender {{difference}} in dialect and standard language used in Shiga prefecture, near Kyoto, is clarified. <b>Glottograms</b> are used. Research analysis outcome indicates that senior and middle aged women use relatively courteous language, {{that men have}} a high regional dialect utilization rate, that the younger generation is the less obvious gender difference becomes, {{and that there is}} a trend towards simplification. A new sense of dialect is evident among the younger generations...|$|R
40|$|A {{new high}} speed system for recording, processing, and {{analysis}} of vocal fold vibrations has been developed. Results obtained with this system will be discussed from the technical {{as well as the}} medical viewpoint. By using a digital high speed camera, the laryngeal movement can be recorded with a maximum speed of about 5600 frames per second and a sequence length of up to 8192 single frames. For examination purposes the recorded sequences can be viewed bidirectionally in different slow motion rates. An application-specific written adaptive semi automatic motion analysis software is used to calculate and plot the <b>glottograms</b> for selected points on each vocal cord. From the obtained data, statistical measures like speed, acceleration rates, the fundamental frequency, amplitudes and perturbation parameters can be calculated. Based on the digital films, motion plots and characteristic statistics, this approach of laryngeal examination is a practicable method which supports the possibilitie s of quantitative and graphical analysis of the moving vocal folds and overcomes the disadvantages of the presently common examination methods...|$|R
