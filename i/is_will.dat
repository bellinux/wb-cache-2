In July 2012, Lynsey is strangled by an unseen person in similar circumstances to Silas' victims. When Silas demands to see Texas in relation to possible information on Lynsey's murder, Texas visits him {{in the mental health}} institution where he is serving his sentences. Silas taunts Texas by explaining how he killed her sister India. He tells Texas that another young woman will die the following day. Texas visits him again a few days later, and tells Silas that she is no longer frightened of him. Silas warns her that another copycat killing will soon occur. He explains that to prevent this he will tell her the identity of the killer if she gives him India's ring. Texas agrees and he tells her that the killer <b>is</b> <b>Will</b> Savage (James Atherton). Texas snatches the ring back, angering Silas. When on a routine appointment at the hospital, Silas fakes a heart attack. He escapes and visits Lynsey's body in the mortuary. Silas sees an apparition of Lynsey who he compliments, telling her she played a good game. Lynsey taunts him saying his game is over as he did not get to what he most wanted as someone else killed her. Silas tells her his game is not over. Silas kidnaps Texas in her flat and leads Texas to believe he will kill her before telling her that he will bide his time and then kill her, this way she will be living in fear of him. Silas then boards a bus, full of young women who are going to a hen party.|$|E
25|$|Fiona {{stops by}} the pawn shop to see Gideon, now that Emma has regained her memories, where {{it turns out}} that Fiona had {{reclaimed}} Gideon's heart with Curse. Then, she uses him to recover her own wand, which she uses to decipher the mysterious writings that Henry had scribbled in the page. Fiona then reads the inscriptions, which details the birth of Light and Darkness, their battle throughout the ages waged via their emissaries, the deaths of the previous Saviors and their enemies at each others' hands, and how the Final Battle will begin after the Emma's birth. After Gideon leaves to find Emma, Gold arrives in the shop, but Fiona fails to trick Gold into thinking that she had only come for her watch. When Gold confronts Fiona about her plans, she tells her son that once the Final Battle is over, the Curse will be lifted and they can be a family again. She also tells Gold that after she destroys all Light Magic, she will have so much power that she will be able to break the Laws of Magic at will, and she will even be able to bring back the dead. She tells him that she can bring back his first-born son, Baelfire, for him. She {{goes on to say that}} with her new powers, she will be able to make his family love him as the Dark One, so that he can keep his power. However, Gold knows that <b>is</b> <b>will</b> come with a steep price and tells her that he refuses to pay the price of magic anymore slipping Fiona's wand into his hand. He forces her onto the ground with magic vowing to make her pay for what she did to Belle. Fiona tells Gold that she had deciphered Henry's writing. She learned that Darkness cannot destroy Light since Darkness isn't strong enough. However, Light can destroy Light. She explains she gave Gideon one final command; to kill Emma, and that even if she dies, Gideon will still be forced to carry out her command. Gold decides to test this and kills Fiona with her own wand, breaking the Dark Curse. This causes Snow, David, Regina, Hook, and Zelena to be transported back to Storybrooke from the Enchanted Forest while Emma and the other residents of Storybrooke regain their memories. Soon afterward Belle returns to Gold and comforts him over his actions, while Gideon arrives at the office with his own enchanted sword in hand. As expected, Gideon confronts Emma and is ready to face off against her.|$|E

We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay.
