5|$|As the 2000s progressed, the Yankees' {{rivalry with}} the Boston Red Sox {{increased}} in intensity as the sides met multiple {{times in the}} American League Championship Series (ALCS), trading victories in 2003 and 2004. New York regularly reached the postseason, but were often defeated {{in the first two}} rounds. In 2009, the Yankees opened a new Yankee Stadium and won the World Series for the 27th time in team history, an MLB record. The furthest the Yankees <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> the postseason since then is the ALCS, in 2010, 2012, and 2017.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Dirty Dozen's uniqueness, {{however, the}} band's success {{inspired}} {{a resurgence of}} New Orleans' brass band music, both {{in the city and}} nationwide. The band was most influential in the 1980s, when they demonstrated by example that brass band music could be successful by moving beyond a type of music that risked stagnation as nothing more than a tourist attraction. Before the Dirty Dozen band was formed the Olympia Brass Band was already mixing R and jazz influences in with traditional tunes; the Dirty Dozen took this farther, and gave the trend worldwide visibility. Bands which followed in their wake did not all follow their more jazz oriented stage band approach—only the Soul Rebels <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> that direction—but a wide variety of bands, from the Rebirth Brass Band to Wisconsin's Youngblood Brass Band have been influenced by them in other ways. Rebirth has the most direct connection with the Dirty Dozen: they got their start playing at Daryl's when the Dirty Dozen was on the road.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "XO" [...] express a cheerful celebration {{of love and}} life as Beyoncé {{attempts}} [...] "to create light from darkness". It {{has been described as}} a universal love song which talks about different types of relationships. The singer lays emphasis on the importance of living the present with a person's loved one as life is unpredictable. She further sings about the tragedy and magnificence that life can hold. Throughout the song, the singer adopts a hopeful attitude and seems to <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> trance with love, a state which is further augmented by the fact that she employs a generally low register.

500|$|... "Irreplaceable JP" [...] {{was written}} for Chrisette Michele. Production team Stargate and singer-songwriter Ne-Yo had written for Beyoncé's second album B'Day, but Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said {{that they might not}} <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> the {{direction}} they did on the song. The tune did not suit Beyoncé's voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, although it was not based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the country style, thinking of country singers Shania Twain and Faith Hill during the sessions. When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a guitar, he thought it sounded like country music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an R vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R western music song instead.|$|E

On behalf of Rolling Stone, Daniel Kreps stated that [...] "Aguilera assumes no less than a dozen different guises, all scantily clad, ranging from carbon copies of Lady Gaga (borrowing heavily from her unique wardrobe), Madonna, Beyoncé, Gwen Stefani, the girls from Robert Palmer's [...] "Simply Irresistible" [...] video and Michelle Pfeiffer's S Catwoman from Batman Returns. Despite the video's attempt to shock, it's unlikely Aguilera will ever out-Gaga Gaga or out-controversy Madonna. ...

500|$|The second, more {{fundamental}} rift, concerned {{a discussion about}} whether NATO should form close relationships with countries far beyond NATO's borders, in particular Australia, Japan and South Korea. The United States and some other NATO members pressed for a closer relationship with these countries. R. Nicholas Burns, Under Secretary for Political Affairs explained the US proposal: [...] "We seek a partnership with them {{so that we can}} train more intensively (...) and grow closer to them because we are deployed with them. Australia, South Korea and Japan are in Afghanistan. They have all been in Iraq (...) [...] in the Balkans." [...] It was however not clear how far this plan would <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> practice, but the US insisted they were not seeking to turn NATO into a global alliance: membership would not be offered to the prospective new partners. The idea of a [...] "global" [...] NATO however was strongly opposed by France, which considers NATO a regional defence alliance that should not spread its wings too far over the globe. The French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie summarized the position of France as follows: [...] "The development of a global partnership could... dilute the natural solidarity between Europeans and North Americans in a fuzzy entity [...] send a bad political message, that of a campaign launched by the West against those who don't share their ideas. What a pretext we would offer to those who promote the idea of a clash of civilisations." [...] The summit did not reach a satisfying consensus on the future role of NATO and it was considered an exercise in [...] "papering over cracks", much more than it was ever a serious effort to decide on the future borders and core purposes. As a consequence the debate continued after the summit.|$|E

2500|$|While some {{winemaking}} techniques {{once considered}} fraudulent are now generally accepted, a few practices <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. One {{of the most}} controversial is adding water to wine in a technique known today as humidification. Master of wine Jancis Robinson calls the act of adding water to [...] "stretch out" [...] or dilute wine [...] "possibly the oldest form of wine fraud in the book." [...] There is a long history of adding water to dilute wine {{in order to make it}} more palatable. The ancient Greeks thought it was [...] "barbaric" [...] to drink undiluted wine. They further believed that undiluted wine was unhealthy and that the Spartan king Cleomenes I was once driven insane after drinking wine that was not diluted with water. Today, few consumers dilute their wine as the Greeks did, but the use of water during the winemaking process is still prevalent.|$|E

Writer Jane Espenson claims that the character was intended for viewers to have antipathy towards, since he was trying to undermine Giles.|$|E

2500|$|The years 560 and 561 {{correspond}} roughly to the annos Domini 1165 and 1166, {{but here}} Ibn Ṣāḥib {{is almost certainly}} off in his dating by a year. The events rather took place in 1164 and 1165. A later Portuguese chronicle, the Crónica dos Godos ("Chronicle of the Goths"), dates the conquest of Évora to the year 1204 of the Spanish era, that is, 1166. Trujillo was taken on 14 May 1164, or in June; Évora in September 1164; and Cáceres in December 1164 or, on a later dating, in September 1166. These were the major conquests. The lesser conquests of Montánchez, Serpa, and Juromenha took place in 1165, based on Ibn Ṣāḥib's scheme, but Montánchez and Serpa may <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> March 1167, as one historian has it. All the primary sources agree that Santa Cruz de la Sierra {{was the last of}} Gerald's successes, which may place it as late as 1169, though perhaps earlier (1167/8), along with Ureña. The conquest of these last two places left Gerald in a position to harass Beja. The date of the capture of Monfragüe, which was certainly one of his conquests, cannot be established.|$|E

[...] Battle submitted to the House: [...] "I cannot believe that those who owned and ran Roberts can <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> and out without seeing the dust everywhere on the surrounding streets and pavements. If they knew that their workers within had to be protected from the asbestos dust, how could they have ignored the position of their neighbours who lived with that dust outside?
