Although there <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three kombatants' having to face their deepest fears to prevail, the action is so frenetic and the dialogue so minimal that the allegory is weightless." [...] Roger Ebert said he was [...] "right in the middle" [...] and noted that the fans might be disappointed by the film's killings being much less brutal than the notoriously violent Mortal Kombat video games. Similar to Ebert, Marc Savlov from The Austin Chronicle mentioned that [...] " [...] It's the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy and Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, but you may recall, you loved that stuff as a kid. I know I did" [...] giving it a 2.5/5 star rating. Laura Evenson from San Francisco Chronicle mentioned [...] "Mortal Kombat the movie has everything a teenage boy could want: snakes that jut out of a villain's palms, acrobatic kung- fu fighting and a couple of battling babes. Everything, that is, but an interesting plot, decent dialogue and compelling acting" [...] commenting however that Mortal Kombat will become a cult classic.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} today's {{business}} is measured increasingly {{in terms of}} what it knows, rather than what it owns. Even so, whilst knowledge exists in most organisations it is regularly difficult to access. This paper addresses {{the question of whether the}} information needs of those engaged in marketing management are being delivered satisfactorily by information providers. It is plainly evident that the use of the Internet and the Intranet as global communication tools has risen exponentially over the past two years. We know therefore, how things are in this increasingly project-driven business world concerning the sheer volume of information available for both support and user alike. However, a question remains as to whether this information is collected and presented in a form- at a level of specificity and depth- that makes for better decision taking.

Procedure manuals are raised in order to standardize processes, it seeks to ensure the welfare of the co-owners and its rights, protect the integrity of persons, public health and welfare in general. Determine regulatory safety measures applicable to pools to ensure compliance with the provisions applicable. As well as establishing good sanitary practices to prevent and control risks affecting the life and health of the co-owners of the closed sets. Set the correct procedures to maintain the facades under optimal conditions, as is essential to the image of the condo. It is vital to emphasize the difference from the sets of commercial, mixed or residential use and which of them are required to have a Statutory Auditor, Public qualified accountant, and in which case may be the owner or holder of private property in the building or condominium...|$|E

40|$|Autor u ovom radu polazi od teoretske pretpostavke o povezanosti solidarnosti i supsidijarnosti i na osnovi toga pokazuje važnost supsidijarnosti za funkcioniranje solidarnosti, posebno društvene solidarnosti. U radu se koriste određena empirijska istraživanja, a posebno po prvi put empirijsko istraživanje unutar projekta Praćenje siromaštva u Hrvatskoj. U tom posljednjem spomenutom, istraživanju pokušao se dohvatiti i odnos prema supsidijarnosti u Hrvatskoj. U prvoj točki: Visoka razina osobne i niska razina društvene solidarnosti pokazuje se općerašireni fenomen u postkomunističkim zemljama, tj. niska razina društvene solidarnosti, što se odnosi i na hrvatsko društvo. U drugoj točki: Način života u Hrvatskoj ne pogoduje prakticiranju solidarnosti autor pokazuje kako određeni oblici ponašanja hrvatskih građana (primjerice slabo štede, slabo cijene samostalnost, spremnost na pomoć drugima i samoobrazovanje), odnosno način života 2 ̆ 7 iznad vlastitih mogućnosti 2 ̆ 7 (pomoću kredita koje sve teže otplaćuju) povećava nepovjerenje i otežava stvaranje 2 ̆ 7 ozračja solidarnosti 2 ̆ 7. Treća točka: Supsidijarnost - nepoznata stvarnost? donosi rezultate koji govore o praktičnom nefunkcioniranju supsidijarnosti u Hrvatskoj i raspravlja o zaprekama za razvoj supsidijarnosti (primjerice, etos amoralnog familizma). Četvrta točka: Supsidijarnost otvara nove mogućnosti sudjelovanja, što se može primijeniti na funkcioniranje solidarnosti upućuje na smisao i značenje supsidijarnosti u europskom društvu. Naglašava se ontološko-antropološko utemeljenje supsidijarnosti u socijalnom nauku Crkve. Iz rada proizlazi, što se onda pokazuje i u zaključku, da je supsidijarnost nužno potrebna za jačanje društvene solidarnosti u Hrvatskoj. U Hrvatskoj je potrebno tražiti određene modele djelovanja kako bi se stvorilo 2 ̆ 7 ozračje solidarnosti 2 ̆ 7 i ujedno postupno razvijala supsidijarnost Na konkretnoj razini moguće je razviti radionice u kojima bi se ljudi upućivali u supsidijarnost kao načelo organizacije društvenoga života koje pridonosi prakticiranju solidarnosti, posebno društvene solidarnosti. On {{the basis}} of several {{empirical}} research projects that have been conducted in Croatia {{over the past decade}} and on {{the basis of}} several articles, it is possible to deeply investigate relations towards solidarity as well as the ties between solidarity and subsidiarity. Based on this, it is possible to portray the significance of subsidiarity for solidarity to be able to function and in particular, social solidarity. The article refers to certain empirical research projects and in particular to empirical research conducted as part of the project Monitoring Poverty in Croatia. This last research attempted to reach towards relations towards subsidiarity in Croatia. Point one, The high level of personal and low level of social solidarity highlights the generally spread phenomenon of post-communist countries, i. e. the low level of social solidarity which is prevalent in Croatian society too. In point two, The way of life in Croatia does not allow solidarity to be practised, the author shows how certain forms of behaviour amongst Croatian citizens (e. g. poor savings, poor evaluation of independence, their lack of readiness to help others; and their poor attitude towards self-education), i. e. their way of life 2 ̆ 7 is above their means 2 ̆ 7 (living on loans that are all the more difficult to pay off), increases mistrust and hampers any possibility of creating 2 ̆ 7 an atmosphere of solidarity 2 ̆ 7. In point three, Subsidiarity - an unknown reality? he presents results on the one hand that speak about practical non-functioning of subsidiarity in Croatia, because solutions to almost all significant questions and problems are expected from some authority: federal, county or local. On the other hand, there <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barriers to developing subsidiarity) e. g. the ethos of amoral Familism) and of the need and prospects of subsidiarity in Croatia. Point four, Subsidiarity opens new opportunities to participation that {{can be applied to the}} functioning of solidarity points out the meaning of subsidiarity in European society. The article discusses horizontal and vertical subsidiarity and their meaning to the functioning of democracy and civil society in general. Emphasis is placed on the ontological-anthropological foundations of subsidiarity in the social teachings of the Church. Based on the fact that subsidiarity is based on the person and variety of persons leads to the nature of subsidiarity: natural orientation towards others and mutual dependence between each other. The article shows in its conclusion that subsidiarity is extremely important towards strengthening social solidarity in Croatia. It is necessary therefore to develop subsidiarity both at a theoretical and practical level. In Croatia, it is important to search for certain models of activities in order to create an 2 ̆ 7 atmosphere of solidarity 2 ̆ 7 and to gradually develop subsidiarity. In that context, the following fields are significant: respect of the law to overcome anomies in numerous forms of public life; strengthening dignity and trust in social and government institutions as well as strengthening trust in people who work in this institutions; education about subsidiarity and solidarity needs to commence from earliest childhood, i. e. systematically from kindergarten and school age. At a concrete level, it is possible to organise workshops that would point out the notion of subsidiarity to people as a principle of an organised social life that contributes towards practising solidarity and in particular, social solidarity...|$|E
