25|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} {{for the preservation of}} the French Quarter, but it was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> challenge. Throughout the 1960s, new hotels opened regularly, often replacing large sections of the French Quarter. The VCC approved these structures as long as their designers adhered to prevailing exterior styles. Detractors, fearing that the Vieux Carré's charm might be compromised by the introduction of too many new inns, lobbied successfully for passage in 1969 of a municipal ordinance that forbade new hotels within the district's boundaries. However, the ordinance failed to stop the proliferation of timeshare condominiums and clandestine bed and breakfast inns throughout the French Quarter or high-rise hotels just outside its boundaries. In the 1980s, many long-term residents were driven away by rising rents, as property values rose dramatically with expectations of windfalls from the planned 1984 World's Fair.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{reception}} of the Sega CD is mixed, praising certain titles in its game library but criticizing its low value for money and limitations on the benefits it provides to the Genesis. GamePro listed the Sega CD as the 7th-worst selling video game console of all time, with reviewer Blake Snow noting that [...] "The problem was threefold: the device was expensive at $299, it arrived late in the 16-bit life cycle, and it didn't do much (if anything) to enhance the gameplay experience." [...] Snow went on to note, however, that the Sega CD did have in its library [...] "the greatest Sonic game of all time" [...] in Sonic CD. IGN's Levi Buchanan criticized Sega's implementation of CD technology for the Genesis, noting, [...] "What good is the extra storage space if there is nothing inventive {{to be done with}} it? No new gameplay concepts emerged from the SEGA CD—it just offered more of the same. In fact, with few exceptions like Sonic CD, it often offered some of the 16-bit generation's worst games, like Demolition Man." [...] Jeremy Parish of USgamer pointed out that [...] "Sega was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> company to muddy its waters with a CD add-on in the early '90s" [...] and highlighted some [...] "gems" [...] for the system, but cautioned [...] "the benefits offered by the Sega CD had to be balanced against the fact that the add-on more than doubled the price (and complexity) of the [...]" [...] Writing for Retro Gamer, Damien McFerran cited various reasons for the Sega CD's limited sales, including the add-on's high price, lack of significant enhancement to the Genesis console, and lack of ability to function without a console attached. Retro Gamer writer Aaron Birch, however, defended the Sega CD and wrote that [...] "the single biggest cause of the Mega-CD's failure was the console itself. When the system came out, CD-ROM technology was still in its infancy and companies had yet to get to grips with the possibilities it offered... quite simply, the Mega-CD was a console ahead of its time." ...|$|E

'La nécessité de mentir pour désavouer un ouvrage est une extrémité qui répugne également à la conscience et à la noblesse du caractère; mais le crime est pour les hommes injustes qui rendent ce désaveu nécessaire à la sûreté de celui qu'ils y forcent. Si vous avez érigé en crime ce qui n'en est pas un, si vous avez porté atteinte, par des lois absurdes ou par des lois arbitraires, au droit naturel qu'ont tous les hommes, non seulement d'avoir une opinion, mais de la rendre publique, alors vous méritez de perdre celui qu'a chaque homme d'entendre la vérité de la bouche d'un autre, droit qui fonde seul l'obligation rigoureuse de ne pas mentir. S'il n'est pas permis de tromper, c'est parceque tromper quelqu'un, c'est lui faire un tort, ou s'exposer à lui en faire un; mais le tort suppose un droit, et personne n'a celui de cherche, à s'assurer les moyens de commettre une injustice.' Vie de Voltaire; Œuv. iv. 33, 34. Condorcet might have found some countenance for his sophisms in Plato (Republ. ii. 383); but even Plato restricted the privilege of lying to statesmen (iii. 389). He was in a wiser mood when he declared (Œuv. v. 384) {{that it is better}} to be imprudent than a hypocrite,--though for that matter these are <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> alternatives.|$|E

[...] Roger Ebert was especially impressed with the performance of Isabelle Huppert, [...] "...small and slender, she embodies the strength of a fighter. In so many films, she is an indomitable force, yet you can't see how she does it. She rarely acts broadly. The ferocity lives within. Sometimes she is mysteriously impassive; we see what she's determined to do, but she sends no signals with voice or eyes to explain it." [...] Michael Koresky of IndieWire concurs, and also praises the ensemble cast: [...] "Maria is <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> film’s <b>only</b> character. Christophe Lambert gives a surprisingly fragile performance as her ex-husband, while Nicolas Duvauchelle is downright frightening as the beautiful, blond, lazy Manuel, who descends to peculiar pathological depths and thrusts himself into unexpected action."

40|$|The {{approximately}} 50 known chemokines {{are classified}} in distinct subfamilies: CXC, CC, CX 3 C, and C.

However, this exception has not been found in humans. In this study, we provide evidence that human CCL 21 is a functional ligand for endogenously expressed CXCR 3 in human adult microglia. In absence of CCR 7 expression, CCL 21 induced chemotaxis of human microglia with efficiency similar to the CXCR 3 ligands CXC chemokine ligand 9 (monokine induced by IFN- 3 γ) and CXC chemokine ligand 10 (IFN-γ-inducible protein- 10). Because human CCL 21 did not show any effects in CXCR 3 -transfected HEK 293 cells, it is indicated that CXCR 3 signaling depends on the cellular background in which the CXCR 3 is expressed...|$|R

I had a sort of realizing sense of what the Bastille prisoners must have felt when they used to come out and look upon Paris after years of captivity, and note how curiously the familiar and the strange were mixed together before them.
