For kinetoplastid infections, the total global research and development funding was approximately $136.3 million in 2012. Each of the three diseases, African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and Leishmaniasis each received approximately a third of the funding, which was about $36.8 million US dollars, $38.7 million US dollars, and $31.7 million US dollars, respectively.|$|E

40|$|In <b>humans,</b> <b>African</b> <b>trypanosomiasis</b> {{occurs in}} two forms; the chronic West African form {{is caused by}} T. b. gambiense and the acute or {{subacute}} East African form is caused by T. b. rhodiense. Trypanosomes are transmitted by tsetse flies generating an extracellular infection eventually affecting the central nervous system. Mortality is due to massive parasitosis or secondary infection {{as a result of}} trypanosome induced immunosuppression. About 60 million people residing in Africa are at risk. Experimental <b>African</b> <b>trypanosomiasis</b> was established in mice and rats to study the immunopathological mechanisms during the disease. We studied the production of cytokines and investigated a mechanism for their regulation through generation of cytokine neutralising autoantibodies (Aabs). Trypanosomiasis resulted in increased serum levels of IFN-[gamma], TN 17 -a and IL- 4 with decreased Aabs to these cytokines during early infection. In the late stage of the disease these responses were reversed; low serum cytokine levels were associated with high serum Aabs. The scenario was different for IL- 10 and TGF-[beta] with initial low cytokine and high Aabs levels. However, at later time points high IL- 10 and TGF-[beta] expression was linked to low Aabs serum levels. Trypanosome-derived lymphocyte-triggering factor released by T. b. brucei triggered CD 8 T-cells and dorsal root gangli cells to produce interferon-[gamma]. This cytokine supported T. b. brucei growth through intracellular STAT- 1 activation. The mice infected with T. b. brucei developed CNS involvement which was associated with significantly increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of MIP- 2, RANTES and MIP- 1 [alpha] and to a lower extent MCP- 1. MIP- 2, RANTES and MIP- 1 [alpha] were produced early by astrocytes and microglia and later by macrophages and T-lymphocytes. The chemokine production was at its peak when the animals developed CNS symptoms and was associated with significant infiltration of lymphomononuclear cells in the brain. The outcome of functional interactions between antigen presenting cells and T- and B-cells are dependent on expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Here we used computerised in situ imaging to investigate the induction of CD 40 -L, CD 86, CD 80, MHC-class 11 expression and germinal center (GC) formation in the spleen during the initial course of experimental <b>African</b> <b>trypanosomiasis.</b> Peak expression of these molecules occurred four days after infection. Initial enhanced CD 86 expression was accompanied by CD 80 expression indicating DC type-II signalling. At later time points we found a significant increase in novel GC formation. In addition, a significant upregulation of IgE response was found in the spleen of infected mice. Thus, <b>African</b> <b>trypanosomiasis</b> is associated with humoral immune activation without eliminating the pathogen...|$|R

40|$|Trypanosoma brucei {{and related}} parasites are causative agents of severe {{diseases}} that affect global health and economy. T. brucei {{is responsible for}} sleeping sickness in <b>humans</b> (<b>African</b> <b>trypanosomiasis)</b> and a wasting disease in livestock. More than 100 years after T. brucei was identified as the etiological agent for sleeping sickness, available treatments remain inadequate, complicated by toxicity, lengthy and expensive administration regiments, and drug-resistance. There is clear need {{for the development of}} a new antitrypanosomal drugs. Due to the unique evolutionary position of these early diverging eukaryotes, trypanosomes posses a number of biological properties unparalleled in other organisms, including humans, which could prove valuable for new drug targets. One of the most distinctive properties of trypanosomes is their mitochondrial DNA, called kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). kDNA is composed of over five thousand circular DNA molecules (minicircles and maxicircles) catenated into a topologically complex network. Replication of kDNA requires an elaborate topoisomerase-mediated release and reattachment mechanism for minicircle theta structure replication and at least five DNA polymerases. Three of these (POLIB, POLIC, and POLID) are related to bacterial DNA polymerase I and are required for kDNA maintenance and growth. Each polymerase appears to make a specialized contribution to kDNA replication. ^ The research described in this dissertation is a significant contribution to the field of kDNA replication and the advancement of kDNA replication proteins as putative drug targets for sleeping sickness. Functional characterization of POLIB indicated that it participates in minicircle replication but is likely not the only polymerase contributing to this process. Gene silencing of POLIB partially blocked minicircle replication and led to the production of a previously unidentified free minicircle species, fraction U. Characterization of fraction U confirmed its identity as a population of dimeric minicircles with non-uniform linking numbers. Fraction U was not produced in response to silencing numerous other previously studied kDNA replication proteins but, as we demonstrated here, is also produced in response to POLID silencing. This common phenotype led us to hypothesize that POLIB and POLID both participate in minicircle replication. Simultaneously silencing both polymerases completely blocked minicircle replication, supporting a model of minicircle replication requiring both POLIB and POLID. Finally, we demonstrate that disease-causing trypanosomes require kDNA and the kDNA replication proteins POLIB, POLIC, and POLID. These data provide novel insights into the fascinating mechanism of kDNA replication and support the pursuit of kDNA replication proteins as novel drug targets for combating <b>African</b> <b>trypanosomiasis.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{evolution}} of parasitism is a recurrent event in the history {{of life and}} a core problem in evolutionary biology. Trypanosomatids are important parasites and include the human pathogens Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania spp., which in <b>humans</b> cause <b>African</b> <b>trypanosomiasis,</b> Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis, respectively. Genome comparison between trypanosomatids reveals that these parasites have evolved specialized cell-surface protein families, overlaid on a well-conserved cell template. Understanding how these features evolved and which ones are specifically associated with parasitism requires comparison with related non-parasites. We have produced genome sequences for Bodo saltans, the closest known non-parasitic relative of trypanosomatids, and a second bodonid, Trypanoplasma borreli. Here we show how genomic reduction and innovation contributed {{to the character of}} trypanosomatid genomes. We show that gene loss has “streamlined” trypanosomatid genomes, particularly with respect to macromolecular degradation and ion transport, but consistent with a widespread loss of functional redundancy, while adaptive radiations of gene families involved in membrane function provide the principal innovations in trypanosomatid evolution. Gene gain and loss continued during trypanosomatid diversification, resulting in the asymmetric assortment of ancestral characters such as peptidases between Trypanosoma and Leishmania, genomic differences that were subsequently amplified by lineage-specific innovations after divergence. Finally, we show how species-specific, cell-surface gene families (DGF- 1 and PSA) with no apparent structural similarity are independent derivations of a common ancestral form, which we call “bodonin. ” This new evidence defines the parasitic innovations of trypanosomatid genomes, revealing how a free-living phagotroph became adapted to exploiting hostile host environments...|$|R

After an initial scan of HGT events using BLSOM, we identified 3. 8 % of the tsetse fly genome as HGT candidates. The predicted donors of these HGT candidates included known symbionts, such as Wolbachia, as well as bacteria that have not previously been associated with the tsetse fly. We detected HGT candidates from diverse bacteria such as Bacillus and Flavobacteria, suggesting a past association between these taxa. Functional annotation revealed that the HGT candidates encoded loci in various functional pathways, such as metabolic and antibiotic biosynthesis pathways. These findings provide a basis for understanding the coevolutionary history of the tsetse fly and its microbes and establish the effectiveness of BLSOM for the detection of HGT events...|$|R
