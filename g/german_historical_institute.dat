25|$|From 2007 to 2012, Römer {{worked a}} {{research}} associate in the project headed by Sönke Neitzel focused on war perception and collective biography of the History Department at the University of Mainz. The project led to the publication of Soldaten: On Fighting, Killing and Dying. The Secret WWII Transcripts of German POWs by Neitzel and Harald Welzer in 2011. For the project, Römer completed a comprehensive 100,000 pages documentary material from the interrogation camp Fort Hunt where about 3,000 POWs German were both interviewed formally and surreptitiously recorded while held there in 1942 to 1945. Based on the research into the POWs held in the United States, Römer's 2012 book, Kameraden – Die Wehrmacht von innen. , appeared in 2012.

500|$|Two of Sterns editors, Koch and Schmidt, {{lost their}} jobs because of the scandal. Both complained {{strongly}} when told that their resignations were expected, pointing out that they had both wanted to sack Heidemann in 1981. A settlement of 3.5million DMs (c. $1million) was provided {{to each of them}} as part of the severance package. The staff at the magazine were angry at the approach taken by their managers, and held sit-ins to protest at the [...] "management's bypassing traditional editorial channels and safeguards". The scandal caused a major crisis for Stern and, according to Esser and Hartung, the magazine [...] "once known for its investigative reporting, became a prime example of sensation-seeking checkbook journalism". Sterns credibility was severely damaged and it took the magazine ten years to regain its pre-scandal status and reputation. According to the <b>German</b> <b>Historical</b> <b>Institute,</b> the scandal was also [...] "instrumental in discrediting the tendency toward an 'unprejudiced' and euphemistic assessment of the Third Reich in West German popular culture".|$|E

5000|$|Since 1953, the Institute {{has been}} {{publishing}} the journal [...] ("Contemporary History Quarterly"), which {{is regarded as}} one of the most important publications of <b>German</b> <b>historical</b> research.

50|$|It was {{no longer}} the will to dominate, but rather the striving for {{exchange}} and mediation among German and French historians that led to the founding of the “Deutsche Historische Forschungsstelle” (<b>German</b> <b>Historical</b> Research Center), which was inaugurated on 21 November 1958. It was financed with German federal government grants and worked under the umbrella organization “Wissenschaftliche Kommission zur Erforschung der deutsch-französischen Beziehungen” (Academic Commission on Franco-German Relations), based in Mainz. Its managing director, the medievalist Eugen Ewig, is regarded as the institute’s founder. The academic intentions behind its foundation were tied to the process of Franco-German reconciliation after World War II. After many years of negotiations, one year after the signing of the Élysée Treaty, the <b>German</b> <b>Historical</b> Research Center in Paris was permanently institutionalized: on 1 July 1964, it was renamed “German <b>Historical</b> <b>Institute</b> Paris” and turned into a dependent institution under the responsibility of the Federal Minister for Scientific Research. The medievalist Alois Wachtel from Bonn became its first director in 1966.|$|R

2500|$|A {{short history}} of the {{founding}} of the Prussian historical institute was published by Friedensburg (Berlin, Academy of Sciences). The project dated back to 1883, {{but it was not until}} May 1888 that Konrad Schottmüller succeeded in opening a Prussian Historical Bureau that began modestly enough, but soon developed into the actual Prussian Institute, reorganized (12 November 1902) on a materially enlarged scale, and now the most important of all historical institutes at Rome, owing largely to the efforts of its present director, Professor Kehr. In addition to the general work of historical investigations, special departments are conducted for the history of art and for patristic and Biblical research. Besides its own publication, [...] "Quellen und Forschungen aus italienischen Archiven" [...] the <b>German</b> <b>Historical</b> <b>Institute</b> in Rome (DHI Rome) today issues a series of German nunciature reports (eleven volumes since 1897). The Library of the Institute, besides extensive monographs on various subjects, has published the useful [...] "Repertorium Germanicum", and, in co-operation with the Instituto Storico Italiano, the [...] "Registrum chartarum Italiæ", a series of independent volumes. These researches take in Italian, German, French, English, and Spanish archives; Austria and Switzerland are likewise visited occasionally. The library of the institute ranks, with that of the Palazzo Farnese, among the best historical libraries in Rome.|$|E
