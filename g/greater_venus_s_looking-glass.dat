40|$|An {{analysis}} was performed to evaluate the potential of utilizing either an airship or aircraft as a flight platform for long duration flight within the atmosphere of Venus. In order to achieve long-duration flight, the power system for the vehicle had {{to be capable of}} operating for extended periods of time. To accomplish these, two types of power systems were considered, a solar energy-based power system utilizing a photovoltaic array as the main power source and a radioisotope heat source power system utilizing a Stirling engine as the heat conversion device. Both types of vehicles and power systems were analyzed to determine their flight altitude range. This {{analysis was}} performed for a station-keeping mission where the vehicle had to maintain a flight over a location on the ground. This requires the vehicle to be capable of flying faster than the wind speed at a particular altitude. An analysis was also performed to evaluate the altitude range and maximum duration for a vehicle that was not required to maintain station over a specified location. The results of the analysis show that each type of flight vehicle and power system was capable of flight within certain portions of <b>Venus</b> <b>s</b> atmosphere.

50|$|The {{mission was}} {{proposed}} in 2001 to reuse {{the design of}} the Mars Express mission. However, some mission characteristics led to design changes: primarily in the areas of thermal control, communications and electrical power. For example, since Mars is approximately twice as far from the Sun as Venus, the radiant heating of the spacecraft is four times <b>greater</b> for <b>Venus</b> Express than Mars Express. Also, the ionizing radiation environment is harsher. On the other hand, the more intense illumination of the solar panels results in more generated photovoltaic power. The Venus Express mission also uses some spare instruments developed for the Rosetta spacecraft. The mission was proposed by a consortium led by D. Titov (Germany), E. Lellouch (France) and F.

50|$|How {{widespread}} {{the cult}} of Gad, the deity, was in Canaanite times may be inferred from the names Baalgad, a city {{at the foot of}} Mount Hermon, and Migdal-gad, in the territory of Judah. Compare also the proper names Gaddi and Gaddiel in the tribes of Manasseh and Zebulun (Numbers 13:10, 11). At the same time it must not be supposed that Gad was always regarded as an independent deity. The name was doubtless originally an appellative, meaning the power that allots. Hence any of the greater gods supposed to favour men might be thought of as the giver of good fortune and be worshiped under that title; it is possible that Jupiter, the planet, may have been the Gad thus honoured - among the Arabs the planet Jupiter was called the <b>greater</b> Fortune (<b>Venus</b> was styled the lesser Fortune).|$|R

60|$|I {{read that}} Lady Yarmouth (my most {{religious}} and gracious king’s favourite) sold a bishopric to a clergyman for 5,000l. (She betted him 5,000l. {{that he would}} not be made a bishop, and he lost, and paid her.) Was he the only prelate of his time led up by such hands for consecration? As I peep into George II’s St. James’s, I see crowds of cassocks rustling up the back-stairs of the ladies of the Court; stealthy clergy slipping purses into their laps; that godless old king yawning under his canopy in his Chapel Royal, as the chaplain before him is discoursing. Discoursing about what?—about righteousness and judgement? Whilst the chaplain is preaching, the king is chattering in German almost as loud as the preacher; so loud that the clergyman—it may be one Dr. Young, he who wrote Night Thoughts, and discoursed on the splendours of the stars, the glories of heaven, and utter vanities of this world—actually burst out crying in his pulpit because the Defender of the Faith and dispenser of bishoprics would not listen to him! No wonder that the clergy were corrupt and indifferent amidst this indifference and corruption. No wonder that sceptics multiplied and morals degenerated, so far as they depended on the influence of such a king. No wonder that Whitfield cried out in the wilderness, that Wesley quitted the insulted temple to pray on the hillside. I look with reverence on those men at that time. Which is the sublimer spectacle—the good John Wesley, surrounded by his congregation of miners at the pit’s mouth, or the queen’s chaplains mumbling through their morning office in their ante-room, under the picture of the <b>great</b> <b>Venus,</b> with the door opened into the adjoining chamber, where the queen is dressing, talking scandal to Lord Hervey, or uttering sneers at Lady Suffolk, who is kneeling with the basin at her mistress’s side? I say I am scared as I look round at this society—at this king, at these courtiers, at these politicians, at these bishops—at this flaunting vice and levity. Whereabouts in this Court is the honest man? Where is the pure person one may like? The air stifles one with its sickly perfumes. There are some old-world follies and some absurd ceremonials about our Court of the present day, which I laugh at, but as an Englishman, contrasting it with the past, shall I not acknowledge the change of to-day? As the mistress of St. James’s passes me now, I salute the sovereign, wise, moderate, exemplary of life; the good mother; the good wife; the accomplished lady; the enlightened friend of art; the tender sympathizer in her people’s glories and sorrows.|$|R

Meanwhile, the other Battle Beasts fight against the so-called Mazinger Army (made up of <b>Great</b> Mazinger, <b>Venus</b> A and three significantly weaker versions of Mazinger Z).

As Kouji continues his journey, a missile attack kills Rigarn and his entire army in Russia. Eventually, Kouji reaches the Photonic Research Institute despite the efforts of Archduke Gorgon. In their desperation to destroy Mazinkaiser, the Mikene armies of Caeser, Ardias and Draydou ripped the very ground apart, seeking its underground hangar. Unluckily for them, Mazinkaiser was being stored in space, out of their reach. With Boss' help, Kouji is able to activate Mazinkaiser. Living up to its title of Ultimate Mazinger, Mazinkaiser then wipes out every last one of the surviving Battle Beasts and kills the three generals with almost embarrassing ease.|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{nonlinear}} dynamics of a forced core-mantle system. We {{show that the}} free axisymmetric motion of a uniform-vorticity Ñuid core coupled to a rigid mantle (the Poincare �-Hough model) is integrable. We derive an approximate Hamiltonian for the core tilt mode that includes the leading nonlinear contribution. We then include gravitational perturbations in the analysis. We identify the principal nonlinear prograde and retrograde resonances and the characteristic excitation associated with each. We compare the nonlinear excitation with the excitation expected in the corresponding linear model. The nonlinear model indicates that for each principal commensurability there are multiple overlapping resonances, and so varying degrees of chaotic behavior are predicted. Chaotic behavior at the principal coremantle commensurabilities is conÐrmed with surfaces of section. We then present the results of numerical evolutions done with a generalization of our (1994) Lie-Poisson integrator {{to allow for a}} Poincare �-Hough core, core-mantle friction, and tidal dissipation. We use our analytical and numerical models to explore the evolution of Earth through the prograde core-mantle resonances and to explore the evolution of Venus through the retrograde resonances.

Mottled plains contain abundant lava flows and domes, suggesting that volcanism forming planes is a significant process in the equatorial region of Venus. Tesserae are found primarily on Beta Regio and its eastern flank and are interpreted to be locally stratigraphically older units, predating episodes of faulting and plains formation. On the basis of spatial and temporal relationships between geologic units, the highlands of Beta Regio and Western Eistla Regio are interpreted to have formed in association with areas of mantle upwelling which uplift plains, cause rifting, and, in the case of Beta Regio, disrupt a large region of tesserae...|$|R
