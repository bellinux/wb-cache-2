5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> of the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite}} side from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|After {{coming of}} age, the Avatar is sent by Garon to inspect a Hoshidan {{fortress}} above the Bottomless Canyon. However, one of Garon's men, Hans, provokes {{a battle with}} the Hoshidans and throws the Avatar's mentor Gunter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canyon.</b> The Avatar is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who recognize them as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The Avatar is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the Avatar. Mikoto shields them {{at the cost of}} her life. In the aftermath, the Avatar comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the one who will save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the Avatar is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the Birthright and Conquest routes, the Avatar chooses either their biological or adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be denounced by the other side, and they are gradually forced to fight them.|$|E

Part of the price that tourists pay for boat rides <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> pays for cleanup efforts, but the boat operators state that the canyon remains filled with trash. Conanp also states that cleanup efforts are insufficient. Mexico’s federal environmental agency, the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (Semarnat) states that it cannot get involved in the situation as it is the municipalities that have the responsibility for disposing of trash appropriately. However, many of these local governments do not have landfills or the separation of recyclables.|$|E

25|$|However, {{upon hearing}} of the missing airliners, Palen decided that {{what he had seen}} might have been smoke from a post-crash fire. He and his brother flew a light {{aircraft}} (a Piper Tri-Pacer) deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> and searched near the location of the smoke. The Constellation's empennage was found, and the brothers reported their findings to authorities. The following day, the two men pinpointed the wreckage of the DC-7. Numerous helicopter missions were subsequently flown down to the crash sites to find and attempt to identify victims, as well as recover wreckage for accident analysis, a difficult and dangerous process due to the rugged terrain and unpredictable air currents.|$|E

O'Mara made two further rescue attempts in the badly damaged HH-3E before his hoist was knocked out, forcing him to return to base. O'Mara was awarded the Air Force Cross in 1969 for his efforts.|$|E
25|$|The scenery of {{the canyon}} {{has become a major}} tourist {{attraction}} for the state, with developments for eco tourism and extreme sports. The navigable part of the Grijalva River is mostly used to ferry visitors <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> area. The park has six lookout points accessible by land called La Ceiba, La Coyota, El Roblar, Tepehuaje, Los Chiapas and Manos. In the rainy season, tourism is enhanced by the activity of waterfalls such as the Árbol de Navidad, Cueva del Hombre, Cueva del Silencio, Cueva de Colón, Cueva de Colores and Cueva del Suspiro. A lesser known attraction is the archeological site called the Ruins of Berlin. The most important economic activity in the canyon is ecotourism. Most of the visitors are Mexicans. Weekends are busiest with local and regional visitors to bike, swim, hike, camp and picnic.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, by mid-afternoon, {{the rear}} of the column—believing the day's march to be nearly at an end—was dawdling. This {{resulted}} in the army becoming separated, with some having already crossed the summit and others still approaching it. At this point the Turks, who had been following and feinting for many days, seized their opportunity and attacked those who had not yet crossed the summit. The French, both soldiers and pilgrims, taken by surprise, were trapped. Those who tried to escape were caught and killed. Many men, horses, and much of the baggage were cast <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> below. The chronicler William of Tyre, writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus perhaps too long after the event to be considered historically accurate, placed the blame for this disaster firmly on the amount of baggage being carried, much of it reputedly belonging to Eleanor and her ladies, and the presence of non-combatants.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the area is {{connected}} to the Chiapa people, who occupied the Central Valley area before the arrival of the Spanish. The origin of these people is not known, but theories have them migrating north from Nicaragua or even Paraguay. Their main settlement was in Chiapa de Corzo near the canyon, with a fortified area in the higher areas in the canyon for protection from invasions. The Chiapa fiercely resisted Spanish conquest and were not subdued until the arrival of Diego de Mazariegos in 1528. Their last refuge was in the fortified area, now known as the archeological site of the Ruins of Berlin. Here the last of the Chiapa held out from 1528 to 1535 after the Spanish took over the main city. Legend states that when this last fortification fell, the remaining Chiapa committed collective suicide by jumping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> Since then, the canyon has served as a boundary marker between the Zoque and Tzotzil peoples.|$|E
500|$|In 1901, the U.S. Geological Survey sent Abraham Lincoln Fellows and William Torrence <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> to {{look for}} a site to build a [...] {{diversion}} tunnel bringing water to the Uncompahgre Valley, which was suffering from water shortages due to an influx of settlers into the area. Torrence, a Montrose native and an expert mountaineer, had taken part in a failed expedition the previous year, and his experience proved valuable on his second excursion. He opted to bring a single rubber air mattress instead of the heavy wooden boats that had doomed his previous journey <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> They entered the canyon on August 12 equipped with [...] "only hunting knives, two silk lifeline ropes, and rubber bags to encase their instruments."

The canyon itself, located within lowlands circumscribed by dune fields, ridges, and mountains, is aligned along a roughly northwest-to-southeast axis and is rimmed by flat massifs known as mesas. Large gaps between the southwestern cliff faces—side canyons known as rincons—were critical in funneling rain-bearing storms <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> and boosting local precipitation levels.

500|$|Upstream {{of the dam}} site, Auburn-Foresthill Road – one of {{the only}} {{all-weather}} thoroughfares of the region – would be inundated by the proposed reservoir. In preparation for the reservoir's filling, it was rerouted over a three-span, -long truss bridge rising [...] above the river. Even though Auburn Dam would never be completed, the bridge was still required because the pool behind the cofferdam would flood the original river crossing. It also improved safety and reduced travel time by eliminating a steep, narrow and winding grade <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> {{on either side of the}} river, as comparisons to maps showing the old road alignment will attest. The contracts for various projects pertaining to the relocation of the roadway were given to O.K.

The Foresthill Bridge, the fourth highest bridge in the United States, was completed in 1973.|$|E
500|$|Two large {{cofferdams}} {{were constructed}} for the dam, {{but they were}} parallel to the river rather than straddling its width, so drilling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> walls was not required. By the end of 1935 about 1,200 workers completed the west and east cofferdams. The west cofferdam was [...] long, [...] thick and was constructed [...] above the bedrock. The cofferdams allowed workers to dry portions of the riverbed and begin constructing the dam, while water continued to flow {{down the center of}} the riverbed. In , once the west foundation was complete, portions of the west cofferdam were dismantled, allowing water to flow through part of the dam's new foundation. In , MWAK had begun constructing cofferdams above and below the channel between the east and west cofferdams.
