25|$|Boxing (musti-yuddha) is {{traditionally}} considered the roughest form of South Asian unarmed combat. In ancient {{times it was}} popular throughout what are now Pakistan and northern India, but is rarely practiced today. Boxers harden their fists by striking stone and other hard objects. Matches may be either one-on-one or group fights. All kinds of strikes and grabs are allowed, and {{any part of the}} body may be targeted except the groin. Another form of boxing was loh-musti (meaning “iron fist”), said to have been practiced by the God Krishna. In this variation, boxers fought while wielding a kara or steel bracelet like a <b>knuckleduster.</b> Grabs, kicks, biting and attacks to the groin were all legal, the only prohibition being spitting on the opponent which was considered crude and dishonourable. The kara used for regular matches was unadorned, but the form employed during war had one or more spikes around its edge. The kara may be paired with one on each hand, but it was generally only worn on one hand so the other hand could be left free. In some cases the free hand could be paired with another weapon, most commonly the bagh nakha.|$|E
25|$|Grappling arts (malla-vidya), practiced {{either as}} sport or {{fighting}} style, are {{found throughout the}} entirety of South Asia. True combat-wrestling is called malla-yuddha, while the term malakhra refers to wrestling for sport. Malla-yuddha was codified into four forms which progressed from purely sportive contests of strength to actual full-contact fights known as yuddha. Due to the extreme violence, this final form is generally no longer practised. The second form, wherein the wrestlers attempt to lift each other off the ground for three seconds, persists in Karnataka. Under Mughal influence, malla-yuddha incorporated new training methods and became known as kusti, which soon came to dominate most of South Asia. Traditional malla-yuddha is virtually extinct in the north {{where it has been}} supplanted by kusti, but another form called malakhra still exists in parts of India and Sindh, Pakistan. Vajra-musti was another old grappling art in which the competitors wrestled while wearing a horned <b>knuckleduster.</b> In a later style called naki ka kusti (claw wrestling), the duellists fought with bagh nakha. Numerous styles of folk wrestling are also found in India's countryside, such as mukna from Manipur and Inbuan wrestling from Mizoram.|$|E

50|$|Brass knuckles, also {{sometimes}} called knuckles, knucks, brass knucks, knucklebusters, <b>knuckledusters,</b> or a classic, are weapons used in hand-to-hand combat. Brass knuckles are {{pieces of metal}} shaped to fit around the knuckles. Despite their name, they are often made from other metals, plastics or carbon fibers. Designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force by directing it toward a harder and smaller contact area, they result in increased tissue disruption, including an increased likelihood of fracturing the victim's bones on impact. The extended and rounded palm grip also spreads across the attacker's palm the counter-force {{that would otherwise be}} absorbed primarily by the attacker's fingers, reducing the likelihood of damage to the attacker's fingers.|$|R
