5|$|Ra's {{enemies are}} {{the forces of}} chaos, which {{threaten}} maat, the cosmic order that he creates. They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent gaze of Apep's own <b>Eye</b> <b>is</b> a potent weapon against Ra, and Ra's <b>Eye</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the few}} powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing the Eye of Ra from its master during the combat. In other texts, the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of the Eye of Ra is another point of overlap with the Eye of Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil.|$|E
5|$|Also, third eyelid. A {{transparent}} or translucent third eyelid that {{is drawn}} across the eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The nictitating membrane also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E
5|$|Black <b>Eye</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} {{full-length}} studio album by the English punk rock band Fluffy, released on September 17, 1996 by The Enclave. It was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded {{live in the}} studio and the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. The record contains loud punk songs that explore social issues such as sex and abuse.|$|E
50|$|Odd-clawed spiders {{have eight}} eyes {{arranged}} in {{two rows of}} four. The front row curves slightly backward, while the back row curves slightly forward.

5|$|In any case, the {{restoration}} of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness, the return of the kingship to Horus, and many other aspects of maat. Sometimes {{the restoration}} of Horus's <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by {{the restoration of}} Set's testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.|$|E

5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. The downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra {{was believed to}} swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar <b>Eye</b> <b>is</b> said to assist in this effort, slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. The red light of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E
5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former. The principal <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> also the only ones with eye muscles, allowing them to move the retina. Having no muscles, the secondary <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> immobile.|$|R

5|$|The cloudy {{outer edge}} of the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> called the “eyewall”. The eyewall {{typically}} expands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect. The eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found, air rises most rapidly, clouds reach to their highest altitude, and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.|$|E

While the male neck is sometimes adorned with a jewelled hooded serpent, the female neck has a blue lotus matching it.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E

5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies {{a loss of}} virility and strength. The removal of Horus's <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{analyze the}} result of {{ultrasound}} biomicroscopy(UBM) of patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment(RRD) who need to perform pars plana vitrectomy(PPV) to explore the value of clinical application of UBM at preoperation. METHODS: Patients who underwent PPV for RRD in our hospital from January to December 2014 were selected. The preoperative results of UBM were recorded and the positive findings of UBM were analyzed, the value of preoperative application of UBM was investigated. RESULTS:Totally 356 cases(357 eyes) of patients with RRD were received PPV. All patients were examined by UBM, 122 eyes(34. 17 %) <b>were</b> positive, 56 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> ciliochoroidal detachment, 28 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> narrow anterior chamber angle, 6 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> chamber angle-closure, 28 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> ciliary body cyst, 4 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> iris cyst, 11 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> anterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy, 1 <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> retinal cyst.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the effective and complications rate of silicone reverse-intubation in treating chronic dacryocystitis with different extubation time after surgery. METHODS: From December 2009 to December 2012, 56 patients(60 eyes) with chronic dacryocystitis were studied. Silicone tube was placed for 1. 5 months(group A) {{or more than}} 3 months(group B), and the follow-up was 6 months after extubation. RESULTS: All <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> successfully placed silicone tube. In group A(32 eyes), all lacrimal passage were unobstructed after extubation, after 6 months of postextubation, 21 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> cured(66 %), 6 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> improved(19 %), 5 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> failed(16 %), the overall successful rate was 84 %. In group B(28 eyes), 27 eyes of lacrimal passage were unobstructed after extubation, after 6 months of postextubation, 16 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> cured(57 %), 5 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> improved(18 %), 7 <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> failed(25 %), the overall successful rate was 75 %. The difference between two groups had not statistically significance(P > 0. 05). Two eyes in group A and 5 eyes in group B had complications with no statistically significance(P > 0. 05).

5|$|Delta Serpentis, forming part of {{the body}} of the snake between the heart and the head, is a {{multiple}} star system positioned around 70 parsecs from Earth. Consisting of four stars, the system has a total apparent magnitude of 3.79 as viewed from Earth, although two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.80, provide nearly all the light. The primary, a white subgiant, is a Delta Scuti variable with an average apparent magnitude of 4.23. Positioned very near Delta, both in the night sky and likely in actual space at an estimated distance of around 70 parsecs, is the barium star 16 Serpentis. Another notable variable star visible to the naked <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> Chi Serpentis, an Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable situated midway between Delta and Beta which varies from its median brightness of 5.33 by 0.03 magnitudes over a period of approximately 1.5 days.|$|E
