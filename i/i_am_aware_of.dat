5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly are not... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of,</b> that match his.|$|E
500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E

500|$|... Darwin's {{belief that}} black people had the same {{essential}} humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from John Edmonstone in 1826. Early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin nearly lost {{his position on the}} ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. [...] He wrote home about [...] "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." [...] Regarding Fuegians, he [...] "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like Jemmy Button: [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2002, Onyango {{had already}} applied for {{political}} asylum when she applied for public housing in Boston. She {{moved into the}} apartment, run by Massachusetts authorities, after back surgery made walking difficult. A Boston Housing Authority official said that the agency was never notified that a deportation order had been issued against Onyango after the government denied her request for asylum. William McGonigle, {{deputy director of the}} Boston Housing Authority, said, [...] "We have no affirmative responsibility <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> to further check on their [...] status after they are initially deemed to be eligible."(A 1977 federal consent decree, resulting from a class action lawsuit in Waltham, prohibits state officials from denying public housing to illegal immigrants).|$|E
2500|$|Having {{compared}} the Australian situation with America, New Zealand, Jamaica and Saint Vincent, Judge Willis then drew a {{contrast with the}} areas under the British Raj. Those territories, he said, were certainly claimed by conquest, yet [...] "the unchristian practice of Suttees and the Jughernaut were permitted to prevail"; but more pointedly, the Charter Act 1833 expressly gave the Governor-General of India powers to make, alter and repeal laws for both British and native inhabitants of India. [...] "There is", the Judge said, [...] "no express law, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of,</b> that makes the Aborigines subject to our colonial code." [...] He then recalled Barry's argument with respect to local alcohol and firearms laws.|$|E
60|$|So we {{sat alone}} {{for half an}} hour, smiling into the flames, bathing our faces in the glow. From time to time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> steps in the tunnel-like passage outside, and of presences peering.

2500|$|Born {{of second}} {{generation}} German immigrants on May 26, 1895, at 1041 Bloomfield Street, Hoboken, New Jersey to Heinrich Nutzhorn and Johanna Lange. Dorothea Lange was named Dorothea Margaretta Nutzhorn at birth. She had a younger brother, Martin. She dropped her middle name and assumed her mother's maiden name {{after her father}} abandoned the family when she was 12 years old, one of two traumatic incidents early in her life. The other was her contraction of polio at age seven which left her with a weakened right leg and a permanent limp. [...] "It formed me, guided me, instructed me, helped me and humiliated me," [...] Lange once said of her altered gait. [...] "I've never gotten over it, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the force and power of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a {{counter-insurgency}} seminar {{conducted by}} Sri Lanka Army in June 2011, Lawrence Smith - an attaché of the American embassy in Sri Lanka from 2008 revealed [...] "...from what I was privileged {{to hear and}} to see, the offers to surrender that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{seemed to come from}} the mouthpieces of the LTTE -- Nadesan, KP -- people who weren't and never had really demonstrated any control over the leadership or the combat power of the LTTE. So their offers were a bit suspect anyway, and they tended to vary in content hour by hour, day by day. I think we need to examine the credibility of those offers before we leap to conclusions that such offers were in fact real..." [...] However the US State Department characterized the statement as [...] "personal opinion".|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Sir Colin Hope stated: [...] "...he {{factory in}} {{question}} was not owned or operated by this Company. It was {{owned and operated by}} a company known as J.W. Roberts Limited ("JWR"). JWR ceased production at that factory in 1958/59, and vacated and sold the premises shortly thereafter. Although JWR continued in business for some time after leaving the Armley site, the company ceased to trade over twenty years ago... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the various comments and allegations that have been made about JWR's Armley factory, particularly as the source of the contamination to which you refer. Those comments and allegations are not accepted." [...] In the Commons, John Battle responded that he was in possession of correspondence [...] "in which the same T plc sought to convince Her Majesty's Inspector of Taxes that, for tax purposes, J.W. Roberts of Armley was still in business {{as an integral part of}} T and should be taken into account when calculating tax reductions. Is it too cynical to suggest that JWR is counted in only for profits, but discounted when it comes to its responsibility for local lives?" ...|$|E
