[...] It may be remarked in passing that this was not an uncommon state of mind with Bob Bowie.|$|E
6000|$|On another {{occasion}} {{a similar case}} of the <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearance</b> of distance occurred.

One of the sailors, Bill by name, insisted that it could not be more than three-quarters of a mile; and thereupon an animated discussion, amounting almost to a dispute, began. But Bill was not to be put down. [...] "He was an old salt. He wasn't to be taken in by these molehills, not he!" [...] He had sailed round the world, according to his own account had been shipwrecked half a dozen times, and drowned once or twice, besides being murdered occasionally; so he thought himself a weighty authority, and entitled to great respect! ...|$|E

So carefully, that I never yet looked at the picture without wishing that somebody would take them up, and out of the way. And I am under a very strong persuasion that Raphael did not think painting [...] "naturally" [...] an easy thing. It will be well to examine into this point a little; and for the present, with the reader's permission, we will pass over the first two statements in this passage (touching the character of Italian art in 1759, and of Venetian art in general), and immediately examine some of the evidence existing as to the real dignity of [...] "natural" [...] painting--that is to say, of painting carried to the point at which it reaches a <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearance</b> of reality.|$|E
60|$|The road {{crosses the}} valley of Tenuyan in a nearly east and west line, and for several miles we have on both hands the conglomerate, {{everywhere}} dipping west and forming separate great mountains. The strata, where first met with, after leaving the gypseous formation, are inclined westward at an angle of only 20 degrees, which further on increases to about 45 degrees. The gypseous strata, as we have seen, are also inclined westward: hence, when looking from {{the eastern side of}} the valley towards the Peuquenes range, a most <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearance</b> is presented, as if the newer beds of conglomerate dipped directly under the much older beds of the gypseous formation. In the middle of the valley, a bold mountain of unstratified lilac-coloured porphyry (with crystals of hornblende) projects; and further on, a little south of the road, there is another mountain, with its strata inclined at a small angle eastwards, which in its general aspect and colour, resembles the porphyritic conglomerate formation, so rare on this side of the Peuquenes line and so grandly developed throughout the western ranges.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is another}} change of position, {{the value of}} which is not so {{apparent}} to me, as it may well seem to be {{to those who are}} unfamiliar with the subject under discussion. Mr. Gladstone discards his three groups of [...] "water-population," [...] "air-population," [...] and [...] "land-population," [...] and substitutes for them (1) fishes, (2) birds, (3) mammals, (4) man. Moreover, it is assumed, in a note, that [...] "the higher or ordinary mammals" [...] alone were known to the [...] "Mosaic writer" [...] (p. 6). No doubt it looks, at first, as if something {108} were gained by this alteration; for, as I have just pointed out, the word [...] "fishes" [...] can be used in two senses, one of which has a <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearance</b> of adjustability to the [...] "Mosaic" [...] account. Then the inconvenient reptiles are banished out of sight; and, finally, the question of the exact meaning of [...] "higher" [...] and [...] "ordinary" [...] in the case of mammals opens up the prospect of a hopeful logomachy.

With eyes shut tight, his teeth hard set, he tried in a great effort of passionate will to keep his hold on that vision of supreme delight. In vain! His heart grew heavy as the figure of Nina faded away to be replaced by another vision this time--a vision of armed men, of angry faces, of glittering arms--and he seemed to hear the hum of excited and triumphant voices as they discovered him in his hiding-place. Startled by the vividness of his fancy, he would open his eyes, and, leaping out into the sunlight, resume his aimless wanderings around the clearing. As he skirted in his weary march the edge of the forest he glanced now and then into its dark shade, so enticing in its <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearance</b> of coolness, so repellent with its unrelieved gloom, where lay, entombed and rotting, countless generations of trees, and where their successors stood as if mourning, in dark green foliage, immense and helpless, awaiting their turn. Only the parasites seemed to live there in a sinuous rush upwards into the air and sunshine, feeding on the dead and the dying alike, and crowning their victims with pink and blue flowers that gleamed amongst the boughs, incongruous and cruel, like a strident and mocking note in the solemn harmony of the doomed trees.|$|E
6000|$|... § 16. It follows evidently {{from the}} first of these {{characters}} of the imagination, its dislike of substance and presence, that a picture has in some measure even an advantage with us in not being real. The imagination rejoices in having something to do, springs up with all its willing power, flattered and happy; and ready with its fairest colors and most tender pencilling, to prove itself worthy of the trust, and exalt into sweet supremacy the shadow that has been confided to its fondness. And thus, so far from its being at all an object to the painter to make his work look real, he ought to dread such a consummation as the loss of one of its most precious claims upon the heart. So far from striving to convince the beholder that what he sees is substance, his mind should be to what he paints as the fire to the body on the pile, burning away the ashes, leaving the unconquerable shade--an immortal dream. So certain is this, that the slightest local success in giving the <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearance</b> of reality--the imitation, for instance, of the texture of a bit of wood, with its grain in relief--will instantly destroy the charm of a whole picture; the imagination feels itself insulted and injured, and passes by with cold contempt; nay, however beautiful the whole scene may be, as of late in much of our highly wrought painting for the stage, the mere fact of its being deceptively real is enough to make us tire of it; we may be surprised and pleased for a moment, but the imagination will not on those terms be persuaded to give any of its help, and, in a quarter of an hour, we wish the scene would change.|$|E
60|$|Mimickry.—This {{principle}} {{was first}} made clear in an admirable paper by Mr. Bates,[525] who thus threw {{a flood of}} light on many obscure problems. It had previously been observed that certain butterflies in S. America belonging to quite distinct families, resembled the Heliconidæ so closely in every stripe and shade of colour {{that they could not}} be distinguished except by an experienced entomologist. As the Heliconidæ are coloured in their usual manner, whilst the others depart from the usual colouring of the groups to which they belong, {{it is clear that the}} latter are the imitators, and the Heliconidæ the imitated. Mr. Bates further observed that the imitating species are comparatively rare, whilst the imitated swarm in large numbers; the two sets living mingled together. From the fact of the Heliconidæ being conspicuous and beautiful insects, yet so numerous in individuals and species, he concluded that they must be protected from the attacks of birds by some secretion or odour; and this hypothesis has now been confirmed by a considerable body of curious evidence.[526] From these considerations Mr. Bates inferred that the butterflies which imitate the protected species had acquired their present marvellously <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearance,</b> through variation and natural selection, in order to be mistaken for the protected kinds and thus to escape being devoured. No explanation is here attempted of the brilliant colours of the imitated, but only of the imitating butterflies. We must account for the colours of the former in the same general manner, as in the cases previously discussed in this chapter. Since the publication of Mr. Bates’ paper, similar and equally striking facts have been observed by Mr. Wallace[527] in the Malayan region, and by Mr. Trimen in South Africa.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of Histriomastix, Antonio and Mellida, Antonio's Revenge, Jacke Drum's Entertainment, What You Will and The Malcontent, focusing on {{the ways in which}} the plays can be regarded as experimental. It proposes that the Antonio plays and The Malcontent resemble experiments which explore options against the abuse of power, and that all the plays experiment with dramatic conventions in a manner that heightens audience awareness of them. The model of the Stoic praemeditatio futuri mali provides a theoretical basis for the argument that the plays investigate possibilities rather than offer solutions to the problems they raise. This approach leads to the observation that the plays after the Histriomastix are linked by examinations of Stoic philosophy and <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearances.</b> Marston's treatment of dramatic conventions such as genre, plot and characterisation is investigated, and it is argued that he frequently transgresses convention, with the result that the plays emphasise their status as dramatic works and the limitations of dramatic representation are made apparent...|$|R
60|$|It {{has long}} been known that this plant {{produces}} cleistogamic flowers, but these were first described with care by M. Duval-Jouve. (8/24. 'Bulletin Bot. Soc. de France' tome 10 1863 page 194.) I procured plants from a stream near Reigate, and cultivated them for several years in my greenhouse. The cleistogamic flowers are very small, and usually mature their seeds within the sheaths of the leaves. These flowers are said by Duval-Jouve to be filled by slightly viscid fluid; but {{this was not the case}} with several that I opened; but there was a thin film of fluid between the coats of the glumes, and when these were pressed the fluid moved about, giving a similarly <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearance</b> of the whole inside of the flower being thus filled. The stigma is very small and the filaments extremely short; the anthers are less than 1/50 of an inch in length or about one-third of the length of those in the perfect flowers. One of the three anthers dehisces before the two others. Can this have any relation with the fact that in some other species of Leersia only two stamens are fully developed? (8/25. Asa Gray 'Manual of Botany of the United States' 1856 page 540.) The anthers shed their pollen on the stigma; at least in one instance this was clearly the case, and by tearing open the anthers under water the grains were easily detached. Towards the apex of the anther the grains are arranged in a single row and lower down in two or three rows, so that they could be counted; and there were about 35 in each cell, or 70 in the whole anther; and this is an astonishingly small number for an anemophilous plant. The grains have very delicate coats, are spherical and about 5/7000 of an inch (.0181 millimetres), whilst those of the perfect flowers are about 7/7000 of an inch (.0254 millimetres) in diameter.|$|E

6000|$|... 88. Fig. 23, {{which is}} a branch of a tree from the {{background}} of Titian's [...] "St. Jerome," [...] at Milan, compared with fig. 20, {{will give you a}} distinct idea of the kind of change which took place from the time of Giotto to that of Titian, and you will find that this whole range of landscape may be conveniently classed in three divisions, namely, Giottesque, Leonardesque, and Titianesque; the Giottesque embracing nearly all the work of the fourteenth, the Leonardesque that of the fifteenth, and the Titianesque that of the sixteenth century. Now you see there remained a fourth step to be taken,--the doing away with conventionalism altogether, so as to create the perfect art of landscape painting. The course of the mind of Europe was to do this; but at the very moment when it ought to have been done, the art of all civilized nations was paralyzed at once by the operation of the poisonous elements of infidelity and classical learning together, as I have endeavored to show elsewhere. In this paralysis, like a soldier shot as he is just gaining an eminence, the art of the seventeenth century struggled forward, and sank upon the spot it had been endeavoring to attain. The step which should have freed landscape from conventionalism was actually taken by Claude and Salvator Rosa, but taken in a state of palsy,--taken so as to lose far more than was gained. For up to this time, no painter ever had thought of drawing anything, pebble or blade of grass, or tree or mountain, but as well and distinctly as he could; and if he could not draw it completely, he drew it at least in a way which should thoroughly show his knowledge and feeling of it. For instance, you saw in the oak tree of the Giottesque period, that the main points of the tree, the true shape of leaf and acorn, were all there, perfectly and carefully articulated, and so they continued to be down to the time of Tintoret; both he and Titian working out the separate leaves of their foliage with the most exquisite botanical care. But now observe: as Christianity had brought this love of nature into Paganism, the return of Paganism in the shape of classical learning at once destroyed this love of nature; and at the moment when Claude and Salvator made the final effort to paint the effects of nature faithfully, the objects of nature had ceased to be regarded with affection; so that, while people were amused and interested by the new effects of sunsets over green seas, and of tempests bursting on rocky mountains, which were introduced by the rising school, they entirely ceased to require on the one side, or bestow on the other, that care and thought by which alone the beauty of nature can be understood. The older painting had resembled a careful and deeply studied diagram, illustrative of the most important facts; {{it was not to be}} understood or relished without application of serious thought; on the contrary, it developed and addressed the highest powers of mind belonging to the human race; while the Claude and Salvator painting was like a scene in a theater, viciously and falsely painted throughout, and presenting a <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearance</b> of truth to nature; understood, as far as it went, in a moment, but conveying no accurate knowledge of anything, and, in all its operations on the mind, unhealthy, hopeless, and profitless.|$|E
40|$|Quine (1966) {{offered his}} classic {{characterization}} {{of the notion of}} paradox, a taxonomy for paradoxical arguments, and some vocabulary for discussing them. In this paper I shall generalize Quine‟s taxonomy and defend a simpler characterization. The simpler characterization will have the virtue or the flaw (as might be) of making paradox a matter of degree. 1. QUINE‟S VIEW For Quine, a paradox is an apparently successful argument having as its conclusion a statement or proposition that seems obviously false or absurd. That conclusion he calls “the proposition of ” the paradox in question. What is paradoxical is of course that if the argument is indeed successful as it seems to be, its conclusion must be true. On this view, to resolve the paradox is (1) to show either that (and why) despite appearances the conclusion is true after all, or that the argument is fallacious, and (2) if the former, to explain away the <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearances.</b> Quine divides paradoxes into three groups. A “veridical ” paradox is one whose “proposition ” or conclusion is in fact true despite its air of absurdity. We decide that...|$|R

He stood there, for several moments, with his elbow upon the mantelpiece, looking down into the fire. A darker shadow had stolen across his face {{as soon as he was}} alone. In his court dress and brilliant array of orders, he was certainly a very distinguished-looking figure. Yet the last few years had branded lines into his face which it was doubtful if he would ever lose. To be Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the greatest power which the world had as yet known must certainly seem, on paper, to be as brilliant a post as a man's ambition could covet. Many years ago it had seemed so to Bransome himself. It was a post which he had deliberately coveted, worked for, and strived for. And now, when in sight of the end, with two years of office only to run, he was appalled at the ever-growing responsibilities thrust upon his shoulders. There was never, perhaps, a time when, on paper, things had seemed smoother, when the distant mutterings of disaster were less audible.

40|$|Considering that {{distrust}} is a core {{element of}} human interaction, {{it has received}} surprisingly little scientific attention. This research contributes to filling this gap by investigating distrust’s influence on creativity. Intuitively {{as well as in}} light of prior research, distrust and creativity appear incompatible. The social consequences of distrust include reluctance to share information, a quality detrimental to creativity in social settings. At the same time, the cognitive concomitants of distrust bear resemblance to creative cognition: Distrust seems to foster thinking about non-obvious alternatives to potentially <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearances.</b> This tendency resembles cognitive flexibility, which is conducive to creativity. These cognitive underpinnings of distrust hold the provocative implication that distrust may foster creativity. Mirroring these contradictory findings, I suggest that the social vs. cognitive consequences of distrust have diverging implications for creativity. I address this question in Study 1 by introducing private/public as a moderating variable for effects of distrust on creativity. Consistent with distrust’s social consequences, subliminal distrust (vs. trust) priming had detrimental effects on creative generation presumed to be public. Consistent with distrust’s cognitive consequences, though, the opposite emerged in private. Study 2 replicated a beneficial effect of distrust on private creative generation with a different priming method. Studies 3 and 4 showed increased category inclusiveness vs. increased remote semantic spread after distrust priming. The latter findings are consistent with enhanced cognitive flexibility as a consequence of distrust. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the creativity-enhancing potential of distrust and suggest cognitive flexibility as the process in question...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the role appearances play, with notable continuity, in the psychology and ethics of Plato's Protagoras, Gorgias, and Republic. Common to these dialogues is {{the claim that}} evaluative appearances are almost invariably false: {{what appears to be}} good or bad is typically not in fact so and what is good or bad typically does not appear so. I argue that this disparity between apparent and real value forms the basis of Plato's diagnoses {{of a wide range of}} practical errors: psychological phenomena like akrasia, mistaken conceptions of the good like hedonism, and the influence of cultural sources of corruption like oratory, sophistry, and poetry. It also, relatedly, forms the basis of his account of lower passions like appetite, anger, or fear. Such passions are especially prone to lead us astray because their objects [...] appetitive pleasures like food, drink, or sex, for example [...] present especially <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearances.</b> One of the principal aims of this thesis is to show that this presents a significant point of agreement between the psychologies of the Protagoras, Gorgias, and Republic. In all three dialogues, I argue, motivational errors result from a specific kind of cognitive error: the uncritical acceptance of appearances. Plato's early and middle psychologies differ in their account of the subject of this error [...] in the Protagoras and Gorgias, the whole person; in the Republic, the appetitive or spirited part of a person's soul [...] but not in their basic theory of how our passions arise or, crucially, why they are liable to motivate us towards harmful ends.

40|$|URL] of {{the central}} tasks which Plato sets for himself in the Sophist is to say what being is. In doing this he makes a variety of {{philosophical}} moves. The first {{is to show that}} non-being in a very restricted sense of the term is an impossible and self-contradictory concept. This occupies the first part (237 A ft.) {{of the central}} section of the Sophist. After discussing some puzzles concerning <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearances</b> (240 B) and falsehoods (240 D), Plato turns to a discussion of being at 242 B. In this section of the dialogue Plato claims to show that the attempts of previous philosophers to define being have failed and he makes his own first attempt in the dialogue to define being (cf. 242 C and 247 E). 2 In this paper I am concerned only with this section of the Sophist (242 - 249), and I want to show first that Plato's notion of being here is ambiguous, the term x 6 5 v shifting between "being" and "what has being," between the form and those things which participate in it. Second, I want to show that the definitions of being at 248 C and 249 D are not only compatible with one another but also that, when properly understood, they make sense of Plato's use of motion and rest in the Sophist. And finally, I want to show that Plato is caught in the snares of self-predication when he talks about being and other Forms of the same ontological level. This is due {{to the way in which}} he formulates the difference between statements of identity and predication in the argument against Parmenides in this section of the Sophist...|$|R

But put these <b>deceptive</b> <b>appearances</b> aside, read the thing, and you will actually find two books-Book One and Book Two. Book One begins with the behavioral economist 2 ̆ 7 s view that sometimes individuals are not the best judges of their own welfare. Indeed, given the propensity of human beings for cognitive errors (e. g., the availability bias) and the complexity of decisions {{that need to be}} made (e. g., choosing prescription plans), individuals often make mistakes. Enter here the idea of the nudge-the deliberate effort to channel people into making the selections that are best for them. The key thing about a nudge is that it 2 ̆ 7 s noncoercive and there 2 ̆ 7 s always an opt out. Then there 2 ̆ 7 s Book Two. This book is also about nudge. Nudge on steroids. This is the book where Nudge-the insight about how to improve delivery of services-turns into the full-fledged ideology that Sunstein and Thaler call 2 ̆ 2 libertarian paternalism. 2 ̆ 2 In its libertarian moment, libertarian paternalism eschews command-and-control regulations in favor of regimes designed to allow individuals to 2 ̆ 2 go their own way. 2 ̆ 2 In its paternalist aspect, libertarian paternalism nonetheless allows the government to structure the regime with a view to achieving set government goals. The defining characteristic of this ideology (besides its origins in Nudge) is a persistent drive to find the middle ground between libertarians and paternalists, Democrats and Republicans. This is what makes Book Two different: In Book Two, Sunstein and Thaler are not simply interested in correcting for cognitive error or improving the choice architecture of government programs, but in displacing ideological competitors on the right and the left. They are quite deliberately looking to flesh out that elusive 2 ̆ 2 Third Way. 2 ̆...|$|R

Of course, if any girl in Porto Ferrajo could imagine the character of the stranger it must be Ghita; and it was on this supposition that she had unwittingly, and, if the truth must be owned, unwillingly, collected around her a clientelle of at least a dozen girls of her own age, and apparently of her own class. The latter, however, felt no necessity for the reserve maintained by the curious who pressed near 'Maso; for, while they respected their guest and friend, and would rather listen to her surmises than to those of any other person, they had such a prompting desire to hear their own voices that not a minute escaped without a question, or a conjecture, both volubly and quite audibly expressed. The interjections, too, were somewhat numerous, as the guesses were crude and absurd. One said it was a vessel with despatches from Livorno, possibly with [...] "His Eccellenza" [...] on board; but she was reminded that Leghorn lay to the north, and not to the west. Another thought it was a cargo of priests, going from Corsica to Rome; but she was told that priests were not in sufficient favor just then in France, to get a vessel so obviously superior to the ordinary craft of the Mediterranean, to carry them about.
