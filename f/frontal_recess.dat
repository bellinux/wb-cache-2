40|$|Background: After {{the failure}} of medical treatment, the surgery of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is planned {{according}} to endoscopic and paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) findings. Objective: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate whether this study method might be eligible in studies aiming at radiation dose reduction. Sinus CT scans were chosen as a model {{because of the high}} variation of the radiological anatomy of surgically important sinonasal structures. We hypothesized that 3 mm-slice-thick reconstruction CT had poor reproducibility. Methods: 59 CRS patients underwent routine multi-detector sinus CT (CTMD). CT 3 mm was reconstructed from CTMD data-sets. Lund-Mackay (LM) scores and 43 other structural parameters were analyzed blinded. Agreement was studied between CTMD and CT 3 mm (intra-observer reproducibility), and between three observers (inter-observer reproducibility) by using Cohen’s kappa. Results: The inter-observer agreement was moderate (kappa 0. 4 - 0. 6, p < 0. 01) in the majority of structures of CT 3 mm scans. The intra-observer reproducibility of CT 3 mm scans was very good in most structures, however, it was poor in important structures such as <b>frontal</b> and spheno-ethmoid <b>recess,</b> lamina pa-pyracae, and location of optic nerve or anterior ethmoidal artery. The grade of surgeon’s confidence of CT 3 mm in comparison to CTMD was lower (kappa 0. 2 - 0. 4, P < 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND, <b>Frontal</b> <b>recess</b> is the {{anatomical}} region {{most difficult to}} manage in endoscopic frontal sinus surgery due to the extreme variability of the cell patterns that may be observed in this area. CT {{has always been the}} gold standard in preoperative evaluation, but especially in the assessment of the causes of <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> obstruction and surgical failure. In recent years, this accredited and reliable method has been complemented by Computed Tomography Cone Beam (CBCT), which provides similarly detailed anatomical information with a lower dose of radiation. AIM, The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze and validate the use of CBCT in the study of <b>frontal</b> <b>recess,</b> and especially its anatomical variants in a youth population. MATHERIALS AND METHODS, We analyzed 500 CBCT images of paranasal sinuses of young subjects with sinus inflammation pathology between 2009 and 2011. RESULTS, We observed that the method is very sensitive in detecting anterior and posterior recess cells, also in a youth population and then report on some significant images.

METHODS: Various dimensions of structures around the <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> were measured on 256 CT images of 128 Japanese patients using the multiplanar reconstruction technique. Measurements done in this study were: {{the distance from the}} nostril to the narrowest point of the <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> (D 1), and the distance from the narrowest point of the <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> to the bony wall of the anterior skull base on an extension of the same line (D 2). The smallest anterior-posterior (D 3) and right-left (D 4) diameters of the "route to the frontal sinus," a site containing the narrowest airspace in the <b>frontal</b> <b>recess,</b> being surrounded by the posterior edge of maxillary bone anteriorly, by the bony wall of the anterior skull base posteriorly, by the middle turbinate medially, and by the medial orbital bony wall laterally, respectively, on the parasagittal and coronal planes.

40|$|Introduction: The nasosinusal surgery {{showed a}} rapid {{development}} {{over the past}} two decades; but cicatricial stenoses secondary to surgical manipulation still occur, even in the hands of experienced surgeons and, especially, in narrow regions such as the <b>frontal</b> <b>recess.</b> The balloon sinuplasty uses the principle of dilatation of the sinus ostia by balloons guided by catheter. Objective: To present and discuss the surgical technique, indications, costs and results of the balloon sinuplasty, through articles published so far on the subject. Literature's Review: The balloon sinuplasty is an alternative in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. It is not substitute for the functional paranasal sinuses surgery. The use of balloon combined with endoscopic surgical approach may minimize surgical complications such as cicatricial stenosis, especially in regions such as the <b>frontal</b> <b>recess.</b> ICU Patients with a higher anesthetic risk and presenting isolated sphenoid disease may also benefit from the use of the balloon. The possibility of carrying out the dilation with local anesthesia is another advantage. As for the risks, they appear to be low, although there is a possibility of lesion to noble structures as the orbit and skull base. Conclusions: The balloon sinuplasty appears to be a feasible, safe and effective procedure in selected patients. It presents itself as an ancillary therapy and complementary to FESS. It has greater prospects in the treatment of the disease related to the <b>frontal</b> <b>recess,</b> febrile patients in ICU with sinus focus and patients at high anesthetic and bleeding risk...|$|E

Patients and Methods: This was a clinical trial prospective study approved by Menoufia University research ethics board (REB) and included 50 Egyptian patients selected from the ENT department of Menoufia University between June 2011 to November 2014, who were suffering from chronic frontal sinusitis. Preoperative CT with coronal, axial and sagittal cuts were examined to show anatomical variants. Frontalsinusotomy was doneendoscopically and surgicall easiness was evaluated. Results: Increased aggernasi cell size was associated with increased operative easiness. Increase danteroposteri or diameter of frontal sinus ostium was associated with increased operative easiness.

40|$|Aims: The use of multiplanar reconstructed {{computed}} tomography (CT) images of <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> and sinuses was assessed {{with regard to}} depiction and understanding of anatomy and effect on surgical approach. Materials and Methods: Three otorhinolaryngologists and one radiologist read CT scans of 43 patients referred for routine paranasal sinus scans. Spiral (helical) CT scans were obtained and coronal and parasagittal reconstructions were imaged. Three hundred forty-two readings were analyzed. The scans were assessed in the coronal plane {{and then in the}} parasagittal plane. The images were assessed for (i) Bent and Kuhn classification of frontal ethmoidal sinus air cells, (ii) size of frontal sinus ostium (assessed as unsure, normal, small, or large), (iii) use of parasagittal scans regarding additional understanding of the anatomy with particular reference as to how the agger nasi cell and frontal ethmoidal cells were arranged in a three-dimensional space, and (iv) if the parasagittal scan and subsequent three-dimensional picture created altered the surgical approach. The first two criteria were assessed in the coronal plane and then in the parasagittal plane. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the Bent and Kuhn classification of frontoethmoidal cells on coronal and reconstructed parasagittal images (t-test; p > 0. 05). The parasagittal scans were significantly better than the coronal scans for identifying and assessing the size of the frontal sinus ostium (p < 0. 001; chi-square test). Assuming an intraobserver change rate (repeat error) of 10 % on CT scan observations, an exact binomial test was performed on SPLUS, which showed that there was a significant (p < 0. 001) proportion of observers who changed their rating after looking at the parasagittal scan. There also was significant improvement in observers' abilities to identify and classify the size of the frontal ostium as reflected by the number of observers who changed from being unsure on the coronal scans to sure on the parasagittal scans. Observers felt that the parasagittal scans improved their three-dimensional understanding of the anatomy of the <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> by 58 % on a 10 -point Lickert scale. In 55 % of these observations, the surgical plan was altered by a mean of 70. 2 % on a 10 -point Lickert scale based on additional information obtained by viewing the parasagittal scans.

The <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> area represents {{a challenge to}} ENT surgeons due to its narrow confines and variable anatomy. Several types of cells have been described in this area. The agger nasi cells are the most constant ones. The frontal cells, originally classified by Kuhn into 4 types, {{have been reported in}} the literature to exist in 20 %– 41 % of frontal recesses. Aim of the Study. To identify the prevalence of <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> cells and their relation to frontal sinus disease. Methods. Coronal and axial CT scans of paranasal sinuses of 70 patients admitted for functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) were reviewed to identify the agger nasi, frontal cells, and frontal sinus disease.

Multiplanar paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) images from 105 patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery were reviewed. The prevalence of <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> cells (FRCs), thickness of the frontal beak (FB), volume of the ANC, A-P length of the FI, and FR were evaluated. Results. The ANC was identified in 96 % of the patients and frontal cells (FCs) in 32 % (FC type 1, 24. 2 %; type 2, 4. 2 %; type 3, 3. 1 %; and type 4, 0 %). The prevalences of frontal bullar, suprabullar, supraorbital ethmoidal, and interfrontal sinus septal cells were 10 %, 7. 8 %, 3. 6 %, and 6. 8 %, respectively. The A-P lengths of the FR and FI were 10. 1 ± 3. 1 and 8. 4 ± 2. 9 mm, respectively. The thickness of the FB was 7. 8 ± 1. 8 mm and the volume of the ANC averaged 394. 1 ± 240. 5 mm 3. The thickness of the FB did not correlate with the volume of the ANC. In contrast, the A-P length of the FI and FR were positively correlated with the volume of the ANC. Conclusion.

The frontal sinus remains difficult to penetrate with topical therapies. This study evaluates the benefit of Draf III frontal dissection compared to traditional Draf IIa for distribution of topical therapies. Methods: Fresh human cadaver heads were dissected sequentially with Draf IIa frontal sinusotomy and then Draf III procedures. Each cavity was irrigated with pediatric (120 mL) and adult (240 mL) irrigation bottles with 1 / 1000 10 % fluorescein-labeled free water in 2 fixed positions (vertex and Frankfort horizontal). An endoscope at a fixed position within the frontal sinus recorded frontal sinus and <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> penetration. The images then underwent blinded evaluation of fluid distribution scored as 0 to 4 (nasal cavity only, <b>frontal</b> <b>recess,</b> medial one-half, lateral one-half, and lavage). Ordinal distribution score was analyzed with Kendall's tau-b. Results: Eight specimens (age 76 ± 11. 2 years; 50 % female) were assessed. Draf III was superior to Draf IIa in ability to achieve frontal sinus distribution of irrigation (90. 6 % vs 50. 1 %, p < 0. 001). Vertex head position improved distribution (90. 6 % vs 50. 1 %, p < 0. 001), was synergistic with Draf III (100 % with 87. 5 % lavage, p < 0. 001), {{but was unable to}} overcome Draf IIa (81. 2 % with 25 % lavage, p < 0. 001). Irrigation volume trended toward improved distribution with larger volume irrigations. Conclusion: Successful treatment of sinonasal disease may require postoperative delivery of topical therapies. Draf III frontal sinusotomy achieves superior topical access, and access to the frontal sinus with Draf IIa appears limited, despite large volumes and positioning. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} the intraoperative safety factor and to acquire anatomic assistance during revision endo-scopic sinus surgery (RESS), we used an optical computer-aided surgery (CAS) {{system that we}} developed collaboratively in Bern, Switzerland. During 1 year, 25 RESSs were performed with CAS: recurrent polyposis (n = 20), recurrent <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> stenosis (n = 3), and recurrent <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> steno-sis with mucocele (n = 2). These patients were compared with a control group of 10 patients undergoing RESS without CAS. The same surgeon (M. C.) performed all operations, {{and there were no}} minor or major complications in either group. The clinical inaccuracy of our system is between 0. 5 and 2 mm with paired-point and surface matching. The navigation system is an important aid to sur-geons in identifying anatomic landmarks that are typically difficult to visualize in this type of surgery, thus reducing the stress placed on the surgeon. (Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 2000; 122 : 808 - 13.) Modern-day imaging techniques, such as CT and MRI, permit detailed identification of very fine anatomic struc-tures. Their primary clinical use traditionally has been for the topographic diagnosis of illness and injuries. However, an application that has begun to emerge {{in the last few years}} is the use of these imaging techniques for computer-aided surgery (CAS). 1 Different systems can be used to localize an instrument: electromechanical systems, 2 electromagnetic systems, 3 optical systems, 4 or ultrasonography. 5 Each system uses a different prin-ciple to locate the exact position of a marked surgical instrument that is followed online on the CT or MRI images during surgical intervention. These systems were first conceived for use during neurosurgical proce-dures in which the head was rigidly fixed. 6 Fixation of the head is not suitable for endoscopic paranasal sinus surgery because the head must often be moved to obtain access to deep-seated structures. Therefore a novel frameless CAS system has been developed at the Maurice-E. Müller Institute for Biomechanics in Bern, in collaboration with the University Clinic of ENT...|$|E
40|$|Paranasal sinus {{mucocele}} is a cystic formation {{filled with}} mucus, {{resulting from the}} obstruction of sinus ostium. The most common place of mucocele localization is frontal sinus, {{which is due to}} its specific anatomical architecture and a narrow passage of the <b>frontal</b> <b>recess.</b> Approximately in 70 % mucocele localizes in a frontal sinus. In this article we present the case report on 37 years old woman who applied to clinic of aesthetic medicine to get consultation about blepharoplasty possibilities. Patient complained on a mild bilateral upper eyelid ptosis, more significant on the left side. She also complained on recurrent nasal blockage, excessive nasal discharge, facial pain and pressure on her left side supraorbitally. Computered tomography (CT) for paranasal sinuses has been ordinated and lateral mucocele in a the left frontal sinus was diagnosed, as well as, inflammatory process in the left maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses. Investigation and treatment options for this patient are discussed in this article...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ossifying fibroma {{is a rare}} {{benign tumor}} of the nasal cavity and the {{paranasal}} sinus, and is easily misdiagnosed. In the present study, we report the clinical data {{in the case of}} a 46 ‑year‑old female patient, treated due to 5 ‑day forehead swelling accompanied by dizziness. CT examination revealed dilation of the right frontal sinus, bone wall integration, dense masses in the cavity, multiple punctate calcification foci inter-nally and no nasal obstruction, nasal mucus or epistaxis. After hospitalization, a right frontal sinus fenestration and tumor resection plus nasofrontal duct reconstruction combined with nasal endoscopic <b>frontal</b> <b>recess</b> open surgery was conducted under general anesthesia. Following the tumor resection, the frontal sinus bone lamella was reset and fixed with a titanium bone fixation set. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was of ossifying fibroma. At the postoperative 5 ‑year follow‑up there was no tumor recurrence and nasal endoscopy revealed an unobstructed nasofrontal duct opening...|$|E
