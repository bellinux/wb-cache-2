5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a <b>good</b> <b>defense.</b> When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} on the Muslim left wing which Yazid commanded was considerably more serious. Whilst the Muslim right wing enjoyed assistance from the mobile guard, the left wing did not and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. Here the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a <b>good</b> <b>defense.</b> Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps {{and for a moment}} Vahan's plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken, though their morale was severely damaged.|$|E

40|$|Today, leading defense {{firms are}} {{concentrated}} into just two distinct blocs – those {{based in the}} US and those in Western Europe. All US defense firms and most European ones are private. Market structure may thus {{play an important role}} in determining procurement levels as well as defense policies in the US and Europe. This paper focuses on the interactions between defense needs and market structure. It presents a model in which two producer blocs (representing the US and Europe) produce an identical homogeneous <b>defense</b> <b>good.</b> The “rest of the world ” purchases the <b>defense</b> <b>good</b> from the two producer countries. The security level of each of the two producing countries depends on its purchase of the <b>defense</b> <b>good</b> relative to the amount of <b>defense</b> <b>good</b> purchased by the rest of the world. Each country measures its security level against a target that it sets for itself. The main results of this paper are: (1) Generally, the total world quantity of the <b>defense</b> <b>good</b> is lower when the governments of the producers of the <b>defense</b> <b>good</b> pay the world price (rather than the marginal production cost plus a markup) to their defense industries.

After Hedo Türkoğlu hit a stepback 3-point shot, Howard blocked Gasol's jumper, giving him a single-game NBA Finals record with 9 blocked shots. On the bench to witness it was a previous record holder, his assistant coach Patrick Ewing, who had 8 in Game 5 of the 1994 NBA Finals while with the New York Knicks.

25|$|The {{second game}} was played on 9 November 2014. The opening was the solid Berlin {{variation}} of the Ruy Lopez where Carlsen played 4.d3 instead of the main line 4.0-0 Nxe4. Carlsen gave up the bishop pair to double Anand's c-pawns {{and the result of}} the opening was roughly equal. However, Anand's moves 16...Rd8, 18...Be6, and 19...Ng6 all contributed to making his position more unpleasant. In the heavy-piece endgame Carlsen's active pieces and outpost on e6 gave him a clear advantage. The game ended abruptly when Anand blundered with 34...h5??, allowing 35.Qb7 forcing instant resignation, because there is no <b>good</b> <b>defense</b> to 36.Rxg7+ Kh8 37.Rh7+ Kg8 38.Qg7 with checkmate. 34...Qd2 was the way to fight on but Anand's chances of a successful defence were slim.

At 8:40 into the game Air Force got on the board when Zach Sasser kicked a 32-yd field goal to shrink the deficit to 14-3. But Quinn would respond with a 24-yd pass to Rhema McKnight. Air Force was able to block the Extra Point Attempt and Notre Dame was now up 20-3 to finish up the 1st quarter.

After a Defensive stop by the Irish they got the ball back and on 9 plays drove down field topping it off with Quinn throwing a 13-yd pass to Jeff Samardzija for the Irish's 2nd TD, but Gioia missed the PAT making the score 13-3 Notre Dame.

Although Russell was a good runner and jumper and had large hands, he simply {{did not understand the}} game and was cut from the team in junior high school.

However, coach George Powles saw Russell's raw athletic potential and encouraged him to work on his fundamentals. Since Russell's previous experiences with white authority figures were often negative, he was delighted to receive warm words from his white coach. He worked hard and used the benefits of a growth spurt to become a decent basketball player, {{but it was not until}} his junior and senior years that he began to excel, winning back to back high school state championships. Russell soon became noted for his unusual style of defense. He later recalled, [...] "To play <b>good</b> <b>defense...</b> it was told back then that you had to stay flatfooted at all times to react quickly. When I started to jump to make defensive plays and to block shots, I was initially corrected, but I stuck with it, and it paid off." [...] Russell, in an autobiographical account, notes while on a California High School All-Stars tour, he became obsessed with studying and memorizing other players’ moves (e.g., footwork such as which foot they moved first on which play) as preparation for defending against them, which including practicing in front of a mirror at night. Russell further described himself as an avid reader of Dell Magazines' 1950s sports publications, which he used to scout opponents' moves for the purpose defending against them.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{they invest}} {{so much energy}} in their territories, beavers are {{intolerant}} of intruders and the holder of the territory {{is more likely to}} escalate an aggressive encounter.

Scent marking increases in August during the dispersal of yearlings, in an attempt to prevent them from intruding on territories.

The number of Indians engaged against Carson in this battle has been estimated as high as 3,000, but that is likely an exaggeration. The total number of warriors possessed by the Comanche, Kiowa and Kiowa Apache probably did not total anywhere near 3,000. As the Kiowa village consisted of 176 lodges and the Comanche village of about 500 lodges, {{it is unlikely that}} the total Indian force numbered more than two fighting men per lodge or 1,300. As it was, Carson left six dead and 25 wounded, including one Indian scout killed and four wounded, while he estimated that the Comanche and Kiowa suffered approximately 50-60 deaths and as many as 100 wounded. The official U.S. Army report on the battle, however, estimated an Indian loss of a total of 60 killed and wounded.
