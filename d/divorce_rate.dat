A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce.

The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E

We find that the different reforms that "made divorce easier" were followed by significant increases in <b>divorce</b> <b>rates.</b> The effect of no-fault legislation was strong and permanent, while unilateral reforms only had a temporary effect on <b>divorce</b> <b>rates.</b> Overall, we estimate that the legal reforms account for about 20 percent of the increase in <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> in Europe between 1960 and 2002. <b>divorce</b> <b>rates,</b> legislation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} available data on trends in divorce in the United States. We find that both vital statistics and retrospective survey data on divorce after 1990 underestimate recent marital instability. These flawed data have led some analysts to conclude that divorce has been stable or declining {{for the past three}} decades. Using new data from the American Community Survey and controlling for changes in the age composition of the married population, we conclude that there was actually a substantial increase in age-standardized <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> between 1990 and 2008. <b>Divorce</b> <b>rates</b> have doubled {{over the past two decades}} among persons over age 35. Among the youngest couples, however, <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> are stable or declining. If current trends continue, overall age-standardized <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> could level off or even decline over the next few decades. We argue that the leveling of divorce among persons born since 1980 probably reflects the increasing selectivity of marriage...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a model in which agents choose voice, exit, or stay options when their marital {{condition}} becomes bad. The "voice" option {{can be interpreted as}} a spouse's effort or "investment" in the household to resolve his/her dissatisfaction and improve the marital condition. If a spouse hopes to divorce, he/she chooses the "exit" option. If a spouse does not hope to express his/her opinion and divorce, he/she chooses the "stay" option. We focus on the role of "exit" and "voice" in a marriage and investigate the effects of a divorce law that is based on fault or no-fault on <b>divorce</b> <b>rates.</b> Our study shows that <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> tend to be too high under a unilateral divorce law in the non-transferable utility case.
