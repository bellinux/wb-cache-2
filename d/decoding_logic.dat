40|$|Abstract- Error {{detection}} {{in memory}} applications was proposed {{to accelerate the}} majority <b>logic</b> <b>decoding</b> of difference set low density parity check codes. This is useful as majority <b>logic</b> <b>decoding</b> can be implemented serially with simple hardware but requires a large decoding time. For memory applications, this increases the memory access time. The method detects whether a word has errors in the first iterations of majority <b>logic</b> <b>decoding,</b> and {{when there are no}} errors the decoding ends without completing the rest of the iterations. Since most words in a memory will be error free, the average decoding time is greatly reduced. In this brief, the application of a similar technique to a class of Euclidean geometry low density parity check (EG-LDPC) codes that are one step majority logic decodable. The results obtained show that the method is also effective for EG-LDPC codes.

40|$|FEC codes mainly {{consist of}} two major categories: Block Codes and Convolutional Codes. The major {{difference}} between them is that convolutional codes have memory bits whereas block codes do not. In general, FEC codes add redundancies to the original information so that the receiver can detect and correct errors appeared during transmission. Error correcting capability is vital since in FEC codes it is not practical to resend information changed by the channel noise. As a result, high performance FEC codes should be implemented to mitigate effect of noise and any unwanted signals.
