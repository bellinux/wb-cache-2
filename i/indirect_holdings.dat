5000|$|The {{total value}} of equity-backed {{securities}} in the United States rose over 600% in the 25 years between 1989 and 2012 as market capitalization expanded from $2,790 billion to $18,668 billion. Direct ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000. Indirect participation {{in the form of}} retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time. [...] Rydqvist, Spizman, and Strebulaev attribute the differential growth in direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>holdings</b> to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the number of}} foreign-origin persons in the United States classified by {{their country of origin}} from census data in 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000. We find, both in cross-sectional tests and in panel data tests, that the size of the foreign-origin group from a country living in the U. S. is positively correlated with U. S. investments in that country. This national origin bias is strong for direct (FDI) and modest for <b>indirect</b> (equity <b>holdings)</b> investments. The results continue to hold even after controlling for the "fundamentals" hypothesized to affect foreign investments. The other economic geography variables of a country [...] physical distance from the U. S., race, language and religion [...] do not seem to affect US investments in that country. ...|$|R
40|$|In many {{countries}} around the world, stock and real estate {{are the two most}} important asset classes in household portfolios. This is particularly the case in Australia where fund assets (very heavily weighted toward equity) in superannuation (Australia’s system of compulsory private pensions) now account for some $ 1. 3 trillion and are now third-ranked in the OECD in terms of the percentage of GDP (90. 9 %) after the Netherlands and Iceland and well above the OECD average of 71. 6 %. Of course, this excludes direct equity <b>holdings</b> and additional <b>indirect</b> equity <b>holdings</b> in the form of trusts. As shown in Table 1, we could conservatively argue that 82 % of the Australian population hold equity holdings indirectly in the form of superannuation and 34 % directly, with possibly another 3 % in the form of equity trusts, potentially representing up to 65 % of household financial assets and 13 % of all household assets. A similar situation exists with real estate, especially given that Australians have among the world’s highest rates of homeownership, with 67 % of households owning or purchasing their own home and 20...|$|R
50|$|Rates of {{participation}} {{and the value}} of holdings differs significantly across strata of income. In the bottom quintile of income, 5.5% of households directly own stock and 10.7% hold stocks indirectly in the form of retirement accounts. The top decile of income has a direct participation rate of 47.5% and an indirect participation rate in the form of retirement accounts of 89.6%. The median value of directly owned stock in the bottom quintile of income is $4,000 and is $78,600 in the top decile of income as of 2007. The median value of indirectly held stock in the form of retirement accounts for the same two groups in the same year is $6,300 and $214,800 respectively. Since the Great Recession of 2008 households in {{the bottom half of the}} income distribution have lessened their participation rate both directly and indirectly from 53.2% in 2007 to 48.8% in 2013, while over the same time period households in the top decile of the income distribution slightly increased participation 91.7% to 92.1%. The mean value of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>holdings</b> at the bottom half of the income distribution moved slightly downward from $53,800 in 2007 to $53,600 in 2013. In the top decile, mean value of all holdings fell from $982,000 to $969,300 in the same time. The mean value of all stock holdings across the entire income distribution is valued at $269,900 as of 2013.|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{main purpose}} of the study is to examine the {{influence}} of family directors on the firm performance of public listed companies (PLCs) in Malaysia. This study provides empirical evidence on the agency problems between controlling shareholders and minority interests in the concentrated ownership setting. Design/methodology/approach Samples of the study are 112 PLCs in year 2006. Two measures of firm performance are used: return on assets (ROA) and Tobin’s Q. Managerial ownership refers to the percentage shareholdings of executive directors with direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>holdings.</b> It was further categorized into family ownership and non-family ownership. Findings In relation to ROA, managerial ownership is found positively significant. The results also show that the positive relationship between managerial ownership is contributed by the managerial-non-family ownership. In relation to Tobin’s Q, the results show a U-shape with turning point at 31. 38...|$|E
40|$|Complex {{structure}} of ownership like cross-ownership, rings, and pyramids {{are common in}} Continental Europe, Eastern Europe, and in Asia. This paper aims at dissecting these complex features by a proper measurement of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>holdings.</b> Building on Brioschi et al. (1989), we use the input-output matrix methodology and we add control considerations in the matrix calculations to derive a straightforward method of quantifying the separation between ownership and control for a firm or a shareholder, named the "separation ratio". After giving {{an overview of the}} full ownership {{structure of}} the listed Belgian companies, we present and apply our method to a database of more than 800 companies and individuals linked to the Belgian listed firms. Next, we replicate the approach with data from several European countries and the United States. These international comparisons allow evaluating the interactions between the economic environment of a country, and its corporate governance features.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{addressed}} household participation in the stock market, but relatively few have focused on household stock trading behavior. Household trading {{is important for the}} stock market, as households own more than 40 % of the NYSE capitalization directly and can also influence trading patterns of institutional investors by adjusting their <b>indirect</b> stock <b>holdings.</b> Existing studies based on administrative data offer conflicting results. Discount brokerage data show excessive trading to the detriment of stockholders, while data on retirement accounts indicate extreme inactivity. This paper uses data representative of the population to document the extent of household portfolio inertia and to link it to household characteristics and to stock market movements. We document considerable portfolio inertia, as regards both changing stockholding participation status and trading stocks, and find that specific household characteristics contribute to the tendency to exhibit such inertia. Although our findings suggest some dependence of trading directly-held equity through brokerage accounts on the performance of the stock market index, they do not indicate that the recent expansion in the stockholder base and the experience of the stock market downswing have significantly altered the overall propensity of households to trade in stocks or to switch participation status in a way that could contribute to stock market instability.

40|$|Outsourcing of {{municipal}} tasks {{from the core}} budget to municipal enterprises tends to distort {{the perception of the}} actual financial position, net assets and results of operations of the German local governments. Excess supply or -demand of/for local public services might be possible consequences of this development. Hence, this article attempts to develop a more comprehensive picture of the municipal budgetary position by a simultaneous analysis of selected indicators. Furthermore, the methodological problems of the calculations are illustrated. If these shadow budgets are taken into account, the total per capita revenues, -investments and -debts will increase by approximately one third to 50 %. However, the share of the municipal employees belonging to the core administration in the total number {{of municipal}} employees is 75 %. Although only about 22 % of the expenditures for certain voluntary municipal tasks have been outsourced, {{there seems to be an}} upward trend. The study also indicates that there are significant differences between Eastern and Western German cities. These include the higher revenues from municipal enterprises, the higher debts per capita and the higher expenditures on culture, sports, leisure services or the promotion of science in Eastern Germany. The results should be interpreted carefully due to some shortcomings of the official statistics. For example, internal cash flows cannot be totally eliminated. Moreover, <b>indirect</b> municipal majority <b>holdings</b> as well as the municipal savings banks are not included in the results. All in all, it remains to be seen whether the initiated reforms concerning the introduction of double-entry accounting into the local government budgeting system will help to achieve the ideal goal of a meaningful “consolidated financial statement” for the “city company”. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the Hungarian legal framework regulating disclosure of information about listed firms at the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE), and we analyze the concentration and types of blockholders at these firms for the years 1996 - 2000. Disclosure rules on the BSE became EU-compatible only very recently, and so far <b>indirect</b> <b>holdings</b> were not reported. The concentration of direct ownership is nonetheless rather high, the largest owner having 46. 2 percent on average in May 2000. While this figure {{is similar to the}} corresponding levels in continental Europe, it is more unusual that the second and third largest blockholders also have large shares (on average 20. 2 and 10. 4 at the same date). Concentration was quite stable during 1996 - 1999, while it decreased somewhat in 2000. The most prevalent type of owner is foreign investor, which had over 50 percent of all blockholdings in 2000, although domestic private blockholders and the state are also present in a significant number of firms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} Australian corporate bond issuance since the early 20 th century, based on a new unit-record dataset that we have compiled. Issuance trends have changed significantly {{over the past century}} as bond markets have become more diverse, sophisticated and globally integrated. A number of changes over the past century are discussed: (i) today, issuance is largely by private entities whereas it was dominated by government-owned corporations historically; (ii) the issuer base has shifted from being mostly non-financial corporations towards banks; (iii) a wide range of entities are now able to tap the bond market; (iv) Australian corporations now raise a large share of funds offshore; and (v) the investor base has shifted away from direct holdings by households towards <b>indirect</b> <b>holdings</b> through superannuation/managed funds and holdings by non-residents. These developments have largely been due to: the evolution {{of the structure of the}} Australian economy; privatisations; and changes in the regulatory landscape, particularly the deregulation of the banking system in the 1980 s, and the floating of the exchange rate and abolition of capital controls in 1983. 33 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between capital structure, managerial equity ownership, corporate governance, and firm value in firms suspected of having ‘extreme’ agency problems. Overall, we find that leverage {{plays a role in}} mitigating the problems that result from the separation of control rights from cash flow rights and a lack of corporate governance. Our results also suggest the wealth effect of leverage is confined to specific forms of debt capital and depends upon key firm- and market-specific characteristics. We find that firms headquartered in emerging markets experience average positive abnormal returns of 68 basis points during renewal or reissue of internationally-syndicated term loans. With the exception of initial Eurobond issues, no other form of debt capital, including domestic bonds or Yankee bonds, creates value for outside shareholders of these firms. Moreover, the wealth effect of syndicated term loans is confined to those firms in which management undertakes large ‘discretionary’ expenditures and has levered their cash flow rights into larger control rights through <b>indirect</b> <b>holdings</b> (i. e. pyramids). Finally, our research suggests that cross-sectional studies can lead to false inferences when testing theories tha...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{shows the}} {{regulation}} of particular duties of investors and issuers in relation to direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>holdings</b> of publicly listed shares, building together an early warning system indicating an imminent change of control in companies. The early warning system is based on several duties, including: (1) the duty to disclose changes in the shareholdings in public companies above and below certain thresholds; (2) the duty to submit a takeover bid after reaching a certain threshold (the so-called controlling stake) or to publish forthwith a decision to launch a voluntary bid; (3) the duty to disclose {{in a timely manner}} relevant price-sensitive information in order to prevent insider dealing, as well as not to distribute any misleading information that would manipulate the market. The system is underpinned by the concept of ‘acting in concert’ whereby these three duties can be triggered with respect to more investors acting as a group with a view to acquiring or divesting shares in a company in order to influence the management of the company who would otherwise, individually, remain below the relevant thresholds. The purpose of the early warning system is to protect participants of the capital markets, minority shareholders and other stakeholders (management board members, creditors, employees, local communities, etc). The protection is achieved through increased transparency of the capital markets which enables the timely reaction of all interested parties: either by selling or buying the shares or by the activation of defence strategies before the actual change of control takes place. The paper also comments on recent changes in EU and German securities legislation...|$|E
