5|$|Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine <b>ecoregion,</b> {{which consists}} mainly of dense forest, comprises 53percent of Banff's area. 27percent {{of the park}} is located above the tree line, in the alpine <b>ecoregion.</b> The tree line in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane <b>ecoregion.</b> Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are {{more common in the}} subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.|$|E

5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{divides the}} waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three {{freshwater}} ecoregions, naming them Columbia Glaciated, Columbia Unglaciated, and Upper Snake. The Columbia Glaciated <b>ecoregion,</b> making up {{about a third of the}} total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the Pleistocene. The <b>ecoregion</b> includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay rivers. The effects of glaciation include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish. The Upper Snake <b>ecoregion</b> is defined as the Snake River watershed above Shoshone Falls, which totally blocks fish migration. This region has 14species of fish, many of which are endemic. The Columbia Unglaciated <b>ecoregion</b> makes up the rest of the watershed. It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon, John Day, Deschutes, and lower Snake Rivers. Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms of freshwater species diversity. There are 35species of fish, of which four are endemic. There are also high levels of mollusk endemism.|$|E
40|$|Patterns of {{endemism}} {{of terrestrial}} mammals inhabiting Mexico are analyzed by applying Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) to 47 <b>ecoregions.</b> The <b>ecoregions</b> were classified in 2 main groups: <b>ecoregions</b> of the Baja California Peninsula and <b>ecoregions</b> {{of the rest}} of the country. We found 27 <b>ecoregions</b> with characteristic taxa, and 5 areas of endemism: Northern High Plateau, Baja California, Chiapas, Isthmus, and Yucatan Peninsula. Groups of <b>ecoregions</b> arc basically congruent with other regionalization schemes previously proposed for the country...|$|R
50|$|The WWF has {{identified}} 867 terrestrial <b>ecoregions</b> across the Earth's land surface, {{as well as}} freshwater and marine <b>ecoregions.</b> The goal of this classification system {{is to ensure that}} the full range of ecosystems will be represented in regional conservation and development strategies. Of these <b>ecoregions,</b> the WWF selected the Global 200 as the <b>ecoregions</b> most crucial to the conservation of global biodiversity. The Global 200 list actually contains 238 <b>ecoregions,</b> made up of 142 terrestrial, 53 freshwater, and 43 marine <b>ecoregions.</b>|$|R
30|$|Subtropical <b>ecoregions</b> at {{southern}} China and tropical <b>ecoregions</b> at Indochina {{were more important}} than temperate <b>ecoregions</b> on playing source areas of NEASTs. Geographical distribution ranges of NEASTs implied {{that most of the}} NEASTs were probably migrated from topical or subtropical <b>ecoregions</b> of Asian continent to Taiwan.|$|R
5|$|A smaller unit of size {{is called}} a microecosystem. For example, a {{microsystem}} can be a stone and all the life under it. A macroecosystem might involve a whole <b>ecoregion,</b> with its drainage basin.|$|E

5|$|In the Canadian {{portion of}} the Columbia Basin, almost half of {{which is part of}} the Kootenay River basin, there are 447 species of {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. Most of the Kootenay basin lies within the Columbia Glaciated <b>ecoregion</b> which encompasses much of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana and southern British Columbia. Fish fauna in the region are largely shared with those of the Columbia Unglaciated <b>ecoregion</b> to the south, which has about fifty species of fish and only one endemic species. There are no endemic fish within the Columbia Glaciated region itself.|$|E
30|$|The 34 {{lists of}} NEAST of <b>ecoregions</b> {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} geographical distributions of angiosperms and to analyze floristic similarities among Taiwan and <b>ecoregions.</b> The NEASTs were transformed into presence data in <b>ecoregions</b> (see Additional file 1 : Appendix S 1). The presence data of NEASTs {{were used for the}} analysis in this study to minimize the bias of data information (Beck et al. 2014; Yesson et al. 2007). NEASTs were evaluated their geographical distribution patterns in Asia. Geographical distribution range of a NEAST was represented by the collection of <b>ecoregions</b> that a NEAST is present. The <b>ecoregions</b> in Asia were categorized into three groups, tropical, subtropical and temperate, according to the published description of <b>ecoregions</b> in WWF. The tropical, subtropical and temperate <b>ecoregions</b> were further subdivided into several sub-regions in this study. The tropical <b>ecoregions</b> were divided into two sub-regions that were <b>ecoregions</b> at tropical continents and tropical islands. The subtropical <b>ecoregions</b> were divided into four sub-regions that were southern slopes of Himalaya, southwest China, southeast China, and southern islands of Japan. The temperate <b>ecoregions</b> were divided into Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Takla-Makan-Gobi Desert, Mongolia and Siberia, northeast China, Korea peninsula, and northern islands of Japan. Whether the distribution ranges of NEASTs over these sub-regions or not are the division criterions of distribution types.|$|R

30|$|There are 3275 {{angiosperm}} {{species in}} Taiwan {{derived from the}} dataset of GBIF. Among them, 847 are endemic and 2428 are NEASTs. Geographical distribution ranges of the 2428 NEASTs were categorized into 7 distribution groups. They were widely distribution from equator to Siberia (27 species), tropical <b>ecoregions</b> (345 species), tropical and subtropical <b>ecoregions</b> (663 species), tropical to temperate <b>ecoregions</b> (591 species), subtropical <b>ecoregions</b> (265 species), subtropical to temperate <b>ecoregions</b> (387 species), and temperate <b>ecoregions</b> (150 species). Results of similarity indices and cluster analysis demonstrated that high floristic similarities were observed among GLTs at lowland and southern Taiwan and tropical and subtropical <b>ecoregions</b> in Asia. GLTs at high mountains were assumed to have floristic similarity with temperate <b>ecoregions</b> in Asia, whereas the assumption was not supported by our analysis. It is partly because of that angiosperms with tropical and subtropical distributions extend their ranges from low to high elevations in Taiwan.|$|R
5|$|The Upper Snake {{freshwater}} <b>ecoregion</b> includes most {{of southeastern}} Idaho and extends into small portions of Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada, including major freshwater habitats such as Jackson Lake. Compared {{to the lower}} Snake River {{and the rest of}} the Columbia River's watershed, the Upper Snake <b>ecoregion</b> has a high level of endemism, especially among freshwater molluscs such as snails and clams. There are at least 21 snail and clam species of special concern, including 15 that appear to exist only in single clusters. There are 14 fish species found in the Upper Snake region that do not occur elsewhere in the Columbia's watershed, but which do occur in Bonneville freshwater <b>ecoregion</b> of western Utah, part of the Great Basin and related to the prehistoric Lake Bonneville. The Wood River sculpin (Cottus leiopomus) is endemic to the Wood River. The Shoshone sculpin (Cottus greenei) is endemic to the small portion of the Snake River between Shoshone Falls and the Wood River.|$|E
5|$|The park protects {{part of the}} Peruvian Yungas <b>ecoregion.</b> A {{variety of}} {{ecological}} communities exist within the park including wet montane forests, high-elevation grasslands above 3000 m, rivers, and small lakes.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>ecoregion</b> remains ecologically intact, {{it faces}} {{conservation}} challenges {{that include the}} negative affects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of the trees {{that make up the}} forest composition, and habitat fragmentation as a result of urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the Northern goshawk.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecology of}} California can be {{understood}} by dividing the state {{into a number of}} <b>ecoregions,</b> which contain distinct ecological communities of plants and animals in a contiguous region. The <b>ecoregions</b> of California can be grouped into four major groups: desert <b>ecoregions</b> (such as the Mojave Desert), Mediterranean <b>ecoregions</b> (such as the Central Valley), forested mountains (such as the Sierra Nevada), and coastal forests.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ecoregions</b> of Madagascar, {{as defined}} by the World Wildlife Fund, include seven terrestrial, five freshwater, and two marine <b>ecoregions.</b> Madagascar's diverse natural {{habitats}} harbour a rich fauna and flora with high levels of endemism, but most <b>ecoregions</b> suffer from habitat loss.|$|R
5000|$|Terrestrial <b>ecoregions</b> are land <b>ecoregions,</b> as {{distinct}} from freshwater and marine <b>ecoregions.</b> In this context, terrestrial is used to mean [...] "of land" [...] (soil and rock), rather than the more general sense [...] "of Earth" [...] (which includes land and oceans).|$|R
5|$|The {{species was}} found in the Brazilian {{semi-arid}} region in the National Park of Catimbau, in July 2007. It was described as new to science in a 2010 Mycotaxon publication by Felipe Wartchow of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. L.rupestris is one of 19 species of Lactarius known from Brazil. The epithet rupestris refers to the campos rupestres montane savanna—the <b>ecoregion</b> where the type species was collected.|$|E
5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the Western High Plateau, although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests <b>ecoregion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spokane {{is within}} the Northern/Canadian Rockies <b>ecoregion,</b> which {{supports}} an abundance of wildlife {{in part because of}} its varied geology and natural history. The area contains a wide range of vegetation, from densely wooded coniferous forests to rolling grassy hills and meadows. Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir are common in the drier and lower elevation areas throughout the region. The ponderosa pine is the official tree of the City of Spokane, which is where specimens were first collected by botanist David Douglas in 1826.|$|E

5|$|The Western Ghats {{are home}} to four {{tropical}} and subtropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregions – the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, North Western Ghats montane rain forests, South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, and South Western Ghats montane rain forests. The northern portion of the range is generally drier than the southern portion, and at lower elevations makes up the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests <b>ecoregion,</b> with mostly deciduous forests made up predominantly of teak. Above 1,000 meters elevation are the cooler and wetter North Western Ghats montane rain forests, whose evergreen forests are characterised by trees of family Lauraceae.|$|E
5|$|The bronze quoll (D. spartacus) is {{the only}} mammal found in the Trans Fly <b>ecoregion,</b> but not in {{northern}} Australia. It {{is found in the}} southern part of New Guinea south of the Fly River. Rising sea levels due to an increase in global temperature caused a land bridge that once connected Australia and New guinea to be covered up with water. A 2007 study conducted by the University of New South Wales suggests the bronze quoll is closely related to the western quoll, their ancestors diverging with the separation of land masses.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} of Strandzha evolved {{before the}} formation of the Bosphorus Strait when the whole southern Black Sea coast was linked and represents the westernmost extension of the Euxine-Colchic <b>ecoregion.</b> Because of the proximity of three seas, the Black Sea, the Marmara Sea and the Aegean Sea, Strandzha remained unaffected by the Quaternary glaciation and retained its mild and relatively humid climate. Under those conditions the region has preserved relict species from the Neogene.|$|E

Rock formations in the watershed include the Pottsville Group and the Llewellyn Formation. These are found on the northern side of the creek's valley.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island is a {{distinct}} terrestrial <b>ecoregion</b> known as the Lord Howe Island subtropical forests. It {{is part of the}} Australasia ecozone and shares many biotic affinities with Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. Almost half of the island's native plants are endemic and many of the island's unique plants grow on or around the mountain summits where the height has allowed the development of a true cloud forest and many different microhabitats from sealevel to the summits. One of the best known is Howea, an endemic genus of palms (Arecaceae) that are commonly known as kentia palms and make handsome houseplants. Annual exports provide a revenue of over A$2million, providing the only major industry on the island apart from tourism.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Rockies <b>ecoregion</b> {{supports}} 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a {{high concentration}} of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish of Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has been making a recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.|$|E
