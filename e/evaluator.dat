In addition, the study examined the effect of gender on classroom observation and analysis skills. A modified pretest/posttest control group design was used. The data for this study were gathered from 77 teacher <b>evaluators</b> in the Des Moines Independent Community School District, Des Moines, Iowa during the 1985 - 1986 school year.

The <b>evaluator</b> would be aware {{that one of the}} two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech.

Methods and Procedures The sample utilized for this study consisted of 30 classroom teachers, 30 trained instructional <b>evaluators,</b> and 120 students from a population that was selected from a metropolitan high school in which the staff and student body represented a diverse make-up. Results The results of this study were statistically insignificant because there were demographic differences, perceptual differences and affective differences among the classroom teachers, trained instructional <b>evaluators</b> and student <b>evaluators.</b> Therefore, data indicated that there was no significant relationship between the ratings by trained instructional <b>evaluators</b> and student <b>evaluators</b> on the classroom performance of high school teachers. Conclusions and Recommendations 1. Ratings of students could be utilized by teachers as feedback for classroom instruction. 2.

40|$|Abstract. We used {{eye-tracking}} {{to study}} 28 users when they evaluated result lists produced by web search engines. Based on their different evaluation styles, the users {{were divided into}} economic and exhaustive <b>evaluators.</b> Economic <b>evaluators</b> made their decision about the next action (e. g., query re-formulation, following a link) faster and based on less information than exhaustive <b>evaluators.</b> The economic evaluation style was especially beneficial {{when most of the}} results in the result page were relevant. In these tasks, the task times were significantly shorter for economic than for exhaustive <b>evaluators.</b> The results suggested that economic <b>evaluators</b> were more experienced with computers than exhaustive <b>evaluators.</b> Thus, the result evaluation style seems to evolve towards a more economic style as the users gain more experience. 1 Introduction and Related Work To date, the process of evaluating result lists of web search engines has received little attention.
