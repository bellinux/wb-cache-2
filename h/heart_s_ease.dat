30|$|In {{addition}} to ECG and PPG, phonocardiogram (PCG), {{the recording of}} the sounds and murmurs made by heart during a cardiac cycle, can be effectively employed to study and monitor the activities of heart. Such sounds are typically recorded using a device called phonocardiograph. The mechanical activity of heart due to its physical movement produces four distinct sounds or beats which are named as first normal <b>heart</b> sound (<b>S</b> 1), second normal <b>heart</b> sound (<b>S</b> 2), third abnormal <b>heart</b> sound (<b>S</b> 3), and fourth abnormal <b>heart</b> sound (<b>S</b> 4). S 1 and S 2 are normal sounds while S 3, S 4, murmurs, and certain other sounds usually refer to some disease or anomaly. Murmur is a noisy heart sound that can be heard when the heart valve is shut but the blood continues to flow. S 1 is usually low frequency and high-amplitude signal while S 2 has high frequency and low amplitude. In some cases, {{it is also possible}} to encounter S 1 having low amplitude than S 2 as elaborated in [7].|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method {{approach}} is proposed for automatic segmentation of <b>heart</b> sounds (<b>S</b> 1, S 2) based on wavelet transform. Unlike many other approaches, this method {{does not use}} ECG as reference for detection. The applied criterion for segmentation {{is based on a}} very important physiologic attribute of heart which is the difference between the pressure of heart valves while opening and closing which causes high frequency components in heart sound. The main idea in this paper is to extract detail and approximation wavelet coefficients of heart sound (PCG) to detect the heart cycle via the Shannon energy of coefficients and then segment S 1 and S 2. The results show the present algorithm is capable of accurate segmentation of 90 % of first <b>heart</b> sounds (<b>S</b> 1) and 88. 9 % of second <b>heart</b> sounds (<b>S</b> 2) ...|$|R

40|$|Amongst {{its textual}} treasures, the Mitchell Library holds two {{textiles}} associated with Captain Cook. One is a silk sampler printed with a late eighteenth-century {{map of the}} world embroidered with the routes of Cook 2 ̆ 7 s three voyages. Threads of empire stretch across a globe framed in a wreath of delicately embroidered English garden flowers - roses, heart 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ease</b> and auricula. The other textile is an unfinished waistcoat worked in coloured silks (supposedly by Cook 2 ̆ 7 s mother) in the anticipation that he would wear it at court on returning from his third voyage. The long and short stitch, spangles and tambour-work characteristic of English eighteenth-century embroidery have been stitched on Tahitian tapa cloth, probably given to Cook on his first voyage. This can be read both as the imperial centre inscribing its culture on that of indigenous peoples as well as the hybridity generated by British exploration and colonisation (Fletcher 11 - 12) ...|$|R

Some of the benefits of the PyBoard were found to be it 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ease</b> of rapid prototyping, a fairly large collection of libraries with useful tools for microcontrollers, and many powerful abstractions that take care of tedious programming details automatically.

40|$|Diagnosing heart {{diseases}} with a stethoscope and ECG are {{two fundamental}} methods {{because of its}} efficiency, simplicity and noninvasive property [1]. However it takes a skilled and experienced doctor {{to be able to}} discover the heart condition by using a stethoscope [2]. With the advancement of computer systems in terms of its reproducibility, consistency and speed, it is vital in aiding the cardiologists in diagnosing tasks. The heart sounds is produced from the mechanical actions of the heart. These mechanical pumping actions correlate with the electrical activity of the heart, that can be picked up by the ECG. The heart sounds repeat with two normal sounds, that is the first <b>heart</b> sound (<b>S</b> 1) and the second <b>heart</b> sound (<b>S</b> 2). However, there could be the third and fourth <b>heart</b> sound (<b>S</b> 3 & S 4) in some conditions. The heart sounds and ECG signals are depicted in Figure 2. 1.

40|$|Abstract. By pumping calcium {{from the}} cytosol to the ER, sarco/endoplasmic {{reticulum}} calcium ATPases (SERCAs) {{play a major}} role in the control of calcium signaling. We describe two SERCA 1 splice variants (S 1 Ts) characterized by exon 4 and/or exon 11 splicing, encoding COOH terminally truncated proteins, having only one of the seven calcium-binding residues, and thus unable to pump calcium. As shown by semiquantitative RT-PCR, S 1 T transcripts are differentially expressed in several adult and fetal human tissues, but not in skeletal muscle and <b>heart.</b> <b>S</b> 1 T proteins expression was detected by Western blot in nontransfected cell lines.

Only two of the ten tracks on the album are solely attributed to Degraw, and he speaks often about collaborating with the other writers and producers in the video of the BUILD series interview. In the same video, when asked which track is his baby, he says he can’t pick a favorite but the one he probably worked the hardest on to get it just right was “You Make My <b>Heart</b> <b>Sing</b> Louder” with Ricky Reed. He also notes that in the studio, Ricky and Gavin originally nicknamed the track “My Well and Wall.” It’s his mother’s favorite track from the album.|$|R

40|$|Business are gratefully acknowledged. Comments are welcome. The Fiscal Impact of the Brain Drain: Indian Emigration to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Easing</b> {{immigration}} restrictions for the highly skilled {{in developed countries}} portend a future of increased human capital outflows from developing countries. The myriad consequences of these developments for developing countries include the direct loss of the fiscal contributions of these highly skilled individuals. This paper analyzes the fiscal impact of this loss of talent for a developing country by examining human capital flows from India to the U. S. The escalation of the emigration of highly skilled professionals from India to the U. S is examined by surveying evidence on {{the changing nature of}} the Indian-born in the U. S. during the 1990 s. The loss of talent to India during the 1990 s was dramatic and highly concentrated amongst the prime-age work force, the highly educated and high earners. In order to estimate the fiscal losses associated with these emigrants, this paper first estimates what these emigrants would have earned in India, and then integrates the resulting counterfactual distributions with details of the Indian fiscal system to estimate fiscal impacts.

The Instantaneous Energy of ECG is performed to verify the occurrence of S 1 and S 2 as it is widely accepted pathologically that Phonocardiogram (PCG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) are two noninvasive source of information depicting the cardiac activity [6]. The ECG is a surface measurement of the electrical potential generated by electrical activity in cardiac tissues.
