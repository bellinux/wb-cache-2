5000|$|Apple MultiMedia <b>Display</b> <b>connector</b> (HDI-45) used on some [...] "AV" [...] model Centris, Quadra and the first-generation (NuBus) Power Macintosh machines.|$|E
50|$|Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector</b> (ADC), {{which carries}} DVI, VGA, USB {{and power in}} one {{connector}} was used on the PowerMac G4 and early models of the PowerMac G5.|$|E
50|$|FDI or Flexible Display Interface is an {{interconnect}} {{created by}} Intel {{in order to}} allow the communication of the HD Graphics integrated GPU found on supported CPUs with the PCH southbridge where <b>display</b> <b>connectors</b> are attached. It provides a path between an Intel processor and an Intel southbridge on a computer motherboard which carries display data from the graphics controller (North Display) of the Intel processor package to the <b>display</b> <b>connectors</b> attached at some PCH (South Display) versions. It is based on DisplayPort standard. Currently it supports 2 independent 4-bit fixed frequency links/channels/pipes at 2.7Gbit/s data rate. It was first used with the 2010 Core i3, i5 processors and H55, H57, Q57, 3450 southbridges released in 2010. FDI enabled processors require FDI enabled southbridge in order to utilize the graphics controller capability, thus boards based on P55, PM55, and P67 {{will not be able to}} take advantage of the graphics controller present on later processors. An FDI capable southbridge and CPU pair is not usable without the existence of the appropriate video connectors on the mainboard.|$|R

50|$|Articles such {{as those}} from The Register {{sometimes}} mistake the P&D port as an alternative form of the Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector,</b> but ADC carries higher current, has different pin layout, and does not support FireWire.|$|E
5000|$|The Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector</b> (ADC) is a {{proprietary}} {{modification of the}} DVI connector that combines analog and digital video signals, USB, and power all in one cable. Apple used ADC for its LCD-based Apple Cinema Displays and their final CRT displays, before deciding to use standard DVI connectors on later models.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} {{proprietary}} systems incompatible with standard AGP; for example, Apple Power Macintosh computers with the Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector</b> (ADC) {{have an extra}} connector which delivers power to the attached display. Some cards designed {{to work with a}} specific CPU architecture (e.g., PC, Apple) may not work with others due to firmware issues.|$|E

50|$|All the Visual Workstations {{supported}} conventional CRT {{monitors and}} had VGA display connectors. As the 230 330, and 550 models used Nvidia Quadro cards they also supported DVI. The SGI 320 and 540 models shipped with the groundbreaking and stylistically matched 1600SW LCD display, using an OpenLDI <b>display</b> <b>connector</b> that required an accessory flat panel adapter. The SGI O2 also supported the 1600SW with an adapter.|$|E
5000|$|A VESA EVC {{connector}} {{is capable}} of carrying analog video (VGA-based) output, video input (composite), FireWire, audio (analogue stereo), and USB signals. Pinout is somewhat similar to the newer VESA Plug and Display. It can be distinguished from a Plug and <b>Display</b> <b>connector</b> by the shell, which is shaped like an isosceles trapezoid similar to the shell of a D-subminiature instead of the [...] "D"-shaped shell of a DVI connector.|$|E
5000|$|The Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector,</b> {{debuted in}} the Apple Studio Display, is {{physically}} incompatible {{with a standard}} DVI connector, as was previously used in the PowerBook G4 and the older Power Mac G4. The Apple DVI to ADC Adapter, which cost $149US at launch but was in 2002 available for $99US, takes USB and DVI connections from the computer, together with power, and combines them into an ADC connection, allowing ADC monitors {{to be used with}} DVI-based machines.|$|E
40|$|A virtual laboratory, SWILAB, {{useful to}} develop and carry out fully {{simulated}} experiences on electrical and electronic circuits by using instrumentation simulators is proposed. SWILAB, running on Windows 95 or superior, includes several instruments like waveform generators, analog and digital oscilloscopes, analog and digital voltmeters and a Device Under Test (circuit simulator), all designed in C++ language. The interfaces between the instruments and the user are like the actual ones and the control panels were designed with a real look (containing all the instrument <b>displays,</b> <b>connectors</b> and control knobs). Particular care was devoted to make actual the action-effect relationship between the knob setting and the command execution. The connections among the electronic instruments and between the instruments and the DUT (Device Under Test) is realized by a SW communication channel and is completely transparent to the user. The connection is performed simply by drag and drop techniques between the connectors to be linked. The virtual laboratory is now used by students of regular courses in several Italian universities and in distance learning courses, with an high satisfaction level and didactic effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{labeling}} {{can have}} {{an enormous impact on}} how a user interacts with a device by increasing intuitiveness, minimizing required training, and ensuring accurate performance. Properly designed labeling presents users with instructions, identifications, markings, symbols, colors, and commands that they already know or can easily intuit. Labeling of medical devices and associated accessories, shipping containers, and wrappings applies to labels, symbols, demarcation lines, shading, positioning, formatting, and markings related to the controls, <b>displays,</b> <b>connectors,</b> and other features of a medical device. Labeling should be the absolute last resort for protecting users from potential risks. General Considerations All equipment elements that are not intuitively obvious, that have some usable functions, or that require identification for other reasons should be labeled or marked. Markings should be positioned so that they are clearly associated with the correct equipment feature and not obscured by hand positions or equipment components. Appropriate markings can enhance the identification of both individual elements and their functional relationships. Labels should be visible at typical viewing distances and angles. General Considerations Labels should be resistant to wear and tear. Ambiguous symbols, codes, or terminology should be avoided. Designing for legibility requires careful analysis of ambient illumination in typical use environments. Consistency of placement, terminology, and coding is critical. All markings should be tested with typical users. Users can be clinicians, caregivers, patients, or maintenance personnel and can vary by age, disability, and other characteristics...|$|R
50|$|The HDI-45 {{was one of}} Apple Computer's {{proprietary}} cable-to-onboard video connectors. This was a 45-pin connector and the HDI {{stood for}} High-Density Interconnect. These connectors were used only in the first generation Power Macintosh computers (the Power Macintosh 6100, 7100 and 8100) specifically for the Apple AudioVision 14 Display. No other <b>display</b> uses this <b>connector.</b> Other various Apple displays and third-party displays could be used with a special adapter that converts this unusual port to a standard DA-15 connector.|$|R
50|$|The first model—the 22-inch Apple Cinema Display—was {{introduced}} in September 1999 alongside the Power Mac G4 and used DVI for video input. It was enclosed in a high-density plastic frame with an easel-style stand {{and had a}} display resolution of 1600×1024. This model was upgraded in July 2000 with the Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector</b> (ADC), which ran DVI, USB, and 28V power through a single connector. It was eventually replaced by a 20-inch model on January 28, 2003, that sported a widescreen display with up to 1680×1050 resolution.|$|E
50|$|For {{connecting}} displays, Apple used a DA-15 connector on {{all models}} {{prior to the}} Blue and White Power Mac G3, which used a VGA connector. The original AGP-based Power Mac G4 used VGA, complemented by a DVI port; almost all later Macs, however, used the Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector</b> {{in addition to a}} VGA or DVI port, until the last revisions of the Power Mac G5 came standard with two DVI ports. Apple includes DVI-to-VGA adapters with its DVI-equipped computers. With the release of the unibody MacBook Pro, DVI was phased out in favor of DisplayPort.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000 the 22" [...] Cinema Displays {{switched}} to the ADC interface, and the 15" [...] Studio Display was remodeled to match the Cinema Display's easel-like form factor and also featured the Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector.</b> In 2001 an LCD-based 17" [...] Studio Display was introduced, with a resolution of 1280x1024. In 2002 Apple introduced the Cinema Display HD which had a 23" [...] widescreen display with a resolution of 1920x1200. In 2003 Apple introduced the 20" [...] Cinema Display to replace the now discontinued 22" [...] display {{and it had a}} resolution of 1680x1050.|$|E

50|$|Also {{commonly}} {{available from}} {{many companies are}} small printers made specifically for calculators which tend to use cash register tape paper, ports and cables for connecting the calculators to a computer and/or another calculator, cassette recorders for recording programmes and data, overhead projector <b>displays</b> and <b>connectors</b> for auxiliary <b>display</b> devices. The earlier programmable calculators {{as well as the}} pocket computers mentioned above also had such things as video interfaces for televisions and composite monitors, 2½ inch mini floppy disc drives, bar-code readers, and standard RS-232 connectivity which provided for other such things as modems, external hard drives and more. The printer selection for the pocket computers was a bit wider as well, including thermal, impact, dot matrix, daisy wheel, 4-colour pen, printers of the type used in simpler printing calculator. Some calculators and pocket computers had external 3½ and 5¼ inch floppy drives, cables for connecting two cassette recorders, cradles containing a printer and/or cassette recorder into which the machine slid, and so on.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design of a new badge {{platform}} for facilitating interaction in large groups of people. We have built this device to be very flexible in order to host a wide variety of interactions in the areas where wearable and social computing converge, from game environments to meetings and conventions. This badge has both RF and IR communication, a 5 x 9 LED display capable of presenting graphics and scrolling text that users in the vicinity can read, an onboard microphone for 12 -bit audio sampling, a 12 -bit audio output, a pager motor vibrator for vibratory feedback, 3 onboard processors, capacity for up to 256 MB of flash memory, provisions for connecting LCD <b>displays,</b> and <b>connectors</b> that mate into the Responsive Environments Group's Stack Sensor platform, allowing a variety of different sensors to be integrated. We describe several applications now being developed for this badge at the MIT Media Laboratory, and touch on how it was used in a multiplayer, augmented reality urban adventure hunt game in Manhattan in the summer of 2003...|$|R
50|$|Apple said in February 2011 {{that the}} port {{was based on}} Mini DisplayPort, not USB. As the system was described, Intel's {{solution}} to the display connection problem became clear: Thunderbolt controllers multiplex data from existing DP systems with data from the PCIe port into a single cable. Older displays, using DP 1.1a or earlier, have to be located {{at the end of}} a Thunderbolt device chain, but native displays can be placed anywhere along the line. Thunderbolt devices can go anywhere on the chain. In that respect, Thunderbolt shares a relationship with the older ACCESS.bus system, which used the <b>display</b> <b>connector</b> to support a low-speed bus.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} updated at the Macworld Expo New York on July 19, 2000; the new {{revision}} included dual-processor 450 MHz and 500 MHz versions, and a low-end single CPU 400 MHz model. It {{was also the}} first personal computer to include gigabit Ethernet as standard. Most people saw this revision as a stopgap release, because higher clocked G4s were not available; the G4’s Motorola XPC107 “Grackle” PCI/Memory controller prevented the G4 from hitting speeds higher than 500 MHz. The dual 500 MHz models featured DVD-RAM optical drive. Zip drives were optional on all models. These models also introduced Apple's proprietary Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector</b> video port.|$|E
5000|$|The fourth {{generation}} of displays were introduced simultaneously with the Blue & White Power Macintosh G3 in 1999, {{which included the}} translucent plastics of the iMac (initially white and blue [...] "blueberry", then white and grey [...] "graphite" [...] upon {{the introduction of the}} Power Mac G4). The displays were also designed with same translucent look. The Apple Studio Display series of CRT displays were available in a 17" [...] Diamondtron and a 21" [...] Trinitron CRT, both driven by an LG-Manufactured chassis. These displays were notorious for faulty flybacks. The last Apple external CRT display was introduced in 2000 along with the Power Mac G4 Cube. Both it and the new LCD Studio Displays featured clear plastics to match the Cube, and the new Apple <b>Display</b> <b>Connector,</b> which provided power, USB, and video signals to the monitor through a single cable. It was available only in a 17" [...] flat screened Diamondtron CRT. It was discontinued the following year.|$|E
40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Implementation of this USB (Universal Serial Bus) based data {{processing}} system is done using PIC 18 f 2550 microcontroller, LCD 16 * 2 <b>display,</b> USB <b>connector,</b> and ATMEL AT 24 C 04 Serial EEPROM for storage of data. The main objective of this project is to establish data communication system between computer and PIC 18 F 2550 microcontroller. In this project Virtual COM port is used through which data is sent and received. Virtual COM port causes the USB device to appear as an additional COM port available to the PC. Application software can access the USB device {{in the same way}} as it would access a standard COM port. Since writing and implementation of USB driver is out of scope of this project, USB driver available to us which is compatible with most of the operating system in the market was used. In order to send data from computer to microcontroller, Visual Basic script was developed. Visual Basic script has different options such as reading from memory or writing into memory or display stored data on LCD. Since the whole design is too large and complicated for a single student, some simplifications were used in this project. This report will discuss how USB interface between computer and PIC 18 F 2550 is established. Electrical and Electronic Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{symmetry}} of the phi 29 head-tail connector is controversial: several studies of two-dimensional arrays of the connector {{have found a}} 12 -fold symmetry, while {{a recent study of}} isolated particles has found a 13 -fold symmetry. To investigate whether a polymorphism of the structure might explain these different results, electron microscopy and image analysis were used to study both isolated connectors and particles in hexagonally packed arrays. The hexagonally packed arrays have a P 1 symmetry, and the <b>connectors</b> <b>displayed</b> 13 subunits both in the arrays and as isolated single particles. While we do not observe a polymorphism between connectors in two-dimensional arrays and as isolated particles, data show that the connectors can exist with either 12 or 13 subunits. A three-dimensional reconstruction of our 13 -fold connector was generated by combining an averaged side-view projection with the known symmetry. The structure of rosettes of the connectors formed in the presence of phi 29 prohead RNA (pRNA) was also examined. These rosettes contain five connectors arranged about a single connector in the center, and this arrangement may reflect an essential role of the pRNA in mediating a symmetry mismatch between either a 12 - or 13 -fold symmetric connector and a putative fivefold symmetric prohead portal vertex into which the connector fits...|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. In steel construction, {{there are}} various seismic {{structural}} systems that have been successfully utilized in the past including eccentric and concentric braced frames and moment frame systems. When these systems are used, the building envelope between structural members is filled with architectural components such as masonry infill walls, which are only expected to carry out of plane loads, such as wind, on each individual wall panel. Hybrid masonry {{is a relatively new}} type of structural system which incorporates the masonry infill walls within steel frames into the structural system to resist lateral loads imposed on the structure. This research represents the third phase of testing at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) and is part of an ongoing project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research (NEESR) to investigate the applicability of hybrid masonry as an adequate structural system. In phases I and II of hybrid masonry connector plate development research at UHM, a wide variety of connector designs were explored to determine the positive and negative aspects to different fuse and link connector plate designs and connection methods. Fuse connector tests demonstrated the viability of tapered fuses to dissipate large amounts of energy during cyclic loading. These tests also showed that various practical connector orientations and methods can be applied for hybrid masonry connectors, particularly the straight bolted side plate connection. In addition, during phase I of testing, a series of bolt push out tests were performed to determine the shear strength of post-installed through-bolts in masonry. Observations from the first two phases of testing were used as a guide for selecting 4 -inch and 6 -inch tapered fuse designs for testing on partially grouted and fully grouted masonry wall specimens. Multiple pairs of both tapered fuse connectors were slip-critically bolted to side plates, which were welded to a steel beam above the masonry wall specimens. These tests were performed to verify that the behavior of multiple pairs of connector plates in series is similar to the behavior of the individual pairs of connector plates. In addition, the tests were performed to observe the interaction between the steel connector plates and masonry wall specimens. Based on numerous observations and results in this phase of testing, the design of Type I hybrid masonry connections was improved. The fuse connector tests showed that the strength and behavior of multiple pairs of fuse connectors can be approximated by designing a single connector plate and multiplying the single plate's capacity by the number of connector plates used. These fuse <b>connectors</b> <b>displayed</b> the capability of dissipating large amounts of seismic energy before failure. Based on the results of these connector subassembly tests, recommended design procedures for connector plates were modified. Both masonry walls failed by means of shear friction at the location of the joint between the masonry and concrete slab. The results from UHM's testing will guide the development of full-scale two-story hybrid masonry test frames which will be tested at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign...|$|R
