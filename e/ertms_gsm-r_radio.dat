Trains can operate using either signalling system. Domestic TGVs use TVM-430, while TGV POS trainsets that operate into Germany use ETCS Level 2. ETCS Level 2 and TVM-430 use the same block sections, but use different means (radio links for ETCS, and track-to-train transmission for TVM-430) to transmit signal information to trains. Since ERTMS is mandated for eventual adoption throughout the European Union, similar installations including ETCS signalling are expected on future LGVs.|$|R

The SRS 3.4.0 from Q2 2014 matches with the MR1 from this process. The further steps were planned for the MR2 {{to be published in}} Q4 2015 (that became the SRS 3.5.0) and the MR3 to be published in Q3 2017 (whereas SRS 3.6.0 was settled earlier in June 2016). Each specification will be commented on and handed over to the RISC for subsequent legalization in the European Union. Deutsche Bahn has expressed a commitment to keep the Baseline 3 specification backward compatible starting at least with SRS 3.5.0 that is due in 2015 according to the streamlined MR2 process, with the MR1 adding requirements from its tests in preparation for the switch to ETCS (for example better frequency filters for the <b>GSM-R</b> <b>radio</b> equipment).

5000|$|The {{principle}} of mixed level signalling {{is based on}} simple principles using bi-directional data exchange between the Radio Block Centre (RBC) and the interlocking systems. The operator sets a route and {{does not need to}} know if the route will be used for a Level NTC (former LSTM) only or a Level 2-equipped train. A route is locked based on the national principles by the interlocking system and the RBC is informed about the routes set. The RBC checks whether it is possible to allocate a train to the route and then informs the interlocking system that a train is allocated to the route. The interlocking system shows the ETCS white bar aspect to all signals along the route including the signal {{at the end of the}} route and sends no ATB-EG code to the track. The RBC sends a movement authority to the train if a Level 2 train is allocated to the route. Otherwise the signal shows the optical proceed aspect and the related ATB-EG code is sent to the track. As soon as a Level 2 train reports itself in rear of a route currently assigned for optical authorisation (e.g. after start of mission procedure or when the driver changes level from Level NTC to Level 2), the optical authorisation is automatically upgraded to a Level 2 movement authority. Consequently, a Level 2 movement authority is downgraded to an optical authorisation after a predefined time-out if the driver closes the cab or a fault is detected that restricts the movement authority (e.g. if the <b>GSM-R</b> <b>radio</b> coverage is unavailable.) ...|$|R

40|$|ERTMS is the {{standard}} railway control-command and signaling system which aims to ensure railway interoperability throughout Europe while enhancing safety and competitiveness. ERTMS is composed of two main subsystems which include <b>GSM-R,</b> a <b>radio</b> system for enabling communication between the train and the traffic management center and ETCS, an automatic train protection system (ATP) to replace the existing national ATP systems. The ERTMS specifications are defined by means of standard documents which set out the requirements ensuring interoperability. These documents evolve regularly to give rise to successive versions. The ERTMS/ETCS standard defines different levels and operation modes according to various trackside and onboard setups and some operational conditions. Given the complexity and the high criticality of railway operation, verification and validation (V&V) are crucial tasks in railway application development. In this paper, after setting the background and the motivations, a mechanizable formalization of a subset of ERTMS/ETCS specifications relative to ETCS modes and transitions is developed. The present work aims to offer a readily available model for formal V&V. Using formal techniques to check SRS is highly recommended to tackle {{the complexity of the}} defined requirements and prevent specification errors. Model-checking technique, which is targeted here, offers exhaustive analysis of the system behavior based on its model and is highly automated, since it is supported by software tools. Based on the last available version of SRS specifications, a progressive process is undertaken to get a formal model which makes explicit the various modes characterized by their respective active functions, as well as the numerous combinations of conditions for switching between modes. The various steps guiding the translation of the SRS literal specifications into a formal model are explained. As will be shown through different examples, the obtained model is a convenient basis to check safety, interoperability and liveness properties...|$|R
40|$|The Siemens track {{monitoring}} system {{is being developed}} in collaboration with Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) and the Institute of Railway Research at the University of Huddersfield. It makes use of the existing on-board <b>GSM-R</b> cab <b>radio</b> present in every train in the UK, through the fitment of a sensor card, which detects track condition over three axes of train vibrations. By using advanced on-train signal processing, {{only a small amount}} of data to be transferred to the Ground System. For voided switches and crossings (S&C), the GPS location allows the S&C asset number to be identified and reported. This ensures maintenance staff are accurately directed to the location of voids, minimising time spent inspecting and maintaining track and improving safety. The Ground System monitors the voids detected by multiple trains, to increase the reported accuracy (within 5 m) of voids and to reduce false alarms. Automated void reporting, including whether the voids are located at S&C or other track types (such as plain-line track or bridges), allows maintenance to be directed and planned. The Ground System provides advanced warning of track defects, allowing more effective and prioritised preventative maintenance. The real benefit of the track {{monitoring system}} is that, by way of a simple activation, it can be present on every train within the UK and therefore be monitoring the track on a large number of train journeys, providing a network-wide track monitoring system. Recent on-train trials have shown that the small low-cost sensor is able to detect voided sleepers underneath both S&C and bridges. The repeatability between trains and for different journeys was found to be excellent. The Network Rail upgrades to the Siemens cab radio, planned for the next 2 - 3 years include a GSM-R/GPS antenna, and the addition of a GPS module to the cab radio, providing a GPS connection in every train. As part of these upgrades Siemens will introduce a the sensor card into the cab radio, minimising installation costs, making it hardware ready for track monitoring, the Siemens implementation of RCM (Remote Condition Monitoring). The only action needed for activation will be the upload of the software application to the cab radio. The track monitoring system allows the network operator to make significant reductions in maintenance and delay costs, line closures, journey re-planning and speed restrictions, by having a reliable monitoring system that is non-intrusive yet gives analysis for the entire rail network, improving train safety, network reliability and passenger comfort...|$|R
