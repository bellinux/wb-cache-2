5|$|In {{the first}} attempt to {{understand}} the many species, Lull found two groups, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> how he distinguished them: one composed of T. horridus, T. prorsus, and T. brevicornus; the other of T. elatus and T. calicornis. Two species (T. serratus and T. flabellatus) stood apart from these groups. By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of T. obtusus and T. hatcheri that was characterized by a very small nasal horn. T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus was now {{thought to be the}} most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, and T. elatus-T. calicornis was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn. C. M. Sternberg made one modification, adding T. eurycephalus and suggesting that it linked the second and third lineages closer together than they were to the T. horridus lineage. This pattern was followed until the major studies of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

He had previously said that voting for Piñera would be a regression and voting for Frei would not be an advancement.|$|E
25|$|Theorists {{challenging}} the traditional view that Pearl Harbor {{was a surprise}} repeatedly note that Roosevelt wanted (though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> so officially) the U.S. {{to intervene in the}} war against Germany. A basic understanding of the political situation of 1941 precludes any possibility the public wanted war. Military historian and novelist Thomas Fleming argues that President Roosevelt, himself, had wished for Germany or Japan to strike the first blow, but did not expect the United States to be hit as severely {{as it was in the}} attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E

The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number – on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.|$|E
25|$|Seedman {{established}} himself as a detective during the 1960s. As the detective commander for Brooklyn, he once oversaw an investigation of a shooting death, in which over 2,000 people were interviewed, that turned out to have been a freak accident. He investigated many prominent crimes during that era, including the Borough Park Tobacco robbery and the Kitty Genovese murder. As the chief of detective he reformed that branch by assigning detectives to specialize in certain areas of crime rather than just investigating whatever cases came their way when they were on shift. His tenure as chief of detectives of the city was short but memorable, marked by the Knapp Commission's corruption investigations which briefly cost him his job, several mob hits and terror attacks carried out by the Black Liberation Army (BLA). When his superior officers hindered his investigation into the murder of an officer at a Harlem mosque out of fear of a race riot, Seedman resigned his position and retired from the force, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that had been the reason for another 40 years.|$|E
25|$|Appian {{wrote that}} Vettius, a plebeian, {{run to the}} forum with a drawn dagger to kill Caesar and Pompey. He was arrested and {{questioned}} at the senate house. He {{said that he had}} been sent by Calpurnius Bibulus, Cicero, and Cato, and that the dagger was given to him by one of the bodyguards of Calpurnius Bibulus. The event was open to all suspicions. Caesar took advantage of this to arouse the crowd and postponed further interrogation to the next day. However, Vettius was killed in prison during the night. Caesar claimed that he was killed by the optimates {{who did not want to}} be exposed. The crowd gave Caesar a bodyguard. According to Appian, it is at this point that Bibulus withdrew from public business and did not go out of his house for the rest of his term of office. Caesar, who run public affairs on his own, did not make any further investigations into this affair. In the version of Cassius Dio Vettius was sent by Cicero and Lucullus. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> when this happened and did not give any details about the actual event. He wrote that Vettius accused these two men and Calpurnius Bibulus. However, Bibulus had revealed the plan to Pompey. This undermined his credibility. There were suspicions that he was lying about Cicero and Lucullus as well and that this was a ploy by Caesar and Pompey to discredit the optimates. There were various theories, but nothing was proven. After naming the mentioned men in public, Vettius was sent to prison and was murdered a little later. Caesar and Pompey suspected Cicero and their suspicions were confined by his defence of Gaius Antonius Hybrida in a trial.|$|E

It was subsequently released on the compilation album, Living in the Past, in 1972. However, elements of the song—essentially its coda—were included on Aqualung as [...] "Wond'ring Aloud". [...] Glenn Cornick played bass on the song and says it is his favourite song he recorded with the band.

500|$|Becoming {{immediately}} {{known for}} his quiet nature, Alston was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "The Quiet Man". Alston's personality contrasted with that of Dressen, who was much more outspoken. Sportswriters had difficulty writing about Alston at first because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> much. He also seemed more conservative in his decisions on the field, which drew criticism from his players even though he had managed many of them in the minor leagues. Don Zimmer said that he had learned more from Dressen and that Dressen knew more about baseball than Alston. Jackie Robinson did not like Alston at first either, according to Robinson's wife.|$|E

When Ganesan asked the reason for including it, Arur Doss mentioned that Ganesan's character would be looked upon by the theatre audiences in a negative light if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> anything to confirm his love for Saroja Devi's character. Understanding the dialogue's essence, Mirasi then re-filmed the climax and included it. The film was processed at Gemini Studios' laboratory. The final length of the film was over [...]|$|E

500|$|In a November {{session of}} the Federation Council, Putin stated that {{establishing}} the national symbols (anthem, flag and coat of arms) should be a top priority for the country. Putin pressed for the former Soviet anthem to be selected as the new Russian anthem, but strongly suggested that new lyrics be written. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> {{how much of the}} old Soviet lyrics should be retained for the new anthem. Putin submitted the bill [...] "On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation" [...] to the Duma for their consideration on 4 December. The Duma voted 381–51–1 in favor of adopting Alexandrov's music as the national anthem on 8 December 2000. Following the vote, a committee was formed and tasked with exploring lyrics for the national anthem. After receiving over 6,000 manuscripts from all sectors of Russian society, the committee selected lyrics by Mikhalkov for the anthem.|$|E

On 11 July Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{put an end to}} the idea when he told Eden that the murder of the Jews was [...] "probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed," [...] and that there should be [...] "no negotiations of any kind on this subject". Of Brand's mission he wrote: [...] "The project which has been put forward through a very doubtful channel seems itself also to be of the most nondescript character.

500|$|The {{vice presidential}} {{nomination}} was considered no president {{had failed to}} complete his elected term. [...] Not much attention {{was given to the}} choice, and the specifics of how Tyler came to gain it are unclear. [...] Chitwood pointed out that Tyler was a logical candidate: as a Southern slaveowner, he balanced the ticket and also assuaged the fears of Southerners who felt Harrison might have abolitionist leanings. Tyler had been a vice-presidential candidate in 1836, and having him on the ticket might win Virginia, the most populous state in the South. One of the convention managers, New York publisher Thurlow Weed, alleged that [...] "Tyler was finally taken because we could get nobody else to accept"—though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> this until after the subsequent break between President Tyler and the Whig Party. Other Tyler foes claimed that he had wept himself into the White House, after crying at Clay's defeat; this was unlikely, as the Kentuckian had backed Tyler’s opponent Rives in the Senate election. Tyler's name was submitted in the balloting, and though Virginia abstained, he received the necessary majority. Tyler, as president, was accused of having gained the nomination by concealing his views, and responded that he had not been asked about them. His biographer, Robert Seager II, held that Tyler was selected because of a dearth of alternative candidates. Seager concluded, [...] "He was put on the ticket to draw the South to Harrison. [...] No more, no less." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{spin-off}} series Torchwood (2006–2011), {{the audience}} learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with {{being unable to}} die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 companion Martha (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008), Rose mysteriously begins {{to appear in the}} Doctor's life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor fails to notice. When a [...] "Time Beetle" [...] creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to The Doctor; 'Bad Wolf'. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the Universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers in her ear and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of The End of Time (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks to her from the shadows, asking her what year it is. She tells him it is January 1, 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will have a really great year.|$|E
