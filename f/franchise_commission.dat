5000|$|The Council {{appointed}} Lightfoot {{to chair}} the District of Columbia Cable Design Commission, {{a commission to}} write a request for proposal that would determine how cable television should operate in the District, in 1982. The Council gave the Commission 90 days to write the request for proposal, but the Commission asked for another six months to complete it. Lightfoot was opposed to the additional time, saying it unnecessarily delayed the awarding of a cable <b>franchise.</b> The <b>Commission</b> released the request for proposal in July 1983. The Commission determined {{that there should be}} minimum offering of 60 channels for residents and 25 channels for businesses and governmental agencies. The winning franchiser should set aside several of the channels for municipal and community use, provide studios to the public to produce programming, provide grants to support public-benefit television programs, provide service to all eight wards, and complete all work within five years. [...] The Washington Post named Lightfoot one of [...] "Five to Watch in 1984", calling him the [...] "cable czar".|$|R
50|$|Especially {{since the}} Federal Trade <b>Commission</b> <b>Franchise</b> Rule on Franchising changed the {{requirement}} that representatives of franchisors as salespeople disclose their past personal and professional history, {{there has been an}} onslaught of salespeople titling themselves 'consultants', and that includes several firms offering to train new members in as little as two weeks to become franchise experts prepared to advise new buyers as to the best opportunity in which to invest their available funds. Certainly there are competent 'franchise brokers' that understand the industry who can help advise buyers, but for the most part, a freshly minted broker (self-titled 'franchise consultant') is not equipped to assist a buyer with decisions concerning their entrepreneurial future.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAcademic {{debate on}} public utility {{regulation}} has considerably {{evolved over the}} past 50 years. The conflict between the supporters of <b>franchise</b> regulation and <b>commission</b> regulation {{has given way to}} much more balanced in-depth analyses. Regulation is defined {{on the basis of its}} structure but also its scope and regulation incentives. A regulation mode must above all be evaluated with regard to the institutional environment. We propose a neo-institutionally-inspired analysis framework and show how the dynamic relationship between regulation and the institutional environment can lead to reforms and ultimately to more efficient regulation. The findings of a French water utility sector analysis underline how a series of national normative reforms and local exploratory reforms can give rise to innovations in the regulation mode. This new hybrid regulation, between <b>commission</b> regulation and <b>franchise</b> bidding, could be more effective than previous regulation mode, i. e. more stable and in line with stakeholders' expectations...|$|R
