On 22 March 2006, President Thabo Mbeki announced that suspended NIA director Billy Masetlha services had been terminated after a breakdown of trust and that trust could not be repaired. His remaining contract would be paid and criminal charges could still be pending. The following <b>day,</b> <b>Inspector</b> General Zolile Ngcakani released details of his investigation of the reasons leading to Masetlha's dismissal. Project Avani initially involved no targeting of individuals but was to evaluate potential threats occurring from the succession battle for the Presidency as well as any foreign interference in it, Zuma's corruption trial, problems from poor service delivery in the townships and lastly the security and stability in the country. Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils was not aware of the project which appeared legitimate though he should have been informed to provide executive oversight because of the sensitivity of the research. Ngcakani alleged that the project had been highjacked by Masetlha which involved the telephonic interception of conversations of senior ANC officials, the opposition, businessmen and civil servants as well as surveillance of some people. He alleged there appeared to be an authorization from Masetlha to fabricate fake intercepted emails externally and which showed divisions in the ANC's succession battle, and these email's were included in a report submitted to President Mbeki.|$|R
40|$|Â© 2015 "IIE". In this work, {{we examine}} a staff {{scheduling}} {{problem in a}} governmental food safety center {{that is responsible for}} the surveillance of imported food at an international airport. In addition {{to the fact that the}} staff have different levels of efficiency and have different preference for work shifts, the Operations Manager of the food safety center would like to balance the dissimilarities of workers in order to provide unbiased work schedules for staff members. We adopt a two-phase approach, where the first phase is to schedule the work shifts of food safety <b>inspectors</b> (including rest <b>days</b> and shift types) with schedule fairness and staff preference taken into account and the second phase is to best-fit them to tasks in terms of skill-matches and create diversity of team formations. We also provide polyhedral results and devise valid inequalities for the two formulations. For the first-phase problem, we relax some constraints of the fairness criteria to reduce the problem size to reduce computational effort. We derive an upper bound for the objective value of the relaxation and provide computational results to show that the solutions devised from our proposed methodology are of good quality. For the second-phase problem, we develop a shift-by-shift assignment heuristic to obtain an upper bound for the maximum number of times any pair of workers is assigned to the same shift at the same location. We propose an enumeration algorithm, that solves the problems for fixed values of this number until an optimality condition holds or the problem is infeasible. Computational results show that our proposed approach can produce solutions of good quality in a much shorter period of time, compared with a standalone commercial solver.
