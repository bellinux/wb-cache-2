40|$|Government {{laws and}} {{regulations}} impose legal requirements on information practices in healthcare and finance. These requirements govern the use and disclosure of information across organizations and their business practices. To comply with the law, organizations must demonstrate that they have verifiable procedures in-place to implement these requirements. This paper surveys our experiences acquiring business process models expressed in the Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) using a systematic method. The method requires business process owners to classify regulatory statements using a legal ontology to identify legal requirements. The itemized requirements can then be used to specify elements in a business process model to demonstrate due diligence under the law. The contributions of this paper include lessons learned while acquiring the model with attention to traceability, distinguishing between legally expressed and implied activities and implementing legally imposed <b>deadlines</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspensions.</b> We discuss the lessons learned with examples from the U. S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic stream rate of {{continuous}} queries, real-time <b>deadline</b> <b>and</b> important value in high critical data stream application is considered in this paper. Firstly, the relative <b>deadline</b> <b>and</b> value is calculated real-time. Secondly, a priority table {{based on the}} relative <b>deadline</b> <b>and</b> value is created and filled which decides the query scheduling order. At last, based on this priority table, a value <b>and</b> <b>deadline</b> jointly based query scheduling algorithm in different stream radio is proposed. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} algorithm raises the hit value radio (HVR) and the success ratio continuous query scheduling...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates how {{students}} perceive {{self and the}} circumstances when writing a graduation thesis, and also the relationship between positive cognitions and mental health. Thirty-one university students who were writing graduation theses were administered a questionnaire {{six months before the}} <b>deadline</b> <b>and</b> again one month before it. Students perceived themselves more emotionally unbalanced and more incapable, but more positive about their attitudes concerning their graduation theses than their classmates did. To perceive themselves more optimistic, strong-willed, and emotionally balanced was negatively correlated with feelings of depression in writing a graduation thesis. With regard to cognition about circumstances, they were more aware of the <b>deadline</b> <b>and</b> the progress of the graduation thesis one month before the <b>deadline,</b> <b>and</b> such awareness correlated with feelings of depression. From the analysis of their free descriptions, both enjoyment and suffering in writing a graduation thesis were abstract six months before the <b>deadline,</b> <b>and</b> they got both enjoyment and suffering in the concrete process of writing a graduation thesis and giving meaning to the results of their research one month before the <b>deadline.</b> The enjoyment <b>and</b> suffering in writing a graduation thesis were inextricably linked with each other...|$|R
