It is shown that separated communication topology design and physical node placement yields optimal design. Designing optimal networks is shown to be NP-complete.

The structured network wiring gives well-controlled electrical parameters that eliminate timing iterations and enable the use of high-performance circuits to reduce latency and increase bandwidth. The area overhead required to implement an on-chip network is modest, we estimate 6. 6 %. This paper introduces the concept of on-chip networks, sketches a simple network, and discusses some challenges in the architecture and design of these networks. 1 Introduction We propose replacing design-specific <b>global</b> on-chip <b>wiring</b> with a general-purpose {{on-chip interconnection}} network. As shown in Figure 1, a chip employing an on-chip network is composed {{of a number of}} network clients: processors, DSPs, memories, peripheral controllers, gateways to networks on other chips, and custom logic. Instead of connecting these top-level modules by routing dedicated wires, they are connected to a network that routes packets between them. Each client is placed in a rectangular tile on the chip and communicates with all other clients, not just its neighbors, via the network. The network logic occupies a small amount of area (we estimate 6. 6 %) in each tile and makes use of a portion of the upper two wiring layers. Using a network to replace <b>global</b> <b>wiring</b> has advantages of structure, performance, and modularity. The on-chip network structures the <b>global</b> <b>wires</b> so that their electrical properties are optimized and well controlled. These controlled electrical parameters, in particular low and predictable cross-talk, enable the use of aggressive signaling circuits that can reduce power dissipation by a factor of ten and increase propagation velocity by three times [3]. Sharing the wiring resources between many communication flows makes more efficient use of the wires: when one client is idle, other clients continue {{to make use of the}} network resources.
