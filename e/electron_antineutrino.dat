The weak interaction is unique in that it allows for quarks to swap their flavour for another. The swapping of those properties is mediated by the force carrier bosons. For example, during beta minus decay, a down quark within a neutron is changed into an up quark, thus converting the neutron to a proton and resulting in the emission of an electron and an <b>electron</b> <b>antineutrino.</b> Also, the weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity-symmetry, and similarly, {{the only one to}} break charge parity symmetry.|$|E
