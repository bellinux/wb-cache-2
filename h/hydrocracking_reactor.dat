40|$|This work {{introduces}} a modified space-time conservation element/solution element (CE/SE) method for the simulation {{of the dynamic}} behavior of a pilot-scale <b>hydrocracking</b> <b>reactor.</b> With this approach, a four-lump dynamic model including vacuum gas oil (VGO), middle distillate, naphtha and gas is solved. The proposed method is capable of handling the stiffness of the partial differential equations resulting from the hydrocracking reactions. To have a better judgment, the model is also solved by the finite difference method (FDM), and the results from both approaches are compared. Initially, the absolute average deviation of the cold dynamic simulation using the CE/SE approach is 8. 98 %, which is better than that obtained using the FDM. Then, the stability analysis proves that for achieving an appropriate response from the dynamic model, the Courant number, which {{is a function of}} the time step size, mesh size and volume flow rate through the catalytic bed, should be less than 1. Finally, it is found that, following a careful selection of these parameters, the CE/SE solutions to the hydrocracking model can produce higher accuracy than the FDM results. A four-lump dynamic model including vacuum gas oil, middle distillate, naphtha and gas was developed. To solve it, a modified space-time conservation element and solution element method was introduced to simulate the dynamic behavior of a pilot-scale <b>hydrocracking</b> <b>reactor.</b> The approach was evaluated by comparing its results with those obtained by applying the finite difference method...|$|E
40|$|An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) and kinetic-based models for a pilot scale vacuum gas oil (VGO) hydrocracking plant are presented in this paper. Reported experimental data in the literature were used to develop, train, and check these models. The proposed models are capable of predicting the yield of all main hydrocracking products including dry gas, light naphtha, heavy naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and unconverted VGO (residue). Results showed that kinetic-based and artificial neural models have specific capabilities to predict yield of hydrocracking products. The former is able to accurately predict the yield of lighter products, i. e. light naphtha, heavy naphtha and kerosene. However, ANN model is capable of predicting yields of diesel and residue with higher precision. The comparison shows that the ANN model is superior to the kinetic-base models.   © 2013 BCREC UNDIP.

50|$|The {{formation}} of dicoronylene in <b>hydrocracking</b> <b>reactors</b> {{is a serious}} problem because its low solubility make it precipitate in any cooler part of the reactor flow path. This causes plugging of flow lines that require periodic shutdown and removal of the reddish deposits. Dicoronylene is also a constituent of coke formed on hydrocracking catalysts, which reduces their activity.|$|R
40|$|In {{hydrocracking}} {{and other}} foaming reactors, the foam {{rises to the}} top {{because it has a}} higher gas fraction than the bubbly mixture from which it comes. The high gas hold-up in foams is undesirable in chemical reactors because it strongly decreases the liquid residence time and in <b>hydrocracking</b> <b>reactors</b> also promotes the formation of coke. To study foams we built a cold slit bubble reactor which when used with aqueous anionic surfactants gives rise to foam. This reactor reproduces the foaming processes which are characteristic of the commercial system CANMET from Petrocanada. We discovered a critical condition for foaming; when the gas velocity exceeds a critical value which depends on the liquid velocity, a foam interface appears {{at the top of the}} reactor, with foam above and bubbly mixture below. The interface is very sharp and it moves down the reactor as the gas velocity is increased at a constant liquid velocity. This is the way reactors foam, with the bubbly mixture being consumed by foam. The foam may be destroyed by increasing the liquid velocity backing up against the foaming threshold. The reactor partitions into two phase, two phase ow with bubbly mixture below and foam above. The bubbly mixture is dispersed gas in water plu...|$|R

The catalysts was prepared by loading Mo followed by Ni Metals onto the natural zeolite (Z) sample, then calcined at 500 oC, oxidized and reduced at 400 oC under nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen stream, respectively. The characterization of catalysts including spesific surface area, average pore radius, and total pore volume were performed by gas sorption analyzer, amount of total acid sites was determined by gas sorption method, and acid site strength was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The hydrocracking process {{was carried out in}} a semi-flow reactor system at 360 oC and catalyst:feed ratio 0. 5 under hydrogen stream (150 mL/hour). The feed was vaporized from the pyrolisis reactor into the <b>hydrocracking</b> <b>reactor.</b> A liquid product was collected and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The characterization results showed that spesific surface area, average pore radius, and total pore volume of the Z sample decreased after loading of the Ni and Mo metals. Amount of total acid sites of the NiMo/Z catalyst was higher than that of the Z sample. The activity of NiMo/Z catalyst decreased after several continously runs. Its regeneration produced the NiMo/Z reg catalyst with similar activity and selectivity to the fresh catalyst (NiMo/Z). The activity of catalysts at the optimum condition followed the order of NiMo/Z reg>NiMo/Z>Z (conversion of hydrocarbon C> 12) and NiMo/Z reg>NiMo/Z>Z (total yield of gasoline fraction).

40|$|Trends in {{the crude}} oil supply {{have shown a}} decline in {{reserves}} of conventional oil, which has been offset by increasing volumes of heavy oil. Therefore, hydrocracking has become an increasingly attractive process for upgrading heavy oil fractions. This process, however, presents major challenges {{that have to be}} overcome. The present work had two principal aims. The first was to develop a new continuous fixed-bed <b>hydrocracking</b> <b>reactor</b> (CFBR) to conduct long time-on-stream experiments, ranging from 180 – 360 minutes. Several challenges were faced during the design and construction caused by operating conditions constraints. Factors such as safety and effective control of the system were also taken into consideration. The second was to study hydrocracking experiments at different operating conditions performed in the CFBR. These were carried out with a model compound, 1 -methylnaphthalene (C 11 - 1 MN) and a commercial catalyst, NiMo/Al 2 O 3. Three residence times (1, 10, 20 minutes) and four temperatures (400, 420, 430 and 450 oC) were used, while keeping pressure constant at 10 MPa. Four main groups of products prevailed: partially hydrogenated bicyclic products, hydrogenated bicyclic products, ring-opening products and cracked products. Each group was further divided in alkyl and alkenyl benzenes, alkyl cyclohexane and decalin. The reaction pathway consisted of a mixture of parallel and consecutive reactions. The activation energy for the decomposition of C 11 - 1 MN was obtained with the Arrhenius equation. The overall selectivity of partially hydrogenated products and ring-opening products were mirrored and the overall selectivity for cracked products decreased with increasing temperature. The selectivity of hydrogenated products was very low. The effect of the sulphiding agent, diheptyl disulphide (DHDS) present in the feed, was elucidated on the activation of the catalyst. A decrease in sulphur concentration in products was coupled with a noticeable increase in C 11 - 1 MN conversion. Finally, the role of DHDS decomposition products in catalyst activation was investigated. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} hundred years, the fossil fuels {{consumption}} is increasing dramatically and this lead to {{a significant increase in}} greenhouse gas emissions, the depletion of natural reserves of fossil fuels and increase the fuel production cost. Consequently, renewable and sustainable fuel sources such as bio-oil are receiving increased attention. In bio-based oil such as micro-algae oil, triglycerides and fatty acids are sustainable resources with high energy densities that can be converted into liquid hydrocarbon fuels, efficiently. One of the efficient ways for bio-oil conversion to applicable fuels is hydro-cracking. Hydro-cracking with acidic catalysts is a single step and energy efficient process for bio-oil upgrading towards bio-fuels. Zeolitic structures such as ZSM- 5 and beta-zeolite are prevalent acidic catalysts in hydro-treating processes due to their strong acidity, their crystalline porous structure and their high hydrothermal stability. The aim of this research is checking the feasibility of hydro-cracking synthesis towards the light (LC) and middle (MC) range of hydrocarbons over the zeolite based catalysts. Two different types of zeolite catalysts, ZSM- 5 and beta-zeolite, were chosen and they were impregnated with Ni (NO₃) ₂. 6 H₂O and calcined at 500 °C. The prepared catalysts were tested with oleic acid which is the main component of plant-derived oil. The catalysts were injected in a lab-scale trickle bed reactor in certain operating conditions. The oleic acid conversion over beta-zeolite was greater than ZSM- 5 due to higher pore size distribution and acidity of beta-zeolite compared with ZSM- 5. Also the reaction rate constant and Arrhenius equations for beta-zeolite and ZSM- 5 were identified. The second step of this research is investigating the hydro-cracking performance with performing a mathematical modelling. The model predictions showed reasonable correlation with experimental data and conversion rates. The total conversion for the <b>hydrocracking</b> <b>reactor</b> model was 82. 54 % for 4 major classes of hydrocarbons (light [LC], middle [MC], heavy [HC] and oligomerised [OC]). In addition, the concentration distribution and temperature profile along the reactor were investigated. At the end, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed to analyse the hydro-cracking reactor performance. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|The {{upgrading}} {{of heavy}} crude oil residues to more valuable light and middle distillates is becoming increasingly important for the global refining industry because {{of the decline in}} conventional, light crude oil sources [1]. The hydrogenolysis is defined as the transformation of large hydrocarbon molecules (high boiling point) into smaller molecules (low boiling point) in the presence of hydrogen. In residue hydrotreatment, this transformation occurs due to the breaking of carbon–carbon bonds or the removal of large atoms that is bonded to two unconnected pieces of hydrocarbon and has been used as one of the techniques for the upgrading of crude residues. For most of hydrotreating catalysts, the conversion rate is primarily a function of operating temperature, pressure and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) [2]. It is generally used to process heavy oil cuts. The process is tailored to various needs of refineries to maximize middle distillates, gasoline, LPG and similar products [3]. Kinetic model has a significant effect on process optimization, unit design and catalyst selection. Mathematical models for a trickle bed catalytic reactor can be complex due to many microscopic and macroscopic effects occurring inside the reactor, including flow patterns of both phases, size and shape of a catalyst particle, wetting of the catalyst pores with liquid phase, pressure drop, intraparticle gradients, thermal effects and, of course, kinetics on the catalyst surface [4]. Laxminarasimhan et al. [5] described a five-parameter continuous model for hydrocracking of heavy petroleum feedstocks that was subsequently used by Khorasheh et al. [6, 7] and Ashouri et al. [8] to describe the kinetics of hydrocracking, HDS, and HDN processes of bitumen. Today, {{there are two types of}} kinetic models available, detailed molecular models and lumped empirical models. The detailed molecular model is very accurate because it takes into account all possible reactions and mechanisms. Although the predictive power of detailed molecular models is much better than that of lumped empirical models, but their application to heavy feedstocks is very rare due to the complexity of the mixture. However, the available analytical techniques are incapable to identify the detailed molecular level of heavy feedstocks [9]. There are other types of modeling used to determine reactor performance such as hybrid modeling which is a first-principles model (FPM) based on the pseudo-component approach coupled with neural network(s) in different hybrid architectures [10], Combination of Genetic Algorithm and Sequential Quadratic Programming which based on genetic algorithm and sequential quadratic programming to determine the significant reactions and their corresponding rate constants [11], and some used kinetics to extract information about yield [12] and other model of <b>hydrocracking</b> <b>reactor</b> [13]. The lumped kinetic models are commonly used in modeling the hydrocracking of heavy feedstocks such as atmospheric vacuum resides. The lumped kinetic models have been classified into two types: discrete lumped models and continues lumped models. Specifying the chemical reactions involved in residual hydrocracking and the actual composition of the products is a complicated task. Therefore, the liquid product of residual upgrading is normally divided into several product lumps that are based on true boiling point temperature [14]. This is one approach to simplify the problem which considers the partition of the components into a few equivalent classes called lumps or lumping technique, and then assume each class as an independent entity [15]. The accuracy and the predictive power of discrete lumping models mainly depend on the number of lumps. As the amount of lumps increases, the predicted accuracy improves. Increasing the number of lumps, however, will complicate the model by increasing the number of model parameters [16]. Although numerous researchers published about lumping model for some oils and residues [3, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], there is a lack of models for predicting kinetic parameters of atmospheric crude oil residue with a flexibility of operating pressure along with the absence of experimental data. The proposed model will estimate the optimal conditions of the five lumps, naphtha, kerosene, light gasoil, heavy gasoil and lowest residue with low content of impurities.|$|E
