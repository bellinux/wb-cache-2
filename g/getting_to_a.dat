5|$|There {{are several}} {{missions}} {{in which the}} player controls a motor vehicle. Though the game engine {{is the same as}} the third-person mode, these missions are based on being in a vehicle. They usually involve <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain location in a certain time period, often while avoiding pursuers while heading to the end point. Weapons can not be used while in a vehicle. While the PDA is not available in these mission types, a map of the city is. Cell phone calls are also sometimes received in these missions.|$|E

For example 1... Kb7? 2. Kb5, then the black king moves and the white king <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> key square and then wins by forcing promotion of the pawn.|$|R

25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Forest Service {{employees}} often traveled {{many miles}} from local ranger stations to forest work sites. Since the forest road networks were not well developed, <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> job site meant a long trek, carrying {{all the equipment}} need to perform the field work. This made it impractical for employees to make daily round-trips. To facilitate work at remote sites, the Forest Service built guard stations at strategic locations throughout the forest to house fire patrols and project crews. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most National Forest areas within a few hours. As a result, many guard stations were no longer needed. The Forest Service found new uses for some stations, but most were demolished or abandon.|$|E

Leto described [...] "Up in the Air" [...] as a passionate and energetic song that [...] "feels really free" [...] but also features the concept of constraint and tension, particularly evident in the line [...] "I'll wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love". Leto explained that the lyric plays on two different levels, giving a sexual connotation to the line, but also the idea of power and control. He further said that the song [...] "has to do with <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{point in your life}} where you're ready {{to let go of the}} past, embrace change and become more of who you really are".|$|E

500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network.

I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes.

500|$|Many early reviews gave Carnivàle good marks {{but also}} said its unique {{characters}} and story might {{prevent it from}} becoming a huge mainstream audience success. Daily Variety TV editor Joseph Adalian predicted that [...] "it will get mostly positive reviews but some people will be {{put off by the}} general weirdness of the show." [...] Phil Gallo of Variety described Carnivàle as [...] "an absolute visual stunner with compelling freak show characters—but the series unfortunately takes a leisurely approach toward <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point," [...] and Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times suggested that [...] "it's as if executives at the premium cable network want to see how far they can slow a narrative before viewers start tossing their remotes through the screen". James Poniewozik of Time called the first three episodes [...] "frustrating" [...] as well as [...] "spellbinding." [...] Amanda Murray of BBC said [...] "With so little revealed, it's almost impossible to pass judgment on the show—it's hard to tell if this is just good, or going to be great." ...|$|E

Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [...] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth." [...] In April 2013, Cheadle stated that Iron Man 3 could be the final film in the series, saying, [...] "The door is always left open in these kinds of movies especially when they do as well as they have done. I know there was talk of making sure we did this one right, and if it worked it could be the last one. There's room for more to be done with these characters. We're <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sweet spot with Tony and Rhodey, anyway." [...] In September 2014, in regards to a fourth film, Downey said, [...] "There isn't one in the pipe ...

The video opens with Beyoncé and her sister riding lowrider bicycles, <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> roller rink where several people are already gathered. Shots of people roler-skating inside the rink with disco balls {{hanging from the ceiling}} follow. The singer is then seen performing a dance with several background dancers as they hold rollers in their hands and enter a place called [...] "Roller City USA". Beyoncé starts skating and performing dance moves in slow-motion with several of her dancers dressed in shorts and T-shirts. Several scenes which are shot in bright black light follow as Beyoncé performs another dance sequence along with her dancers on their rollers. The second, more uptempo part of the song starts and the singer is seen arriving with a vehicle in front of a place called [...] "Cherry". She dances atop the car and dances with her background band as they play the song on their keytars.

During the end of the video, Beyoncé and her sister are seen going away on the same path by which they came. Close-up shots of Beyoncé lip-syncing the song are intertwined in the video with her lips covered with a shiny lipstick.|$|E

2500|$|His Theology in the Flesh: How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God is {{the first}} book to apply the field of {{cognitive}} linguistics to theology. According to cognitive linguistics, the specific types of bodies humans have shape how we interact with and understand our world. We have concepts such as up/down and in/out because we have bodies that can experience these sorts of things. Embodied experience also gives rise much of our metaphorical thinking. For instance, {{we know what it}} is like to go on a journey in which we experience <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> destination together and perhaps overcoming obstacles on the way. Many, but not all, languages use the experience physical journeys as the framework in which to understand the experience of love. We say, [...] "Our relationship has come a long way together" [...] and [...] "We have overcome many bumps in the road." [...] We reason about our love relationship in terms of a journey. Yet, in English, we also conceive of love in terms of strong physical forces ("He's blown away by love"), magnetism ("She is attracted to him"), and even insanity ("He is crazy about her"). That means that metaphors can be cognitive and not merely rhetorical. We actually think with metaphors.|$|E
