Figure 1.1 Centrifugal compressors {{used in conjunction}} with reciprocating internal combustion engines are known as turbochargers if driven by the engine’s exhaust gas and turbo-superchargers if mechanically driven by the engine. Standards set by the industry for turbochargers may have been established by SAE. Ideal gas properties often work well for the <b>design,</b> <b>test</b> and analysis of turbocharger centrifugal compressor performance.|$|E
25|$|Air-conditioning and {{refrigeration}} and HVAC: Centrifugal compressors {{quite often}} supply the compression in water chillers cycles. Because {{of the wide}} variety of vapor compression cycles (thermodynamic cycle, thermodynamics) and {{the wide variety of}} workings gases (refrigerants), centrifugal compressors are used {{in a wide range of}} sizes and configurations. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly <b>design,</b> <b>test</b> and analyze the performance of these machines. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASHRAE, ASME & API.|$|E
25|$|A {{structured}} CM program {{ensures that}} documentation (e.g., requirements, <b>design,</b> <b>test,</b> and acceptance documentation) for items is accurate {{and consistent with}} the actual physical design of the item. In many cases, without CM, the documentation exists but is {{not consistent with the}} item itself. For this reason, engineers, contractors, and management are frequently forced to develop documentation reflecting the actual status of the item before they can proceed with a change. This reverse engineering process is wasteful in terms of human and other resources and can be minimized or eliminated using CM.|$|E

Inter-cooling is often needed between stages to control air temperature. Note that the road repair crew and the local automobile repair garage find screw compressors better adapt to their needs. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASME and government regulations that emphasize safety.

25|$|In oil refineries, natural-gas processing, {{petrochemical}} {{and chemical}} plants. Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often one-shaft multi-stage and driven by large steam or gas turbines. Their casings are often termed horizontally split or barrel. Standards {{set by the}} industry (ANSI/API, ASME) for these compressors result in large thick casings to maximize safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of compressor is also often termed API-style. The power needed to drive these compressors is most often in the thousands of HP. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly <b>design,</b> <b>test</b> and analyze their performance.|$|E

The impellers are often if not always of the covered style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of compressor is also often termed an API-style.

25|$|In chronic opioid users, such {{as those}} on Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy (COAT) for {{managing}} severe, chronic pain, behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One 2000 study analysed COAT patients {{to determine whether they}} were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The findings from this study suggest that stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in driving (this includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., Rey Complex Figure Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the WAIS-R Block <b>Design</b> <b>Test)</b> but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher order cognitive abilities (i.e., planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It {{is important to note that}} this study reveals that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on psychomotor, cognitive, or neuropsychological functioning.|$|E

5000|$|Implementation is {{different}} in every testing project. In one project, you might decide to build both automated test scripts and manual <b>test</b> scripts. [...] <b>Designing</b> <b>tests,</b> instead, is an iterative process. You can start <b>designing</b> <b>tests</b> before any system implementation by basing the <b>test</b> <b>design</b> on use case specifications, requirements, prototypes, and so on. As the system becomes more clearly specified and you have builds of the system to work with, you can elaborate {{on the details of}} the design. The activity of <b>designing</b> <b>tests</b> answers the question, “How am I going to perform the testing?” A complete <b>test</b> <b>design</b> informs readers about what actions need to be taken with the system and what behaviors and characteristics they should expect to observe if the system is functioning properly.|$|R

2500|$|There {{were a few}} {{primarily}} {{right hemisphere}} tasks Genie did not perform well on. On one memory for <b>design</b> <b>test</b> she scored at a [...] "borderline" [...] level in October 1975, although she {{did not make the}} mistakes typical of patients with brain damage. In addition, on a Benton Visual Retention Test and an associated facial recognition test Genie's scores were far lower than any average scores for people without brain damage. Although these contrasted with observations of Genie in everyday situations, researchers wrote that they anticipated these results. Curtiss' explanation was that these tasks likely require use of both hemispheres, noting that previous results on the memory for <b>design</b> <b>test</b> found a negative impact from abnormal brain function in either hemisphere, and that these would therefore be very difficult for Genie since she exclusively used her right hemisphere.|$|E

2500|$|A {{boilerplate}} spacecraft, {{also known}} as a mass simulator, is a nonfunctional craft or payload which is used to test various configurations and basic size, load, and handling characteristics of rocket launch vehicles. [...] It is far less expensive to build multiple, full-scale, non-functional boilerplate spacecraft than it is to develop the full system (<b>design,</b> <b>test,</b> redesign, and launch). In this way, boilerplate spacecraft allow components and aspects of cutting-edge aerospace projects to be tested while detailed contracts for the final project are being negotiated. [...] These tests may be used to develop procedures for mating a spacecraft to its launch vehicle, emergency access and egress, maintenance support activities, and various transportation processes.|$|E
2500|$|Modern ICs are {{enormously}} complicated. An average {{desktop computer}} chip, as of 2015, has over 1 billion transistors. The rules for what can and cannot be manufactured are also extremely complex. Common IC processes of 2015 {{have more than}} 500 rules. Furthermore, since the manufacturing process itself is not completely predictable, designers must account for its statistical nature. The complexity of modern IC design, as well as market pressure to produce designs rapidly, {{has led to the}} extensive use of automated design tools in the IC design process.
