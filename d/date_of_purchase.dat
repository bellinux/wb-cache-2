2500|$|For example, if a user had a $1,000 {{transaction}} and repaid it in full {{within this}} grace period, {{there would be}} no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized {{on the back of the}} monthly statement. The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the annual percentage rate (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB). [...] Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail finance charge (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).|$|E
2500|$|The {{clothes were}} {{traced to a}} Maltese merchant, Tony Gauci, who became a key {{prosecution}} witness, testifying that he sold the clothes to a man of Libyan appearance. Gauci was interviewed 23 times, giving contradictory evidence about who had bought the clothes, that person's age and appearance, and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase,</b> but later identified Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. As Megrahi had only been in Malta on 7 December, that date {{was assumed to be}} the purchase date. This date is in doubt as Gauci had testified that Malta's Christmas lights had not been on when the clothes had been purchased; it was subsequently determined that the lights had been switched on on 6 December. Scottish police had also failed to inform the defence that another witness had testified seeing Libyan men making a similar purchase on a different day. An official report, providing information not made available to the defence during the original trial, stated that, on 19 April 1999, four days before identifying al-Megrahi for the first time, Gauci had seen a picture of al-Megrahi in a magazine which connected him to the bombing, a fact which could have distorted his judgment. Gauci was shown the same magazine during his testimony at al-Megrahi's trial and asked if he had identified the photograph in April 1999 as being the person who purchased the clothing; he was then asked if that person was in the court. Gauci then identified al-Megrahi for the court stating – [...] "He is the man on this side. He resembles him a lot".|$|E
