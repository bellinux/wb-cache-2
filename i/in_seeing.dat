5|$|The Swiss {{historian}} Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) in his The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860), by contrast, {{defined the}} Renaissance as {{the period between}} Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance {{the emergence of the}} modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential {{in the development of the}} modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. However, Buckhardt has been accused of setting forth a linear Whiggish view of history <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> the Renaissance as the origin of the modern world.|$|E

5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that they were interested <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities {{in order to reach}} a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E
5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E

5|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} their {{contention}} that Kinne {{had been so}} interested <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> her husband removed {{that she had been}} willing to pay for his murder, supported by the grand-jury testimony of John Boldizs. Boldizs, though nominally a witness for the prosecution, weakened his testimony on the stand during the trial by claiming that Kinne's offer to pay him $1,000 in return for James Kinne's murder could have been a joke, and Hill was forced to attack his own witness's credibility. Further prosecution testimony alleged that the Kinne's marriage had been on the verge of dissolution at the time of James Kinne's death, that Sharon Kinne's adultery had been a cause of this, and that Sharon Kinne had known that she would collect her husband's $29,000 in life insurance policies only if she were still his wife.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was the native {{land of the}} “growthmen.” Its leading light, Paul Samuelson, had {{published}} a pathbreaking undergraduate textbook, Economics: An Introductory Analysis. In the sixth edition of Economics, Samuelson (1964) added a “new chapter on the theory of growth.” Samuelson drew on the work on growth theory of his younger colleague Robert Solow (1956)—an indication that growthmanship was taking an analytical turn. The MIT economists were thus growthmen in two senses: <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> growth as an absolutely central policy imperative and <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> the theory of growth as a focus for economic research. What the MIT growthmen added was a distinctive style of analysis that {{made it easier to}} address the dominant policy concerns in tractable formal models. Solow’s (1956) model was the perfect exemplar of the MIT style. It provided the central framework for the subsequent developments in growth theory and secured MIT as {{the center of the universe}} in the golden age of growth theory in the 1960s (Boianovsky and Hoover 199–200).|$|E
