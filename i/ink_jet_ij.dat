40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} and experimentation are used at Xerox Office Group to design, optimize, and verify the fluid dynamic behavior of phase-change <b>ink</b> <b>jets,</b> including the individual jets in a print head. A typical model of an <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> {{is based upon}} lumped-parameter (no spatial variation) assumptions. While quite accurately predicting the main Helmholz resonant frequency (a key performance measure), a lumped-parameter model does not predict other parasitic frequencies that occur in a typical <b>ink</b> <b>jet.</b> As printer performance improves by increasing the jetting frequency, understanding and controlling these other resonant frequencies becomes critical. This paper documents the improvement of an existing lumped-parameter model by incorporating one-dimensional transmission line elements which substantially increases {{the ability of the}} model to predict the frequency response of an <b>ink</b> <b>jet.</b> The first part of the paper describes the application of lumped-parameter elements and of transmission line theory to the modeling of <b>ink</b> <b>jets.</b> The existing lumped-parameter model and the improved model are then used to simulate a Xerox Phaser ® 350 <b>ink</b> <b>jet.</b> The model predictions are compared with experimental data obtained with an impedance meter...|$|R

40|$|We {{have shown}} that thermal <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> print heads {{can be used to}} place GaN {{nanowires}} on patterned substrates. The semiconductor nanowires had diameters ranging from 70 to 300 nm and lengths from 5 µm to 20 µm. They were dispersed in alcohol-water solutions for loading into ink reservoirs. To avoid clogging, the thermal <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> heads were chosen with drop weights from 72 to 165 ng. The thermal <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> method was successfully used to place nanowires across narrow gaps in metal patterns. When using a low-power optical microscope to align the nozzle with substrate pattern features, the placement accuracy is much higher than with micropipette placement. For unknown reasons, nanowires would not pass through piezoelectric <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> heads.

40|$|Resonance Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{offers several}} advantages {{in the studies}} of <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> prints stemming from its inherent selectivity and sensitivity. These include the possibility to obtain direct information on the chemical interactions between the paper and ink that {{play a major role}} in long-term print fastness. However, resonance Raman techniques can suffer from obtrusive fluorescence from colorants or printing substrate and this severely complicates the Raman measurements. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the applicability of resonance Raman spectroscopy combined with a Kerr gate fluorescence rejection system to gain information on the light fastness of <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> prints. This was studied using a set of experimental coatings and inks with known compositions. The results indicate that Kerr gated resonance Raman spectroscopy is applicable to the light fastness studies of <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> prints owing to the effective suppression of the sample-related fluorescence. Moreover, detailed molecular information can be obtained by tuning the laser to get selective resonance enhancement. This enables specific analyses of chemical paper-ink interactions, which generally contribute decisively to the light fastness of <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> prints...|$|R
