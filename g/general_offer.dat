This <b>general</b> <b>offer</b> of righteousness, of the righteousness of God, declares {{that it is in}} vain for men to think to be set just and righteous before God by any other means. 3.

From all these scriptures, therefore, it is manifest, 'that men must be justified from the curse of the law, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.' ...|$|E

40|$|Stock price {{reactions}} to announcements of new equity issues via dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs) {{have been shown}} to be statistically insignificant. The insignificant reaction documented in studies using conventional event study methods may be because (1) equity issuance through DRPs arises from economic motives that are different from those underlying <b>general</b> cash <b>offers,</b> (2) new-issue DRPs are generally much smaller than <b>general</b> cash <b>offers,</b> hence their effects are more difficult to detect, or (3) identification of the precise event date for new-issue DRPs is problematic.
