The most commonly used are the hydrochloride (freebase conversion ratio 0.805), phosphate (0.736), sulphate (0.859), and citrate (0.842). Others include a salicylate NSAID, codeine salicylate (0.686), a bromide (codeine methylbromide, 0.759), and at least four codeine-based barbiturates, the cyclohexenylethylbarbiturate (0.559), cyclopentenylallylbarbiturate (0.561), diallylbarbiturate (0.561), and <b>diethylbarbiturate</b> (0.619). The latter was introduced as Codeonal in 1912, indicated for pain with nervousness. [...] Codeine methylbromide is also considered a separate drug for various purposes.|$|E
50|$|Barbital (as {{known in}} the United States) or barbitone (as known elsewhere), marketed under the brand names Veronal for the pure acid and Medinal for the sodium salt, was the first commercially {{available}} barbiturate. It {{was used as a}} sleeping aid (hypnotic) from 1903 until the mid-1950s. The chemical names for barbitone are diethylmalonyl urea or diethylbarbituric acid; hence, the sodium salt (known as medinal, a genericised trademark in the United Kingdom) is known also as sodium <b>diethylbarbiturate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown the}} very frequent occurrence in infectious mononucleosis of abnormal findings on liver function tests (1 - 7), and of hepatic involvement on histologic examina-tion of both autopsy (8 - 11) and biopsy material (1, 12 - 14) in cases with and without jaundice. Alterations observed {{in the composition of}} the serum proteins (2, 4, 6, 15, 16 a) appear to be compatible with the occurrence of positive cepha-lin-cholesterol flocculation and thymol turbidity 1 Present address: Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass. tests, notwithstanding the various interpretations advanced to explain the mechanisms of these tests (16 - 22). The present work was undertaken to study in detail the serum proteins in infectious mononu-cleosis by the electrophoretic method and to exam-ine separated protein fractions for the presence of heterophile antibodies. METHODS The electrophoretic runs were performed with the standard apparatus and technique described by Longs-worth (23) using sodium <b>diethylbarbiturate</b> (veronal...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the synthesis and binding properties of highly selective noncovalent molecular receptors 13 ·(DEB) 6 and 33 ·(DEB) 6 for different hydroxyl functionalized anthraquinones 2. These receptors are formed by the self-assembly of three calix[4]arene dimelamine derivative molecules (1 or 3) and six <b>diethylbarbiturate</b> (DEB) molecules to give 13 ·(DEB) 6 or 33 ·(DEB) 6. Encapsulation of 2 occurs in a highly organized manner; that is, a noncovalent hydrogen-bonded trimer of 2 is formed within the hydrogen-bonded receptors 13 ·(DEB) 6 and 33 ·(DEB) 6. Both receptors 13 ·(DEB) 6 and 33 ·(DEB) 6 change conformation from staggered to eclipsed upon complexation to afford a better fit for the 23 trimer. The receptor selectivity toward different anthraquinone derivatives 2 has been studied using 1 H NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, UV spectroscopy, and isothermal microcalorimetry (ITC). The - stacking between the electron-deficient center ring of the anthraquinone derivatives 2 a-c and 2 e-g and the relatively electron-poor melamine units of the receptor {{is the driving force}} for the encapsulation of the guest molecules. The selectivity of the hydrogen-bonded host for the anthraquinone derivatives is the result of steric interactions between the guest molecules and the calix[4]arene aromatic rings of the host...|$|E
