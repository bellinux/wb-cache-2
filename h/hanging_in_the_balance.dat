With the battle <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance,</b> Masinissa's cavalry, having driven the fleeing Carthaginian horsemen away, returned and immediately fell onto {{the rear of the}} Carthaginian lines. This decided the battle and at once Hannibal's army began to collapse. The Second Punic War was over and for his services Masinissa received the kingdom of Syphax, and became king of Numidia.|$|E
25|$|With Trotsky {{mostly on}} the sidelines through a {{persistent}} illness, the Zinoviev-Kamenev-Stalin triumvirate collapsed in April 1925, although the political situation was <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> {{for the rest of}} the year. All sides spent most of 1925 lining up support behind the scenes for the December Communist Party Congress. Stalin struck an alliance with Nikolai Bukharin, a Communist Party theoretician and Pravda editor, and the Soviet prime minister Alexei Rykov. Zinoviev and Kamenev strengthened their alliance with Lenin's widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya, and also aligned with Grigori Sokolnikov, the People's Commissar for Finance and a candidate Politburo member. Their alliance became known as the New Opposition.|$|E

The vehicle is hanging over the edge of a cliff, and leaving the passengers' lives <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance.</b> Steve regains consciousness first and abandons the wreckage. While everyone emerges alive from the crash, young Sinead Tinker is left paralysed, potentially for life, and Steve's depression takes a turn for the worse. The episode where the bus crashes was broadcast on the same night actress Anne Kirkbride's death occurred and was announced.|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} with the license exposed the club's weak financial situation and led to chaos and panic, prompting many of the key players to flee, including head coach Stoycho Mladenov himself, who left saying he was {{not happy with the}} fire sale of so many important players. The future of CSKA looked grim, its status as a professional club <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance.</b> In the midst of the crisis, Dimitar Penev was given the head coach's job for the third time and burdened with the task of saving the club. With almost all senior players gone, Penev was left to rely on members of the CSKA youth squad. Ultimately, CSKA managed to fulfill all licensing requirements set by the BFU and was allowed to compete in A Group. Despite all the difficulties, and to the surprise of the whole football community, Penev's young squad claimed the Bulgarian SuperCup in August 2008, overcoming Litex 1–0.|$|E

At the first meeting between representatives of the two navies in April 1917, the British First Sea Lord—Admiral Sir John Jellicoe—had astonished the new American naval envoy—Rear Admiral William S. Sims—by informing him that Allied shipping loses had recently surpassed [...] per month, and that the Admiralty did not see any immediate solution to the problem.|$|E
500|$|Conservative media figure Glenn Beck (who {{joined the}} LDS Church in 1999) has alleged that President Barack Obama [...] "is {{going to bring}} us to the verge of {{shredding}} the Constitution, of massive socialism." [...] On November 14, 2008—following Obama's election—Beck appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor and said that [...] "we are {{at the place where}} the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up." [...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, we are at the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread." ...|$|E

[...] Minutes later, Bellamy gave an interview saying {{he was prepared to}} play in any position for his club. However, with his Newcastle United career <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance,</b> he later admitted that he had threatened to fake injury ahead of the Arsenal match, though in a later interview accused Souness of lying about him and his commitment to the club.|$|E

Ferris makes the summation the universe will then always expand, but at a slower and slower rate that never completely comes to a halt.
