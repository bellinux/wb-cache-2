We used the <b>Double</b> <b>Pattern</b> scale (Caron et al, 1993) and the Contraceptives Altitude scale (Kyes, s. d.) We identified a <b>double</b> <b>pattern</b> which was tendentiously liberal, more noticeable among girls, not being influenced by age taking into account the total number of teenagers.

A total of 330 milk flow recorders were collected during morning and evening milkings by using an electronic milk flow meters (Lactocorder (R)). Milk flow curves were examined and subject were divided according milk flow pattern in: normal pattern, bimodal pattern and "double pattern". Data were analysed by using ANOVA and Chi square test. Total milk yield per milking was significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in pluriparous and consistent with the average DIM of 205 days. No differences in milk yield and maximum milk flow were found between the oxytocin groups while both parameters were higher in bimodal and <b>double</b> <b>pattern</b> groups compared to normal milk flow pattern. Lag time was higher (P< 0. 01) in oxytocin treated group and in normal vs the other two pattern groups.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>double</b> <b>patterning</b> has {{received}} interest recently since it can potentially increase the half-pitch resolution {{by a factor}} of 2. This could allow the use of immersion lithography tools beyond the 32 nm node, potentially to the 16 nm node. While <b>double</b> <b>patterning</b> improves pitch resolution, it must rely on non-lithographic methods, such as trimming, to actually reduce the feature size, possibly by as much as 50%.|$|E
50|$|Prototypes using 32 nm {{technology}} first {{emerged in}} the mid-2000s. In 2004, IBM demonstrated a 0.143 μm2 SRAM cell with a poly gate pitch of 135 nm, produced using electron-beam lithography and photolithography on the same layer. It was observed that the cell's sensitivity to input voltage fluctuations degraded significantly at such a small scale. In October 2006, the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC) demonstrated a 32 nm flash patterning capability based on <b>double</b> <b>patterning</b> and immersion lithography. The necessity of introducing <b>double</b> <b>patterning</b> and hyper-NA tools to reduce memory cell area offset some of the cost advantages of moving to this node from the 45 nm node.TSMC similarly used <b>double</b> <b>patterning</b> combined with immersion lithography to produce a 32 nm node 0.183 μm2 six-transistor SRAM cell in 2005.|$|E

40|$|The {{period of}} a muscle's {{activity}} during cycling can be described by the onset and offset of electrical activity. Certain muscles can exhibit two distinct periods of activity (a ‘double burst'), reflecting different muscular functions during a pedal revolution. Our aims were to determine (1) {{the consistency of the}} <b>double</b> burst <b>pattern</b> in the Gastrocnemius Laterals (GL) muscle during cycling and (2) by how much the reliability of the offset of GL is improved by taking the double burst into account. 11 cyclists volunteered to participate. Participants cycled for 6 min at 265 W and 90 rev. min- 1 on three separate days. Using surface electromyography, an ensemble-average of GL was constructed from a 30 s segment. Onset and offset threshold was set at 25 % of the peak activity of the ensemble-averaged pattern to determine the crank angle of onset/offset. Two onsets/offsets were recorded for double bursts. Reliability of the primary offset was determined using the Standard Method (SM), that is, the offset of the final activity; and an Alternative Method (AM), which incorporated the muscular function, with the most frequent offset across days being regarded as the ‘primary' offset. A double burst was consistently detected for only 7 of the 11 cyclists. AM showed better reliability for the offset than SM (Standard Error of Measurement: 6. 8 ° vs 21. 3 °, Intra Class Correlation: 0. 82 vs 0. 47). The <b>double</b> burst <b>pattern</b> is commonly observed in GL while cycling in trained cyclists. However, detection across several days is more difficult and could lead to erroneous conclusions about the (<b>double)</b> burst <b>pattern.</b> When analysing muscles with a possible <b>double</b> burst <b>pattern,</b> researchers could incorporate the muscle's function.
