40|$|The {{human hand}} is a {{masterpiece}} of mechanical complexity, able to perform <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> <b>manipulations</b> and powerful work alike. Designing an animatable human hand model that features the abilities of the archetype created by Nature requires {{a great deal of}} anatomical detail to be modeled. In this paper, we present a human hand model with underlying anatomical structure. Animation of the hand model is controlled by muscle contraction values. We employ a physically based hybrid muscle model to convert these contraction values into movement of skin and bones. Pseudo muscles directly control the rotation of bones based on anatomical data and mechanical laws, while geometric muscles deform the skin tissue using a mass-spring system. Thus, resulting animations automatically exhibit anatomically and physically correct finger movements and skin deformations. In addition, we present a deformation technique to create individual hand models from photographs. A radial basis warping function is set up from the correspondence of feature points and applied to the complete structure of the reference hand model, making the deformed hand model instantly animatable...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Human Movement Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Controversy {{still exists}} among {{researchers}} {{with regard to}} the most effective intervention methods and the success thereof regarding DCD children. This condition is known to have different underlying causes, which can influence the success of intervention programmes. It is indicated in the literature that intervention of motor difficulties early {{in the life of the}} child, can improve motor development and academic achievement and thus contribute to the total wellness of these children. The aims of this study was, firstly, to determine the effect of an intervention programme based on an integrated approach, on 9 to 12 year old farm labourer children with DCD. The data was analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, t-testing as well as effect sizes to determine practical significance. A second aim was to determine the relation between underlying sensory-neurological problems and the measure of success reached with the intervention programme. This data was mainly analysed with descriptive statistics and in a qualitative manner. The third aim was to determine the relation between <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> <b>manipulation</b> skills and behaviour characteristics as assessed by the teacher and the measure of success reached with an intervention programme. This data was also analysed by means of descriptive data and in a qualitative manner. The sample of the investigation, on a farm in the North-West Province, consists of children of farm workers between the ages of 4 and 12 years (n = 36) who were evaluated according to the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC) test (Henderson & Sugden, 1992) to determine their DCD status. Eight children (5 girls and 3 boys) were classified with DCD. One girl was identified in the 9 to 10 year old group, and 5 boys and 2 girls (n = 7) were in the 1 l to 12 year old group. These children were also evaluated on the "Sensory-Neurological Screening test" (Auxter et al., 2001), the ''Qwck Neurological Screening test" (Mutti et al., 1978), and the "Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor proficiency" (Bruininks, 1978) in order to determine the possible underlying causes of their problems on which the content of the intervention programme was based. The MABC Checklist (Henderson & Sugden, 1992) was used to determine the children's <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> <b>manipulation</b> skills as well as their behaviour characteristics as assessed by their teachers. The children were tested eight weeks prior to (PREI), and again just before the programme started (PRE 2) in order to determine the effect of maturation. Immediately after the intervention programme of 8 weeks, twice a week for 45 minutes was completed, they were tested (POSTI) to determine the effect of the programme, and two months (RTI) and nine months (RT 2) later they were re-tested to determine the long term effect of the programme. The intervention programme consists of perceptual-motor, sensory integration and task-specific components. With regard to the first aim of the study, the results indicated that the intervention programme had a positive effect on two of the children, while no effect was noticed on the problems of one, and three of them regressed. The results indicated that with a little modification the intervention programme, based on an integration approach, could have a better effect. The results indicated that each child has different needs, and that the underlying problems might be a reason why the children reacted differently to intervention. However, <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> <b>manipulation</b> skills increased on the short term, while balance skills showed a long term effect. Further research to determine the reasons of a child's problems, is recommended in order to establish the best method of intervention. With reference to the second and third aim of the study, the comparison of the children who improved (n = 2) with those who regressed (n = 3), indicated that those who regressed after the intervention programme, had more complex underlying sensory-neurological conditions. They also experienced more problems regarding <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> <b>manipulation</b> skills as well as behaviour. They also showed poor bilateral integration, which was not the case with the other children. Further research concerning the role that bilateral co-ordination plays in DCD is recommended. From the results of this study, it is also recommended that intervention programmes should be conducted on an individual basis in order to assure that the focus is on the child's specific problems, and to ensure that the intervention has a positive effect. Proper assessment of underlying causes must be done in conjunction with the MABC testing, because this will help to determine the method that is selected for intervention. Master...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: Sensory deficits after stroke {{are common}} with {{prevalence}} rates variously {{reported to be}} 11 % to 85 %. In {{spite of the fact}} that Sensory deficits can decrease the quality of upper limb's movements and result in impairments in <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> <b>manipulation</b> of objects, grasp and manipulative skills and finally decrease the patient's quality of life but commonly overlooked in stroke rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sensory retraining on upper limb recovery. Materials and methods: In this study we studied 5 chronic stroke patients were participated using a single-system (A-B) design. During the baseline phase patient's function and motor impairment of upper limb were measured by Fugl-Meyer and Motoricity Index and their hand dexterity were measured by Box and Block test on three days intervals. When Patients reached to a stable pattern of changes, their treatment program began. In this phase they received sensory retraining intervention for 6 weeks. Based on sensory retraining principles and according to each patient's abilities, intervention began with detection and localization of constant and moving touch and followed by higher discriminatory tasks, such as graphestesia. Then results of evaluations of two phases were analyzed. Results: Four patients showed significant improvements in upper limb function. The data showed significant improvements in motor impairments and hand dexterity in all of them. Conclusion: Regarding of significant recovery of upper limb function, motor impairment and hand dexterity of patients, sensory retraining can be considered as a practical method in rehabilitation of stroke patients.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is "Physiotherapy of <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills for patiens after cerebrovascular stroke". Stroke is a neurological disease that {{is caused by a}} vascular disorder with symptoms corresponding to the affected part of the brain. This disease is the most common and its occurrence can not be reduced despite a great awareness of the risk factors that anyone can affect. The main target of this work is mapping of this stroke issue and its influence on <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills of affected individuals. Than this thesis describe suggestion, implementation and evaluation of therapeutic methods in three probands. Based on those targets a research question was set: What changes in kinesiological testing might occur after the implementation of the proposed therapeutic methods by patiens with impaired <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills after a stroke? This thesis is devided into two main parts: the theoretical part and practical part. The theoretical part deals with the stroke issue and its manifestation by the affected part of the brain as well as its impact on a man. This part describes <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, <b>manipulation,</b> grasps and <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills testing. The last chapter introduces the therapy from the perspective of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and therapy using the robotic technology Armeo Spring and Amadeo. The practical part is based on qualitative research, which includes a complete kinesiology and neurological testing and analysis functions of individuals grip. Short and long term rehabilitation plans have been done. Both are based on the testing results. The research was conducted for patients with subacute phase of stroke who were hospitalised on the Rehabilitation or Neurological Department of Hospital České Budějovice a. s.

Such results challenge a theoretical model postulating that group-level lateralization {{is more likely}} to evolve in social species 3. To test this hypothesis further, we investigated whether Procambarus clarkii, a decapod crustacean considered a non-social species with remarkable burrowing capabilities 4, displays behavioural asymmetries while performing a <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> <b>manipulation</b> task. Crayfish were placed in a rectangular environment, with a removable wall covering one side of the apparatus. Once this wall was removed, animals were free to reach a pellet of food placed beyond a transparent barrier, and only accessible through a small hole, thus requiring the crayfish to use a specific pereopod in order to reach the food. To evaluate lateralization, the pereopod used to grasp the food (left or right) was recorded, along with the time the animals needed to accomplish the task. We observed that crayfish were not strongly lateralized at the individual-level (only 35 out of 122 animals displayed an individual level bias), and the time necessary to solve the task was not different between lateralized and non-lateralized animals (p= 0. 626). This result shows that no advantage is apparent for lateralized individuals 5 - 6 and it could then be concluded that crayfish are equally skilled with both {{the left and the right}} pereopods. By contrast, the analysis on the whole population revealed that there is overall a slight but systematic preference for the use of the right pereopods to graps and pull the food pellet (p= 0. 01). These results indicate that a further invertebrate species can display a certain degree of functional asymmetries within the population, although in absence of significant individual-level lateralization. Furthermore, the systematic preference for right manipulation observed in P. clarkii is similar to that of other vertebrate social species performing the same task 7 and other non-social tasks 8. Therefore, our findings provide support to the fact that preferential limb use has a widespread occurrence and a long evolutionary history...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Prenatal alcohol {{exposure}} (PAE) {{can cause}} fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and associated neurodevelopmental impairments. It is uncertain which types of <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills {{are most likely}} to be affected after PAE or which assessment tools are most appropriate to use in FASD diagnostic assessments. This systematic review examined which types of <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills are impaired in children with PAE or FASD; which <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> assessments are appropriate for FASD diagnosis; and whether <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> impairments are evident at both “low” and “high” PAE levels. Methods: A systematic review of relevant databases was undertaken using key terms. Relevant studies were extracted using a standardized form, and methodological quality was rated using a critical appraisal tool. Results: Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria. Complex <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, such as visual-motor integration, were more frequently impaired than basic <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, such as grip strength. Assessment tools that specifically assessed <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills more consistently identified impairments than those which assessed <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills as part of a generalized neurodevelopmental assessment. <b>Fine</b> <b>motor</b> impairments were associated with “moderate” to “high” PAE levels. Few studies reported <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills of children with “low” PAE levels, so the effect of lower PAE levels on <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills remains uncertain.

Assessing these skills enables parents and teachers to target areas for improvement or prepare children to enter school ready to learn and achieve. To assess children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, current educators are assessing those skills by either determining their shape drawing correctness or measuring their drawing time durations through paper-based assessments. However, the methods involve human experts manually assessing children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, which are time consuming and prone to human error and bias. As there are many children that use sketch-based applications on mobile and tablet devices, computer-based <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skill assessment has high potential to solve {{the limitations of the}} paper-based assessments. Furthermore, sketch recognition technology is able to offer more detailed, accurate, and immediate drawing skill information than the paper-based assessments such as drawing time or curvature difference. While a number of educational sketch applications exist for teaching children how to sketch, they are lacking the ability to assess children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills and have not proved the validity of the traditional methods onto tablet-environments. We introduce our <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skill classifying framework based on children?s digital drawings on tablet-computers. The framework contains two <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skill classifiers and a sketch-based educational interface (EasySketch). The <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skill classifiers contain: (1) KimCHI: the classifier that determines children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills based on their overall drawing skills and (2) KimCHI 2 : the classifier that determines children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills based on their curvature- and corner-drawing skills. Our <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skill classifiers determine children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills by generating 131 sketch features, which can analyze their drawing ability (e. g. DCR sketch feature can determine their curvature-drawing skills). We first implemented the KimCHI classifier, which can determine children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills based on their overall drawing skills. From our evaluation with 10 - fold cross-validation, we found that the classifier can determine children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills with an f-measure of 0. 904. After that, we implemented the KimCHI 2 classifier, which can determine children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills based on their curvature- and corner-drawing skills. From our evaluation with 10 -fold cross-validation, we found that the classifier can determine children?s curvature-drawing skills with an f-measure of 0. 82 and corner-drawing skills with an f-measure of 0. 78. The KimCHI 2 classifier outperformed the KimCHI classifier during the <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skill evaluation. EasySketch is a sketch-based educational interface that (1) determines children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills based on their drawing skills and (2) assists children how to draw basic shapes such as alphabet letters or numbers based on their learning progress. When we evaluated our interface with children, our interface determined children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills more accurately than the conventional methodology by f-measures of 0. 907 and 0. 744, accordingly. Furthermore, children improved their drawing skills from our pedagogical feedback. Finally, we introduce our findings that sketch features (DCR and Polyline Test) can explain children?s <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skill developmental stages.

We explored concurrent relationships between two components of <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, <b>Fine</b> <b>Motor</b> Precision and <b>Fine</b> <b>Motor</b> Integration, and early reading and maths development in two studies with primary school children of low-to-mid socio-economic status in the U.

This may reflect the protective effects of recent national-level interventions to promote early literacy skills in young children in the U. K. that have not been similarly promoted for maths. Second, <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills were a better predictor of early maths ability than they were of early reading ability. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills did not significantly predict reading ability when verbal short-term memory was taken into account. In contrast, <b>Fine</b> <b>Motor</b> Integration remained a significant predictor of maths ability, even after the influence of nonverbal IQ had been accounted for.

Therefore, it is imperative that OT practitioners identify and understand the evidence to support these strategies to ensure intervention effectiveness and best practices. Objective: The purpose of this presentation is to identify the evidence supporting the use of sensory-based interventions for <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> performance. Methods: A systematic search of databases CINAHL, PubMed, OT Search, and OT Seeker yielded 235 articles after removal of duplicates. Title, abstract, and full text screens were completed using inclusion/exclusion criteria, yielding 13 articles for final critique. Authors independently critiqued final articles using Law et al. Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies as adapted by Teal Benevides. Findings The majority of articles (11 / 13) found improvements in <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> outcomes. Sensory-based strategies combined with <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> activities elicited the most improvement in <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills. Specifically, participants demonstrated improvement in handwriting, visual motor skills, functional skills and self-care skills. Results of one study suggest sensory-only strategies were effective in improving handwriting, visual motor skills, and in-hand manipulation, however a different study showed no improvement in these skills. Conclusions: There is moderate evidence to support the use of sensory-based strategies combined with <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> activities to improve <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills in school age children in an outpatient and school setting. However, there is conflicting evidence to support the use of sensory-only strategies. Further research, with more rigorous methodology is required to determine the extent and scope of the efficacy of these strategies.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity of the <b>Fine</b> <b>Motor</b> Scale of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition (PDMS-FM- 2). Participants included two groups of 18 {{children between the ages}} of 4 and 5 years with and without mild <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> problems. The PDMS-FM- 2 was administered twice to 12 children and rated by two occupational therapists. The PDMS-FM- 2 results were compared with scores on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC). In addition, the scores of the children with and without <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> problems were compared. For the test-retest reliability and the inter-rater reliability, correlation coefficients varied from r = 0. 84 to r = 0. 99. These results suggest that PDMS-FM- 2 has excellent test-retest and inter-rater reliability. Convergent validity with the <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> section of the M-ABC and discriminant validity have been confirmed. Only 39 % of the children in the group with problems in <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> activities had <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> problems according to the PDMS-FM- 2. This finding seems to indicate that the PDMS-FM- 2 may not be sensitive enough for this population...|$|R

Problems with the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, muscles, or joints {{can also have}} an effect on <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, and decrease control. If an infant or child up to age five is not developing their <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, they will show signs of difficulty controlling coordinated body movements with the hands, fingers, and face. In young children, the delay in the ability to sit up or learn to walk can be an early sign that there will be issues with <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills. Children may also show signs of difficulty with tasks such as cutting with scissors, drawing lines, folding clothes, holding a pencil and writing, and zipping a zipper. These are tasks that involve <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, and if a child has difficulty with these they might have poor hand eye coordination and could need therapy to improve their skills.|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this {{systematic}} review is to investigate the relationship between <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills and handwriting legibility and speed in children. Methods: Studies were selected if they included both a population of children between 5 to 12 years of age with poor handwriting, and a comparison sample of children with good handwriting. Studies that included participants with a known upper motor neuron lesion, a known intellectual impairment or known visual or hearing loss were excluded. Electronic searches were conducted of the CINAHL, Medline and PsycINFO databases for articles matching these criteria. Results: Nine articles were eligible for inclusion. Seven studies investigated the relationship between <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills and handwriting legibility and four studies compared <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills and handwriting speed. Across the studies selected, children with poor handwriting received significantly lower scores on <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> assessments than children with good handwriting. Low to moderate correlations between <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills and both handwriting legibility and handwriting speed were identified. Significance: Low to moderate correlations identified in this systematic review {{support the notion that}} handwriting is a complex task. To effectively manage handwriting deficits in children occupational therapists need to address <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills as one of many components in a comprehensive handwriting assessment. Conclusions: Future randomised controlled trials are required to examine if a <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills intervention program leads to improvements in handwriting legibility and speed in children with poor handwritin...|$|R

40|$|In task-environments {{with limited}} {{visibility}} (e. g. rescue workers in smoke), individuals rely on tactile perception {{as a primary}} mode of data acquisition. They need to translate tactile information into three-dimensional images, to solve problems mentally, before translating them into motor actions. To assess this ability in an inexpensive, standardised way, the Tupperware Neuropsychological Task (TNT) was developed. It is a timed task using the Tupperware ™ Shape O Toy. Participants completed the TNT blindfolded, and also completed standardised measures of spatial visualisation, tactile form perception and memory, and <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> coordination. Healthy adults (N= 170) aged 19 to 30 completed the tasks on all tests on an individual basis. This paper reports normative data for the TNT, including mean completion time and standard deviations. It also reports small but significant correlations with other measures of tactile form perception, mental rotations, <b>motor</b> <b>manipulation</b> and tactile recall. This suggests that the TNT taps all these constructs in one task, {{which would make it}} an economical measure of the functions required to work effectively in low visibility environments...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. In an {{investigation}} of the functional impact of amblyopia in children, the <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills of amblyopes and agematched control subjects were compared. The influence of visual factors that might predict any decrement in <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills was also explored. [...] - METHODS. Vision and <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills were tested in a group of children (n 82; mean age, 8. 2 1. 7 [SD] years) with amblyopia of different causes (infantile esotropia, n 17; acquired strabismus, n 28; anisometropia, n 15; mixed, n 13; and deprivation n 9), and age-matched control children (n 37; age 8. 3 1. 3 years). Visual motor control (VMC) and upper limb speed and dexterity (ULSD) items of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency were assessed, and logMAR visual acuity (VA) and Randot stereopsis were measured. Multiple regression models were used to identify the visual determinants of <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills performance. RESULTS. Amblyopes performed significantly poorer than control subjects on 9 of 16 <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills subitems and for the overall age-standardized scores for both VMC and ULSD items (P 0. 05). The effects were most evident on timed tasks. The etiology of amblyopia and level of binocular function significantly affected <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skill performance on both items; however, when examined in a multiple regression model that took into account the intercorrelation between visual characteristics, poorer <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills performance was associated with strabismus (F 1, 75 5. 428; P 0. 022), but not with the level of binocular function, refractive error, or visual acuity in either eye. [...] - CONCLUSIONS. <b>Fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills were reduced in children with amblyopia, particularly those with strabismus, compared with control subjects.
