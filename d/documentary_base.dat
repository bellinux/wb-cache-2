This collection contains the German State Secretary's account on a meeting with Soviet ambassador Merekalov. [...] This memorandum reproduces the following ambassador's statement: [...] "'there exists for Russia no reason why she should not live with us on a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better." [...] According to Carr, this document is the first recorded Soviet step in the rapprochement with Germany. The next documentary evidence is the memorandum on the May 17 meeting between the Soviet ambassador and German Foreign Office official, where the ambassador [...] "stated in detail {{that there were no}} conflicts in foreign policy between Germany and Soviet Russia and that therefore {{there was no reason for}} any enmity between the two countries." [...] The third document is the summary of the May 20 meeting between Molotov and German ambassador von der Schulenburg. [...] According to the document, Molotov told the German ambassador that he no longer wanted to discuss only economic matters, and that it was necessary to establish a [...] "political basis", which German officials saw as an [...] "implicit invitation." [...] The last document is the German State Office memorandum on the telephone call made [...] on June 17 by Bulgarian ambassador Draganov. In German accounts of Draganov's report, Astakhov explained that a Soviet deal with Germany better suited the Soviets than one with Britain and France, although from the Bulgarian ambassador it [...] "could not be ascertained whether it had reflected the personal opinions of Herr Astakhov or the opinions of the Soviet Government".|$|E

5000|$|The History of Soviet Russia series {{were not}} {{translated}} into Russian {{and published in}} the Soviet Union until 1990. A Soviet journal commented in 1991 that Carr was [...] "almost unknown to a broad Soviet readership", though all Soviet historians were aware of his work, {{and most of them}} had considerable respect for Carr, they had been unable to say so until Perestroika. Those Soviet historians who specialized in rebutting the [...] "bourgeois falsifiers" [...] as Western historians were so labelled in the Soviet Union attacked Carr for writing that Soviet countryside was in chaos after 1917, but praised Carr as one of the [...] "few bourgeois authors" [...] who told the [...] "truth" [...] about Soviet economic achievements. Through right up until glasnost period, Carr was considered a [...] "bourgeois falsifier" [...] in the Soviet Union, Carr was praised as a British historian who taken [...] "certain steps" [...] towards Marxism, and whose History of Soviet Russia was described as [...] "fairly objective" [...] and [...] "one of the most fundamental works in bourgeois Sovietology". In a preface to the Soviet edition of The History of Soviet Russia in 1990, the Soviet historian Albert Nenarokov wrote in his lifetime Carr had been 'automatically been ranked with the falsifiers", but in fact The History of Soviet Russia was a [...] "scrupulous, professionally conscientious work". Nenarokov called Carr a [...] "honest, objective scholar, espousing liberal principles and attempting on the basis of an enormous <b>documentary</b> <b>base</b> to create a satisfactory picture of the epoch he was considering and those involved in it, to assist a sober and realistic perception of the USSR and {{a better understanding of the}} great social processes of the twentieth century". However, Nenarokov expressed some concern about Carr's use of Stalinist language such as calling Bukharin part of the [...] "right deviation" [...] in the Party without the use of the quotation marks. Nenarokov took the view that Carr had too narrowly reduced Soviet history after 1924 down to a choice of either Stalin or Trotsky, arguing that Bukharin was a better, more humane alternative to both Stalin and Trotsky.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the features of}} the Soviet reception of the novel by John Steinbeck. «The winter of our anxiety» published in the USSR within the sunset of «thaw» in 1962. Despite the restrained assessment of the novel at its homeland and the general low opinion about the post-war work of Steinbeck, in the USSR «Winter of our anxiety» was accepted very warmly, after the Nobel committee of Soviet critics began to talk about the return of «old times of Steinbeck>s «Grapes of wrath». However, no doubt that the reason for the success of this book in the USSR was not much Steinbeck>s «critics of bourgeois reality», the «American Dream», which commonly was written by the domestic press as guessable Soviet readers parallels between the way the main character of the novel Ethan Allen Hawley, committed them to choose between good and evil, «money and humanity» - and his own life, ambiguous and unstable situation of the creative intelligentsia in the Soviet Union at the beginning of 1960. However, the inability to say publicly about his own doubts and problems that inevitably led to a repetition of the rhetoric of the 1930 s reduced the value of the novel «Winter of our anxiety» in denouncing the American way of life. <b>Documentary</b> <b>base</b> article made reviews of the novel members of the editorial board of the magazine «Foreign Literature «, research works by R.

40|$|How did a topic {{linked to}} {{macroeconomics}} {{come to be}} part of the cultural identity of a country and have a museum? The idea of its creation arose in the mid- 2001, when a group of graduate students and professors from the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires began to hold meetings and discussing the matter of foreign debt. In 2003, the task on creating "a space to illustrate in a didactic and attractive way the history of Argentine debt" was commenced; initiated by the Managing Council. The first exhibition “Foreign Debt: Never Again” was opened in April, 2005. This museum was created with the aim – according to the director’s thinking – of cooperating in the construction of citizenship in the frame of the historical memory and spreading the problematic of the foreign indebtedness, a topic that identifies all the Argentineans in their daily life. Opened to the general public and to the university students of all faculties, it has a permanent exhibition that is complemented by the resources of comic strips and a series of changing videos. In addition, its center of documentation offers investigators the most complete <b>documentary</b> <b>base</b> on the topic in the country. The important question is: does it allow the visitors who do not have a thorough knowledge of the subject to think about the facts from an objective point of view or does it impose an ideological message on them?

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted {{to one of the}} most {{important}} administrative and political actions initiated by Stalin’s regime in the mid- 1930 s – campaigns on verification and exchange of party documents. The author made an attempt to examine the whole course of the campaign as much as possible in detail, from the preparation stage at the beginning of 1935 until its completion in the autumn of 1936 in a particular historical and geographical location – in the areas of the Upper Volga region. <b>Documentary</b> <b>base</b> of this research were, first of all, archival materials, introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. In this article series on the basis of the evidence the author reveals the following provisions. Firstly, investigation of party documents represented a large-scale ideological and political examination covering all regions – intra-party filtering of communists for “political reliability”. Secondly, the immediate aim of the campaign was to collect materials compromising the Communists and to make a list of the potentially repressed. One of the most important tools for carrying out the “ideological examination” of the Party and Soviet nomenclature used together with public security bodies in the territory of the Upper Volga region in the mid- 1930 s, was represented by the Party Control Commission (CPC) at the Central Committee of the CPSU (b) and its regional structure – Communist Party Collegium and later by the authorized representatives of the CPC of the Ivanovo and Yaroslavl regions. The author makes the general conclusion – campaign for the exchange and verification of party documents became the representative illustration of methodologically verified political technologies of the Stalin’s regime, as evidenced by its course: organization; full control by the center by means of directives; efficiency manifested in revealing “socially alien elements” recorded statistically for CPC line...|$|E
