40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the effects of <b>differences</b> in {{temporal}} <b>gating</b> and ear of presentation (both separately and in combination) on listeners' ability to detect an increment in the level of a 1 kHz component (the target) relative to that of four spectrally flanking components. The flanking components were always presented to the listeners' right ear, while the target component was either presented to the same ear (monaural presentation) or to the left ear (dichotic presentation). Similarly, the target and flanking components were either gated on and off at the same time (synchronous presentation), or else the target component began 100 ms before and terminated 100 ms after the four flanking components (asynchronous presentation). On average, thresholds were lowest in the synchronous, monaural condition, and highest in the two asynchronous conditions. Ear differences alone did result in elevated thresholds for most listeners. However, combining <b>differences</b> in <b>gating</b> and ear of presentation produced thresholds that were indistinguishable from those obtained when <b>gating</b> <b>differences</b> alone were employed. These results are consistent with the suggestion that <b>differences</b> in temporal <b>gating</b> lead to more complete segregation of concurrent frequency components than differences in spatial location. ...|$|R

Notably, α 1 I tail currents require two or even three exponentials, whereas α 1 G tails were well described by a single exponential over a wide voltage range. Also, closed-state inactivation is more significant for α 1 I, even for relatively strong depolarizations. Despite these <b>differences,</b> <b>gating</b> of α 1 I can be described by the same kinetic scheme used for α 1 G, where voltage sensor movement is allosterically coupled to inactivation.

The voltage dependence of this slow current does not differ from the dependence of the fast current.

This slow sodium current induces a depolarization and results in repetitive firing pattern and burst firing in a time-dependent manner. BotIT2 decreases the maximal peak of the fast depolarizing sodium inward current and thus causes a decrease in action potential amplitude. Together, BotIT2 modifies the kinetics of insect’s sodium channel activation, transforms fast sodium currents in slow current and enhances (in DUM) or induces (in the axon) a repetitive firing pattern or burst activity, but of smaller amplitude.|$|R

This paper investigates {{the effect of the}} asymmetric source and drain geometries of surround-gate vertical MOSFETs on the drain leakage currents in the OFF-state region of operation. Measurements of gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) and body leakage are carried out as a function of temperature for transistors connected in the drain-on-top and drain-on-bottom configurations. Asymmetric leakage currents are seen when the source and drain terminals are interchanged, with the GIDL being higher in the drain-on-bottom configuration and the body leakage being higher in the drain-on-top configuration. Band-to-band tunneling is identified as the dominant leakage mechanism for both the GIDL and body leakage from electrical measurements at temperatures ranging from ? 50 to 200 ?C.

Low frequency noise measurements are known as an effective characterization method for the evaluation of device reliability. This technique is usually applied on the drain current spectral density, but it is now largely accepted that the gate access is a major reliability indicator. Moreover, devices featuring slight differences in their drain current noise can be subjected to strong <b>differences</b> on their <b>gate</b> leakage currents, and as a consequence on the current low frequency noise (LFN). In the present work, LFN measurements are investigated on the gate and drain currents of two sets of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) with high and low gate leakage currents. It is demonstrated that devices featuring weak differences on their drain current can be subjected to strong <b>differences</b> on their <b>gate</b> leakage signatures: moreover, it is found that the high leakage current can generate numerous traps under the gated zone of the transistor, leading to a change of the intrinsic tuning voltage and by consequence of the number of carriers, thus explaining the reduction on the drain current. The transistors show a difference of 3 to 4 decades on their gate current noise and a negligible shift of 20 % on their drain current noise. The large variations on the gate LFN signatures between the two sets of devices, and the induced charges for the leaky devices can probably be related with large differences on the expected lifetimes for the devices under test.
