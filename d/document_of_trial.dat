This presence was accompanied by political political power during the first eight centuries (since the conquest of Andalusia in 92 AH / 711 AD until the fall of Granada in 897 AH / 1492 AD), and then became the presence of large groups of Muslims spread throughout Spain carrying different names: The first Mudejares, then the Moriscos, {{did not have the}} political authority {{to take care of their}} affairs, but were merely subjects subject to Christian authority and subjected to various forms of persecution until finally the laws of collective expulsion were passed between 1609 and 1614.

With the reign of Henry VIII, however, its character changed to concentrate more on the sovereign's most intimate and domestic matters which the Crown wished to keep from prying eyes. The subjects of its contents included Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard, Lady Jane Grey, Walter Raleigh, the Earl of Essex, Guy Fawkes, and other such cases. The closet which succeeded the ox-hide pouch was locked with three separate locks, the keys to which were in the possession of the Lord Chief Justice, the Attorney General, and the Master of the Crown Office. In the late 19th century, all documents were removed from the locked closet and given to the care of the Public Record Office, distributed into their proper series and topics, and are now accessible with limitations, with due care for their preservation. The <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> Queen Anne, for example, had been thought long destroyed but after their removal and examination were found to be almost entirely complete.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a novel approach}} for automatically generating a virtual instructor from textual input only. Our fully implemented system first analyzes the rhetorical structure of the input text and then creates various question-answer pairs using patterns. These patterns have been derived from correlations found between rhetorical structure of monologue texts and question-answer pairs in the corresponding dialogues. A selection of the candidate pairs is verbalized into a diverse collection of question-answer pairs. Finally the system compiles the collection of question-answer pairs into scripts for a virtual instructor. Our end-to-end system presents questions in pre-fixed order and the agent answers them. Our system was evaluated {{with a group of}} twenty-four subjects. The evaluation was conducted using three informed consent <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>trials</b> from the domain of colon cancer. Each <b>of</b> the <b>documents</b> was explained by a virtual instructor using 1) text, 2) text and agent monologue, and 3) text and agent performing question-answering.

40|$|In his {{controversial}} 1998 film, The Specialist, Israeli director Eyal Sivan casts the Holocaust {{in a new}} light when he represents it {{through the eyes of the}} Nazi perpetrator. Sivan and his scriptwriter, human rights activist Rony Brauman, re-assemble and manipulate footage originally filmed by Leo Hurwitz for Capital Cities Broadcasting <b>of</b> Adolf Eichmann’s <b>trial</b> by an Israeli court in Jerusalem in 1961. Specifically, Sivan recycles the video footage <b>of</b> the <b>trial</b> into a 16 mm film that critiques, not the heinous nature of Eichmann’s crimes, nor the depravity of the man who committed them, but the system of regulation that constructed and judged Eichmann. While the video footage was originally filmed as a <b>document</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trial,</b> Sivan radically redeploys the same images in a narrative that exposes the manipulations of the court, its representations and the continued injustice of such institutions and representations today, 45 years later. According to The Specialist, Eichmann’s actions are not on trial; they are a foregone conclusion. To prove Eichmann’s guilt or innocence was not the point <b>of</b> the <b>trial</b> in the first place, and it is certainly not the goal of The Specialist. Through its careful weaving of fragments of the proceedings, over the course of its narrative, The Specialist reveals the relationship of otherness — the differences and identicalities — between Adolf Eichmann, the ‘deportation specialist’ and Attorney General Gideon Hausner for the prosecution. Simultaneously, the film considers the relationship between Eichmann and the crimes of the National Socialist Party as they were forged by the Israeli court...|$|R

Feeling he had not said {{what he wanted to}} say about Joan of Arc, Dello Joio returned to her as the source of this new work. He wrote an entirely new libretto in two acts, going back to the historical <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> her <b>trial</b> as a source for the new text. He also wrote completely new music for the opera. Dello Joio commented on this process: The Trial at Rouen is not a version of my first opera, but is a completely new statement, both musically and dramatically; though the temptation to use the old material was great... The premise of my opera is simple. My conclusion is that the Joan story recounts the ageless conflict between the individual of excessive imagination and those who hold to the status quo. I was aware of how dangerous this concept was, because singing philosophy can be a bore. But, in reading the intense human drama between Joan and her accusers leaped forth from the pages in highly emotional terms.|$|R

30|$|GIS {{has some}} {{important}} advantages for creating new {{insight into the}} spatial development of the past. It can include the location explicitly where they were placed. Secondly, it allows integrating data from different sources. Finally, it enables different types of spatial analysis and visualizes the data and its changing pattern. In fact, the main essence of GIS in historical geography {{is that it can}} incorporate qualitative data (like historical text) for spatial analysis.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the subject of collaborationism. The author {{for the first time}} examines the materials <b>of</b> the <b>trial,</b> held in Riga in October 1965. Some <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> the criminal <b>trials</b> against former SS guards, held in the USSR in 1945 - 1965 are also introduced for the scientific use for the first time. Special attention is attached to the collaborators' personal participation in single, localized murders. The circumstances and sites of these murders are usually little-known and remain beyond the scope of scientific research. This is explained by the fact that, unlike Babi Yar or Zmievskaya Balka, the number of victims of these localized murders is incomparably small and therefore, could never acquire a symbolic meaning and be used for propaganda purposes. The author draws attention to certain behavioral features of some of the crimes participants. In the author's view, the politicized claims of some researchers regarding the prominent role of certain ethnicities in Nazi crimes are debatable. The article emphasizes that the ethnic composition of local Nazi collaborators within the occupied territories depended on the ethnic composition of the population of those territories. Crimes and criminals transcend national boundaries. As one of the proofs of his thesis, the author cites the ethnic composition of the SS guards in the Stutthof concentration camp and in the Trawniki training camp. This article may stimulate researchers' interest to the problem of localized murders, including the possibilities to determine crime sites, number of victims and their names, the crime participants and perpetuate the memory of the dead...|$|R
