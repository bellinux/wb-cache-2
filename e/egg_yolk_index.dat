40|$|The {{experiment}} {{examined the}} effect of inclusion of sun-dried alfalfa leaf meal and 0. 05 Xylam enzyme (ALM+X) in laying hens' diet on eggs' production and quality. Forty eight White Hisex laying hens aged 20 weeks were offered four iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous diets (D, D, D and D of 0. 0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 7 % ALM, 1 2 3 4 respectively) supplemented with Xylam enzyme (0. 05 %), for 8 weeks. Supplementation of ALM+X to layer hens’ diet showed insignificant differences in feed consumption, feed conversion ratio, hen-day egg production percentage, egg weight, egg albumin height and egg specific gravity when compared to alfalfa free diet.

Egg and blood samples were collected at monthly intervals after the egg production reached peak level.

Chromium supplementation resulted in a 1. 88 % reduction in feed consumption and 4. 28 % improvement in the efficiency of feed utilisation. Chromium had no effect on live weight change, overall mean egg production, egg weight, specific gravity, shape index, shell thickness and Haugh unit, but increased shell breaking strength, albumen and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> <b>index</b> values were noted. Supplemental chromium had no significant effect on serum phosphorus, while it resulted in increases in calcium and magnesium concentrations at first sampling.

[著者抄録] 68 週令のWhite Leghon(WL) 種およびRhode Island Red(RIR) 種の産卵鶏を供試し、給与飼料へのDES添加が卵黄の色調および卵の品質におよばす影響について検討した。DESの添加量は実験の進行とともに、無添加(20 日間) 、 10 ppm(16 日間) 、 20 ppm(16 日間) 、 40 ppm(16 日間) と増量し、実験の終了前 32 日間は添加を中止した。その結果を要約するとつぎのとおりである。 1. DESの添加は卵黄の色調を改善し、WL、RIRともに明らかに濃くなり、無添加時にくらべ有意差を認めた。DESの添加量の違いによる色調への影響は、添加濃度の高い処理が濃厚であるが、色調と添加量とは必ずしも比例しないで、着色の度合は 10 ppmが一番大きい。添加の中止により色調は次第にうすくなったが、 30 - 33 日後ても実験初期の色調には戻らなかった。このような色調の変化に対して、飼料摂取量および産卵率の影響について検討した結果それらの影響は何ら認められなかった。 2. 色調は品種によって差のあることが認められ、WLよりもRIRの色調が濃かったが、DESに対する反応はむしろWLの方が強いと考えられる。 3. DESが卵の諸形質におよばす影響については、卵重では品種による違いがあったが、DES添加の影響は WLにおいて強く、添加量の増量によって大きくなる傾向があったが、RIRには影響を与えないようである。卵殻の厚さについては、DESの添加によって両品種ともやや薄くなる傾向が認められたが、この傾向はRIRの方が目立つ結果であった。卵黄係数では、WLよりもRIRが大きいようで、DESは両種に値を大きくする方向で影響があるように思われる。卵黄係数の計算要因でこの点を検討した結果では、卵黄の直径が短くなり、卵黄高が高くなる結果を得た。更に、卵黄高を維持する要因として卵黄粗脂肪含量を検討したが、 20 ppm、 40 ppmは無添加よりも多いことを認めた。この結果はDESによる色調改善と関連かあるものと思われる。卵黄のpHは品種的にも、DESの添加による影響も認められなかった...|$|R

The assessments of each experiment were related to one mineral, thus, experiment 1 assessed the supplementation with selenium in 0. 35 -, 0. 70 - and 1. 05 -mg/kg levels of feed; experiment 2, the supplementation with zinc in 50 -, 100 - and 150 -mg/kg levels of feed; and experiment 3, the supplementation of manganese with 60 -; 120 - and 180 -mg/kg levels of feed. All diets were evaluated compared with a control diet without mineral supplementation. Birds were distributed in a completely randomized experimental design, with eight birds per plot and six replicates per treatment. Fifty-five days after the beginning of diets, the yolks of three eggs from each plot were collected for selenium, zinc and manganese quantification, whereas the albumens of three eggs from each parcel were collected for analysis of selenium concentration.

Diets with either com or Florida 301 wheat as the grain source were fed to 50 -wk-old hens (140 per diet). Eggs were collected and stored at 10 C for up to 4 wk or at 23 C for 1 wk. At weekly intervals Haugh units, <b>yolk</b> <b>index,</b> <b>yolk</b> rupture strength, and yolk deformation distance at rupture were measured and compression percentages were calculated. Haugh units and <b>yolk</b> <b>index</b> were not affected by diet. Yolk rupture strength and deformation were 12. 3 % and 4. 7 % greater, respectively, for eggs from hens on the wheat diet than for those from hens on the corn diet. Both rupture strength and deformation declined significantly with storage. Eggs stored at 23 C were lower in yolk rupture strength and deformation than those held at IOC. Percentage of compression at rupture also declined with storage, but the decline was initially more rapid for <b>egg</b> <b>yolks</b> from birds fed the corn diet than for <b>egg</b> <b>yolks</b> from birds fed the wheat diet. It was concluded that Florida 301 wheat may be substituted for com without incurring any problems in the quality of the yolk and that yolk breaking strength would be enhanced...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hen's egg allergy is a {{frequent}} cause of childhood food allergy. <b>Egg</b> <b>yolk</b> is used in various commonly consumed foods; if children with allergy to hen's egg could eat heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> {{their quality of life}} (QOL) would improve. No reports exist regarding oral food challenges (OFCs) for heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b> We aimed to clarify whether pediatric patients allergic to hen's egg could consume heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b> Methods: Data from pediatric patients who had undergone OFCs for heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Among 919 patients, positive OFC results were obtained in 17. 0 % of patients; seven presented with severe symptoms. Older age, high specific IgEvalue for ovomucoid, low total IgE levels, and history of anaphylaxis related to food other than hen's egg were risk factors for positive OFC results. Specific IgE values for eggwhite, ovomucoid, and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> indicative of a negative predictive value > 95 %, were 0. 71, 0. 41, and 0. 17 kU(A) /l, respectively.

Heritability estimates for <b>egg</b> weight, <b>yolk</b> <b>index,</b> albumen index and albumen weight ranged from low to medium while those of haugh unit, yolk weight, shell weight and shell thickness ranged from low to high. The genetic and phenotypic correlations of egg weight with other egg quality traits except shell quality traits were mostly positive and moderate to high. High positive genetic and phenotypic correlations between haugh unit and other traits were observed. Genetic correlation of yolk weight with albumen weight was positive while that with shell quality traits was mostly negative. Shell weight {{was positively correlated with}} shell thickness. Conclusion: Significant genetic group differences were observed for various egg quality traits studied. The heritability estimates for different egg quality traits were low to moderate.

The dietary treatments were supplemented with 0, 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5 and 6. 0 % purslane meal. Laying hens were fed for five weeks following a seven day adaptation period.

A total of 25 <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> samples of day 35 (n = 5 <b>egg</b> <b>yolks</b> for each treatment) were collected to analyse physical quality of eggs.
