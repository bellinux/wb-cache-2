40|$|Bernofsky, Carl (The University of Kansas, Kansas City), and Russell C. Mills. <b>Diaphorases</b> from Aerobacter aerogenes. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 1404 – 1414. 1966. —Five enzymes which {{catalyze}} {{the reduction}} of 2, 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH 2) have been separated from sonic extracts of Aerobacter aerogenes B 199 by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose chromatography. Three major chromatographic fractions (enzymes I, II, and III) account {{for most of the}} activity in the extract. Of the two minor fractions, one is associated with cytochrome b 1. The other is extremely labile, and was not studied further. The chromatographed <b>diaphorases</b> appear to have a specific requirement for flavin mononucleotide. They are also readily inactivated by dilution; however, this can be prevented by a combination of phosphate buffer, bovine serum albumin, and flavin mononucleotide. The different enzymes are clearly distinguishable by their activities with NADH 2 and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH 2) in the presence of various electron acceptors (2, 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol, ferricyanide, menadione, and cytochrome c), and by their responses to inhibitors (amobarbital, antimycin A, Atabrine, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate, dicumarol, and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol). With 2, 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol as acceptor, enzymes I, II, and III have comparable activities with either NADH 2 or NADPH 2. With menadione and ferricyanide as acceptors, enzymes II and III exhibit very high, NADH 2 -specific activities. When cytochrome c is the acceptor, however, enzyme III shows greater activity with NADPH 2 as the electron donor. Ferricyanide is the most active acceptor for the cytochrome b 1 -containing fraction. Coenzyme Q 6 does not appear to serve as an acceptor. All the <b>diaphorases,</b> with the exception of that in the cytochrome b 1 -containing fraction, are inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate. Amobarbital is relatively ineffective and inhibits only the indophenol reductase activity of enzyme I. The menadione reductase activity of enzymes I, and II, and the <b>diaphorases</b> in the cytochrome b 1 -containing fraction are strongly inhibited by antimycin A, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, dicumarol, and Atabrine. However, the menadione reductase activity of enzyme III is affected only by the last three of these inhibitors.

50|$|Oxidative protein {{modification}} {{is likely}} to be a pre-digestive mechanism used by Dionaea muscipula. Aqueous leaf extracts have been found to contain quinones such as the naphthoquinone plumbagin that couples to different NADH-dependent <b>diaphorases</b> to produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide upon autoxidation. Such oxidative modification could rupture animal cell membranes. Plumbagin is known to induce apoptosis, associated with the regulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. When the Dionaea extracts were pre-incubated with <b>diaphorases</b> and NADH in the presence of serum albumin (SA), subsequent tryptic digestion of SA was facilitated. Since the secretory glands of Droseraceae contain proteases and possibly other degradative enzymes, it may be that the presence of oxygen-activating redox cofactors function as extracellular pre-digestive oxidants to render membrane-bound proteins of the prey (insects) more susceptible to proteolytic attacks.|$|R

The fetuses were categorized into three groups based on their CVRL. Results: In Group I, the distribution of enzymes was uniformly weak in developing villi-like projections in cecum and completely absent from submucosa. In Group II, the enzymes showed a moderate to strong activity in epithelium lining tunica mucosa which progressively decreased as the fetus progresses toward late gestational age.

The most distinct feature of the carbohydrate content of the epididymis was a layer of acidic, alcian blue-positive glycoprotein over the luminal surface of the epithelium, particularly in the terminal segment. PAS-positive, diastase-resistant inclusions were also found throughout the epdidymis. Neutral lipid occurred as droplets {{above and below the}} nucleus in the epithelium of the middle segment, and as supranuclear accumulations in the terminal segment. All the enzymes except the steroid dehydrogenases were detected in the epididymal epithelium, and all except the steroid dehydrogenases and acid phosphatase were detected in the spermatozoa. There was considerable variation in the intensity of the cytochemical reactions in the epithelium, but not in the spermatozoa, in different regions of the epididymis. In general, the enzymes involved in active transport showed strongest reactions in the initial and terminal segments, the reactions in the stereocilia being the most intense. The enzymes involved in energy metabolism showed strongest reactions in the middle and terminal segments, with the activity being fairly evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the principal cells. However, the two lysosomal enzymes which were studied showed quite different distributions: the reactions for acid phosphatase were strongest in the initial and middle segments, whilst the reactions for non-specific esterase were strongest in the middle and terminal segments.

5000|$|Gregorio Weber {{was born}} in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1916. He {{attended}} the University of Buenos Aires where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1942. While a medical student, from 1939 to 1943, {{he worked in the}} Department of Physiology and Biochemistry as a teaching assistant for Bernardo Alberto Houssay who had already achieved renown as a physiologist for his work on the endocrine system and in particular the pituitary gland (Houssay shared the 1947 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine with Carl and Gerty Cori). Weber continued his studies at the University of Cambridge under the guidance of Malcolm Dixon, well-known enzymologist, and, in 1947, earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry. His thesis, titled [...] "Fluorescence of Riboflavin, <b>Diaphorase</b> and Related Substances", {{marked the beginning of the}} application of fluorescence spectroscopy to biomolecules.A large portion of Weber’s thesis was devoted to measurements on the quenching of fluorescence of riboflavin and on development of a general theory of quenching by complex formation. This led to his first publication entitled: [...] "The quenching of fluorescence in liquids by complex formation. Determination of the mean life of the complex". This paper was the first to demonstrate that fluorescence quenching can take place after formation of molecular complexes of finite duration rather than collisions. His second publication entitled [...] "Fluorescence of riboflavin and flavin adenine dinucleotide", was the first demonstration of an internal complex in FAD. Years later he was to follow up this work with the first demonstration that NADH also formed an internal complex and with more complete characterizations of the excited state properties of FAD and NADH.From 1948 to 1952 Weber carried out independent investigations at the Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry at Cambridge, supported by a British Beit Memorial Fellowship. At that time he began to delve more deeply into the theory of fluorescence polarization and also began to develop methods which would allow him to study proteins which did not contain an intrinsic fluorophore such as FAD or NADH (the fluorescence of the aromatic amino acids had not yet been discovered). To this end, he invested considerable time and effort in synthesizing a fluorescent probe which could be covalently attached to proteins and which possessed absorption and emission characteristics appropriate for the instrumentation available in post-war England. The result of two years of effort was the still popular probe dimethylaminonaphthalene sulfonyl chloride or dansyl chloride. With this tool in hand and with new instrumentation he began to investigate several protein systems, publishing his theory and experimental results in two classic papers published in 1952, namely, Polarization of the fluorescence of macromolecules. I. Theory and experimental method and Polarization of the fluorescence of macromolecules. II. Fluorescent conjugates of ovalbumin and bovine serum albumin. The theory paper (which contains an acknowledgement to F. Perrin for his suggestions) includes an extension of Perrin’s theory of depolarization due to rotation of ellipsoidal molecules. Specifically, Weber showed that Perrin’s complex equations, which required a knowledge of the orientation of the fluorophore’s absorption and emission oscillators with respect to the axis of rotation of the ellipsoid, could be considerably simplified if the fluorophores carrying the oscillators were assumed to be randomly oriented on the macromolecule. This paper also contained a formulation of the law of additivity of polarizations.Weber stayed at Cambridge as an independent researcher until 1953 when Hans Krebs recruited him for the new Biochemistry Department at Sheffield University.|$|E

40|$|NADPH <b>diaphorase</b> {{staining}} neurons, uniquely {{resistant to}} toxic insults and neurodegenerative disorders, have been colocalized with neurons {{in the brain}} and peripheral tissue containing nitric oxide synthase (EC 1. 14. 23. -), which generates nitric oxide (NO), a recently identified neuronal messenger molecule. In the corpus striatum and cerebral cortex, NO synthase immunoreactivity and NADPH <b>diaphorase</b> staining are colocalized in medium to large aspiny neurons. These same neurons colocalize with somatostatin and neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity. NO synthase immunoreactivity and NADPH <b>diaphorase</b> staining are colocalized in the pedunculopontine nucleus with choline acetyltransferase-containing cells and are also colocalized in amacrine cells of the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cells of the retina, myenteric plexus neurons of the intestine, and ganglion cells of the adrenal medulla. Transfection of human kidney cells with NO synthase cDNA elicits NADPH <b>diaphorase</b> staining. The ratio of NO synthase to NADPH <b>diaphorase</b> staining in the transfected cells is the same as in neurons, indicating that NO synthase fully accounts for observed NADPH staining. The identity of neuronal NO synthase and NADPH <b>diaphorase</b> suggests a role for NO in modulating neurotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|The NAD(P) H-nitrate reductase complex (overall-NR) of Chlamydomonas reinhardii {{exhibits}} two partial activities: NAD(P) H-cytochrome c reductase (<b>diaphorase)</b> {{and reduced}} benzyl viologen-NR (terminal-NR). Mild tryptic digestion of the enzyme complex {{resulted in the}} loss of both overall and terminal-NR activities, whereas <b>diaphorase</b> activity remained unaltered. The <b>diaphorase</b> activity of mutant 104 and the terminal-NR activity of mutant 305 of C. reinhardii, which are the sole activities related to NR present in these mutants, responded to tryptic treatment to the same extent as the corresponding activities of the wild enzyme complex. Trypsin disassembled the 220 -kd NR native complex by destroying the aggregation capability of the <b>diaphorase</b> subunits without affecting their activity nor molecular size (45 kd). A 67 -kd thermostable protein, containing molybdenum co-factor, was also released from trypsin-treated NR. This protein lacked <b>diaphorase</b> and NR activities but was able to reconstitute the overall-NR complex by complementation with untreated <b>diaphorase</b> subunit of mutant 104. Our results support a tetrameric structure for the C. reinhardii NR complex, containing two kinds of subunits...|$|E
40|$|A histochemical {{method is}} {{described}} for the localization of triphosphopyridine nucleotide <b>diaphorase</b> using a recently synthesized tetrazolium salt (Nitro-BT). By {{virtue of the}} favorable histochemical properties of this reagent, it has been possible to demonstrate that whereas DPN <b>diaphorase</b> is usually restricted to the mitochondria, the TPN <b>diaphorase</b> activity of corresponding cells was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in granules too fine to be considered mitochondria. Furthermore, although the <b>diaphorase</b> alone {{is responsible for the}} passage of electrons from TPNH to the tetrazole, it has been found that sites of activity of different TPN-linked dehydrogenases can be visualized in tissue sections, and characteristic loci for each enzyme may be observed. For example, whereas TPN <b>diaphorase</b> and isocitric dehydrogenase have an extensive distribution in the kidney cortex, 6 -phosphogluconic dehydrogenase is limited to the cells of the macula densa...|$|E
40|$|Erythrocytic NADH methemoglobin <b>diaphorase</b> acquires NADH-dichlorophenolindophenol <b>diaphorase</b> {{activity}} when enzyme-associated NAD is removed. This {{transformation is}} reversible {{and can be}} mediated by membrane NAD glycohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 2. 5) in hemolysates {{as well as in}} intact cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. It is abolished either in NADH methemoglobin <b>diaphorase</b> deficiency or in NAD(P) glycohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 2. 6) deficiency which is common in Afro-American but not in European-American adults. Activities of erythrocytic NADP glycohydrolase and NAD glycohydrolase appear to depend on a single membrane enzyme...|$|E
40|$|The four {{kinds of}} anti-tumor agents i. e. nitromin (0. 5 mg per mouse, four times), {{colchicine}} (0. 05 mg per mouse, one time), sakomycin (5 mg per mouse, one time) and mitomycin C (0. 04 mg per mouse, one time) were intraperitoneally administered to dds-mice {{which had been}} transplanted with Ehrlich ascites tumor seven days previously. And the changes of the DPN <b>diaphorase,</b> TPN <b>diaphorase,</b> succinic dehydrogenase (SD) and α-glycero-phosphate dehydrogenase (αGD) of the ascites tumor cells were cytochemically examined in the smear method and suspension method. 1) In general, moderate morphological changes of the tumor cells by these anti-tumor agents were observed, and the changes of the stainability of the oxidative enzymes were often observed. 2) After nitromin administration. no change of the stainability of the DPN <b>diaphorase</b> and TPN <b>diaphorase</b> in the smear method and slight increase of their stainability in the suspension method were observed. The stainabilities of the SD and α-GD were decreased in lesser degree in both methods. 3) After colchicine administration, no change of the stainability of the DPN <b>diaphorase</b> and TPN <b>diaphorase</b> in the smear method was observed, but their stainability of all tumor cells showed a tendency down to keep same intensity. A slight decrease of the stainability of the SD and α-GD was observed in the smear method, while their stainabilities were slightly increased in the suspension method. 4) After sarkomycin administration, stainabilities of all four enzymes were decreased in certain degree in the smear method, but the DPN <b>diaphorase</b> and TPN <b>diaphorase</b> staining intensity were remarkably decreased in the suspention method and their stainabilities of all cells showed a tendency down to keep same intensity. The SD and α-GD staining intensity were also decreased slightly in the suspension method. 5) After the administration of mitomycin C, changes of the staining intensity of the DPN <b>diaphorase</b> and TPN <b>diaphorase</b> were scarcely observed in both methods. The staining intensity of the cells in the end stage of the interphase showed to be decreased in lesser degree. Stainabilities of the SD and α-GD were slightly decreased in the smear method, while their stainabilities were slightly increased in the suspension method. 6) It might be assumed that the decrease of the stainability reacted with the anti-tumor agents in the smear method specimen showed decrease or destruction of the oxidative enzymes and that the change of stainability reacted in the suspension method specimen showed change of {{the activity of the}} enzymes...|$|E
40|$|DT <b>diaphorase</b> is a {{flavoprotein}} that enzymaticly transfers two electrons from quinones as intermediate substrates and {{has been}} reported to increase its activity in the liver after exposure to toxicants. In this series of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that DT <b>diaphorase</b> also increases its activity after exposure to oxidants following gradient ischemia in skin. Using dorsal rat flaps, oxidant stress was induced immediately or during a 7 -day period of preconditioning as a bipedicle flap before the distal attachment was divided. DT <b>diaphorase</b> activity ([Delta]Abs/min/ 100 g) or expression of message was measured during the period of preconditioning to determine the relationship between skin survival, enzyme activity, and expression of message. There was 4. 7 +/- 0. 8 cm of skin necrosis in the distal end of acute flaps while the preconditioned flaps had no skin necrosis after the distal attachment was divided. In the acute flaps, the DT <b>diaphorase</b> activity was equal throughout the flap for the first 6 hr. After 24 hr of ischemia, the DT <b>diaphorase</b> activity was significantly higher in the proximal end of the flap (1. 83 +/- 0. 21 [Delta]Abs/min/ 100 g) than that in the distal end (0. 005 +/- 0. 01 [Delta]Abs/min/ 100 g), which was significant (P P < 0. 05). Maximal enzyme induction of DT <b>diaphorase</b> activity occurred after 4 days of preconditioning and correlated with the maximal expression of mRNA. These studies provide the first evidence that DT <b>diaphorase</b> enzyme activity is inducible after oxidant stress. The data also suggests that DT activity remains elevated for at least 6 hr of ischemia and may be a potential source of anti-oxidant activity in ischemic skin...|$|E
