5|$|He was {{in great}} {{form for the}} Belgian spring classics, but a fall and {{material}} malfunction <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> playing {{a part in the}} final of both the E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem. Cancellara was one of the favourites to win the renewed Tour of Flanders but played no part in the final due to a crash in the feed zone. It was caused by a discarded water bottle. He suffered a four-part fracture of the right collarbone which ruined his spring campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Timberlake {{successfully}} {{applied for}} a commission in Colonel William Byrd's recently formed 2nd Virginia Regiment. Commissioned as an Ensign, Timberlake accompanied the regiment on its march to Fort Duquesne, but illness <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> proceeding. In 1759, he took part in several minor operations in the present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, mostly overseeing the construction of defensive works.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, the {{sectional}} {{differences that}} eventually {{culminated in the}} Civil War led to a convention {{to be held in}} Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of defining a common course of action for all Southern (slave-holding) states. Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention. Personal considerations <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> attending, but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, WKMS {{reported}} that Bevin had remained politically {{active in the}} aftermath of his defeat by McConnell, and an email to his followers calling on Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, to denounce new carbon regulations issued by the EPA fueled speculation that Bevin would seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2015. The station also cited an anonymous source that said Bevin would campaign for Rand Paul's Senate seat in 2016 if Paul's expected presidential bid <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> running for re-election. An August 2014 survey by Public Policy Polling showed that 25% of Republicans wanted Bevin to be the party's gubernatorial nominee, ahead of declared candidates James Comer (20%) and Hal Heiner (18%).|$|E
5|$|In Karhide, {{the king}} is {{reluctant}} to accept his diplomatic mission. In Orgoreyn, Ai is seemingly accepted more easily by the political leaders, yet Ai is arrested, stripped of his clothes, drugged, and sent to a work camp. Rescued by Estraven, the deposed Prime Minister of Karhide, Genly realizes that cultural differences—specifically shifgrethor, gender roles and Gethenian sexuality—had <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> understanding their relationship previously. During their 80-day journey across the frozen land to return to Karhide, Ai learns to understand and love Estraven.|$|E

5|$|Sanford's {{opponent}} in the 1992 election was Lauch Faircloth, a former Democrat turned Republican who had served as state Highway Commissioner in Sanford's gubernatorial administration. Enjoying substantial backing from Sanford's Senate colleague, Jesse Helms, Faircloth accused Sanford of being a tax-and-spend liberal bound to special interests. While initial polls showed that Sanford had a comfortable lead over his rival, he lost supporters after an operation for an infected heart valve <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> campaigning for much of October and raised doubts {{as to whether he}} was capable of serving another term. On November 3, 1992, Faircloth won the election by a 100,000-vote margin.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E
5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} second Olympics {{appearance}} at the 2006 Games in Turin. He recorded four points in six games before suffering a tournament-ending shoulder injury in a collision with teammate Ville Peltonen during a line change {{in front of the}} team bench. The injury <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> playing in the semifinal and gold medal game, where Finland won the silver medal in a 3–2 loss to Sweden. Despite missing two games, Salo ranked second among team defencemen, behind Kimmo Timonen, with a goal and four points in six games. Four years later, Salo competed once again for Finland at the 2010 Winter Olympics in his NHL hometown Vancouver. He recorded two points in six games, while leading all Finnish players in ice time. He scored his lone goal during the bronze medal game, opening the score against Slovakia in a 5–3 win.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson {{struggled}} in the 2011 playoffs, {{as he returned}} from a lower-body injury that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the six games {{near the end of}} the regular season. Recording three points over 11 games against the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was suspected he was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, he fell to the ice while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed to be helped off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his adductor tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. With Samuelsson out of the lineup, Vancouver advanced to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{letters from}} the precentor of Chichester Cathedral beg the bishop to come to Chichester over Easter to {{celebrate}} the Easter Mass {{and to deal with}} pressing issues in the diocese. Neville's duties as chancellor <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> attending to much of the business of his diocese, but he employed clerics to administer the ecclesiastical offices of his diocese and in general his relationship with his cathedral chapter appears to have been good. He employed a teacher of theology for his cathedral, and supported students at schools in Lincoln, Oxford, and Douai. He worked to protect the rights, lands, and privileges of his diocese and cathedral chapter from encroachment by others, both secular and clerical. On one occasion he threatened to excommunicate the Earl of Arundel or the earl's men for hunting on land the bishop considered to be his own.|$|E

5|$|The Grant administration, who {{recognized}} Morton {{as a powerful}} friend, offered him the position of Minister to Great Britain, replacing John Lothrop Motley, but Morton declined. Because the Indiana General Assembly was controlled by the Democrats, Morton feared a Democrat would be elected to his U.S. Senate seat. In 1874 similar concerns caused him to refuse invitations to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. (Later, Grant recalled that concerns over Morton's ill health alone had <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> proposing Morton for Chief Justice, but Grant may have mistaken. Well-advised sources at the time heard that the Senator from Indiana had been offered {{a place on the}} Supreme Court, unofficially, and Justice David Davis took the credit for convincing Grant that the rigor of the job would cause Morton a physical breakdown).|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} doping {{case from}} the 2007 Giro involved sprinter Alessandro Petacchi. Petacchi took five stage wins, but after the third of them, he tested non-negative for salbutamol, an asthma medication which Petacchi has a medical exemption to use. Petacchi was obligated as the stage winner to give a urine sample to the doping authorities, {{and it had a}} concentration of 1,352 nanograms per milliliter of salbutamol, above the 1,000 allowed by the medical exemption. Salbutamol has anabolic effects at high concentrations. Team Milram placed Petacchi on immediate provisional suspension following the Giro, which <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> participating in the Tour de France later that season as he had planned. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) asked the Italian Cycling Federation (FCI) for a one-year ban for Petacchi.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Edwards {{published}} a significant treatise entitled Bibliographic Catalogue of the Described Transformation of North American Lepidoptera.

Frustrated with the experience, Edwards sailed back to New York the next year {{with the intention of}} returning to acting, but poor health <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> full enjoyment of the limelight. In March, Edwards appeared as Holofernes in Love's Labour's Lost at Augustin Daly's Daly Theatre, but was often short of breath and unable {{to keep pace with the}} run—his part was given to a young Tyrone Power who also covered Edwards' old role of Sir Oliver Surface for Daly's road show of The School for Scandal.|$|E

5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot's health {{problems}} <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> military service. In 1939, he met actor Pierre Fresnay, {{who was already}} an established film star in France. Clouzot wrote the script for Fresnay's only directorial feature Le Duel, {{as well as two}} plays for him: On prend les mêmes, which was performed in December 1940, and Comédie en trois actes, which was performed in 1942. Despite writing scripts for films and plays, Clouzot was so poor that he resorted to trying to sell lyrics to French singer Édith Piaf, who declined to purchase them. After France was invaded by Germany and subsequently during the German occupation of France during World War II, the German-operated film production company Continental Films was established in France in October 1940. Alfred Grevin, the director of Continental, knew Clouzot from Berlin and offered him work to adapt stories of writer Stanislas-André Steeman. Clouzot felt uncomfortable working for the Germans, but was in desperate need of money and could not refuse Grevin's offer. Clouzot's first film for Continental was the adaptation of Steeman's mystery novel Six hommes mort (Six Dead Men). Clouzot retitled the film Le Dernier des six, having been influenced by actress Suzy Delair while writing the script, allowing her to choose the name of the character she would play.|$|E
5|$|In , {{which takes}} place after {{the events of the}} series, Naruto faces Toneri Otsutsuki; at the movie's climax, Naruto and Hinata enter a {{relationship}} that eventually leads to their marriage.

There is also a spin-off where Naruto and his allies go to defeat a new Akatsuki organization. A manga centered around Boruto, , has Naruto as a recurring character adapting the Boruto film though the series starts in a distant future where Naruto is said to be dead by an enemy of Boruto. An anime set before Boruto became a ninja has Naruto often making appearances with his new family.|$|E
