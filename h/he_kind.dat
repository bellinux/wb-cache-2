500|$|When {{writing the}} {{screenplay}} for The Curse of the Black Pearl, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio envisioned Captain Jack Sparrow as a supporting {{character in the}} vein of Bugs Bunny and Groucho Marx. The producers saw him as a young Burt Lancaster. Director Gore Verbinski admitted, [...] "The first film was a movie, and then Jack was put into it almost. He doesn't have the obligations of the plot in the same ways that the other characters have. He meanders his way through, and <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> of affects everybody else." [...] Sparrow represents an ethical pirate, with Captain Barbossa as his corrupt foil. His true motives usually remain masked, and whether he is honorable or evil depends on the audience's perspective. This acts as part of Will Turner's arc, in which Sparrow tells him a pirate {{can be a good}} man, like his father.|$|E

His father lived next door to a crack house and taught Fiasco to use guns to defend himself from drug dealers. Despite his unstable upbringing, Fiasco states that he was well-educated as a child, asserting that his parents exposed him to a diverse array of subjects and that reading was highly encouraged in his household. [...] As a teenager, Fiasco participated in Academic Decathlon competitions. [...] His mother described him by saying, [...] "He was a great spirited child. Smart, a bit complex; <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> of was a loner; he didn't hang with a lot of people...He always had the glasses.

[...] Fiasco initially disliked hip hop music for its use of vulgarity, and preferred to listen to jazz; he idolized clarinet player Benny Goodman. [...] His struggle to learn to play an instrument led him to create poetry instead, which led to his interest in the lyrical aspects of music.|$|E

In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot.

In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Goddard said that Cane working at Jabot Cosmetics is [...] "very enthusiastic and cautious about falling into a family business which is an Abbott company", and that he is [...] "very sensitive about that".

500|$|Mandi Bierly, also of Entertainment Weekly, also {{praised the}} premiere and drew {{particular}} attention to the scene with Sarah confronting Adam about stealing her idea. She said the scene shows the writers and actors [...] "are not people afraid of letting an awkward, tension-filled scene breathe", and that kind of realism illustrates the strength of the show's writing and acting. Camille Wright Felton of CNN said she loved the show, and particularly praised the subplot about Haddie learning to drive, as well as Adam's response when Haddie asked if whether {{he and his wife had}} an agreement to ignore each other's flaws: [...] "Yeah, it's called marriage." [...] However, Felton criticized Baldwin's character, which she described as a [...] "single-minded boss who apparently exists as an island and doesn't get that people have families and need to tend to family crises". HitFix television columnist Alan Sepinwall felt the first half of the episode was too uneven in its mix of comedy and drama, but that it was later redeemed mainly by the scenes featuring Max, who he said [...] "is the one character on the show who never feels inauthentic, and <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> of pulls everyone toward him". Sepinwall praised the performance of Max Burkholder as Max, but described William Baldwin's character as a [...] "caricatured playboy boss".|$|E
500|$|The {{atmosphere}} in the studio was described by contributor Evian Christ as [...] "very focused," [...] and West once again brought in several close collaborators. Producer Hudson Mohawke noted the inclusive [...] "group" [...] atmosphere of the sessions, in which multiple contributors would work on similar pieces, with different elements ultimately selected from each. All involved were given a song to work on and return {{the next day to}} sit and critique, a process Anthony Kilhoffer compared to an art class. Producer Arca described being initially asked to send West music, noting that [...] "I made sure to send maybe the strangest stuff I had, and it just so happened that Kanye was excited by that." [...] Describing West's collaborative style, Arca stated:It was a lot of coming up with design, like solving riddles. If the song called for something aggressive, it was up to three or four people to design what in their head was the best solution for that aggression in that moment. Everyone would approach it in completely different ways, and ultimately, it would all be edited by Kanye himself. In a weird way, <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> of produced it. Not only did he select it, but he stylized it. Determined to [...] "undermine the commercial," [...] several tracks were left off the finished product that were deemed too melodic or more in line with West's previous material. West set parameters regarding sound and style, insisting that there be no [...] "bass wobbles" [...] reminiscent of dubstep. The album's recording process was described as [...] "very raw" [...] by Thomas Bangalter of the French electronic duo Daft Punk, who produced four songs for the album, adding that West was [...] "rapping – kind of screaming primally, actually." [...] While previous albums, particularly Dark Fantasy, took considerable time in the studio, Yeezus was described by Kilhoffer as [...] "the fastest record we ever made." [...] In May 2013, Def Jam executives listened to the [...] "final product," [...] (only later to be changed) describing the album as [...] "dark." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E

One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when I realized that maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn't like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me.

2500|$|Warhol was gay.

Warhol's assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. It has also been contradicted by his lovers, including Warhol muse BillyBoy who has said they had sex to orgasm: [...] "When he wasn't being Andy Warhol and when you were just alone with him he was an incredibly generous and very kind person. What seduced me was the Andy Warhol who I saw alone. In fact when I was with him in public <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> of got on my nerves….I'd say: 'You're just obnoxious, I can't bear you." [...] Asked if Warhol was only a voyeur, Billy Name also denied it, saying: [...] "He was the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity….It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York." [...] "But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front." [...] Warhol's lovers included John Giorno, Billy Name, Charles Lisanby, and Jon Gould. His boyfriend of 12 years was Jed Johnson, whom he met in 1968, and who later achieved fame as an interior designer.|$|E

Bryant recalled: [...] "There was an interview that I heard Shaq do which <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> of threw down the challenge of me not being able to win without him. After I read that, I said, 'Aw, that's it.' Some comparison that he made with me and Penny Hardaway, and once I read that, I said, 'You know what? I can't finish my career with people saying that.

2500|$|The band entered Jackson Browne's private {{recording}} studio named Groovemasters in January 2006, after Panunzio had suggested {{it would be}} a suitable recording location. New Found Glory strove to achieve a [...] "clean kind of classic guitar sound" [...] when recording, using a Vox AC30 amp on almost the entire record. The amp, known for its [...] "jangly" [...] high-end sound, was used with several classic guitars in the studio including a Fender Tele, Les Paul, Gibson 335-S and a Rickenbacker. Gilbert enthused that, [...] "It sounds huge. When you put our old records on and our new record, there's actually less guitars on our new album, but it sounds bigger." [...] Jordan Pundik likewise accounted; [...] "he [...] brought this classic vibe to it, especially with the tones he got. We learned we don't have to double-up 15 Mesa cabinets and make it all distorted to make it sound big." [...] Pundik also spoke of the band's desire to challenge themselves musically; [...] "Usually with every record we think, 'We’ve got to put the fast punk song on it or people won't like it', but this wasn't anything like that." [...] He did admit that around thirty songs were written, including some fast-paced songs, but were excluded as, [...] "(they) didn't really fit." [...] Steve Klein, the band's principal lyricist and rhythm guitarist, also praised Panunzio for helping the band bring new elements to their sound. Describing the sessions as [...] "best recording experience ever", he added, [...] "It's this empty mansion where we were able to set up all our equipment, we just woke up and wrote songs. We were really relaxed and able to set our own pace. Everything about the record is way more classic rock sounding because Thom has done a bunch of classic rock records like Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen and Ozzy, and {{the list goes on and}} on. <b>He</b> <b>kind</b> of brought this different element to our band.

2500|$|The {{character}} was eventually {{to make his}} return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer Diederick Santer {{as part of a}} storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy.

For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy. Aaron Sidwell was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him. It was Sidwell's first television role, and he has described it as [...] "a bit daunting...but everyone was really welcoming...the first few directors I worked with were fantastic...After we did rehearsal, after we did a take, they'd always give me feedback...I needed it." [...] He added, [...] "I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive.

[...] Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said [...] " [...] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded...
