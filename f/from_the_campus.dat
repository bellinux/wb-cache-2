His device worked as designed, but only from a wooden ship; attempts to get it to work on a metal ship such as a destroyer failed.|$|E

5|$|Danville's {{trustees}} also {{voted to}} give free {{use of the}} courthouse in the square {{to a group of}} Freemasons in 1817. The trustees sold another portion of the square near Main Street for the construction of private residences in 1823, and the Freemasons purchased the courthouse and the land it occupied in 1828. A group of Methodists purchased the land from the Freemasons in 1834, and they subsequently sold it to a Reverend Adams the following year. Adams purchased two adjacent plots and founded an all-female academy which ultimately failed. In 1854, the Danville Theological Seminary moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>campus</b> of Centre College to Constitution Square, occupying many of the buildings there. The brick courthouse became the main building of the seminary, and during the Civil War, it was used as a hospital to treat wounded soldiers both Union and Confederate {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of Perryville. Danville Theological Seminary remained in operation until 1878. After its closure, the main building deteriorated and was eventually razed.|$|E
5|$|Western Middle School in Russiaville faced {{enormous}} pressure from many parents and faculty to deny White <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>campus</b> after his diagnosis became widely known.

The court, however, declined {{to hear the case}} until administrative appeals had been resolved.
