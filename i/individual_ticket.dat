5|$|While {{inflation}} has eroded away {{the achievements of}} most films from the 1960s and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises, James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners {{in an era of}} much higher <b>individual</b> <b>ticket</b> prices. When properly adjusted for inflation, however, on that comparative scale Gone with the Wind—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.|$|E

40|$|Like {{airlines}} and hotels, sports teams and entertainment venues {{can benefit from}} revenue man-agement efforts for their ticket sales. Teams and entertainment venues usually offer bundles of tickets early in their selling horizon and put single-event tickets on sale at a later date. All of these organizations must determine {{the best time to}} offer <b>individual</b> <b>tickets</b> because both types of ticket sales consume the same fixed inventory. We model the seller’s optimal a priori timing decision for switching product offerings from selling bundles to <b>individual</b> <b>tickets</b> in order to maximize revenue when bundle and single-ticket customers each arrive according to independent, non-homogeneous Markovian death processes with a linear death rate that can vary over time. We characterize the circumstances in which it is optimal for the seller to practice mixed bundling and when the seller should only sell bundles or <b>individual</b> <b>tickets.</b> We establish comparative statics for the optimal timing decision for the special case of constant customer arrival rates as model parameters such as bundle size, marginal revenues, and customer arrival rates vary. We extend our results to find the optimal time for offering products with different demand characteristics, and we apply the model to a data set obtained from the sports industry. ...|$|R
