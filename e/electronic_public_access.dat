CM/ECF is not used in state courts, but several states have moved toward implementation of comparable systems for at least some cases. [...] As of January 2012, there were [...] "some two hundred" [...] courts running CM/ECF. PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records), the Federal Judiciary's <b>electronic</b> <b>public</b> <b>access</b> system, still provides access to docket entries as it did before CM/ECF; however, CM/ECF allows for access to pleadings, motion papers, briefs, and other documents filed by the parties and attorneys in the case (with the exception of any documents permitted to be filed under seal or in camera). For most documents, an access charge of $0.10 per page is levied to defray the cost of maintaining the system. In compliance with the E-Government Act of 2002, written opinions that [...] "set forth a reasoned explanation for a court's decision" [...] are free of charge. To facilitate online access, courts implementing CM/ECF require attorneys to file copies of most litigation papers electronically, instead of or in addition to the traditional filing of paper copies.|$|E

This article analyzes trends and developments of new "digital places" that seek to integrate electronic and physical design. Drawing upon the construct of "recombinant design" the article reviews several case applications in North America. These developments include new public uses of traditional places of civic meaning (e. g. libraries); community services that transcend space (e. g. local schools); innovative uses of electronic/physical connections for cultural education (e. g. children's museums), and encouraging access through local centers (e. g. community technology centers).
