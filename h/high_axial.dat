Standing [...] <b>high,</b> <b>Axial</b> Seamount is the youngest volcano and current eruptive center of the Cobb–Eickelberg Seamount chain.

40|$|Abstract: A {{total of}} 10 {{high-strength}} concrete columns confined by high-strength complex stirrups were tested under cyclic lateral force and a <b>higher</b> constant <b>axial</b> loading. The {{results indicate that}} the hysteresis loop of this type of columns still shows plump spindle-shaped at <b>higher</b> <b>axial</b> compression ratio, with better ductility, energy dissipation capability and stronger anti-collapse ability; so setting closed high-strength stirrups is an effective measure to ensure the HSC columns good ductility and enhance its axial compression ratio limits. Additionally based on the experimental research and theoretical analysis, the limits of axial compression ratio of HSC columns at different levels of seismic are present in this paper...|$|R

30|$|The early {{results of}} both Li et al. (1988) and Low and Moehle (1987) {{evidence}} similar effects of axial load variations on uniaxial and biaxial flexure.

60|$|Not {{only the}} directions, {{but also the}} {{velocities}} of rotation seem thus explicable. It might naturally be supposed that the large planets would revolve on their axes more slowly than the small ones: our terrestrial experiences of big and little bodies incline us to expect this. It is a corollary from the Nebular Hypothesis, however, more especially when interpreted as above, that while large planets will rotate rapidly, small ones will rotate slowly; and we find that in fact they do so. Other things equal, a concentrating nebulous mass which is diffused through a wide space, and whose outer parts have, therefore, to travel from great distances to the common centre of gravity, will acquire a <b>high</b> <b>axial</b> velocity in course of its aggregation; and conversely with a small mass. Still more marked will be the difference where {{the form of the}} genetic ring conspires to increase the rate of rotation. Other things equal, a genetic ring which is broadest in the direction of its plane will produce a mass rotating faster than one which is broadest at right angles to its plane; and if the ring is absolutely as well as relatively broad, the rotation will be very rapid. These conditions were, as we saw, fulfilled in the case of Jupiter; and Jupiter turns round his axis in less than ten hours. Saturn, in whose case, as above explained, the conditions were less favourable to rapid rotation, takes nearly ten hours and a half. While Mars, Earth, Venus, and Mercury, whose rings must have been slender, take more than double that time: the smallest taking the longest.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the biomechanical advantages of medial support screws (MSSs) in the locking proximal humeral plate for treating proximal humerus fractures. Methods: Thirty synthetic left humeri were randomly divided into 3 subgroups to establish two-part surgical neck fracture models of proximal humerus. All fractures were fixed with a locking proximal humerus plate. Group A was fixed with medial cortical support and no MSSs; Group B was fixed with 3 MSSs but without medial cortical support; Group C was fixed with neither medial cortical support nor MSSs. Axial compression, torsional stiffness, shear stiffness, and failure tests were performed. Results: Constructs with medial support from cortical bone showed statistically <b>higher</b> <b>axial</b> and shear stiffness than other subgroups examined (P, 0. 0001). When the proximal humerus was not supported by medial cortical bone, locking plating with medial support screws exhibited <b>higher</b> <b>axial</b> and torsional stiffness than locking plating without medial support screws (P# 0. 0207). Specimens with medial cortical bone failed primarily by fracture of the humeral shaft or humeral head. Specimens without medial cortical bone support failed primarily by significant plate bending at the fracture site followed by humeral head collapse or humeral head fracture. Conclusions: Anatomic reduction with medial cortical support was the stiffest construct after a simulated two-part fracture...|$|R

This thread form also is easy to machine on a thread milling machine, unlike the difficult to machine square thread form. It can also compensate for nut wear using a split nut, much like the Acme thread form.|$|E
30|$|These results {{demonstrate}} that bolts achieve good stability {{at the half}} pin–Rancho cube interface by tolerating <b>higher</b> <b>axial</b> loads than grub screws before loosening. This is a result from the greater torque that can be produced using a spanner or wrench. Whilst the point profile of the grub screw secures a better hold of the half pin when the torque used is equal, the driver used to insert the grub screw is limited in delivery of a high maximum torque before breakage; {{this appears to be}} the limiting factor for the security of hold on the half pin by grub screws.|$|R

50|$|The {{platform}} is permanently moored {{by means of}} tethers or tendons grouped {{at each of the}} structure's corners. A group of tethers is called a tension leg. A feature of the design of the tethers is that they have relatively <b>high</b> <b>axial</b> stiffness (low elasticity), such that virtually all vertical motion of the {{platform is}} eliminated. This allows the platform to have the production wellheads on deck (connected directly to the subsea wells by rigid risers), instead of on the seafloor.

40|$|Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic {{encephalopathy}} is a {{major cause}} of brain damage in infants, and is associated with periventricular white matter injury and chronic neurological dysfunctions. However, the mechanisms of the chronic white matter injury and reorganization are still unclear. In this study, in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was employed to evaluate the late changes of white matter microstructural integrity in the rat brains at 10 weeks after severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic insults at postnatal day 7. In the fractional anisotropy directionality map, qualitative evaluation showed that a dorsoventrally oriented fiber bundle extended from the corpus callosum into the cyst in the anterior brain, whilst the posterior peri-infarct areas had similar fiber orientations as the contralateral internal capsule, optic tract and fimbria of hippocampus. Compared to the contralateral hemisphere, significantly <b>higher</b> fractional anisotropy, <b>axial</b> diffusivity and diffusion trace value were observed quantitatively in the distal end of the extended fiber bundle connecting the anterior and posterior white matters rostrocaudally. A significantly lower fractional anisotropy but <b>higher</b> <b>axial</b> and radial diffusivities and trace were also found in the ipsilateral corpus callosum, proximal external capsule and anterior commissure, while slightly lower fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity were noticed in the ipsilateral internal capsule and optic nerve. It was suggested that increased fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity and trace characterize white matter reorganization in chronic neonatal hypoxic-ischemic insults, whereas reduction in fractional anisotropy appears to characterize two types of white matter lesions, with significantly <b>higher</b> <b>axial</b> and radial diffusivities and trace being primary and slightly lower axial diffusivity being secondary. Combined with fractional anisotropy directionality map, in vivo DTI provides important indices to differentiate the chronic effects of severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury and recovery globally, quantitatively and non-invasively. © 2009 ISDN. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
