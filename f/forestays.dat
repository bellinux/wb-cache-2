A boat lay at the steps, and he and Carroll rowed the others off to the sloop. The moon was just rising from behind the black firs at the inner end of the inlet, and a little cold wind that blew down across them, faintly scented with resinous fragrance, stirred the water into tiny ripples that flashed into silvery radiance here and there. Lights gleamed on the <b>forestays</b> of vessels whose tall spars were etched in high, black tracery against the dusky blue of the sky, athwart which there streamed the long smoke trail of a steamer passing out through the Narrows.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not quite}} {{half an hour later}} when the Estremedura moved on again, and Macallister {{informed}} Austin that he could not allow two journals to become overheated in the same voyage. It would, he said, be too much of a coincidence, and some of his subordinates did know a little about machinery. They had accordingly some few minutes yet in hand when they swung round the high Isleta cinder heap into sight of Las Palmas. It gleamed above the surf fringe, a cluster of twinkling lights at the black hills' feet, and there were other lights, higher up, on ships' <b>forestays,</b> behind the dusky line of mole. In between, the long Atlantic heave flashed beneath the moon, and there was scarcely two miles of it left. Austin, standing forward with a pair of night-glasses, and Jacinta beside him, watched the lights close on one another dejectedly.|$|E

But Captain Ludlow, backed by the broadside of the Coquette and the cross-fire of his marines, is not Captain Ludlow alone, on a sea bluff, with a crutch no better than his own arm, and a stout heart. As the first, he is like a spar supported by backstays and <b>forestays,</b> braces and standing rigging; while, as the latter, he is the stick, which keeps its head aloft by the soundness and quality of its timber. You have the appearance of one who can go alone, even though it blew heavier than at present, if one may judge of the force of the breeze, by the manner it presses on the sails of yonder boat in the bay." ...|$|E
50|$|Often a sail is {{attached}} to the <b>forestay.</b> This sail may be a jib or a genoa.

6000|$|Shrouds {{and stays}} are the thick ropes {{that keep the}} masts firmly in position. They form {{part of what is}} termed the [...] "standing gear" [...] of a ship--in other words, the ropes that are fixtures--to {{distinguish}} them from the [...] "running gear"--those movable ropes, by means of which the sails, boats, flags, etcetera, are hoisted. Nearly all the ropes of a ship are named after the mast, or yard, or sail with which they are connected. Thus we have the main shrouds, the main-top-mast shrouds, and the main-topgallant shrouds; the main back-stay, the main-topgallant back-stay, and so on--those of the other masts being similarly named, {{with the exception of the}} first word, which, of course, indicates the particular mast referred to. The shrouds rise from the chains, which are a series of blocks called [...] "dead eyes," [...] fixed to the sides of the ship. To these the shrouds are fixed, and also to the masts near the tops; they serve the purpose of preventing the masts from falling sideways. Backstays prevent them from falling forward, and <b>forestays</b> prevent them from falling backward, or [...] "aft." [...] Besides this, shrouds have little cross ropes called ratlines attached to them, by means of which rope-ladders the sailors ascend and descend the rigging to furl, that is, tie up, or unfurl, that is, to untie or shake out, the sails.|$|E

5000|$|Running Backstays—These are {{supplemental}} temporary backstays (one on each side) that attach {{opposite of}} the <b>forestay.</b> They are very effective at generating <b>forestay</b> tension, but make the boat more difficult to tack because one running backstay needs to be released {{and the other one}} applied each time the boat tacks.|$|R
50|$|To a stay - Sails {{attached}} to stays, include jibs, which are {{attached to}} <b>forestays</b> and staysails, which are mounted on other stays (typically wire cable) that support other masts from the bow aft.|$|E
50|$|A headsail of a {{sailing vessel}} is any sail set {{forward of the}} {{foremost}} mast. The most common headsails are staysails, a term that includes jibs and the larger genoa. Other headsails are set independently of any <b>forestays,</b> such as the spinnaker.|$|E
50|$|The {{bowsprit}} on a tall ship may be {{of considerable}} length and carry several <b>forestays</b> supporting the foremast. Headsails are stowed by tying onto the bowsprit when not in use.

50|$|Schooners {{typically}} {{have up to}} three jibs. The foremost one sets on the topmast <b>forestay</b> and is generally called the jib topsail, a second on the main <b>forestay</b> is called the jib, and the innermost is called the staysail. Actually, all three sails are both jibs and staysails in the generic sense.|$|R

50|$|Stays are ropes, wires, or rods on sailing {{vessels that}} run fore-and-aft along the {{centerline}} from the masts to the hull, deck, bowsprit, or to other masts which serve {{to stabilize the}} masts. On a ship with a single mast, stays that run aft are called backstays and stays that run forward are called <b>forestays.</b> Along with shrouds, they form the primary stabilization for the standing rigging.|$|E
50|$|In square rigged ships the staysails {{can help}} in tacking, {{overcoming}} the lumbering square sails' tendency to prevent bearing up to windward, especially in light winds. Where a ship attempts to tack but fails and has to bear away again on the original tack, {{she is said to}} have missed her stays. In cutter rigged yachts the genoa will often need to be furled before changing tack due to the difficulty in passing the big sail between the two <b>forestays.</b> Here the staysail can help bring the bow through the wind more effectively.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results obtained from the application of different output-only modal identification techniques to ambient response data collected in two dynamic tests of a cable-stayed bridge and the subsequent finite element model correlation analysis. The first test, performed by using a traditional data acquisition system with servo-accelerometers, was aimed at investigating the vertical dynamic characteristics of the bridge. In the second test, an innovative radar vibrometer was used for non-contact measurement of deflection time series of the <b>forestays</b> and the identification of local natural frequencies of the stay cables. In the theoretical study, vibration modes were determined using a 3 D Finite Element model of the bridge and the information obtained from the field tests, combined with a classic system identification technique, provided a linear elastic model, accurately fitting the modal parameters of the bridge in its present condition...|$|E

5000|$|An {{inherent}} {{problem of}} a fractional rig is its inability to exert as much tension on the <b>forestay</b> as a similar masthead rig. The {{reason for this is}} because the attachment point of the <b>forestay</b> is not directly opposite to the backstay. Under certain conditions, the moment arm that results from these offset attachment points can be used to advantage, as this is an effective method of inducing bend in the mast, which in turn flattens the mainsail. If the distance between the attachment points is too great, a mast of average stiffness will be unable to apply optimum <b>forestay</b> tension, unless one of the following mast-stiffening design features is used: ...|$|R
5000|$|Swept back {{spreaders}}—Swept back spreaders (or rather their associated shrouds, which {{attach to}} the deck significantly aft of the mast) provide significant fore-and-aft support to the mast, and thereby increase tension in the <b>forestay.</b> The biggest disadvantage of this scheme {{is that it makes}} it difficult to deliberately slacken the <b>forestay</b> for the purpose of making the jib fuller in light winds.|$|R
5000|$|On a sailing vessel, a <b>forestay,</b> {{sometimes}} just called a stay, {{is a piece}} of standing rigging which keeps a mast from falling backwards. It is attached either {{at the very top of}} the mast, or in fractional rigs between about 1/8 and 1/4 from the top of the mast.

50|$|The {{performance}} of the sail is dependent on having a <b>forestay</b> which is taut. If the <b>forestay</b> is allowed to slack, the sail will lose its airfoil shape and not perform as well.
