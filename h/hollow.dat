5|$|The {{alignment}} of NY167 follows the Paine's <b>Hollow</b> Road, constructed between Little Falls and Paines <b>Hollow.</b> This new road would shorten {{time between the}} two communities through Herkimer County. The Paine's <b>Hollow</b> Road opened on October 4, 1921, opening a new road through the dairy country of the Mohawk Valley. The new road had branch alignments toward Oneonta, Cooperstown and Richfield Springs. At 1 p.m. (1800 UTC) that day, a convoy of vehicles drove the route south from Little Falls, with a band on a large truck and a coach with six horses. When the group reached Paines <b>Hollow,</b> a ceremony was held, led {{by the president of}} the Little Falls Chamber of Commerce and H.P. Snyder, the local legislator for Herkimer County. The new section between Paines <b>Hollow</b> and Jordanville cost $123,136.25 (1921 USD) and was designated as State Highway1363.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Hart Mountain is a basaltic fault block {{mountain}} in the semi-desert region of the northern Basin and Range province in south-central Oregon. Geomorphic processes associated with lingering snowpatches have formed nivation <b>hollows,</b> which are small scale depressions in the hillsides. The lingering snow in the <b>hollows</b> prohibits shrub growth. Bedrock scarps, present {{in some of the}} <b>hollows,</b> show indications of chemical alteration. Bills are present below most of the <b>hollows,</b> indicating that surface runoff from these sites occurs. Average hillslope, which controls the shear stress placed on soil particles, is statistically related to morphometric attributes defining the size and angles of the <b>hollows.</b> Simple linear regressions and the nonparametric Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (p-) and Theil's C test for the regression line slope suggest that average hillslope {{is directly related to the}} morphometric attributes of the <b>hollows.</b> Heat transfer controls the areal distribution and duration of snowpatcnes. A relative insolation factor and elevation are taken as surrogates for heat transfer. These surrogates are likewise correlated with the morphometric attributes of the <b>hollows.</b> Both the elevation and the relative insolation factor suggest an inverse relationship between heat transfer and the size of nivation <b>hollows.</b> The <b>hollows</b> on Hart Mountain appear to have been formed by accelerated nivation processes during the Pleistocene and are currently being modified by less intense nivation...|$|R
5|$|The {{piece of}} NY167 between Richfield Springs and Paines <b>Hollow,</b> a small hamlet {{southwest}} of Little Falls, was originally {{part of an}} unsigned legislative route in the early 20th century.

In 1924, the Richfield Springs–Paines <b>Hollow</b> route became part of NY28; however, that route was altered as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to follow a new alignment to the west. NY28's former routing between Richfield Springs and Paines <b>Hollow</b> became part of the new NY167, which continued north through Little Falls to Dolgeville as it does today.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{proposed}} a precise assembly method of a ring part with <b>hollowed</b> fingers. Ring's deformation in a radial direction {{is a problem in}} ring assembly. To solve the problem, the proposed method utilizes <b>hollowed</b> fingers. In the proposed method, a ring part caged in the space of <b>hollows</b> is assembled to a shaft part without deformation. In addition, the proposed method can achieve precise ring assembly without sensor feedback. We also discussed optimization of the shape of <b>hollows</b> in this paper. The shape of <b>hollows</b> is optimized by geometrical and mechanical conditions of ring assembly. We verified that the proposed method can realize precise ring assembly by assembly experiments.|$|R

50|$|Odd-clawed spiders are {{endemic to}} the Great Otway National Park of Victoria, Australia.
