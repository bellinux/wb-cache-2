5|$|An equestrian {{statue of}} the General was erected in Boulogne-sur-Mer; the statue was inaugurated on October 24, 1909, at a {{ceremony}} attended by several units from the Argentine military.

The statue is 10m high, on a 4m by 6m base; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> known to locals. Located on the beach, it was virtually untouched by the numerous bombings campaigns during both world wars.|$|E
5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> worth the trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by one of our best science journalists.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tourette's is unknown, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> {{established}} that both genetic {{and environmental factors}} are involved. Genetic epidemiology {{studies have shown that}} the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified. In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a phenomenon known as tourettism.|$|E
5|$|While A.bradleyi {{is easily}} outcompeted by other plants in more fertile habitats, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> {{adapted to the}} thin, acidic soil and harsh {{environment}} of its native cliffs, where it finds few competitors. Its isolated situation on these cliffs protects it from most threats, but quarrying and mining of the cliffs, rock climbing, and other activities that disturb the cliff ecosystem can destroy it.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is popular}} for {{recreational}} and competitive driving, to which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> suited in temperament. In 1997, {{the rules of}} driving events in France were modified {{to take into account}} the speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm temperament and willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, more than a third of the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events at the international level.|$|E
