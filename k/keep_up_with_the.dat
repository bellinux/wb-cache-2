5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses.

Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> company's stock price.
