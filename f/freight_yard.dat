5|$|Readville {{station is}} bounded by several {{railroad}} yards which were mostly {{built in the}} first half of the 20th century. East of the station on the Fairmount Line is the Readville Interim Repair Facility, an MBTA commuter rail maintenance facility and layover yard. Readville 1-Yard is an active CSX <b>freight</b> <b>yard</b> located south of the station, on tracks connecting the Fairmount Line to the Northeast Corridor. Additionally, there were formerly several yard tracks along the Northeast Corridor north of the station.|$|E
5|$|The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 {{legislation}} forced many {{utility companies}} in the United States to switch to low-sulfur coal. In response Harrisburg's already waning economy took a severe downturn. The <b>freight</b> <b>yard</b> closed in 1982, Sahara Coal company shut down operations in 1993, 865 jobs {{were lost in the}} county that year. This ended the reign of big coal in Harrisburg, {{a way of life for}} residents for over 100 years. The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad/Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway system tracks were taken up in the late 1980s and replaced by the Tunnel Hill State Trail in 1996.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 1890s, {{the station}} was {{frequently}} overcrowded and North Philadelphia and the northern suburbs grew in population. The completion of the Delair Bridge in 1896 allowed passengers to ride trains directly to the summer resorts of southern New Jersey (rather than taking a ferry to Camden) further increased traffic on the line. George B. Roberts, president of the railroad, used his social connections to hire Theophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr. to construct a new station. The new station was constructed on a former <b>freight</b> <b>yard</b> {{on the south side}} of the tracks (across from the previous station), where there was more space for the station. The site also provided better connections for passengers using newly electrified streetcars on Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street to reach the station.|$|E

5|$|In May 1922, John Hylan {{launched}} a new plan for the freight and passenger tunnel, and the Board of Estimate recommended that $4,080,000 be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority {{refused to accept the}} plan, as they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than the original plan. The original plan would have had the tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a <b>freight</b> <b>yard</b> to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a trunk line would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised plan would only cover the Narrows Tunnel, and a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard.|$|E
5|$|Storo {{is a mixed}} {{residential}} and commercial area. It has traditionally been easily accessible by car due to being located along Ring 3, a major highway. The shopping center Storo Storsenter is located just beside the station. Following {{the opening of the}} rapid transit station, a new housing complex was built {{on the west side of}} the station, on a former <b>freight</b> <b>yard</b> owned by the Norwegian State Railways. The first stage with 260 apartments was finished in 2006; when finished, it will feature 900 apartments. The area, named Stasjonsbyen ("the Station City") was developed by ROM Eiendom. Ridership at Storo increased from 2,060 per day to 3,630 per day from 2003 to 2007.|$|E
5|$|The North Shore {{branch of}} the SIRT began at Saint George Terminal, using the northernmost {{platform}} and tracks of the terminal. After running through the St. George <b>Freight</b> <b>Yard</b> (near the modern Ballpark Station), the line ran {{on the shore of}} the Kill Van Kull from New Brighton to West Brighton. The line ran on land between St. George and New Brighton, and on a ballast-filled wood trestle supported by a wood retaining wall through Livingston and West Brighton. Though the right-of-way is distinguishable, little evidence of this portion of the line exists today, except for abandoned tracks and supports, much of which has eroded into the kull.|$|E

5|$|The {{detonation}} {{was initially}} planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because {{of rain and}} lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation. A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45, and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison. By 05:30 the rain had gone. There were some communication problems. The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad <b>freight</b> <b>yard</b> in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
5|$|On October 21, 1957, {{four years}} after North Shore Branch {{passenger}} trains ended, the very last SIRT special—a train from Washington carrying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to the Staten Island Ferry from a state meeting in Washington, D.C. with President Eisenhower—crossed the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge. There was a royal train and a press train and they traveled over the Reading Railroad and the B to get to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. Since British royalty was being transported, the movement was done in secrecy with high security. The trains reached the Camp by traveling via the Port Reading Branch of the Reading Railroad. In order to travel to Staten Island, which required traveling over the Arthur Kill swing bridge, the two trains had to be reconfigured. Done at the Camp, the two diesel locomotives in the front were dropped from the two consists, allowing the trains to pass over the bridge, which had a limited load capacity. Awaiting {{the return of the}} equipment from Staten Island, the two diesel trains were sent to Cranford Junction. On the morning of October 21, the press train, consisting of 10 cars, left the Camp in New Jersey and traveled to the SIRT via the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The royal train, which was constructed by Pullman Standard, followed an hour later. These two trains terminated at the Stapleton <b>freight</b> <b>yard,</b> which was cleaned up for the occasion. Each of the trains were hauled back to Cranford Junction by a SIRT switcher after the Queen's motorcade left the yard. The trains, that afternoon, then went south to Baltimore.|$|E
