5|$|Soona {{gives the}} <b>digital</b> <b>cassette</b> to Mulder at a {{discreet}} {{meeting in a}} park. An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters, {{only to find that}} the cassette is encrypted. Scully believes the encryption is based on the Navajo language and takes the tape in order to investigate. When Skinner calls Mulder to his office to question him about the tape, Mulder physically attacks him. Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is questioned about Mulder's actions. Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI, and that she will suffer a similar punishment if she has lied to them.|$|E
5|$|The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a {{successful}} attempt {{by a friend}} of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system. The hacker, Kenneth Soona (Bernie Coulson), is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a <b>digital</b> <b>cassette.</b> However, Soona is later assassinated, and the downloaded files {{are found to be}} written in Navajo. Contacting Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman)—a Navajo man capable of translating the files—Mulder is shown a box-car full of what appear to be alien corpses. He is trapped in the box-car by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and left for dead after it is destroyed. He is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen. Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien-human hybrids. Her sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw), however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night.|$|E

The MC-4 had an optional <b>digital</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder called the Roland MTR-100.

50|$|The track listing for the {{cassette}} release {{can be found}} inside the tape's inlay. Unlike the CD release of Pocket Full of Kryptonite, {{the cassette}}s did not feature a track listing on the back cover—only the black & white photography (as seen on the vinyl and CD releases) is depicted. The <b>digital</b> <b>cassette</b> release of Pocket Full of Kryptonite, however, featured a black & white photograph of the band instead (sans the track listing).|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the tape}} device the read head signal is fed into an {{operational}} amplifier (1) whose output signal is DC-filtered. Op-amp (2) amplifies and feeds an RC-filter. Op-amp (3) amplifies the signal again {{followed by another}} DC-filter. Op-amp (4) amplifies the signal into clipping the sine formed signal. The positive and negative rails for all op-amps are wired to +5V DC and GND. The clipped signal therefore fits into the TTL electrical level window of the schmitt trigger step that in turn feeds the <b>digital</b> <b>cassette</b> port.|$|E

50|$|Registration of {{the head}} in its natural {{position}} while obtaining a cephalogram has the advantage that an extracranial line (the true vertical or a line perpendicular to that) {{can be used as}} a reference line for cephalometric analysis, thus bypassing the difficulties imposed by the biologic variation of intracranial reference lines. True vertical is an external reference line, commonly provided by the image of a free-hanging metal chain on the cephalostat registering on the film or <b>digital</b> <b>cassette</b> during exposure. The true vertical line offers the advantage of no variation (since it is generated by gravity) and is used with radiographs obtained in natural head position.|$|E
50|$|Several HP calculators {{were offered}} with HP-IL {{interface}}s. In the HP-75C/D {{it was built}} in, in others such as the HP-71 and HP-41, plug in interface modules were available (such as the HP82160A for the HP-41). Popular uses for the HP-IL on the calculators included printing (using the HP 82162A thermal printer) and cassette file storage (through the HP 82161A <b>digital</b> <b>cassette</b> drive). For ease of use, the calculators supported automatic I/O address assignment ("AUTOIO"), where printer or mass storage commands are directed to the first available device of the appropriate type. Where multiple devices per type were present, a manual ("MANIO") assignment mode could be used.|$|E

5000|$|... 7501 and 7502 were {{functionally}} {{the same}} and shared identical interfaces and system software. A 4 Kbyte Read-Only Memory (ROM) in the normal address space provided a system bootstrap capable of downloading the operating software over the normal synchronous communications line, loading or dumping from/to local floppy disc or providing a local engineer's console. For diagnostic purposes an Engineer's Test Unit could be installed between the CPU card and the backplane. This gave the engineer full capability of reading and writing registers or memory and single-stepping machine code or CPU microcode.
