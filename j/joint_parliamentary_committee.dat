5|$|Increasing {{costs and}} {{concerns}} over the ships' design led to the cancellation of the DDL project. The Department of Defence observed that the DDL's costs were escalating and it was unable to finalise the design. The Navy also reviewed the project {{and found that it}} was unduly expensive, and a <b>Joint</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>committee</b> concluded that a unique Australian design entailed significant technological risks. As a result, the Navy recommended to the Government that the DDL project be cancelled, and this took place in August 1973. The cost of the project to the Navy had been A$1.7 million, most of which was spent on design investigations and management consultancies. The opposition Liberal Party opposed the decision to cancel the DDL project.|$|E

Although the government rejected their demand, when the winter session of Parliament began on 9 November 2010 the opposition again pressed for a JPC; again, their demand was rejected. The demand for a JPC gained further momentum when the CAG report was tabled in Parliament on 16 November 2010. The opposition blocked the proceedings, again pressing for a JPC; the government again rejected their demand, creating an impasse. Speaker of the Lok Sabha Meira Kumar unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the impasse. The winter session of Parliament concluded on 13 December 2010. Although 22 new bills were planned to be introduced, 23 pending bills passed and three bills withdrawn, Parliament functioned for only nine hours. On 22 February 2011, after resisting opposition demands for over three months, the government announced that it would form a JPC. The JPC criticised the CBI for its leniency to the PM, the Attorney General, Dayanidhi Maran and Chidambaram and its reluctance to investigate their roles on 24 July 2012. After questioning former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi and the head of Maxis Communications, the CBI alleged that the Maran brothers accrued an illegal 5.50billion by the sale of Sun Direct TV shares at highly [...] "inflated prices".|$|E
