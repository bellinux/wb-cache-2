Unfortunately, in the initial observation of this study, pronunciation errors produced by preschool teachers were found. Such facts triggerred the writer to conduct a further study. Therefore, this study investigates: (1) types of English pronunciation errors the teachers produce, (2) sources of their errors, and (3) their efforts to overcome their errors. Employing a case study design, the participants involved were 50 preschool teachers from ten different branches under the same private Foundation in Surabaya, Sidoarjo and Malang, East Java, Indonesia. 40 individual words drawn from the syllabus were prepared. The {{teachers were asked to}} pronounce those prepared words and their voices were recorded. Contrastive analysis and phonological analysis were applied to analyze the data. To triangulate, this study provided a 29 -item questionnaire and an interview. This study also referred to two models of pronunciation namely Standard Southern British (SSB) and General American (GA) and both models employ the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabets</b> (IPA) for <b>phonetic</b> transcriptions. Finally, types of errors, causes of errors, teachers’ efforts revealed become the basis of suggestions made in this study.

The study will take into account the language of six games (three played by girls and three by boys in teenage years) for linguistic analysis in the study. The registers of the games include rhyme-scheme for the specific game, and the words associated with the games. The two genders quite vary in their languages of games. The study will find out the reflection of their sexes in the registers employed by them. This socio-linguistic analysis will analyze the field data by examining speech practices associated with gender, and studying self-disclosure, and politeness theory in these games. The data will be observed in Hindi language (one of the official languages of India spoken in Northern India) and transcribed in <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabets</b> along with liner translation in English.

Este trabajo es un estudio sobre el registro (una variedad de la lengua utilizada para un propósito particular en un contexto particular) utilizado en varios juegos jugados comúnmente por niños en la India. El estudio se analizará la lengua usada en seis juegos (tres jugados por niñas y tres por niños adolescentes). Los registros de los juegos incluyen el esquema rítmico para un juego específico y las palabras asociadas a los juegos. El género es una variable relevante en el estudio lingüístico de los juegos. Este estudio pretende describir cómo el género condiciona el registro utilizado en los juegos. Este análisis sociolingüístico analizará los datos obtenidos mediante el examen de muestras de habla asociadas con el género, y estudiará, en los juegos, los mecanismos de autorevelación personal y teoría de la cortesía que se usan. Los datos se han recogido en lengua hindi (una de las lenguas oficiales de la India hablada en el norte) y se transcribirán fonéticamente junto con la correspondiente traducción al inglés...|$|R

40|$|Speech {{recognition}} {{technology has}} made spoken interaction with machines feasible. However, no universal interface {{has yet been}} proposed for human to communicate effectively, efficiently and effortlessly with machines via speech. Since the existing speech interfaces are language specific and language dependent, it is proposed to standardize the interface to make it language independent and adaptive to local dialects. The two existing primary models of speech recognition (Sehultz and Waibel, 2001) the acoustic model (analyses the sound of voice and convert them to phonemes) and the language models (compares the combination of phonemes to the words in its digital dictionary) -are language and speaker dependent. The extension of these models, Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition, is proposed in this study. Monolingual recognizers for multiple languages are designed first and the entire collection of phoneme set is called as GlobalPhone database. Based on this global unit set, it is aimed to make the resulting multilingual acoustic model as language independent. The phonemes with common sound are refined from GlobalPhone database to form a set of <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabets</b> (IPA). From this, the phonemes can be derived for any target language. To make the interface adaptive to different dialects, phoneme models of arbitrary context width called polyphones from resulting target language are maintained. By evaluating the Polyphone Decision Tree Specification, which is context-relative of that target language, the recognizer {{can be adapted to}} all accents and dialects of that particular language...|$|R
5000|$|... "How now brown cow" [...] (...) is {{a phrase}} used in elocution {{teaching}} to demonstrate rounded vowel sounds. Each [...] "ow" [...] {{sound in the}} phrase represents the diphthong /aʊ/. Although orthographies {{for each of the}} four words in this utterance is represented by the English spelling [...] "ow", the articulation required to create this same diphthong represented by the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> Association's <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> as /aʊ/ is also represented by the spelling [...] "ou". Some examples of these homophonic /aʊ/'s are the English words [...] "house", [...] "blouse", [...] "noun", and [...] "cloud". The use of the phrase [...] "how now brown cow" [...] in teaching elocution can be dated back to at least 1926.Although not in use today, the phrase [...] "how now" [...] is a greeting, short for [...] "how say you now", and can be found in archaic literature, such as the plays of William Shakespeare.|$|R
40|$|Preschool {{teachers}} {{have a very}} significant role and great influence towards their students’ second language acquisition. They put the basic foundation of English and sounds are firstly introduced during the period. Due {{to the fact that}} the students are in their golden period, pronunciation accuracy must be emphasized. This ought to be the main concern for the teachers to prevent them from fossilization and errors which can hinder communication in the future. Therefore, being a good model of English pronunciation is the key. Unfortunately, facts on pronunciation errors produced by preschool teachers were found in the initial observation of this study. The errors eventually triggered the writer to seek much deeper information in regard with those preschool teachers’ pronunciation errors. This study aimed to investigate: (1) features of errors the teachers were prone to, (2) sources of errors, and (3) efforts the teachers did to overcome the errors. Employing a case study design, the participants involved were 50 preschool teachers from three different branches in Surabaya, Sidoarjo and Malang, East Java. They all work for the same foundation with different of working experience and native language. 40 individual words drawn from their syllabus were prepared. The teachers were asked to pronounce those prepared words and their voices were recorded. Contrastive analysis and phonological analysis were applied to analyze the data. To triangulate, this study provided a 29 -item questionnaire and an interview. This study also referred to two models of pronunciation namely Standard Southern British (SSB) and General American (GA) and both models employ the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Alphabets</b> (IPA) for <b>phonetic</b> transcriptions. Results of the study revealed that participants were prone to errors to six types of consonants, three long vowels, two diphthongs, and two types of word stress. Those errors were mainly caused by interlingual and intralingual transfers. Further, the study also revealed efforts the participants did to overcome pronunciation difficulties: consulting friends, looking up on printed dictionary, and checking from online dictionary on internet. Finally, on the basis of the findings, some suggestions were provided in this study. The suggestions consisted of building more awareness on their roles as pronunciation model for students, improving knowledge and skills on English pronunciation and options for teacher professional development...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the pronunciation problems faced by ESL learners and to investigate the effect of <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training on ESL learners’ pronunciation of English words. This study constitutes a pre-test, an intervention (<b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training), and a post-test. At the pre-test, the participants were given a test to diagnose their pronunciation problems. At the intervention, the participants who have never received any instruction on <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets</b> were given <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training for nine weeks which emphasized on the drilling of the production of vowel and consonant sounds. After nine weeks, the participants were given a post-test to identify the effectiveness of the <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training. This study discovered that ESL learners had problems pronouncing vowel sounds and the <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training did not wholly positively enhance ESL learners’ English pronunciation. This seems to confirm Lenneberg’s (1967) theory that the stage before puberty is more successful for language learning. This study should raise the awareness of the importance of equipping ESL learners with <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training at the young age. This is because ‘age’ influences the acquisition of a second language and will impede learners’ success of acquiring <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> knowledge when they learn it as adults. It is hoped that this study serves as a template for further research on <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training and persuade curriculum developers to include <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training in the school’s curriculum...|$|R
