40|$|Constipation is a {{prevalent}} {{condition that}} disproportionately affects women and older adults {{and leads to}} self-medication and/or medical consultation. It {{occurs as a result}} of functional idiopathic causes or secondarily {{as a result of a}} variety of factors including dietary and exercise patterns, adverse effects of medication and disease processes. Constipation is often perceived to be a benign, easily treated condition with short-term treatment being relatively straightforward; however, chronic constipation is associated with mild complications that, left untreated, can develop into more serious bowel complaints (<b>faecal</b> impaction, <b>incontinence</b> and bowel perforations) with further implications for healthcare costs and the patient's health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). This review summarises the evidence of the HR-QOL impact and economic burden of constipation on patients. Relatively few studies have systematically explored the HR-QOL and economic impact of constipation; however, the existing evidence suggests that HR-QOL is lower in patients with constipation than in non-constipated individuals, and treatments for constipation improve HR-QOL. Additionally, constipation represents an economic burden for the patient and healthcare provider.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{correlation}} between clinical symptoms and anatomical findings by conventional imaging is poor {{in patients with}} rectoceles. The aim of this prospective study was to assess and to correlate symptomatic changes after anterior levatorplasty with morphologic changes visualized by magnetic resonance defecography (MRD). METHOD: Fourteen women with a median age of 57 (range 37 - 83) accepted to participate. Seven of 14 had previous hysterectomy. Patients underwent MRD before surgery and again 6 months postsurgery. Pre- and postoperative symptoms {{and quality of life}} (QoL) (Eypasch) were assessed. <b>Faecal</b> and urinary <b>incontinence</b> were graded (Wexner- / Hanley-score). RESULTS: The median Eypasch-score improved from 90 (range 38 - 106) to 106 (range 29 - 133) after surgery (P = 0. 016). Similarly, the Wexner-score ameliorated from 8 (range 0 - 20) to 4. 5 (range 0 - 18; P = 0. 02). Seven patients described new dyspareunia postoperatively. The median follow up was 16. 5 months (range 9 - 45). The median rectocele size decreased from 37 mm (range 30 - 48) preoperatively to 12 mm (range 0 - 42) postoperatively (P = 0. 004). Furthermore, enteroceles were corrected and pelvic floor descent was significantly reduced after surgery. Only the clinical symptom of incomplete evacuation strongly correlated with the respective radiological finding of contrast dye trapping (Rho = 0. 822; P = 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Sacral nerve {{stimulation}} is the therapy {{of choice in}} patients with neurogenic <b>faecal</b> and urine <b>incontinence,</b> constipation and some pelvic pain syndromes. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the best insertion angles of the electrode under laparoscopic visualization of the sacral nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five fresh cadaver pelvises were dissected through an anterior approach of the presacral space, exposing the ventral sacral roots. Needles and electrodes were inserted into the S 3 foramen. Both right and left sides were used, with the traditional percutaneous procedure. The validation was done by a laparoscopic camera controlling the position of the needle and electrode on the nerve. The angles were assessed with a goniometer and were confirmed in two living patients. RESULTS: The mean angle of insertion in the sagittal plane was 62. 9 +/- 3 degrees (range, 59 - 70). In the axial plane, the mean angle for the left side was 91. 7 +/- 13. 5 degrees (range, 80 - 110) and 83. 2 +/- 7. 7 degrees for the right side (range, 75 - 95). These angles resulted in the optimal placement of the leads along the S 3 sacral root, in all these cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study allows direct visualization during the placement of the needle and electrode, thus permitting accurate calculations of the best angle of approach during the surgical procedure in sacral {{nerve stimulation}}. These objective findings attempt to standardize this technique, which is often performed with the aid of intra-operative fluoroscopy but still leaving a lot to chance. These insertion angles should help to find more consistent and reproducible results and thus improved outcome in patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{prevalence}} of incontinence in a South Australian representative population sample {{and compare the}} health-related quality-of-life impact of incontinence with other chronic conditions. METHOD: The 1998 South Australian Health Omnibus Survey interviewed 3, 010 male and female respondents aged 15 to 97 years (response rate 70. 2 %). This representative population survey included questions to determine the {{prevalence of}} urinary (stress and urge), and anal (<b>faecal</b> and flatus) <b>incontinence,</b> and other chronic conditions. Respondents also completed the MOS SF- 36 questionnaire. RESULTS: Self-reported prevalence {{of all types of}} incontinence was 26. 0 %. The prevalence of anal and urinary incontinence were 10. 5 % and 20. 3 % respectively, with 4. 8 % of respondents experiencing both. Univariate analysis found the prevalence of incontinence was statistically significantly higher among females, and those who were older, widowed, had no post-school education, and lower incomes. After adjusting for differences in age and sex, it was found that people with incontinence were significantly impaired across all dimensions of the SF- 36, scoring in the lowest 42 % of the population, compared with those people without incontinence. People with incontinence exhibited different SF- 36 profiles to those with other chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Incontinence is common in South Australia, affecting more than one-quarter of the population, particularly older women (56. 2 % for 60 years and over). The impact of incontinence on health-related quality of life is characteristically different to that demonstrated by other chronic conditions. IMPLICATIONS: In an ageing population, identification of the impact of incontinence is necessary to direct policy development and resource allocation to this area.

40|$|Background: Obstetric fistula classic {{symptoms}} of <b>faecal</b> and urinary <b>incontinence</b> cause women {{to live with}} social stigma, isolation, psychological trauma and lose their source of livelihoods. There is a paucity of studies on the health seeking behaviour trajectories of women with fistula illness although women live with the illness for decades before surgery. We set out to establish the complete picture of womenâ€™s health seeking behaviour using qualitative research. We sought to answer the question: what patterns of health seeking do women with obstetric fistula display {{in their quest for}} healing? Methods: We used grounded theory methodology to analyse data from narratives of women during inpatient stay after fistula surgery in 3 hospitals in Kenya. Emergent themes contributed to generation of substantive theory and a conceptual framework on the health seeking behaviour of fistula patients. Results: We recruited 121 participants aged 17 to 62 years whose treatment pathways are presented. Participants delayed health seeking, living with fistula illness after their first encounter with unresponsive hospitals. The health seeking trajectory is characterized by long episodes of staying home with illness for decades and consulting multiple actors. Staying with fistula illness entailed health seeking through seven key actions of staying home, trying home remedies, consulting with private health care providers, Non-Governmental organisations, prayer, traditional medicine and formal hospitals and clinics. Long treatment trajectories at hospital resulted from multiple hospital visits and surgeries. Seeking treatment at hospital is the most popular step for most women after recognizing fistula symptoms. Conclusions: We conclude that the formal health system is not responsive to womenâ€™s needs during fistula illness. Women suffer an illness with a chronic trajectory and seek alternative forms of care that are not ideally placed to treat fistula illness. The results suggest that a robust health system be provided with expertise and facilities to treat obstetric fistula to shorten womenâ€™s treatment pathways...|$|R

Another study showed that bismuth acted synergistically with various antibiotics to inhibit sulfate-reducing gut bacteria and sulfide production. Some authors proposed a theory that H2S was involved in the development of ulcerative colitis and that bismuth might be helpful in the management of this condition. However, bismuth administration in rats did not prevent them from developing ulcerative colitis despite reduced H2S production. Also, new evidence suggests that colonic H2S is largely present in bound forms, probably sulfides of iron and other metals. Rarely, serious bismuth toxicity may occur with higher doses.|$|E
40|$|<b>Faecal</b> {{urgency and}} <b>incontinence</b> with rectal {{hypersensitivity}} is a chronic, unexplained condition {{that is difficult}} to treat. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if there was an altered level of the voltage gated tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-s) sodium channel Na(v) 1. 7 in rectal sensory fibres, since this channel has been implicated in clinical nociceptive disorders. Full thickness rectal biopsies from patients with physiologically characterised rectal hypersensitivity (n= 7) were compared with control tissues (n= 10). Formalin fixed specimens were studied by immunohistochemistry using affinity purified antibodies to Na(v) 1. 7 and the pan-neuronal structural marker PGP 9. 5, and the immunoreactive nerve fibres quantified by computerised image analysis. In rectal hypersensitivity, Na(v) 1. 7 immunoreactive nerve fibres were significantly increased in mucosal (P= 0. 0004), sub-mucosal (P= 0. 019), and muscle layers (P= 0. 0076), while PGP 9. 5 immunoreactive nerve fibres were increased significantly only in the mucosa (P= 0. 04); ratios of Na(v) 1. 7 :PGP 9. 5 showed a significant increase in all layers, suggesting increased expression of Na(v) 1. 7, and nerve sprouting in the mucosa. The cause of this increase remains uncertain, but may be due to increase of nerve growth factor (NGF), which regulates the expression of both Na(v) 1. 7 and TRPV 1, which we have previously reported to be increased in this condition. In paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (familial rectal pain), where the gene that encodes Na(v) 1. 7 is mutated, Na(v) 1. 7 protein was undetectable in the rectum (n= 2), which suggests reduced Na(v) 1. 7 immunoreactivity or expression. Drugs that target Na(v) 1. 7 -expressing nerve terminals may be useful for treating rectal hypersensitivity, and combining these with TRPV 1 antagonists may enhance efficacy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Faecal</b> {{urgency and}} <b>incontinence</b> with rectal {{hypersensitivity}} is a distressing, unexplained disorder that is inadequately treated. We aimed {{to determine whether}} expression of the heat and capsaicin receptor vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV 1 or VR 1) was changed in rectal sensory fibres, and to correlate nerve fibre density with sensory abnormalities. METHODS: We compared full-thickness rectal biopsy samples from nine patients with physiologically characterised rectal hypersensitivity with tissue samples from 12 controls. Sensory thresholds to rectal balloon distension and heating the rectal mucosa were measured before biopsy. We assessed specimens with immunohistochemistry and image analysis using specific antibodies to TRPV 1; nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor tyrosine kinase A; glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF); neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P; the related vanilloid receptor-like protein (VRL) 2; glial markers S- 100 and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP); and the nerve structural marker peripherin. FINDINGS: In rectal hypersensitivity, nerve fibres immunoreactive to TRPV 1 were increased in muscle, submucosal, and mucosal layers: in the mucosal layer, the median% area positive was 0. 44 (range 0. 30 - 0. 59) in patients who were hypersensitive and 0. 11 (0. 00 - 0. 21) in controls (p= 0. 0005). The numbers of peripherin-positive fibres also increased in the mucosal layer (hypersensitive 3. 00 [1. 80 - 6. 50], controls 1. 20 [0. 39 - 2. 10]: (p= 0. 0002). The increase in TRVP 1 correlated significantly with the decrease in rectal heat (p= 0. 03) and the distension (p= 0. 02) sensory thresholds. The thresholds for heat and distension were also significantly correlated (p= 0. 0028). Expression of nerve fibres positive for GDNF (p= 0. 001) and tyrosine kinase A (p= 0. 002) was also increased, as were cell bodies of the submucosal ganglia immunoreactive to CGRP (p= 0. 0009). INTERPRETATION: Faecal urgency and rectal hypersensitivity could result from increased numbers of polymodal sensory nerve fibres expressing TRPV 1.

40|$|TITLE: Transanal {{minimally}} invasive surgery plus preoperative short-course radiotherapy versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision in T 2 N 0 M 0 rectal tumours treatment. BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most incident cancer worldwide and the first at Girona province. Radical resection for rectal cancer treatment, such as Total Mesorectal Excision (TME), is accompanied with high morbidity (permanent stomas, bleeding) and poor long term functional outcome (sexual dysfunction, <b>faecal</b> and urinal <b>incontinence),</b> as it involves the dissection of planes closely related to nervous structures in order to excise the mesorectum. The implementation of screening programs will probably show a shift towards more early staged cancers and TME {{could be seen as}} an overtreatment for this group of patients, despite its excellent oncological outcomes that had make TME the gold-standard for surgical treatment of late stage I cancers (T 2 N 0 M 0). Transanal Minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is a new approach for rectal tumours treatment, with excellent functional outcomes. As a local excision procedure itâ€™s much less invasive and aggressive than radical resections, but local recurrence rates are much higher than in TME, as it only removes the tumour confined to the rectal wall, while possible nodal metastases undetected by stage methods can remain within the mesorectum. Neoadjuvant treatments like short-course radiotherapy (SC-RT) combined with TAMIS can be a solution to properly treat these early-staged carcinomas. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess if TAMIS plus SC-RT is non-inferior to laparoscopic TME, regarding overall survival. Results over local recurrences, complication rate, cancer-specific survival, quality of life, sexual function and faecal continence will also be assessed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this multicentre trial, patients with clinical staged T 2 N 0 M 0 rectal cancer will be randomized between TAMIS plus neoadjuvant SC-RT and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision. A sample of 352 patients will enter into the study through a non-probabilistic consecutive recruitment.
