40|$|BACKGROUND: Vegetable pollen {{is a rare}} {{source of}} {{occupational}} allergens. Occupational allergy has only been described {{in the case of}} paprika pollen and tomato pollen. We describe a new source of occupational pollen allergy. AIM: To study the incidence and the impact of broccoli and cauliflower pollen allergy in employees involved in classical plant breeding. METHODS: Fifty-four employees of five companies working with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea botrytis) and broccoli (B. oleracea italica/cymosa) pollen were eligible for complete evaluation. Allergy to cauliflower and broccoli pollen was evaluated by questionnaire and determination of sensitization by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and skin-prick tests (SPT). SPT and RAST were performed with a panel of commercial and homemade extracts from cauliflower and broccoli pollen. RESULTS: Work-related symptoms such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma and urticaria caused by B. oleracea pollen were reported by 44 % of the participants (24 / 54), of whom all but one had positive SPT for cauliflower- and/or broccoli-pollen/flower extracts and 58 % (14 / 24) had positive RAST results. Symptoms had developed within the first 2 years in 33 % of the patients. Six patients had to stop or change work. CONCLUSIONS: Brassica oleracea pollen is a new source of occupational allergen with strong allergenic potential leading to symptoms in almost half of the <b>exposed</b> <b>employee...</b>|$|E

The objective {{was to determine the}} risk to workers of acquiring HIV infection as a result of exposure to HIV-infected blood and other body fluids. To be eligible, a worker must have sustained a documented parenteral, mucous membrane or skin contact exposure to blood or body fluids from an HIV-infected person.

40|$|Policymakers have {{questioned}} whether firms {{should be allowed}} to indemnify their employees for personal sanctions for corporate crimes. This article provides the first formal analysis of this form of indemnification. Targeting employees with unindemnifiable sanctions carries the social cost of <b>exposing</b> <b>employees</b> of law-abiding firms to the risk of mistaken government prosecution. Deterrence is typically achieved more efficiently by sanctioning the firm alone. We find the circumstances under which the government should additionally sanction employees to be quite limited and the circumstances under which the government should ban indemnification of these sanctions to be more limited still. One circumstance is when an unindemnifiable employee sanction provides prosecutors with leverage to adjust the employee's sanction in exchange for his cooperation against the firm.
