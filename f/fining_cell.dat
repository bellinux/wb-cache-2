For the strontium-modified alloy the ductility has a minimum at intermediate cell sizes, the fracture mode being transgranular for the larger cell sizes and intergranular for the <b>finer</b> <b>cell</b> sizes. For the unmodified alloy, the ductility also has a minimum at intermediate cell sizes and the fracture mode is, again, transgranular at large cell sizes and intergranular at <b>fine</b> <b>cell</b> sizes. The ductility of the large cell size unmodified materials is low, being dominated by the large elongated silicon particles.

40|$|Recently, a novel {{diffuse source}} (DS) {{upscaling}} method {{has been successfully}} applied for the upscaling of US tight gas reservoir model. However, this approach does not work {{very well in the}} conventional SPE 10 waterflood reservoir model. Therefore, in this work, the goal is to figure out why this approach does not work in another model and how to improve this DS upscaling algorithm. Detailed analysis shows that there are three issues that need to be resolved for a more robust algorithm. The first issue is about the specification of the diffuse source time that is needed to define the transient state diffuse source in the <b>fine</b> <b>cell.</b> In the previous work, the time selection rule is not clearly stated. Too small or too large time values can lead to an overestimated or underestimated upscaling result. In this study, I find that the diffuse source time can be correlated with the <b>fine</b> <b>cell</b> diffusive time of flight (DTOF). By means of a series of sensitivity test, I get the conclusion that we can use the pore volume weighted average of the DTOF square to determine the diffuse source time. The second issue is related to the calculation of the effective transmissibility. In the case of upscaling the homogenous model, the previous proposed effective transmissibility calculation method gives us a wrong result. In this study, by studying the internal pressure profile in the coarse cells, I propose to use the <b>fine</b> <b>cell</b> pressures immediately adjacent to the coarse cell interface to determine an effective face permeability and apply the effective permeability to the calculation of steady state transmissibility in the simulator. The effective transmissibility obtained from this method is correct when the model is homogenous. The third issue {{has to do with the}} no flow boundary condition used in the local upscaling. In upscaling, we often encounter such problem that the no flow boundary condition is a bad approximation and to improve the accuracy of the result, we need to consider the existence of boundary effect. In this study, I generalize the DS upscaling algorithm by adding a buffering region around the upscaling coarse cells to reduce the impact of unrealistic boundary condition on the inter-cell effective transmissibility calculation. The buffering region is determined according to the <b>fine</b> <b>cell</b> DTOF in the target coarse cells and by using the exponential function in the diffuse source term, I propose a cut-off criterion to exclude the cells that are not necessary for upscaling. Based on all the analysis above, I applied an improved upscaling algorithm for the upscaling of the SPE 10 model. It turns out that the simulation results from the new upscaled model have a good match with the fine scale results, which gives us the confidence on this improved algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Additively {{manufactured}} (AM) 316 L steel exhibits extraordinary {{high yield}} strength, and surprisingly good ductility despite {{the high level}} of porosity in the material. This detailed study sheds light on the origins of the observed high yield strength and good ductility. The extremely <b>fine</b> <b>cells</b> which are formed because of rapid cooling and dense dislocations are responsible for the macroscopically high yield strength of the AM 316 L (almost double of that seen in annealed 316 L steel). Most interestingly, twinning is dominant in deformed samples of the AM 316. It is believed that twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) behaviour to be responsible for the excellent ductility of the steel despite {{the high level of}} porosity. The dominant twinning activity is attributed to Nitrogen gas used in 3 D printing. Nitrogen can lower the stacking fault energy of the steel, leading to the disassociation of dislocations, promoting the deformation twinning. Twinning induces large plasticity during deformation that can compensate the negative effect of porosity in AM steel. However, twinning does not induce significant hardening because (1) the porosity causes a negative effect on hardening and (2) twinning spacing is still larger than extremely <b>fine</b> solidification <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports {{research}} {{work in the}} development of biodegradable foams in block forms based on wheat flour for cushion packaging application. A novel concept of Regular Packing and Stacking (RPS) was developed for production of macro-composites block foams that combines extrusion foaming of starch foams with selfadhesion aided by application of water to produce block foams with a network of reinforcing interfaces. The structure and material properties of the foams can be manipulated through control of foam cell structure and the interface network. Parameters controlling the evolution of cell structures including processing conditions and additives were systematically studied using a twin-screw extruder. Under constant screw speed and controlled feed rate, high barrel temperature profiles with appropriate water contents were found to result in <b>finer</b> <b>cell</b> structure foams. Short length reverse screw with tight pitch was found more effective to produce <b>fine</b> <b>cell</b> foams. Addition of 22 micron talc powder at 1 wt% was found effective as a nucleating agent. Addition of flax fibre resulted in <b>fine</b> <b>cell</b> and high strength foams. The key variables in design and operation of a RPS machine were investigated. A pultrusion technique has been employed to reform the extruded foam strands to modify their shape and density and facilitate self-adhesion. Uniform wetting was achieved by using water absorbent fabrics to apply water in a controlled manner. Foam strands were then bonded to form macro-composite block foams. A RPS demonstration machine was successfully developed. The key factors affecting the macro structure and performances of the RPS block foams were investigated in great detail. Extruded foam strands were anisotropic and this feature was utilised in the design of RPS block foams to manipulate their properties in different strands' orientations. Thicker interfaces formed a network within the RPS block foams, which was found to make a significant contribution to the strengthening of the RPS foams (by a factor of 3). High humidity conditioning of the RPS foams was found an efficient way to control density and refine cell structure of the foams which could increase foam density by a factor of 3. 5 and compressive strength by a factor of 10. This work has made significant contributions {{to the development of a}} novel technology for processing of block foams based on starch foam and understanding of extrusion foaming process, structure and properties of the starch materials. The research results paved the way for the industrial development of biodegradable block foams for cushion packaging application, which are based on renewable resources and are bio-compostable and thus facilitate reduction of landfill at the end of their intended service life.

However, it is well-known that whole core transport with MOC is both computational expensive and requires significant storage. On the other hand, discrete ordinates (SN) methods have been successfully applied to large systems, as has been demonstrated by the computer code Attila.
