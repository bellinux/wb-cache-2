500|$|On August 4, Yankovic began {{recording}} parodies {{starting with}} [...] "Living With a Hernia". The song, a spoof of [...] "Living in America" [...] by James Brown—which {{was also the}} theme to the 1985 film [...] Rocky IV—is about hernias. When {{it came time to}} pick a song to parody as the lead single for Polka Party! Scotti Brothers Records [...] "had some very strong ideas" [...] and wished to have Yankovic parody a musician who was signed on the same label. After [...] "Living in America" [...] became a hit, the record label insisted that Yankovic parody the song, to which Yankovic obliged. In order to accurately write the song, Yankovic researched the various types of hernias. Yankovic noted that [...] "it was a real thrill to do James Brown. I'm a total non-dancer, never went to any dances in high school, but if I analytically dissect a dance routine <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> it out." [...] A choreographer named Chester Whitmore was hired to accurately create the dance scenes featured in the video, which was shot on the concert set actually used in the movie Rocky IV. The second parody recorded was [...] "Addicted to Spuds", a pastiche of [...] "Addicted to Love" [...] by Robert Palmer, about a man's obsession for potatoes and potato-based dishes. A music video for the song was never made to the song because there was a strict budget for videos for the album, and Yankovic felt that the video would be one big joke and not really worth its own video. A parody of Palmer's video, however, was later inserted into Al's [...] "UHF" [...] video.|$|E
2500|$|In Tyler’s works, the {{characters}} are the driving forces behind the stories and {{the starting point for}} her writing: [...] “I do make a point of writing down every imaginable facet of my characters before I begin a book, trying to get to know them so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out how they’ll react in any situation…..My reason for writing now is to live lives other than my own, and I do that by burrowing deeper and deeper….till I reach the center of those lives.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Let Me Be the One" [...] was remixed in 1991, with an {{extended}} beginning, end, {{and a different}} piano line. This remix can only {{be found on the}} From the Top box set. It starts with Richard counting off, and Richard's piano line is different from the original mix. The fadeout is also removed. The reason Karen stopped singing suddenly in this version is because she forgets the words, which is why she says something about [...] "where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out where the melody is, I'll sing it"...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make no <b>figure</b> {{at such a}} supper," [...] said Redclyffe. [...] "But I admire your inexhaustibleness {{in being}} ready for midnight {{refreshment}} after such a feast." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} my advertisement, a {{motionless}} young man one morning stood upon my office threshold, the door being open, for it was summer. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see that <b>figure</b> now--pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot do that, signor," [...] Giuseppi said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{make out}} <b>figures.</b> That is {{necessary}} to us, as how else could we keep time with our customers? We can read the sundials, as everyone else can; but as to reading and writing, that is not for poor lads like us." ...|$|R
2500|$|Patriots {{head coach}} Raymond Berry then {{replaced}} Eason with Steve Grogan, {{who had spent}} the previous week hoping {{he would have the}} opportunity to step onto the NFL's biggest stage. [...] "I probably won't get a chance", he had told reporters {{a few days before the}} game. [...] "I just hope <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out some way to get on the field. I could come in on the punt-block team and stand behind the line and wave my arms, or something." [...] But on his first drive, Grogan could only lead them to the 37-yard line, and they decided to punt rather than risk a 55-yard field goal attempt. The Bears then marched 72 yards in 11 plays, moving the ball inside the Patriots' 10-yard line. New England kept them out of the end zone, but Butler kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half to give Chicago a 23–3 halftime lead.|$|E
2500|$|Dad {{then joined}} {{the team and}} played {{right up until the}} out-break of war in the autumn of 1939. During the war, he was a {{merchant}} seaman and suffered from post-traumatic stress that required hospitalisation. He was withdrawn from active service and played in the Empire Eleven, playing cricket to boost the nation's morale. According to the press cuttings that I am currently looking at, he was the Captain of the Empire XI in 1941 and C.B. Clarke, the West Indies Test bowler was also in the team, along with H.P. Crabtree and F. Appleyard, formerly of Herts County Cricket Club. [...] The photographs are a real snapshot of time. I shall endeavour to upload some photographs and press cuttings if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out how to do so. My father's archive of photographs from the 1940s is uplifting and insightful, telling the story of a bygone era when the primary motivation of public sporting events was to feed the spirit and the soul, irrespective of financial reward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Guess <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> {{them out}} pretty well," [...] Mr. Coulson remarked with a smile. [...] "We've got an evening press {{of our own}} in New York." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it {{that you}} want me to do?" [...] she said, jumping up from her seat. [...] "Set me a task, and if I don't go mad over it, I'll get through it. There are the account books. Give them to me. I don't suppose <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see the <b>figures,</b> but I'll try to see them." ...|$|R
60|$|Now my {{original}} business--that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and drawer-up of recondite documents of all sorts--was considerably increased by receiving the master's office. There was now great work for scriveners. Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I must have additional help. In {{answer to my}} advertisement, a motionless young man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being open, for it was summer. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see that <b>figure</b> now--pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby.|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, when I {{endeavor}} to conceive {{an end to}} extension, the two ideas refuse to come together. When I attempt to form a conception of the last point of space, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> not help <b>figuring</b> to myself a vast space beyond that last point. The combination is, under the conditions of our experience, unimaginable. This double meaning of inconceivable {{it is very important}} to bear in mind, for the argument from inconceivableness almost always turns on the alternate substitution of each of those meanings for the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did. So far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure,</b> it's a {{mine that}} will make its living, and nothing worth while more. 'Bout two or three cents on the dollar." ...|$|E
60|$|ANNA--Because it's {{the best}} way out <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure,</b> Mat. [Her voice catching.] I been {{thinking}} it over and thinking it over day and night all week. Don't think it ain't hard on me, too, Mat.|$|E
6000|$|Simpson, the {{proprietor}} of the hotel, jocosely remarked: [...] "Well, Hans, as near as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> it out, to-morrow is to be your busy day, but you'd better lay low to-night. The Kitsongs'll get ye, if ye don't watch out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sprung from}} Walter the Stewart, so much I know; my lands lie Carrick-wards,' said Sir James lightly, 'but I {{have been a}} {{prisoner}} so long, that the pedigree of my house was never taught me, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make no <b>figure</b> in describing my own descent.' And as though {{to put an end}} to the inquiry, he walked to the window, where Malcolm so soon as they had begun to talk of the misrule of Scotland, had ensconced himself in the window-seat with his new book, making the most of the failing light, and asked him whether the Monk of Iona equalled his expectations.|$|R
60|$|I vaguely {{remember}} some of {{the details}} of that gathering--dimly <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see a hundred people--no, perhaps fifty--shadowy figures sitting at tables feeding, ghosts now to me, and nameless forever more. I don't know who they were, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> very distinctly see, seated at the grand table and facing the rest of us, Mr. Emerson, supernaturally grave, unsmiling; Mr. Whittier, grave, lovely, his beautiful spirit shining out of his face; Mr. Longfellow, with his silken white hair and his benignant face; Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, flashing smiles and affection and all good-fellowship everywhere like a rose-diamond whose facets are being turned toward the light first one way and then another--a charming man, and always fascinating, whether he was talking or whether he was sitting still (what he would call still, but what would be more or lees motion to other people). <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see those <b>figures</b> with entire distinctness across this abyss of time.|$|R
5000|$|After the disbandment of LCD Soundsystem (between 2011 and 2015), James Murphy pursued other artistic {{projects}} including remixing, directing, developing his own espresso, producing, {{and putting}} out footage and audio from LCD Soundsystem’s final show. Murphy {{has stated that}} dissolving LCD Soundsystem {{has made it possible}} for him to experiment with other projects. [...] "So projects become possible, which is incredible. I get to do all this crazy shit - and if I ever wanted to be in a band again, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> probably <b>figure</b> that out." [...] He has also stated how much time the creation of an album takes and that time can be spent doing other activities. [...] "I wouldn’t have a record coming out in April if I had done all projects. It’s impossible. And if I had a record coming out in April, I would have been fucking invisible for two years.” Though Murphy has illustrated a great freedom with his spare time after the band he also “misses it a lot times”.|$|R
6000|$|... "Looking for the stake," [...] said Saunders with {{a rather}} grim chuckle. [...] "They mean {{to put the}} work through before they come round to call on us. As far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure,</b> there can't be more than four of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Graham nodded. [...] "He can't help it. It {{was born}} in him. You and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> and plan, but Courthorne is different--the right thing comes to him. I knew the first night I saw him, you had got the man you wanted at Silverdale." ...|$|E
6000|$|As he {{was leaving}} the club Babbitt heard Chum Frink protesting to Gunch, [...] "--don't know what's got into him. Last Sunday Doc Drew preached a corking sermon about decency in {{business}} and Babbitt kicked about that, too. Near 's <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out--" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{was always}} {{interested}} in the question: How could this possibly happen? How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> understand this? And this experience of the holocaust was joined with my experience in the totalitarian regime. This brought up very similar questions in my soul-search and world investigation: how could this happen? How could people do things like this? So I {{had to find out}} what morality is all about, {{what is the nature of}} good and evil, what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do about crime, what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> out about the sources of morality and evil? That was the first inquiry. The other inquiry was a social question: what kind of world can produce this? What kind of world allows such things to happen? What is modernity all about? Can we expect redemption? ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} asked the {{question}} you now address me with, and as duly [...] answered it, I can't remember how many times: there is no sort of [...] objection to one more assurance, or rather confession, on my part, [...] that I did in my hasty youth presume to use the great and [...] venerated personality of WORDSWORTH {{as a sort of}} painter's model; [...] one from which this or the other particular feature may be selected [...] and turned to account: had I intended more, above all, such a [...] boldness as portraying the entire man, I should not have talked [...] about [...] "handfuls of silver and bits of ribbon". These never [...] influenced the change of politics in the great poet; whose [...] defection, nevertheless, accompanied as it was by a regular face [...] about of his special party, was to my juvenile apprehension, and [...] even mature consideration, an event to deplore. But just as in the [...] tapestry on my wall <b>I</b> <b>can</b> recognise <b>figures</b> which have struck out [...] a fancy, on occasion, that though truly enough thus derived, yet [...] would be preposterous as a copy, so, though I dare not deny the [...] original of my little poem, I altogether refuse to have it [...] considered as the [...] "very effigies" [...] of such a moral and intellectual [...] superiority.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{it might}} be {{possible}} for me to make that part of it plain in my mind," [...] Hiram said thoughtfully. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out all else; but why it should be his purpose to keep us here any length of time, instead of delivering us up at once, is more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> come at. Certain it is he's playing a game, and it remains for us to learn what it may be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Morton. I'm not {{so young}} in years even if I am young {{west of the}} Pecos. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> ahead. It stands to reason, no matter how damn strong these rustlers are, how hidden their work, however {{involved}} with supposedly honest men--they can't last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll stop loading that ballast," [...] he said. [...] "I'm fixed this time. I guess Merril has the ship. Carpenters to come {{on board}} to-morrow, {{and as far as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure,</b> eight hundred dollars won't see them clear. Besides that, it's a sure thing we'll lose the coast mill contract." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{to thank}} you, gentlemen, and I'll swear you in," [...] he said. [...] "From what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure,</b> it must be Ned Johnston's gang, and they're about the hardest of the crowd. I haven't much fault to find with Mr. Leland's {{programme}} except on a point or two." ...|$|E
5000|$|The SIAA was {{the oldest}} of these, founded {{in the winter of}} 1894 by Vanderbilt {{chemistry}} professor William Lofland Dudley. The SIAA was often seen as large enough to represent the South at large; and with officials and coaches and so forth of potential selectors restricted to viewing conference play, an All-SIAA team was sometimes equivalent to the All-Southern team; apparently with increasing frequency since 1902. For example, the 1905 composite selection from the Atlanta Journal reads [...] "It must be taken into consideration, however, that each gridiron Sir Oracle was requested by the Journal to confine his selections to members of clubs composing the S. I. A. A. This organization really represents the greater south, as its scope is wider and more general. V. P. <b>I.</b> <b>can</b> scarcely be <b>figured</b> in the calculation as that institution hasn't played any of the S. I. A. A. representatives." [...] South Atlantic writers of course were not fond of this, and would sometimes critique the latest All-Southern selection with titles such as [...] "Virginia and Carolina no longer in the South." ...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} component of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for teaching geometry is its capacity to transform a figure into as many different figures as possible, yet all of which respect the same underlying logical specification. Given a logical specification for a <b>figure,</b> (<b>i)</b> a <b>figure</b> <b>can</b> be constructed automatically from the objects and properties in the spepification; and (ii) once constructed, one <b>can</b> transform a <b>figure</b> through displacement of any of its objects and still obtain a figure that respects the specification. For a student user, this feature provides an invaluable tool for graphical exploration and discovery of properties induced by the logical specification. Our problem domain is automatic construction of figures; and we address this issue in restricted cases using Constraint Logic Programming We present solutions to cases in which <b>figures</b> <b>can</b> be constructed automatically and {{in which there is}} also a natural notion of completeness for our system. For this automatic figure construction system, we describe an implementation, written in Prolog III, which makes use of both constraints and coroutines provided in the language. Results of experimentation are also included, as well as ways in which the system can be extended to handle non restricted cases. ...|$|R
60|$|Two years ago, {{walking with}} my {{children}} in some pleasant fields, near to Berne in Switzerland, I strayed from them into a little wood; and, {{coming out of it}} presently, told them how the story had been revealed to me somehow, which for three-and-twenty months the reader has been pleased to follow. As I write the last line with a rather sad heart, Pendennis and Laura, and Ethel and Clive, fade away into Fable-land. I hardly know whether they are not true: whether they do not live near us somewhere. They were alive, and I heard their voices, but five minutes since was touched by their grief. And have we parted with them here on a sudden, and {{without so much as a}} shake of the hand? Is yonder line (----) which I drew with my own pen, a barrier between me and Hades as it were, across which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see those <b>figures</b> retreating and only dimly glimmering? Before taking leave of Mr. Arthur Pendennis, might he not have told us whether Miss Ethel married anybody finally? It was provoking that he should retire to the shades without answering that sentimental question.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{a man of}} {{that kind}} ever came to be Laura Waynefleet's father is more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out!" [...] he said.

6000|$|... "I've seen {{a better}} fire, boys, but I've camped with {{none at all}} on as cold a night," [...] he said.

6000|$|... "We {{have got}} {{four of them}} {{and most of the}} horses, but, so far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure,</b> two or three must have got away," [...] he said.

60|$|He {{became part}} of that ghostly Boston of my first visit, which would {{sometimes}} return and possess again the city I came to know so familiarly in later years, and to be so passionately interested in. Some color of my prime impressions has tinged the fictitious experiences of people in my books, but I find very little of it in my memory. This is like a web of frayed old lace, which I have to take carefully into my hold for fear of its fragility, and make out as best <b>I</b> <b>can</b> the <b>figure</b> once so distinct in it. There are the narrow streets, stretching saltworks to the docks, which I haunted for their quaintness, and there is Faunal Hall, which I cared to see so much more because Wendell Phillips had spoken in it than because Otis and Adams had. There is the old Colonial House, {{and there is the}} State House, which I dare say I explored, with the Common sloping before it. There is Beacon Street, with the Hancock House where it is incredibly no more, and there are the beginnings of Commonwealth Avenue, and the other streets of the Back Bay, laid out with their basements left hollowed in the made land, which the gravel trains were yet making out of the westward hills. There is the Public Garden, newly planned and planted, but without the massive bridge destined to make so ungratefully little of the lake that occasioned it. But it is all very vague, and I could easily believe now that it was some one else who saw it then in my place.|$|R
60|$|He {{managed a}} whole year upon the proceeds, and kept a cheerful spirit till the last soldo was spent, inventing one thing after another, and giving much {{time and money to}} a new {{principle}} of steam propulsion, which, as applied without steam to a small boat on the canal before his door, failed to work, though it had no logical excuse for its delinquency. He tried to get other pupils, but he got none, and he began to dream of going to America. He pinned his faith in all sorts of magnificent possibilities to the names of Franklin, Fulton, and Morse; he was so ignorant of our politics and geography as to suppose us at war with the South American Spaniards, but he knew that English was the language of the North, and he applied himself to the study of it. Heaven only knows what kind of inventor's Utopia, our poor, patent- ridden country appeared to him in these dreams of his, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> but dimly <b>figure</b> it to myself. But he might very naturally desire to come to a land where the spirit of invention is recognized and fostered, and where he could hope to find that comfort of incentive and companionship which our artists find in Italy.|$|R
50|$|A. Yes. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{confirm the}} <b>figures.</b> This {{happened}} {{during the summer of}} 1994. The 5th Corps of the BH army in the Bihać pocket was headed by General Atif Dudaković and it launched an attack especially in the area of Velika Kladuša, and it expelled up to 40.000 Muslims who were faithful to Fikret Abdić. These 40.000 Muslims were expelled towards the Krajina area, and they were taken in two camps which I personally visited together with people, officials from the UNHCR. Bertrand Dupasquier was a responsible official at the time. These 40.000 people were taken in the Batnoga and Turan camps where they were taken care of with a lot of humanity by the local population in Krajina. The local population fed them but also looked after them medically speaking; if they were wounded, if they were sick, if they were women about to deliver, they were taken care of. So all these Muslims were gathered in Batnoga and Turan and they were taken care of in the Glina Hospital with total dedication. They were given blood supplies. They were helped without any kind of discrimination. And very often the few medicines, the few supplies that there were in the Glina Hospital were given to the Muslim population.|$|R
