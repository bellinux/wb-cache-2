5|$|James Richard Ellis {{has argued}} that the incest taboo <b>is</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>to</b> a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's {{theories}} and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid's version of the myth of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for if she and her father were animals, there would be no bar to their union.|$|E
5|$|The acetyl group, {{formally}} {{derived from}} acetic acid, <b>is</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>to</b> {{all forms of}} life. When bound to coenzyme A, it {{is central to the}} metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the fatty acids), acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides. However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|E

This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for unicellular organisms such as bacteria, {{as well as the}} specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells <b>is</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>to</b> all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} <b>is</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>to</b> {{our understanding of the}} Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems {{largely from the}} habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change <b>is</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>to</b> {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E

5|$|The polyatomic {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished from}} the diatomic nonmetals by virtue of having higher coordination numbers, higher melting points (in their thermodynamically most stable forms), and higher boiling points; and having wider liquid ranges and lower room temperature volatility. More generally they show a marked tendency to exist in allotropic forms, and a stronger inclination to catenate; and have a weaker ability to form hydrogen bonds. The ability of carbon to catenate, in particular, <b>is</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>to</b> the field of organic chemistry and life on Earth. All of the polyatomic nonmetals are solids, and all are known in either malleable, pliable or ductile forms; most also have lower ionisation energies and electronegativities {{than those of the}} diatomic nonmetals.|$|E
