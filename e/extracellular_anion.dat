40|$|The cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel pore is blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by {{a broad range}} of anionic substances added to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here we investigate the origin of the voltage dependence of block by intracellular Au(CN) 2 −, a highly permeant lyotropic anion which also acts as a high-affinity blocker of Cl− permeation. Not only the affinity, but also the voltage dependence of block by intracellular Au(CN) 2 − ions is strongly dependent on extracellular Cl− concentration; following replacement of most extracellular Cl− by glucose or by impermeant anions, block by Au(CN) 2 − shows greatly weakened voltage dependence. This suggests that coupled movement of Au(CN) 2 − and Cl− ions within the pore contributes to the voltage dependence of block. This explanation requires that interactions between different anions take place within the pore, implying simultaneous binding of multiple anions to intrapore sites. Other anions are able to substitute for extracellular Cl− and interact with intracellular Au(CN) 2 − ions. Analysis of the effects of different <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions</b> on the apparent affinity and voltage dependence of block by intracellular Au(CN) 2 − ions suggests that <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions</b> do not need to permeate through the channel in order to destabilize Au(CN) 2 − binding within the pore, implying that this destabilizing effect results from binding to an externally accessible site in the permeation pathway. We propose that multiple anions can bind simultaneously within the CFTR channel pore, and that repulsive interactions between bound anions speeds anion exit from the pore...|$|R

40|$|Effects of <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions</b> {{were studied}} in {{electrophysiological}} experiments on freshly isolated rat ventricular myocytes. Under current-clamp, action potential duration (APD) was prolonged {{by reducing the}} extracellular Cl− concentration and shortened by replacement of extracellular Cl− with I−. Under voltage-clamp, membrane potential steps or ramps evoked an anionic background current (IAB) carried by either Cl−, Br−, I− or NO 3 −. Activation of IAB was Ca 2 +- and cyclic AMP-independent, and was unaffected by cell shrinkage. IAB was insensitive to stilbene and fenamate anion transport blockers at concentrations that inhibit Ca 2 +-, cyclic AMP- and swelling-activated Cl− currents in ventricular cells of other mammals. These results suggest that IAB may be carried by a novel class of Cl− channel. Correlation of anion substitution experiments on membrane current and action potentials revealed that IAB could {{play a major role}} in controlling rat ventricular APD. These findings have important implications for those studying cardiac Cl− channels as potential targets for novel antiarrythmic agents...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTMEM 16 A protein, {{also known}} as anoctamin- 1, has been {{recently}} identified as {{an essential component of}} Ca 2 +-activated Cl− channels. We previously reported the existence of different TMEM 16 A isoforms generated by alternative splicing. In the present study, we have determined the functional properties of a minimal TMEM 16 A protein. This isoform, called TMEM 16 A(0), has a significantly shortened amino-terminus and lacks three alternative segments localized in the intracellular regions of the protein (total length: 840 amino acids). TMEM 16 A(0) expression is associated with Ca 2 +-activated Cl− channel activity as measured by three different functional assays based on the halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein, short-circuit current recordings, and patch-clamp technique. However, compared to a longer isoform, TMEM 16 (abc) (total length: 982 amino acids), TMEM 16 A(0) completely lacks voltage-dependent activation. Furthermore, TMEM 16 A(0) and TMEM 16 A(abc) have similar but not identical responses to <b>extracellular</b> <b>anion</b> replacement, thus suggesting a difference in ion selectivity and conductance. Our results indicate that TMEM 16 A(0) has the basic domains required for anion transport and Ca 2 +-sensitivity. However, the absence of alternative segments, which are present in more complex isoforms of TMEM 16 A, modifies the channel gating and ion transport ability...|$|E

The host must therefore {{provide them with}} inorganic metabolites, including carbon. This study describes a tool for studying cell processes occurring in a bacteria-containing cell by the dissociation of trophosome cell types. The physiological assays performed on cell preparations focused on carbon dioxide conversion and transport processes. Trophosome tissue was mechanically dissociated, resulting in cell suspensions enriched in small (7 - 20 mum) bacteriocytes, which were viable for several hours. In addition, medium-term cell cultures were also attempted. As a start {{to the understanding of}} the CO 2 metabolism of these cells, we were interested in evidence of carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms, ATPases and chloride exchangers. Variations in intracellular and extracellular pH, and in intracellular concentrations of sodium, potassium and chloride, were followed after addition of selective inhibitors. The data presented here suggest the occurrence of potential cytosolic and membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase isoforms in the bacteriocytes, proton-driven sodium-ATPases and a well represented anion transporter exchanging intracellular chloride against <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{current flow}} through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, {{referred}} to as Ih, {{plays a major role}} in several fundamental biological processes. The sequence of the presumed pore region of HCN channels is reminiscent of that of most known K+-selective channels. In the present work, the pore topology of an HCN channel from sea urchin sperm, called SpHCN, was investigated by means of the substituted-cysteine accessibility method (SCAM). The Ih current in the wild-type (w. t.) SpHCN channel was irreversibly blocked by intracellular Cd 2 +. This blockage was not observed in mutant C 428 S. Extracellular Cd 2 + did not cause any inhibition of the Ih current in the w. t. SpHCN channel, but blocked the current in mutant channels K 433 C and F 434 C. Large <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions</b> blocked the current both in the w. t. and K 433 Q mutant channel. These results suggest that 1) cysteine in position 428 faces the intracellular medium; 2) lysine and phenylalanine in position 433 and 434, respectively, face the extracellular side of the membrane; and 3) lysine 433 does not mediate the anion blockade. Additionally, our study confirms that the K+ channel signature sequence GYG also forms the inner pore in HCN channels...|$|R
40|$|Members of the CLC protein {{family of}} Cl− {{channels}} and transporters display the remarkable {{ability to function}} as either chloride channels or Cl−/H+ antiporters. Due to the intracellular localization of ClC- 6 and ClC- 7, {{it has not yet}} been possible to study the biophysical properties of these members of the late endosomal/lysosomal CLC branch in heterologous expression. Whereas recent data suggest that ClC- 7 functions as an antiporter, transport characteristics of ClC- 6 have remained entirely unknown. Here, we report that fusing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the N terminus of ClC- 6 increased its cell surface expression, allowing us to functionally characterize ClC- 6. Compatible with ClC- 6 mediating Cl−/H+ exchange, Xenopus oocytes expressing GFP-tagged ClC- 6 alkalinized upon depolarization. This alkalinization was dependent on the presence of <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions</b> and could occur against an electrochemical proton gradient. As observed in other CLC exchangers, ClC- 6 -mediated H+ transport was abolished by mutations in either the “gating” or “proton” glutamate. Overexpression of GFP-tagged ClC- 6 in CHO cells elicited small, outwardly rectifying currents with a Cl− > I− conductance sequence. Mutating the gating glutamate of ClC- 6 yielded an ohmic anion conductance that was increased by additionally mutating the “anion-coordinating” tyrosine. Additionally changing the chloride-coordinating serine 157 to proline increased the NO 3 − conductance of this mutant. Taken together, these data demonstrate {{for the first time that}} ClC- 6 is a Cl−/H+ antiporter...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of a hyperpolarization-activated Cl− current (Ihyp-act) in murine ciliated respiratory cells {{have been studied}} using whole cell patch clamping. The current–voltage relationship was inwardly rectifying which was due to voltage-dependent gating of the channel. Inward current was markedly sensitive to the extracellular Cl− concentration, an effect that {{was not related to}} changes in transmembrane Cl− gradient. Decreasing extracellular Cl− concentration to 6 mM caused a 70 % reduction in inward current with the dose–response relationship exhibiting a Hill coefficient of ≈ 2 · 0 and an IC 50 of 29 mM. External anion replacement gave a selectivity sequence of Br− ≥ I− > Cl− > gluconate = aspartate. The more permeant halides significantly increased current density while the less permeant anions decreased current density, indicating that an <b>extracellular</b> <b>anion</b> is important for channel activity. The conductance was unaffected by exposure to anisotonic pipette solutions or to increases in intracellular cAMP; however, current density was reduced dose dependently by increases in intracellular calcium concentration from 0 · 1 to 0 · 5 μM. These results indicate that Ihyp-act is unlikely to be involved in either volume regulation or cAMP/Ca 2 +-stimulated fluid secretion. Decreasing extracellular pH to 5 · 0 irreversibly inhibited Ihyp-act. However, the current was fully active over the pH range 5 · 4 – 9 · 0 making it unlikely that it is modulated by extracellular pH under physiological conditions. We speculate that Ihyp-act may have a role in basal Cl− absorption, acting as a Cl− sensor to maintain optimal volume and composition of airway surface liquid...|$|E
40|$|AB STRACT The {{rates of}} anion net efflux from gramicidin-treated {{erythrocytes}} {{in the presence}} ofa K gradient were measured at 25 °C, pH 7. 8, as rates of loss of Ki. The experiments served to estimate the relative contributions of two hypothetical mechanisms to C 1 net efflux at low extracellular C 1 concentrations. Cl, Br, and N 0 3 net effluxes were measured into media of different Cl, Br, or N 0 3 concentrations, respectively, to determine and compare the relative rates of the extracellular anion-inhibitable components. They were 48, 160, and 230 mmol/(kg Hb-min), respectively, at a membrane potential of about- 90 mV. This indicates that the anion-inhibitable efflux is not due solely to the return translocation of the empty transport site ("slippage") because slippage should be independent of the chemical nature of the anion. Cl net efflux was also measured {{as a function of}} the intracellular C 1 concentration into media containing either 0 or 50 mM CI. Under both conditions, net efflux was linearly dependent on Cli between 30 and 300 mM Cli and was 0 when back-extrapolated to 0 Cl i. This observation is not compatible with the slippage process, which under these conditions would have been expected to be independent of Cl i above 15 mM Cli. It was concluded that slippage contributes negligibly to Cl net efflux even at low <b>extracellular</b> <b>anion</b> concentrations and that the alternative process of "tunneling"-that is, movement of the anion through the anion transporter without a conformational change in a channel-type behavior-is the major, if not the sole, mechanism underlying Cl conductance...|$|E

Data suggest that increased dietary Cl− intake increases blood pressure, yet paradoxically, higher serum Cl− appears associated with lower mortality and cardiovascular risk. This implies that serum Cl− also reflects risk pathways independent of blood pressure, serum Na+, and bicarbonate (HCO 3 −). We analyzed 12 [*] 968 hypertensive individuals followed up for 35 years, using Cox proportional hazards model to test whether baseline serum Cl− was an independent predictor of mortality. To distinguish the effect of Cl− from Na+ and HCO 3 −, we adjusted for these electrolytes and also performed the analysis stratified by Na+/HCO 3 − and Cl− levels. Generalized estimating equation {{was used to determine}} the effect of baseline Cl− on follow-up blood pressure. The total time at risk was 197 [*] 101 person-years. The lowest quintile of serum Cl− (&# 60; 100 mEq/L) was associated with a 20 % higher mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular) compared with the remainder of the subjects. A 1 mEq/L increase in serum Cl− was associated with a 1. 5 % (hazard ratio, 0. 985; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 98 – 0. 99) reduction in all-cause mortality, after adjustment for baseline confounding variables and Na+, K+, and HCO 3 − levels.

40|$|H 2 O 2 -producing lactobacilli in the vaginal fluid {{have been}} {{suggested}} to play a potential tumor-preventive role {{in addition to the}} control of undesirable microorganisms. As the vaginal fluid also contains a significant concentration of peroxidase that might utilize lactobacilli-derived H 2 O 2 as substrate for HOCl synthesis, a dominant biological role of HOCl in both natural defence systems has been postulated. Our study shows that lactobacillus-derived H 2 O 2 per se {{is not likely to be}} beneficial for the vaginal epithelium, as it causes apoptosis nonselectively in nontransformed as well as transformed cells. However, the combination of lactobacilli and peroxidase, i. e. the situation that is actually found in vivo, leads to the conversion of H 2 O 2 to HOCl which does not affect non-malignant cells, as these do not generate <b>extracellular</b> superoxide <b>anions.</b> In contrast, malignant cells, due to their abundant <b>extracellular</b> superoxide <b>anion</b> generation allow the generation of apoptosis-inducing hydroxyl radicals through HOCl/superoxide anion interaction. In total, our data show that the combination of H 2 O 2 -generating lactobacilli and peroxidase causes the selective elimination of malignant cells and thus might contribute to the tumorpreventive potential of lactobacilli. These findings are in good agreement with epidemiological data. The contribution of lactobacilli in this system can be completely mimicked by H 2 O 2 -generating glucose oxidase, indicating that it is fully explained by bacterial generation of H 2 O 2...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntracellular pH (pHi) regulates {{several aspects}} of {{mammalian}} sperm function, although the transport mechanisms that control pHiin these cells are not understood. The pHiof mouse cauda epididymal sperm was determined from the fluorescence excitation ratio of 2, 7 -bis(carboxyethyl) - 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein and calibrated with nigericin and elevated external [K+]. Two acid efflux mechanisms were identified following imposition of acid loads. One pathway has many anticipated characteristics of the somatic Na+-dependent Cl−–[formula]exchanger, although sperm and somatic mechanisms can be distinguished by their ion selectivity and inhibitor sensitivity. Sperm may have an isoform of this exchange pathway with novel functional characteristics. The second acid-export pathway does not require <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions</b> or cations and is inhibited by arylaminobenzoates (flufenamic acid, diphenylamine- 2 -carboxylate). Mouse sperm also recover spontaneously from intracellular alkalinization. Recovery rates inN-methyl-D-glucamine+Cl−or in 0. 25 Msucrose are {{not significantly different from}} that in a complex culture medium. Thus, recovery from alkalinization does not utilize specific, ion-dependent transport mechanisms. Other widely distributed acid-efflux mechanisms, such as the Na+–H+antiport pathway and the Na+-independent Cl−–[formula]exchanger are not major regulators of mouse sperm pHi. Sperm capacitation results in pHiincreases (from 6. 54 ± 0. 08 to 6. 73 ± 0. 09) that require a functional Na+-, Cl−-, and[formula]-dependent acid-efflux pathway. Inhibition of this regulatory mechanism attenuates alkaline shifts in pHiduring capacitation as well as the ability of sperm to produce a secretory response to zona pellucida agonists. These data suggest that one aspect of mouse sperm capacitation is the selective activation of one major pHiregulator...|$|R

In solutions in which extracellular divalent cation concentrations were 0. 1 mM, cells exhibited a large inward current. This current was {{not the result of}} increasing leak between the glass pipette and membrane, as there was no effect on the outward current. The inward current comprised both instantaneous and time-dependent components. The magnitude of the inward current increased,vith increasing extracellular K+ and negative membrane potential but was insensitive to <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions.</b> Replacing <b>extracellular</b> K+ with Rb+, Cs+, or Na+ only slightly modulated the magnitude of the inward current, whereas replacement,vith Li+ reduced the inward current by approximately 50 %, and tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) and choline were relatively impermeant. The inward current was blocked by extracellular Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + with apparent K(i) s (at - 140 mV) of 363 +/- 78 and 96 +/- 14 mu M, respectively. Furthermore, decreasing cytosolic K+ increased the magnitude of the inward current independently of the electrochemical driving force for K+ influx, consistent with regulation of the inward current by cytosolic K+. Uptake of Rb- 86 (+) by intact trk 1 Delta trk 2 Delta cells was inhibited by extracellular Ca 2 + with a K-i within the range observed for the inward current. Furthermore, increasing extracellular Ca 2 + from 0. 1 to 20 mM significantly inhibited the growth of these cells.

The molecular identity and regulation of anion transporters in PTs is unknown. Here we report a negative gradient of cytosolic anion concentration focused on the tip, in negative correlation with the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. We hypothesized that a possible link between these two ions is based on the presence of Ca 2 +-dependent protein kinases (CPKs). We characterized anion channels and CPK transcripts in PTs and analyzed their localization. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tagging of a homolog of SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1 (SLAH 3 :YFP) was widespread along PTs, but, in accordance with the anion efflux, CPK 2 /CPK 20 /CPK 17 /CPK 34 :YFP fluorescence was strictly localized at the tip plasma membrane. Expression of SLAH 3 with either CPK 2 or CPK 20 (but not CPK 17 /CPK 34) in Xenopus laevis oocytes elicited S-type anion channel currents. Interaction of SLAH 3 with CPK 2 /CPK 20 (but not CPK 17 /CPK 34) was confirmed by Förster-resonance energy transfer fluorescence lifetime microscopy in Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll protoplasts and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in living PTs.

40|$|AbstractP 2 X 7 receptors (P 2 X 7 Rs) are nonselective cation {{channels}} that are opened by the binding of extracellular ATP and {{are involved in}} the modulation of epithelial secretion, inflammation and nociception. Here, we investigated the effect of extracellular anions on channel gating and permeation of human P 2 X 7 Rs (hP 2 X 7 Rs) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Two-microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings showed that ATP-induced hP 2 X 7 R-mediated currents increased when extracellular chloride was substituted by the organic anions glutamate or aspartate and decreased when chloride was replaced by the inorganic anions nitrate, sulfate or iodide. ATP concentration–response comparisons revealed that substitution of chloride by glutamate decreased agonist efficacy, while substitution by iodide increased agonist efficacy at high ATP concentrations. Meanwhile, the ATP potency remained unchanged. Activation of the hP 2 X 7 R at low ATP concentrations via the high-affinity ATP effector site was not affected by the replacement of chloride by glutamate or iodide. To analyze the anion effect on the hP 2 X 7 R at the single-molecule level, we performed single-channel current measurements using the patch-clamp technique in the outside-out configuration. Chloride substitution did not affect the single-channel conductance, but the probability that the P 2 X 7 R channel was open increased when chloride was replaced by glutamate and decreased when chloride was replaced by iodide. This effect was due to an influence of the anions on the mean closed times of the hP 2 X 7 R channel. We conclude that hP 2 X 7 R channels are not anion-permeable in physiological Na+-based media and that external anions allosterically affect ion channel opening in the fully ATP 4 -liganded P 2 X 7 R through an <b>extracellular</b> <b>anion</b> binding site...|$|E

The relatively constant ionic pattern of vertebrates reflects a genetic "set" of many regulatory mechanisms [...] particularly renal regulation. Renal regulation of ionic pattern when loss of fluid from the body is disproportionate relative to the extracellular fluid composition (e. g., gastric juice with vomiting and pancreatic secretion with diarrhea) makes manifest that a mechanism to produce a biologically relatively inactive <b>extracellular</b> <b>anion</b> HCO 3 - exists, whereas no comparable mechanism to produce a biologically inactive cation has evolved. Life in the ocean, which has three times the sodium concentration of extracellular fluid, involves quite different osmoregulatory stress to that in freshwater. Terrestrial life involves risk of desiccation and, in large areas of the planet, salt deficiency. Mechanisms integrated in the hypothalamus (the evolutionary ancient midbrain) control water retention and facilitate excretion of sodium, and also control the secretion of renin by the kidney. Over and above the multifactorial processes of excretion, hypothalamic sensors reacting to sodium concentration, as well as circumventricular organs sensors reacting to osmotic pressure and angiotensin II, subserve genesis of sodium hunger and thirst. These behaviors spectacularly augment the adaptive capacities of animals. Instinct (genotypic memory) and learning (phenotypic memory) are melded to give specific behavior apt to the metabolic status of the animal.

Here, we used whole-cell and excised inside-out patch-clamp to investigate the relationship between anion permeation and gating, two processes typically viewed as independent, in TMEM 16 B expressed in HEK 293 T cells. The permeability ratio sequence determined by substituting Cl- with other anions (PX/PCl) was SCN- > I- > NO 3 - > Br- > Cl- > F- > gluconate. When external Cl- was substituted with other anions, TMEM 16 B activation and deactivation kinetics at 0. 5 μM Ca 2 + were modified according to the sequence of permeability ratios, with anions more permeant than Cl- slowing both activation and deactivation and anions less permeant than Cl- accelerating them. Moreover, replacement of external Cl- with gluconate, or sucrose, shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state activation (G-V relation) to more positive potentials, whereas substitution of extracellular or intracellular Cl- with SCN- shifted G-V to more negative potentials. Dose-response relationships for Ca 2 + in the presence of different <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions</b> indicated that the apparent affinity for Ca 2 + at + 100 mV increased with increasing permeability ratio.

40|$|Abstract The cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl channel pore {{is thought to}} contain multiple binding sites for permeant and impermeant anions. Here, we investigate the effects of mutation of different positively charged residues in the pore on current inhibition by impermeant Pt(NO 2) 4 2 and suramin anions. We show that mutations that remove positive charges (K 95, R 303) influence interactions with intracellular, but not extracel-lular, Pt(NO 2) 4 2 ions, consistent with these residues being situated within the pore inner vestibule. In contrast, mutation of R 334, supposedly located in the outer vestibule of the pore, affects block by both extracellular and intra-cellular Pt(NO 2) 4 2. Inhibition by extracellular Pt(NO 2) 4 2 requires a positive charge at position 334, consistent with a direct electrostatic interaction resulting in either open channel block or surface charge screening. In contrast, inhibition by intracellular Pt(NO 2) 4 2 is weakened in all R 334 -mutant forms of the channel studied, inconsistent with a direct interaction. Furthermore, mutation of R 334 had similar effects on block by intracellular suramin, a large organic molecule that is apparently unable to enter deeply into the channel pore. Mutation of R 334 altered interactions between intracellular Pt(NO 2) 4 2 and extracel-lular Cl but not those between intracellular Pt(NO 2) 4 2 and extracellular Pt(NO 2) 4 2. We propose that while the posi-tive charge of R 334 interacts directly with <b>extracellular</b> <b>anions,</b> mutation of this residue also alters interactions with intracellular anions by an indirect mechanism, due to mutation-induced conformational changes in the protein that are propagated {{some distance from the}} site of the mutation in the outer mouth of the pore...|$|R

This defines the beginning of phase 2, in which NO-mediated signaling depends on intracellular superoxide anions exclusively. The resultant peroxynitrite seems to activate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and thus triggers execution of apoptosis. Experimental depletion of intracellular glutathione causes a drastic decrease in the length of phase 1 in transformed cells and renders nontransformed cells sensitive to NO-mediated apoptosis induction. These findings allow the prediction that eithe...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{evaluation}} of chemically modified human erythrocytes {{has led to}} the proposal that amino acid residue E 681 of the band 3 anion exchanger AE 1 lies on the anion translocation pathway and is a proton carrier required for H+/SO 42 − cotransport. We have tested in Xenopus oocytes the functional consequences of mutations in the corresponding residue E 699 of mouse AE 1. Most mutations tested abolished AE 1 -mediated Cl− influx and efflux. Only the E 699 Q mutation increased stilbene disulfonate-sensitive efflux and influx of SO 42 −. E 699 Q-mediated Cl− influx was activated by elevation of intracellular SO 42 −, but E 699 Q-mediated Cl− efflux was undetectable. The DNDS (4, 4 ′-dinitrostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid) sensitivity of E 699 Q-mediated SO 42 − efflux was indistinguishable from that of wt AE 1 -mediated Cl− efflux. The <b>extracellular</b> <b>anion</b> selectivity of E 699 Q-mediated SO 42 − efflux was similar to that of wt AE 1 -mediated Cl− efflux. The stoichiometry of E 699 Q-mediated exchange of extracellular Cl− with intracellular SO 42 − was 1 : 1. Whereas SO 42 − injection into oocytes expressing wt AE 1 produced little change in membrane potential or resistance, injection of SO 42 −, but not of Cl− or gluconate, into oocytes expressing E 699 Q depolarized the membrane by 17 mV and decreased membrane resistance by 66 %. Replacement of bath Cl− with isethionate caused a 28 -mV hyperpolarization in SO 42 −-loaded oocytes expressing E 699 Q, but had no effect on oocytes expressing wt AE 1. Extracellular Cl−-dependent depolarization of SO 42 −-preloaded oocytes was blocked by DNDS. AE 1 E 699 Q-mediated inward current measured in the presence of extracellular Cl− was of magnitude sufficient to account for measured 35 SO 42 − efflux. Thus, AE 1 E 699 Q-mediated SO 42 −/ Cl− exchange operated largely, if not exclusively, as an electrogenic, asymmetric, 1 : 1 anion exchange. The data confirm the proposal that E 699 resides on or contributes to the integrity of the anion translocation pathway of AE 1. A single amino acid change in the sequence of AE 1 converted electroneutral to electrogenic anion exchange without alteration of SO 42 −/Cl− exchange stoichiometry...|$|E

These experiments were done to determine if nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by lymphocytes was due to the presence of superoxide anion. Mitogen-activated lymphocytes showed increased nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction compared to unstimulated cells, and the cells reducing nitro-blue tetrazolium were both T-cells and non-T-cells. Release of superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide by either resting or stimulated lymphocytes was not detected. There was no difference between resting and stimulated lymphocytes in the amount of chemi-luminescence produced in the presence of lucigenin, an agent which appears to be sensitive to intracellular and <b>extracellular</b> superoxide <b>anion.</b> The results, then, indicate superoxide anion is not present in lymphocytes.

40|$|AbstractCurrent chemiosmotic {{models of}} {{exocytosis}} ascribe {{an essential role}} to the influx of <b>extracellular</b> monovalent <b>anions</b> or cations into the secretory granules apposed to the plasma membrane. These hypotheses were tested by measuring insulin release in sucrose media devoid of monovalent ions. A small response to glucose (25 % of controls) was still observed, which could be potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine and suppressed by cobalt or low temperature. Substitution of Ba 2 + for Ca 2 + triggered a practically normal release of insulin that was inhibited by blockers of Ca 2 + channels (cobalt or D 600) and abolished by low temperature. These results show that insulin release remains possible {{in the absence of}} extracellular monovalent ions and, therefore, that the chemiosmotic models of exocytosis do not entirely apply to insulin release...|$|R

Increases in XD and XO activity in EC induced by hypoxia were associated upon reoxygenation with increased (P less than 0. 05) <b>extracellular</b> superoxide <b>anion</b> (O 2 -.) levels that were inhibited by treatment with XO inhibitors (tungsten, allopurinol) or an anion-channel blocker (4, 4 '-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid). EC monolayers subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation also leaked more preloaded 51 Cr, were more adherent to neutrophils, and permitted greater albumin transit than control monolayers. Treatment with tungsten, allopurinol, and/or superoxide dismutase decreased (P less than 0. 05) 51 Cr release, neutrophil adherence, and albumin transit in EC monolayers exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation. We conclude that prolonged hypoxia increases both XO and XD activity in EC and may predispose the endothelium to oxidative and inflammatory damage...|$|R

We examined {{the possibility that the}} leukocytes were activated by their adhesion to activated platelets and demonstrated that P-selectin-dependent platelet adhesion to neutrophils and monocytes induced produc-tion of <b>extracellular</b> superoxide <b>anion</b> (02 -) by these leu-kocytes. Leukocyte membrane glycoproteins containing Ser/Thr-linked carbohydrate chains were responsiblc for the signal reception leading to the leukocyte activation. Cytokines were shown to influence these processes. For example, treatments of neutrophils with interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) potentiated the P-selectin-induced 02 - production. Fur-thermore, interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) and interferon- 1 r (IFN- 1 r) induced surface expression of P-selectin on platelets {{in the presence of a}} low concentration of thrombin and con-sequently enhanced their adhesion capacity to leuko-cytes. These results indicated that the adhesion of acti-vated platelets to the leukocytes through the interaction between P-selectin and its carbohydrate ligand, sialyl Lewis X (Lex), was a crucial step for the activation of leukocyte function and supported the notion that acti-vated platelets were actively involved in the inflamma...|$|R

Therefore, we have assessed the oxidative stress status of peritoneal leukocytes from young prematurely aging mice (PAM) as compared with non-prematurely aging mice (NPAM), as well as the effects on this oxidative stress of a dietary supplementation with biscuits rich in antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotenes, zinc and selenium). We found that, in the peritoneal leukocytes, the levels of several parameters of oxidation such as <b>extracellular</b> superoxide <b>anion</b> (O(2) (-)), Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), nitric oxide, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) were higher in PAM as compared with NPAM, whereas the antioxidant defences such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, were decreased. Consequently, young PAM showed an oxidative stress in their leukocytes, which is characteristic of mice of an older chronological age. Antioxidant diet supplementation was able to restore redox homeostasis, increasing the antioxidant and decreasing the oxidant levels. Accordingly, supplementation with adequate levels of antioxidants, from an early age, could be useful to preserve health, especially in prematurely aging populations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBiophotovoltaic (BPV) devices {{employ the}} {{photosynthetic}} activity of microalgae or cyanobacteria to harvest light energy and generate electrical current directly {{as a result}} of the release of electrons from the algal cells. NADPH oxidases (NOX) are plasma-membrane enzymes that transport electrons from the cytosol to generate <b>extracellular</b> superoxide <b>anions,</b> and have been implicated in BPV output. In this study, we investigated NOX activity in the diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana in an attempt to understand and enhance NOX and BPV function. We found that NOX activity was linked to defined growth regimes and growth phases, and was light dependent. Crucially, current output in a BPV device correlated with NOX activity, and levels of up to 14 μA per 106 cells (approximately 500 mA·m− 2) were obtained. Expression of two putative P. tricornutum NOX genes (PtNOX 1 and PtNOX 2) was found to correspond with the observed growth patterns of superoxide anion production and power output, suggesting that these are responsible for the observed patterns of NOX activity. Crucially, we demonstrate that NOX activity levels could be enhanced via semi-continuous culturing, pointing to the possibility of maintaining long-term power output in BPV devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{esophagus}} of Ascaris is a syncytial muscle {{organ of}} tubular shape {{in which the}} myofibrils are arranged radially between the lumen and the external surface. A resting potential of almost 40 mv (cytoplasm negative) is maintained by the <b>extracellular</b> organic <b>anions</b> (volatile fatty acids) found in the perienteric fluid. Replacement of these anions by Cl- ions results in a large depolarization. The resting potential is also decreased when the external pH is lowered. The leading phase of the action potential with a positive overshoot of about 18 mv elicits contraction of the myofibrils, development of negative pressure within the lumen, and suction of liquid and food particles. The mechanical energy stored in the elastic components of the cell is released when the myofibrils relax, thus injecting {{the contents of the}} lumen into the intestine. A fast and synchronous relaxation is elicited by a regenerative membrane polarization, a negative spike with a peak value of up to 108 mv produced by an increase in the permeability of the membrane to K+ ions.

We examined the effect of micelles of mono- and trisialoganglioside GM 1 and GT 1 b on the production of reactive oxygen species by stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils using different spectroscopic methods. The results indicated that exogenous gangliosides did not influence <b>extracellular</b> superoxide <b>anion</b> (O 2. -) generation by polymorphonuclear neutrophils activated by receptor-dependent formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. However, when neutrophils were stimulated by receptor-bypassing phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA), gangliosides above their critical micellar concentrations prolonged the lag time preceding the production in a concentration-dependent way, without affecting total extracellular O 2. - generation detected by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction. The effect of ganglioside GT 1 b (100 µM) on the increase in lag time was shown to be significant by means of both superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction assay and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (P < 0. 0001 and P < 0. 005, respectively). The observed phenomena {{can be attributed to}} the ability of ganglioside micelles attached to the cell surface to slow down PMA uptake, thus increasing the diffusion barrier and consequently delaying membrane events responsible for PMA-stimulated O 2. - production...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{obtained}} new {{evidence for the}} occurrence of intracellular NADPH-oxidase activity in neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). PMA activation leads to a partial translocation of cytochrome b 558 from the membranes of the specific granules to the plasma membrane. It was suggested that NADPH-oxidase activity only {{takes place in the}} plasma membrane, leading to an extracellular release of oxygen metabolites because cellular self-destruction can be avoided in this way. The effects of PMA activation were indirectly studied in recent experiments employing scavengers of <b>extracellular</b> superoxide <b>anion</b> and hydrogen peroxide, and support for intracellular NADPH-oxidase activity was obtained. In this paper we use Raman microspectroscopy as a direct method to study intracellular molecular reactions that result from cellular triggering by PMA. The molecular specificity of this microscopic method enables us to show that intracellular reduction of both myeloperoxidase (MPO) and cytochrome b 558 occurs in neutrophilic granulocytes. Control measurements with cytochrome b 558 -deficient neutrophilic granulocytes did not show a reduction of intracellular MPO. This is direct support for the occurrence of intracellular NADPH-oxidase activity in organelles that must be in close contact with the azurophilic granules that contain MPO. Furthermore, a comparison was made with chemical reactions occurring in eosinophilic granulocytes after activation with PMA. Moreover, in these cells an intracellular reduction of eosinophil peroxidase was observed...|$|R
