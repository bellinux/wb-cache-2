40|$|Untreated <b>human</b> <b>and</b> {{animal excreta}} once being {{released}} into the environment can be a hazard to the environment <b>and</b> <b>human</b> health by possible pathogens and drug residues.

Meanwhile the demand of livestock <b>and</b> <b>humans</b> manure reuse in agriculture and fisheries requires that the hygienic safety of both treated <b>human</b> <b>and</b> animal excreta is ensured and their nutrient contents remain high. This research aims to assess the situation of <b>human</b> <b>and</b> animal excreta management based on regulation documents and environmental health impact approaches and to introduce some initial researches on integrated animal <b>and</b> <b>human</b> waste management.

5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on {{the similarities and differences}} between <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order from any of the other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences between <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.|$|E

5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
