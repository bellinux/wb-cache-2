50|$|In {{addition}} to the extant subspecies listed below, there is a Pleistocene population known from fossils: the larger, stout and long-winged paleosubspecies G. g. brodkorbi is known from the Ichetucknee River deposits in Florida. It was originally described as a distinct species, but is probably the direct ancestor of some of todays common gallinules. The presence in the same deposits of fossils typical of the shorter-winged and more delicate G. g. cerceris suggests that G. g. brodkorbi was not ancestral to the Antillean (<b>Florida)</b> <b>gallinule</b> of our time but rather to the more northerly North American subspecies.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study {{chromosomal}} polymorphism in natural populations, to evaluate karyotype evolution and to sex birds {{that do not}} have morphological sexual dimorphism, the short-time technique of culturing the feather pulp was improved (Giannoni et al, 1986) by minor modifications of the method described by Schoffner (1985). Several techniques have used feather pulps as material for cytogenetic studies. The first description of the use of this material was given by Sandnes (1954). Shoffner propagated and improved the method using feather pulps (Schoffner and Krishan, 1965; Schoffner et al, 1967; Schoffner, 1985). The main advantage of these assays is that they provide the possibility of studying rare, wild living birds and/or birds from zoos, without any trauma for the animal. The material can be obtained from young birds, but also from adult animals having no growing feathers. In the latter case, 6 - 10 feathers are removed. The removed feathers are replaced by new ones, 10 [...] 20 days later, and these can also be used. Feathers from recently deceased birds can also be used. The gelatinous material from 7 - 10 growing feathers was macerated in a Petri dish with 8 ml of complete medium (medium + 0. 4 ml phytohemagglutinin + 20 % serum) and placed in an incubator at 39 Â°C. After 4 h of incubation, 5 - 6 drops of a 0. 0016 % colchicine solution was added, the Petri dish containing the material was returned to the incubator for an additional 2 h before hypotonization (0. 075 NI KCl), fixation (acetic acid:methanol, 1 : 3), and staining with Giemsa in the usual manner. The C- and NOR (nucleolar organizer region) -bands were obtained according to the techniques of Sumner, (1972) and Howell and Black (1980), respectively, after analysis of the Giemsa-stained slides, without previous destaining. The results have been satisfactory for materials from various birds (such as partridge, shore-birds, parrot, macaw, toucan, <b>Florida</b> <b>gallinule)</b> ...|$|E
