5|$|When {{a batter}} {{attempts}} a sacrifice bunt {{and the resulting}} bunt is so well-placed that he safely reaches first base, the official scorer may elect to credit the batter with a hit instead of a sacrifice {{if there is no}} error on the play and an ordinary effort by the <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> not have recorded an out.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{was offered}} a berth after it {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 10–2 record—its highest win total since the 2006 season—that ended with a 40–34 win against arch-rival Ohio State. Virginia Tech {{was offered a}} berth after it finished its season 11–2, which culminated in a 38–10 loss in the 2011 ACC Championship Game to Clemson. Media attention focused {{on the quality of the}} bowl selection, as both teams were criticized for not having strong schedules. Attention also focused on how Virginia Tech's <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> contain Michigan QB Denard Robinson.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the keys}} for the Hokie <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> be linebacker Brandon Manning, who {{attended}} the Air Force Academy's preparatory school before deciding to walk on to Virginia Tech's football team instead of attending the Academy. Manning was Tech's No.3 tackler in terms of statistics, accumulating 70tackles {{during the course of}} the regular season. Virginia Tech defensive tackle Jimmy Williams injured his ankle twodays prior to the game, causing him to be unable to play. Tech's Richard Johnson was also listed as injured and unlikely to play.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, {{where the}} path ended at the amphitheater, strong {{barricades}} had been erected {{in a sort}} of semicircle; so that anyone, after having forced the first <b>defenses,</b> <b>would,</b> as he showed himself {{at the entrance to the}} amphitheater, be exposed to the fire of the whole of its defenders.|$|R
50|$|These {{proposed}} defense systems, {{intended to}} lessen the risk of devastating nuclear war, would lead to it, according to these critics. Indeed, according to game theory, the side not building large-scale missile <b>defenses</b> <b>would</b> {{have an incentive to}} launch a pre-emptive first strike while such a strike could still get through.|$|R
50|$|Items become {{functionally}} obsolete {{when they}} can no longer adequately perform the function for which they were created. For example, while one could theoretically adapt an Avro Lancaster to deploy modern JDAM bombs, the situations in which it could actually succeed at doing so against modern air <b>defenses</b> <b>would</b> be so few that it would be essentially useless.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, The British Invasion, {{defeated}} Team 3D on July 21, 2009, at {{the taping}} of the July 30, 2009, episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, in a tables match. Afterwards, NJPW {{released a statement}} announcing {{that they did not}} sanction the defense nor the title change, and as such were not going to recognize the reign. They continued to recognize Team 3D as the current champions and proclaimed that the next title <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> be by Team 3D and would be sanctioned by NJPW. On August 10, 2009, NJPW issued another press release stating that they were now recognizing The British Invasion of Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams as the current IWGP Tag Team Champions, making the reign official.|$|E
25|$|The area {{within the}} walls is large and its <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> require {{much more than a}} typical Middle Woodland {{fighting}} force.|$|E
25|$|Joe Dailey {{would start}} off the scoring {{in the second}} half with a 13-yd pass to Hakeem Nicks but the Irish <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> block another XP attempt making the score 31-19. The Irish would strike back with Quinn hitting Jeff Samardzija with a 42-yd pass to make the score 38-19. UNC would repeat their earlier tandem with Dailey {{throwing}} a 72-yd pass to Nicks to cut the deficit to 38-26. But that would be UNC's last hurrah in this game as the Irish <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> prevent anymore scoring and the lone score of the 4th quarter was Darius Walker's 1-yd run to give 45-26 final.|$|E
25|$|Defenses {{work best}} against the {{offensive}} weapon {{with which they}} are matched. A defense mechanism used against a mismatched attack is diminished to the square root of the defense value (with a minimum of 1). For example, nine units of shield <b>defenses</b> <b>would</b> afford the same protection as only three units of armor when used to defend against mass drivers.|$|R
50|$|In September 1992, it was Hill {{pitted against}} 1984 Olympic {{teammate}} Frank Tate for the vacant WBA 175-lb. title. It was a 'grudge match' between the two, and Hill won the title {{on his home}} turf of Bismarck. Another string of ten <b>defenses</b> <b>would</b> follow, including a rematch with Tate, a close decision over Lou Del Valle who almost upset Hill.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the state defense forces, {{including}} the FSG, was to fulfil the National Guard’s state obligations. This could include guarding infrastructure, protecting against sabotage, calming riots, or aiding law enforcement. Although the mainland United States was never invaded during World War II, state <b>defenses</b> <b>would</b> have shared responsibility with the federal military and National Guard in defending American territory.|$|R
25|$|Michigan would {{score on}} its next two drives {{to go up}} 21–18, but the <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> get the ball back to Robinson, who would put {{together}} an 81-yard drive, including a 4th down and 7yard conversion, and score on a 3-yard keeper with :53 left to give the Lions a 25–21 lead.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s the Finnish and Estonian coastal {{defenses}} made extensive {{plans to}} use the fortresses against their former masters, and prevent the Soviet Baltic Fleet from gaining access to the seas. The <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> be strengthened by minefields and patrolling submarines from the Finnish and Estonian navies. These plans were however nullified with the Soviet demands of air and naval bases in the Baltic States in 1939.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Culpepper lost a fumble while being sacked by safety Shaun Williams, and Cornelius Griffin {{recovered}} {{the ball on}} the Vikings 29, setting up Toomer's 7-yard touchdown reception to close out the scoring. New York's <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> dominate the Vikings {{for the rest of the}} game, not allowing them to get beyond the Giants 40-yard line. They also intercepted Culpepper twice, one by Sam Garnes and the other by Jason Sehorn.|$|E

50|$|Hampton {{remained}} at left defensive end in 1986 {{and was a}} First-team All-Pro. However, in the Bears 46 <b>defense</b> he <b>would</b> line up as a nose tackle and when the Bears lined up in a nickel <b>defense,</b> Hampton <b>would</b> play right tackle. Late in the 1987 season, Mike Ditka moved Hampton back to defensive tackle (where he played from 1982-1984), where he remained {{throughout the rest of}} his career.|$|R

25|$|The defense held Indiana to 180 {{yards of}} total offense and only six first downs, the fewest Penn State has ever allowed in a Big Ten game. Linebacker Josh Hull led all tacklers with seven, {{including}} his first career sack. The only points allowed {{came on a}} Marcus Thigpen 57-yard rushing touchdown {{in the second quarter}} to tie the game 7–7. Kevin Kelly later kicked a field goal to give the Lions a 10–7 lead at halftime. In the second half, the Nittany Lions <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> only give up 36 yards and one first down.|$|E
25|$|After his surgery, Martínez {{confirmed}} his next title <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> {{take place in}} his native Argentina, in what would be his first fight in his home country since leaving for Spain in 2002. News agency Reuters reported that Martínez could make his first title defense against British fighter Martin Murray on 27 April 2013 in Argentina. Martínez defeated Ring Top 10 Middleweight Martin Murray by a controversial unanimous decision. Many observers stated {{that there had been}} a clear deterioration in Martínez since the Chavez Jr bout.|$|E
25|$|Assistant Secretary of Defense Frederick F.Y. Pang, however, {{warned the}} school that the Department of <b>Defense</b> <b>would</b> {{withdraw}} ROTC programs from the school if privatization took place. As {{a result of this}} action by Pang, Congress passed a resolution on 18 November 1997 prohibiting the Department of Defense from withdrawing or diminishing any ROTC program at one of the six senior military colleges, including VMI. This escape clause provided by Congress came after the VMI Board of Visitors had already voted 9–8 to admit women and the decision was not revisited.|$|E
50|$|Second Lieutenant Weitzel's first {{assignment}} was helping improve the defenses of New Orleans under Major P.G.T. Beauregard, {{who had also}} graduated second in his class (as had Robert E. Lee in his). His work on Fort Jackson, Fort St. Philip and the Customs house earned the respect of Major Beauregard and Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, so Weitzel was promoted to First Lieutenant. Knowledge of those <b>defenses</b> <b>would</b> prove crucial later in his career.|$|R

50|$|Arising {{from the}} Argus As 292 project, the Argus Fernfeuer was also {{designed}} by Fritz Gosslau. During {{the testing of}} the small As 292 drone, Gosslau proposed an aircraft-sized UAV capable of delivering a one tonne drop charge over long distances. Control was either by line-of-sight radio control or by radio beam direction. A manned aircraft, flying clear of local <b>defenses,</b> <b>would</b> signal the UAV to release the drop-load. The Fernfeuer aircraft would then return to base.|$|R

25|$|Following the CSAC's {{decision}} {{to uphold the}} results of the positive steroid test, the UFC officially stripped Sherk of his Lightweight Championship. At UFC 80, B.J. Penn defeated Joe Stevenson to win the vacant title. After the fight, UFC president Dana White announced that Penn's first title <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> be against Sherk, who was reinstated by UFC in April 2008, and has tested clean ever since. Sherk and Penn fought at UFC 84 on May 24, 2008. Sherk lost by TKO in the third round after failing to answer the fourth round bell.|$|E
25|$|BYU {{would start}} {{the second half}} with the ball but once again the Wisconsin <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> force a three–and–out. After a nice punt return by Kenzel Doe, the Badgers would start the drive at the Cougars 23-yard line. The BYU <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> hold the Badgers to a 26-yard field goal and giving Wisconsin a 20–3 lead. The Cougars would answer right back quick 6–play drive capped by a 34-yard {{touchdown}} pass to WR Cody Hoffman from QB Taysom Hill. A couple of stalled drive by both teams but Wisconsin would get the ball at their own 8-yard line after a 73-yard punt by BYU and were moving the ball into BYU territory as their quarter came to an end. The Badgers would score just over a minute into the fourth quarter on a 14-yard touchdown run by James White giving the Badgers a 27–10 lead. The next four drive (two by each team) would all result in punts. BYU would score after a 9–play 57 yard drive capped by a 5-yard touchdown pass to Cody Hoffman from Taysom Hill. BYU then forced the Badgers to punt and the Cougars would get the ball back with 2:12 {{left in the game}} and down by 10 points. BYU got down to the Wisconsin 25-yard line but ran out of time, Wisconsin won 27–17.|$|E
5|$|Of the 108 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree. The initial Japanese attack {{did not succeed in}} neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's <b>defenses</b> <b>would</b> be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.|$|R

5|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the capability of radar to create an effective centralized early warning system also contributed to the over-reliance on the self-defense capabilities of bombers. However Hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed <b>defenses</b> <b>would</b> make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential {{to the creation of the}} United States Air Force.|$|R
25|$|When {{the third}} quarter started, the Seahawks looked to {{increase}} its lead to win the game. Hasselbeck would lead the Seahawks to a 99-yard drive, capping it off 33-yard touchdown pass to Carlson. Julius Jones would seal the win with a 62-yard touchdown (and rushing 119 in total) run to put Seattle up by 28. The Seahawks <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> shutout the Rams, as they totaled only 247 total yards on offense and forcing two fumbles and three sacks. Seattle moved to 1–0 to start off the season, and beat the Rams for the ninth straight time.|$|E
25|$|More generally, the <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> {{be denied}} to people {{experiencing}} symptoms of intoxication {{who continued to}} consume the spiked drink because {{they ought to have}} known what was happening to them. Equally, if no further consumption occurred but they ought to have recognized that they were affected by an unknown substance, beginning an activity such as driving would not fall within the defense. In other words, the policy underpinning the operation of the law favors the protection of the public as against the interests of an individual who recklessly or with wilful blindness exposes the public to danger.|$|E
25|$|The {{psychiatrist}} {{claims that}} Dahlgren considered Harok family {{a source of}} his stress, while he was indifferent to other persons including the girlfriend {{of one of the}} victims, a mail carrier, and a house cleaner who all made contact with Dahlgren either prior to or in between the killings. The psychiatrist was the first witness who was asked additional questions by Dahlgren; Dahlgren claimed he had been hearing voices in his head for two years every ten or fifteen seconds. Following this expert testimony, the defense attorney announced that the <b>defense</b> <b>would</b> order another expert witness testimony, while the judge adjourned the hearing until June 19.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{response}} to the SDI during the period March 1983 through November 1985 provided indications of {{their view of the}} program both as a threat and as an opportunity to weaken NATO. SDI was likely seen not only {{as a threat to the}} physical security of the Soviet Union, but also as part of an effort by the United States to seize the strategic initiative in arms controls by neutralizing the military component of Soviet strategy. The Kremlin, however, masked their real concerns, advocating that space-based missile <b>defenses</b> <b>would</b> make nuclear war inevitable.|$|R
2500|$|Darrow {{was later}} criticized for {{misleading}} and pressuring the McNamaras into each pleading guilty.
