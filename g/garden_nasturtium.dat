50|$|The genus Nasturtium {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the flowering garden annual commonly known as nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus). Though not related, the leaves of the <b>garden</b> <b>nasturtium</b> also have a peppery taste.|$|E
50|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>nasturtium</b> {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} the Dot Moth and the Garden Carpet Moth. A very common pest found on nasturtiums is the caterpillar of the Large White or Cabbage White Butterfly.|$|E
5000|$|Tropaeolum tuberosum (mashua, {{see below}} for other names) is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the family Tropaeolaceae, grown in the Andes, particularly in Peru and Bolivia, {{and to a lesser}} extent in Ecuador as well as in Boyacá Department, Colombia, for its edible tubers, which are eaten cooked or roasted as a vegetable. It is a minor food source, especially to native Amerindian populations. Mashua is a herbaceous perennial climber growing to 2 - 4 m in height. It is related to <b>garden</b> <b>nasturtiums,</b> and is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental for its brightly coloured tubular flowers.|$|R
50|$|Tropaeolum majus (<b>garden</b> <b>nasturtium,</b> Indian cress or monks cress) is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Tropaeolaceae, originating in the Andes from Bolivia north to Colombia. The species has become naturalized {{in parts of the}} United States (California, New York, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut). It is of cultivated, probably hybrid origin, with possible parent species including T. minus, T. moritzianum, T. peltophorum, and T. peregrinum. It is not closely related to the genus Nasturtium (which includes watercress).|$|E
40|$|Pieris brassicae L. is {{a serious}} pest of {{cultivated}} crucifers in several parts of theworld. Larvae of P. brassicae also feed prolifically on <b>garden</b> <b>nasturtium</b> (Tropaeolummajus L., of the family Tropaeolaceae). Proteolytic digestion was studied in larvaefeeding on multiple hosts. Fourth instars were collected from cauliflower fields beforetransfer onto detached, aerial tissues of selected host plants in the lab. Variable levels ofmidgut serine proteinases were detected in larvae fed on different hosts using proteinsubstrates (casein and recombinant RBCL cloned from cauliflower) and diagnostic,synthetic substrates. Qualitative changes in midgut trypsin activities and quantitativechanges in midgut chymotrypsin activities were implicated in physiological adaptation oflarvae transferred to T. majus. Midgut proteolytic activities were inhibited to differentextents by serine proteinase inhibitors, including putative trypsin inhibitors isolated fromherbivore-attacked and herbivore-free leaves of cauliflower (CfTI) and T. majus (TpTI). Transfer of larvae to T. majus significantly influenced feeding parameters but notnecessarily when transferred to different tissues of the same host. Results obtained arerelevant for devising sustainable pest management strategies, including transgenicapproaches using genes encoding plant protease inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} elongase [often {{designated}} FAE or β-(or 3 -) ketoacyl-CoA synthase] is a condensing enzyme {{and is the}} first component of the elongation complex involved in synthesis of erucic acid (22 : 1) in seeds of <b>garden</b> <b>nasturtium</b> (Tropaeolum majus). Using a degenerate primers approach, a cDNA of a putative embryo FAE was obtained showing high homology to known plant elongases. This cDNA contains a 1, 512 -bp open reading frame that encodes a protein of 504 amino acids. A genomic clone of the nasturtium FAE was isolated and sequence analyses indicated the absence of introns. Northern hybridization showed the expression of this nasturtium FAE gene to be restricted to the embryo. Southern hybridization revealed the nasturtium β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase to be encoded by a small multigene family. To establish {{the function of the}} elongase homolog, the cDNA was introduced into two different heterologous chromosomal backgrounds (Arabidopsis and tobacco [Nicotiana tabacum]) under the control of a seed-specific (napin) promoter and the tandem 35 S promoter, respectively. Seed-specific expression resulted in up to an 8 -fold increase in erucic acid proportions in Arabidopsis seed oil, while constitutive expression in transgenic tobacco tissue resulted in increased proportions of very long chain saturated fatty acids. These results indicate that the nasturtium FAE gene encodes a condensing enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids, utilizing monounsaturated and saturated acyl substrates. Given its strong and unique preference for elongating 20 : 1 -CoA, the utility of the FAE gene product for directing or engineering increased synthesis of erucic acid is discussed...|$|E
