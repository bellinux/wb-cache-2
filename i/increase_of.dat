40|$|Bender/extender element {{testing of}} {{unsaturated}} compacted speswhite kaolin samples {{was used to}} investigate the influences of mean net stress p, suction s, specific volume v and degree of saturation Sr on shear and compression wave velocities, Vs and Vp, and hence on small strain elastic values of undrained shear modulus and undrained constrained modulus. Testing was performed in a suction-controlled triaxial cell and involved combinations of isotropic loading and unloading stages and wetting and drying stages, {{in an attempt to}} isolate the influence of each unsaturated state variable. The results showed that <b>increases</b> <b>of</b> Vs are caused by <b>increases</b> <b>of</b> p and decreases <b>of</b> v. Combined <b>increases</b> <b>of</b> s and decreases of Sr during drying also lead to <b>increases</b> <b>of</b> Vs, and conversely combined decreases <b>of</b> s and <b>increases</b> <b>of</b> Sr during wetting lead to decreases of Vs. Separating the effects of changes of s and Sr on Vs was not possible, because the evidence on the influence of a change of Sr at constant s was contradictory. <b>Increases</b> <b>of</b> Vp are caused by <b>increases</b> <b>of</b> p and Sr and decreases of v, whereas the influence of a change of s at constant Sr is unclear...|$|R

30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  3 a {{that under the}} condition that the mass content of non-condensing gases is kept unchanged, SMTF pressure decreases with <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> injection rate. It {{is observed}} from Fig.  3 b that {{under the condition that}} the mass content of non-condensing gases is kept unchanged, SMTF temperature increases at first and then turns to decrease with <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> injection rate. This is because when the injection rate is relatively small, heat loss has a significant influence on temperature drop. However, the effect of heat loss on temperature drop becomes weaker with <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> injection rate. It is observed from Fig.  3 c that under the condition that the mass content of non-condensing gases is kept unchanged, superheat degree <b>increases</b> with <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> injection rate. Besides, under the condition that the injection rate is kept unchanged, superheat degree decreases with <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> mass content of non-condensing gases. It is observed from Fig.  3 d that the effect of injection rate on enthalpy profiles is negligible, but the enthalpy decreases rapidly with <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> mass content of non-condensing gases.|$|R
