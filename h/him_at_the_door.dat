25|$|Lord Baltimore {{negotiated}} a compromise in 1733, but Cresap ignored it and continued his raids. A deputy {{was sent to}} arrest him in 1734, and Cresap killed <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The Pennsylvania governor demanded that Maryland arrest Cresap for murder; the Maryland governor instead commissioned him as a captain in the militia. In 1736, Cresap was finally arrested; he was jailed until 1737 when the King intervened. In 1750, a court decided that, by failing to develop the land with settlers, Lord Baltimore had forfeited his rights to a twenty-mile (32km) swath of land. In 1767, a new Pennsylvania-Maryland border was officially established by the Mason-Dixon line.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{possible}} {{instance of}} human sacrifice {{mentioned in the}} Bible is the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter in Judges 11. Jephthah vows to sacrifice to God whatsoever comes to greet <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> when he returns home if he is victorious. The vow is stated in the Book of Judges, 11:31: [...] "Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer Him a burnt offering." [...] When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs out to greet him. She begs for, and is granted, [...] "two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends", after which [...] "he [...] did to her as he had vowed." [...] According to some commentators of rabbinic literature, Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow {{that she would be}} devoted to the Lord.|$|E
2500|$|When the band's first album, Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash, was {{released}} in August 1981, it received positive reviews in local fanzines. Options Blake Gumprecht wrote, [...] "Westerberg {{has the ability to}} make you feel like you're right in the car with him, alongside <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> drinking from the same bottle." [...] The album contained the band's first single, [...] "I'm in Trouble", Westerberg's [...] "first truly good song". Sorry Ma included the song, [...] "Somethin to Dü", a homage to another Minneapolis punk band, Hüsker Dü. The Replacements had a friendly rivalry with the band, which started when Twin/Tone chose the Replacements over Hüsker Dü, and Hüsker Dü landed an opening slot at a Johnny Thunders gig that the Replacements had wanted. Hüsker Dü also influenced the band's music. The Replacements began playing faster and became more influenced by hardcore punk. Despite this, the band did not feel part of the hardcore scene. As Mars later stated, [...] "We were confused about what we were." ...|$|E

This act was the catalyst that led to the Flight of the Noldor.|$|R
2500|$|Ford {{was highly}} intelligent, erudite, {{sensitive}} and sentimental, but {{to protect himself}} in the cutthroat atmosphere of Hollywood he cultivated {{the image of a}} [...] "tough, two-fisted, hard-drinking Irish sonofabitch". One famous event, witnessed by Ford's friend actor Frank Baker, strikingly illustrates the tension between the public persona and the private man. During the Depression, Ford—by then a very wealthy man—was accosted outside his office by a former Universal actor who was destitute and needed $200 for an operation for his wife. As the man related his misfortunes, Ford appeared to become enraged and then, to the horror of onlookers, he launched himself at the man, knocked him to the floor and shouted [...] "How dare you come here like this? Who do think you are to talk to me this way?" [...] before storming out of the room. However, as the shaken old man left the building, Frank Baker saw Ford's business manager Fred Totman meet <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> where he handed the man a cheque for $1,000 and instructed Ford's chauffeur to drive him home. There, an ambulance was waiting to take the man's wife to the hospital where a specialist, flown in from San Francisco at Ford's expense, performed the operation. Some time later, Ford purchased a house for the couple and pensioned them for life. When Baker related the story to Francis Ford, he declared it the key to his brother's personality: ...|$|E
