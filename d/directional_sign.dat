25|$|There {{is a vast}} {{range of}} signs in use on British roads, from <b>directional</b> <b>sign</b> posts, to signs warning of {{possible}} hazards ahead, and regulatory signs instructing motorists to perform certain actions.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013 {{designs for}} a new style of <b>directional</b> <b>sign</b> were {{released}} following lobbying by Conradh na Gaeilge to make the signs display Irish in equal proportion to English. The new design departs from the British Transport typeface instead using the test Turas typeface. The design demonstrates that Irish placenames would be shown in Yellow on a blue motorway sign.|$|E
25|$|Since the incident, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management has {{installed}} additional numerous large {{signs on the}} approaches to Bear Camp Road, warning that the road may be impassable during winter months. Also, the <b>directional</b> <b>sign</b> ("To Gold Beach and Coast") {{at the spot where}} the Kims turned onto the wrong road, has been moved and replaced. At the spot, the through road is narrow and steeply uphill while the side road is much wider and more level and appears to be the proper continuation. The location and arrow direction on the old sign was confusing and ambiguous, especially in snow when {{it would be impossible to}} see that the narrow uphill road is the correct route while the wide level road is not.|$|E
2500|$|A rather {{informal}} distinction {{among the}} <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> {{is the one}} between advance <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> interchange <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> and reassurance <b>signs.</b> Advance <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> appear at a certain distance from the interchange, giving information for each direction. A number of countries do not give information for the road ahead (so-called [...] "pull-through" [...] signs), and only for the directions left and right. Advance <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> enable drivers to take precautions for the exit (e.g., switch lanes, double check whether this is the correct exit, slow down).|$|R
5000|$|A rather {{informal}} distinction {{among the}} <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> {{is the one}} between advance <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> interchange <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> and reassurance <b>signs.</b> Advance <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> appear at a certain distance from the interchange, giving information for each direction.

Advance <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> enable drivers to take precautions for the exit (e.g., switch lanes, double check whether this is the correct exit, slow down).They often do not appear on lesser roads, but are normally posted on expressways and motorways, as drivers would be missing exits without them. While each nation has its own system, the first approach sign for a motorway exit is mostly placed at least 1000 m from the actual interchange. After that sign, one or two additional advance <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> typically follow before the actual interchange itself.|$|R

25|$|This {{style of}} signage {{has become a}} common feature of many tourist images of Ireland and {{can be seen in}} some Irish pubs. However, they can be easily rotated, and have been done so on {{occasion}} and therefore are not completely reliable. While most examples of these signs still in situ are rural finger-posts, the advance <b>directional</b> <b>sign</b> of this era can still very occasionally be seen: this has a grey background, with the destinations in outlined, white-background boxes linked together with black lines, and the text is not raised on these, unlike on fingerposts. These signs, rare even when the system was in use, can be seen in some areas of DÃºn Laoghaire and Drogheda. These signs were prescribed under various regulations, with the final design prescribed under the Road Traffic Signs (Regulations) 1962.|$|E
500|$|Because the {{ordinance}} imposed content-based restrictions on free speech, Justice Thomas held that {{the ordinance}} would only be constitutional if it survived strict scrutiny. Assuming that the town's interests of preserving aesthetic appeal and traffic safety were compelling, he concluded that these were [...] "hopelessly underinclusive" [...] because the ordinance allowed for the proliferation of an unlimited number of larger, ideological signs that pose the same threats to aesthetics and traffic as directional signs. In fact, Justice Thomas suggested that a [...] "sharply worded" [...] ideological sign {{may be more likely}} to distract drivers than a <b>directional</b> <b>sign.</b> Justice Thomas also suggested that some directional signs [...] "may be essential, both for vehicles and pedestrians, to guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety". Therefore, Justice Thomas remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the Court's opinion.|$|E
