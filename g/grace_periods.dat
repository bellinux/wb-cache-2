5|$|The IFC makes {{loans to}} {{businesses}} and private projects generally with maturities of seven to twelve years. It determines a suitable repayment schedule and grace period for each loan individually to meet borrowers' currency and cash flow requirements. The IFC may provide longer-term loans or extend <b>grace</b> <b>periods</b> if a project is deemed to warrant it. Leasing companies and financial intermediaries may also receive {{loans from the}} IFC. Though loans have traditionally been denominated in hard currencies, the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local currencies. Its disbursement portfolio included loans denominated in 25 local currencies in 2010, and 45 local currencies in 2011, funded largely through swap markets. Local financial markets development is one of IFC’s strategic focus areas. In line with its AAA rating, it has strict concentration, liquidity, asset-liability and other policies. The IFC committed to approximately $5.7 billion in new loans in 2010, and $5 billion in 2011.|$|E
25|$|A credit card's {{grace period}} {{is the time}} the {{cardholder}} has to pay the balance before interest is assessed on the outstanding balance. <b>Grace</b> <b>periods</b> may vary, but usually range from 20 to 55 days {{depending on the type}} of credit card and the issuing bank. Some policies allow for reinstatement after certain conditions are met.|$|E

5000|$|Extensive {{changes were}} also {{made to the}} {{possibilities}} for the legal remedy of the failure to observe various time limits within the European patent system. Most particularly, the failure to pay various fees (filing fee, designation fee, search fee and examination fee) were, until the coming into force of the EPC 2000, excluded from the standard legal remedies of further processing [...] and re-establishment of rights. Under the EPC 1973, the failure to observe the time limits for paying these fees could only be remedied by strict <b>grace</b> <b>periods.</b> These <b>grace</b> <b>periods</b> have now {{been replaced by the}} application of further processing [...] and, if the further processing time limit is missed, re-establishment of rights, which although not directly applicable to the time limit missed originally, is applicable to the failure to observe the time limit for further processing.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{states have}} added an {{additional}} level of complexity to the interest calculation problem by providing {{what amounts to}} a front end interest free loan {{for a period of time}} after a payment falls due. Presumably, this [...] "grace period" [...] is given to allow for processing and accounting delays - these being the time taken when a payment is made through the Registry of a Court. Some states allow a 30-day <b>grace</b> <b>period,</b> a 31-day <b>grace</b> <b>period,</b> or a [...] "one-month" [...] <b>grace</b> <b>period.</b> Thus, a payment made within the <b>grace</b> <b>period</b> is treated as if paid on time.|$|R

25|$|Usually, if a {{cardholder}} is late {{paying the}} balance, finance charges will be calculated and the <b>grace</b> <b>period</b> does not apply. Finance charges incurred {{depend on the}} <b>grace</b> <b>period</b> and balance; with most credit cards there is no <b>grace</b> <b>period</b> {{if there is any}} outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions).

50|$|Related finance {{companies}} are not regulated as strictly as banks by the Federal Reserve, rather they are regulated by the Department of Financial Institutions or Department of Commerce on a State level depending on the State.

One method used to cause payment posting delays was to was to have customers submit payments by mail to a more distant payment center (such as having Ohio customers send their payments to a Arizona address instead of an address in Ohio or even Illinois) or intentionally understaff select payment centers so that it was not possible to process payments very quickly.|$|E
50|$|Consolidation loans have longer terms {{than other}} loans. Debtors can choose terms of 10 - 30 years. Although the monthly {{repayments}} are lower, {{the total amount}} paid over the term of the loan is higher than would be paid with other loans. The fixed interest rate is calculated as the weighted average of the interest rates of the loans being consolidated, assigning relative weights according to the amounts borrowed, rounded up to the nearest 0.125%, and capped at 8.25%. Some features of the original consolidated loans, such as postgraduation <b>grace</b> <b>periods</b> and special forgiveness circumstances, are not carried over into the consolidation loan, and consolidation loans are not universally suitable for all debtors.|$|E
