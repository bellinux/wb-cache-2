5|$|Because of its {{extensive}} ethnomedical tradition, the phytochemistry of P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the topic of several studies. Analysis of the plant's essential oil has identified over two dozen compounds, although the compounds detected and their relative prevalence have not been consistent. Most analyses have identified various monoterpenes and monoterpenoids as the dominant components, such as carene, eucalyptol, limonene, γ-terpinene, and (+)-β-thujone, although the essential oil of a sample from the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Torino had camphor as its most prevalent component. Other monoterpenes, camphene, α-pinene, and β-pinene are also present, as are sesquiterpenes such as γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, trans-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Several terpenoid alcohols—borneol, cedrol, and menthol—have been extracted from P.atriplicifolia, as have caffeic acid and <b>ferulic</b> <b>acid.</b> More complex compounds have been isolated, {{some of which were}} first identified in this manner, including perovskatone; the glycosides atriplisides A and B; and atricins A and B, a pair of triterpenes that are similar to oleanane.|$|E

25|$|Chlorogenic acids {{belong to}} a group of {{compounds}} known as phenolic acids, which are antioxidants. The content of chlorogenic acids in dried green coffee beans of robusta is 65mg/g and of arabica 140mg/g, depending on the timing of harvesting. At roasting temperature, more than 70% of chlorogenic acids are destroyed, leaving a residue less than 30mg/g in the roasted coffee bean. In contrast to green coffee, green tea contains an average of 85mg/g polyphenols. These chlorogenic acids could be a valuable, inexpensive source of antioxidants. Chlorogenic acids are homologous compounds comprising caffeic acid, <b>ferulic</b> <b>acid</b> and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid, which are connected by an ester bond to the hydroxyl groups of quinic acid. The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acid is more potent than of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or mannitol, which is a selective hydroxy-radical scavenger. Chlorogenic acids have a bitter taste in low concentrations such as 50mg/l water. At higher concentrations of 1g/l water, they have a sour taste. Chlorogenic acids increase the solubility of caffeine and are important modulators of taste.|$|E
25|$|The term matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization (MALDI) {{was coined}} in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These {{researchers found that}} the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed {{with this kind of}} “matrix”. The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used what they called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337nm nitrogen laser for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266nm laser. Further improvements were realized {{through the use of a}} 355nm laser and the cinnamic acid derivatives <b>ferulic</b> <b>acid,</b> caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.|$|E

In addition, we investigated the presence of salicylic and <b>ferulic</b> <b>acids,</b> two phenolic acids with pharmacological activity, whose presence in M. oleifera leaves has been scarcely investigated so far.

2500|$|While {{the exact}} route of {{vanillin}} biosynthesis in V. planifolia is currently unknown, several pathways are proposed for its biosynthesis. Vanillin biosynthesis is generally {{agreed to be}} part of the phenylpropanoid pathway starting with L-phenylalanine, which is deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to form t-cinnamic acid. The para position of the ring is then hydroxylated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H/P450) to create p-coumaric acid. Then, in the proposed ferulate pathway, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase (4CL) attaches p-coumaric acid to coenzyme A (CoA) to create p-coumaroyl CoA. Hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) then converts p-coumaroyl CoA to 4-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate. This subsequently undergoes oxidation by the P450 enzyme coumaroyl ester 3’-hydroxylase (C3’H/P450) to give caffeoyl shikimate/quinate. HCT then exchanges the shikimate/quinate for CoA to create caffeoyl CoA, and 4CL removes CoA to afford caffeic acid. Caffeic acid then undergoes methylation by caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) to give <b>ferulic</b> <b>acid.</b> Finally, vanillin synthase hydratase/lyase (vp/VAN) catalyzes hydration of the double bond in <b>ferulic</b> <b>acid</b> followed by a retro-aldol elimination to afford vanillin. Vanillin can also be produced from vanilla glycoside with the additional final step of deglycosylation. In the past p-hydroxybenzaldehyde was speculated to be a precursor for vanillin biosynthesis. However, recently it was demonstrated by radiolabelled precursor studies that [...] p-hydroxybenzaldehyde do not synthesis vanillin or vanillin glucoside in the vanilla orchids.|$|E
2500|$|In hens, {{tamarind}} {{has been}} found to lower cholesterol in their serum, and in the yolks of the eggs they laid. Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities.

40|$|Cinnamic {{acid and}} its {{hydroxylated}} derivatives (p-coumaric, caffeic, <b>ferulic</b> and sinapic <b>acids)</b> are known allelochemicals {{that affect the}} seed germination and root growth of many plant species. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} the reduction of root growth by these allelochemicals is associated with premature cell wall lignification. We hypothesized that an influx of these compounds into the phenylpropanoid pathway increases the lignin monomer content and reduces the root growth. To confirm this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, <b>ferulic</b> and sinapic <b>acids</b> on soybean root growth, lignin and the composition of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) monomers. To this end, three-day-old seedlings were cultivated in nutrient solution with or without allelochemical (or selective enzymatic inhibitors of the phenylpropanoid pathway) in a growth chamber for 24 h. In general, the results showed that 1) cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic and <b>ferulic</b> <b>acids</b> reduced root growth and increased lignin content; 2) cinnamic and p-coumaric acids increased p-hydroxyphenyl (H) monomer content, whereas p-coumaric, caffeic and <b>ferulic</b> <b>acids</b> increased guaiacyl (G) content, and sinapic acid increased sinapyl (S) content; 3) when applied in conjunction with piperonylic acid (PIP, an inhibitor of the cinnamate 4 -hydroxylase, C 4 H), cinnamic acid reduced H, G and S contents; and 4) when applied in conjunction with 3, 4 -(methylenedioxy) cinnamic acid (MDCA, an inhibitor of the 4 -coumarate:CoA ligase, 4 CL), p-coumaric acid reduced H, G and S contents, whereas caffeic, <b>ferulic</b> and sinapic <b>acids</b> reduced G and S contents.
