25|$|Fire: The <b>fire</b> <b>signs</b> are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. A native with mainly <b>fire</b> <b>signs</b> will be energetic, {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic, with {{a need to}} be {{in the center of the}} action making things happen. They can be egotistical, headstrong and sometimes arrogant, but also can be generous, warm-hearted, and spontaneously kind. Fire subjects are independent and prefer to have control over their own lives, but they can also be sometimes autocratic. A subject lacking <b>fire</b> <b>signs</b> will be fearful or over-cautious, pessimistic and shy, and will lack enthusiasm, confidence and faith in the future. Planets in the 1st, 5th and 9th houses and an emphasis on cardinal signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|R

50|$|The fire {{signs of}} Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are noted for their energy, enthusiasm and optimism.

Aries rising gives out a well-organized, slightly military bearing which makes them fit {{for any kind of}} military or civil service organization. Leo rising subjects have a dignified and rather formal manner which inspires confidence; while Sagittarius risers have a cheerful, pleasant and rather witty outer manner which suits all kinds of teaching, training and public speaking situations.|$|E

5000|$|Jupiter is in a {{feminine}} sign, while the Sun and Mars {{are both in}} masculine signs. Jupiter is also in a mutable water sign, while the Sun is in a cardinal air sign and Mars in a fixed <b>fire</b> <b>sign.</b> Jupiter shares neither duality, element, nor mode with the two planets that aspect it in quincunx. This complete lack of commonality of Jupiter with the two sextile planets illustrates how the yod triggers an irritating situation that can be overcome only through adaptation and discovering new paths. If {{there is no other}} aspect outlet for Jupiter (as would be reflected in a trine or sextile angle to another planet), a transiting planet in opposition to Jupiter and conjunct the midpoint of the sextile planets can trigger major life events which are difficult to handle and take great creativity to overcome. This is why the yod is often called the [...] "Finger of God", for it takes great initiative and fortitude to overcome the limitations created by the yod, but great rewards can result if the native does the necessary work.|$|E
