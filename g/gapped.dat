5|$|Again, the day's {{principal}} breakaway {{was given}} a large time gap. After , Andrey Amador, Davide Malacarne, Mathew Hayman, Fabian Wegmann and Jens Mouris had a lead of over 11 minutes. The parcours began to take its toll at this point, and as the chase ramped up in the peloton, the time gap fell precipitously. By the time the ascent of the Sasso Tetto began, Mouris was <b>gapped</b> off and lost {{more and more time}} as the day went on, eventually finishing 21 minutes behind the stage winner. Hayman and Wegmann kept the pace for a while, and Wegmann won the day's second climb, the Camerino at , but eventually only Amador and Malacarne were left out front. The second group on the road eventually reduced itself to just a select group of overall favorites and contenders. Amador attacked first on the finishing circuit, but Malacarne made the bridge. Instead of working together to stay away and let a two-up sprint decide the stage winner, Amador and Malacarne sat on one another's wheels and let their rapidly falling advantage dwindle even further. From the elite group of contenders, Pinotti put in an attack on an uphill section of the finishing circuit that effectively <b>gapped</b> off race leader Robert Gesink, who had used up all of his support riders at this point. Gesink finished 17 seconds back on the day, losing the race leadership.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. <b>Gapped</b> SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The <b>gapped</b> SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E

25|$|Garmin-Cervélo {{was again}} {{touted as a}} strong team for the season's second monument, the Tour of Flanders, with Hushovd perhaps seen as the strongest of the team's three leaders. Noted in the team's favor was the {{leadership}} of sporting director Peter Van Petegem, twice a winner of this race. On race day, Hammond made the day's first major breakaway group, one which stayed away over the first ten cobbled climbs. Hushovd effectively stayed {{at the front of}} the race most of the day, even chasing back on to the front after puncturing on the Taaienberg. However, attacks from the likes of Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara on the Leberg <b>gapped</b> him off to the point that he never was able to rejoin the front of the race. He finished with the second large group on the road, over four minutes down, in 54th place. Garmin-Cervélo had no riders factor into the race's finale; Farrar fared slightly better than Hushovd, leading the first large group across the finish line, but he was a minute and a half down in 12th place. Haussler was over eight minutes back, having never been a factor in the race. After yet another disappointing showing in a major spring classic, one post-race analysis suggested the team should no longer be considered favorites in single-day races.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that there have been some findings suggesting the possibility of crosstalk between <b>GAPs.</b> A recent study showed that the p120Ras <b>GAP</b> could bind the DLC1 Rho <b>GAP</b> at its catalytic domain.

50|$|The {{most widely}} used <b>gap</b> penalty {{function}} is the affine <b>gap</b> penalty. The affine <b>gap</b> penalty combines the components in both the constant and linear <b>gap</b> penalty, taking the form A+(B⋅L). This introduces new terms, A {{is known as the}} <b>gap</b> opening penalty, B the <b>gap</b> extension penalty and L the length of the <b>gap.</b> <b>Gap</b> opening refers to the cost required to open a <b>gap</b> of any length, and <b>gap</b> extension the cost to extend the length of an existing <b>gap</b> by 1. Often it is unclear as to what the values A and B should be as it differs according to purpose. In general, if the interest is to find closely related matches (e.g. removal of vector sequence during genome sequencing), a higher <b>gap</b> penalty should be used to reduce <b>gap</b> openings. On the other hand, <b>gap</b> penalty should be lowered when interested in finding a more distant match. The relationship between A and B also have an effect on <b>gap</b> size.

500|$|While the {{similarity}} in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet [...] may hold {{a clue to}} its name, [...] other factors may have been involved. During the late baroque era, composers such as Bach and Handel were making new demands on the skills of their trumpeters, who were often required to play difficult melodic passages in the high, or as {{it came to be}} called, clarion register. Since the trumpets of this time had no valves or pistons, melodic passages would often require the use of the highest part of the trumpet's range, where the harmonics were close enough together to produce scales of adjacent notes as opposed to the <b>gapped</b> scales or arpeggios of the lower register. The trumpet parts that required this speciality were known by the term clarino and this in turn came to apply to the musicians themselves. It is probable that the term clarinet may stem from the diminutive version of the 'clarion' or 'clarino' and {{it has been suggested that}} clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing particularly difficult passages on these newly developed [...] "mock trumpets".|$|E
500|$|At {{the first}} {{monument}} {{race of the}} season, Milan–San Remo, BMC {{was one of only}} two teams to have more than three riders present in the leading group on the road after a crash on the Le Manie climb [...] from the finish effectively split the field in two. With both teams lacking field sprinters, and with sprinters Tom Boonen, Alessandro Petacchi, and Heinrich Haussler surviving the split, BMC captain Ballan and 's Vincenzo Nibali struck a deal that they would each send men {{to the front of the}} lead group to help keep it away from the sprinters left behind in the second group, and dislodge the sprinters in the first group if possible. The tactic worked; with domestiques from both these teams, plus , pulling at the head of the leading group, they kept their lead through to the end of the race. Ballan, and Nibali, later figured into a crucial eight-rider selection that took place on the Poggio just a few kilometers from the end of the [...] day of racing. Those eight riders represented eight different teams, so no one had a teammate to perform a proper leadout. After Nibali, Gilbert, and 's Yoann Offredo opened up the sprint, Ballan was <b>gapped</b> off momentarily and could manage only fourth behind race winner Matthew Goss. Van Avermaet had also been with the first group after the split on Le Manie, and occupied first position on the road for the kilometers between the Cipressa and the descent from the Poggio, before he was caught by the select group of eight that finished together at the head of the race.|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} stage-concluding ascent to the hilltop town of Chieti truly began, world time trial {{champion}} Fabian Cancellara, Giovanni Visconti, Dmitriy Muravyev, and world road race champion Thor Hushovd tried a counter-move, but none could keep Cancellara's wheel, {{so they did}} not attain a meaningful advantage and were soon brought back. As the climb began, Michele Scarponi, Philippe Gilbert, Danilo Di Luca, and Damiano Cunego went on the attack and <b>gapped</b> off some of their rivals. Ivan Basso and Cadel Evans at first rode more conservatively, but did bridge back up. Scarponi was the strongest of the attackers, quickly surging {{to the front of}} the race. Gilbert and then Evans in succession tried to make their way up to him. Cunego marked each move and stayed in their slipstream, so that should the man he was following catch Scarponi, he would be fresher to attack and take victory for his team. Since his teammate was up the road, he did not help either in the chase. Scarponi faded toward the end but held on for victory by a few bike lengths. When it was clear that Scarponi would win the day, Cunego put in a finishing kick to take second place ahead of Evans, giving [...] the top two finishers on the day. Scarponi also won in Chieti in the 2010 Tirreno–Adriatico. The gruppetto containing the sprinters, including overnight race leader Tyler Farrar, was 17 minutes back, so there was a new leader after this stage. That was Robert Gesink, still well-placed because of 's win in the team time trial, but he had had his advantage narrowed by finishing 12 seconds back on this stage.|$|E

500|$|However, as {{the number}} of {{sequences}} increases and especially in genome-wide studies that involve many MSAs it is impossible to manually curate all alignments. Furthermore, manual curation is subjective. And finally, even the best expert cannot confidently align the more ambiguous cases of highly diverged sequences. In such cases it is common practice to use automatic procedures to exclude unreliably aligned regions from the MSA. For the purpose of phylogeny reconstruction (see below) the Gblocks program is widely used to remove alignment blocks suspect of low quality, according to various cutoffs on the number of <b>gapped</b> sequences in alignment columns. However, these criteria may excessively filter out regions with insertion/deletion events that may still be aligned reliably, and these regions might be desirable for other purposes such as detection of positive selection. A few alignment algorithms output site-specific scores that allow the selection of high-confidence regions. Such a service was first offered by the SOAP program, which tests the robustness of each column to perturbation in the parameters of the popular alignment program CLUSTALW. The T-Coffee program uses a library of alignments {{in the construction of the}} final MSA, and its output MSA is colored according to confidence scores that reflect the agreement between different alignments in the library regarding each aligned residue. [...] Its extension, [...] : (Transitive Consistency Score), uses T-Coffee libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Another alignment program that can output an MSA with confidence scores is FSA, which uses a statistical model that allows calculation of the uncertainty in the alignment. The HoT (Heads-Or-Tails) score can be used as a measure of site-specific alignment uncertainty due to the existence of multiple co-optimal solutions. The GUIDANCE program calculates a similar site-specific confidence measure based on the robustness of the alignment to uncertainty in the guide tree that is used in progressive alignment programs. An alternative, more statistically justified approach to assess alignment uncertainty is the use of probabilistic evolutionary models for joint estimation of phylogeny and alignment. A Bayesian approach allows calculation of posterior probabilities of estimated phylogeny and alignment, which is a measure of the confidence in these estimates. In this case, a posterior probability can be calculated for each site in the alignment. Such an approach was implemented in the program BAli-Phy.|$|E
