She argued that <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> access to at-home-care.

25|$|The son of rich parents, Clark was {{introduced}} to the fine arts at an early age. Among his early influences were the writings of John Ruskin, which instilled in him the belief that <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> access to great art. After coming {{under the influence of the}} connoisseur and dealer Bernard Berenson, Clark was appointed director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, when he was twenty-seven, and three years later he was put in charge of Britain's National Gallery. His twelve years there saw the gallery transformed to make it accessible and inviting to a wider public. During the Second World War, when the collection was taken away from London for safe keeping, Clark made the building available for a series of daily concerts which proved a celebrated morale booster during the Blitz.|$|E

Peng's family lived in a thatched-straw hut and owned approximately 1.5 acres of irrigated land, on which the family grew bamboo, sweet potatoes, tea, cotton, and various vegetables. His father also operated a bean curd shop. The income from the land and shop supported an extended family of eight people, including Peng, his three brothers, his parents, his grandmother, and a grand-uncle. Peng's grand-uncle had joined and fought for the Taiping rebellion, and used to tell Peng about the old Taiping ideals: that <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> enough food to eat, that women should not bind their feet, and that land should be redistributed equally. Peng later described his own class background as [...] "lower-middle peasant".|$|E

[...] They were in India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, where they took part in the Siege of Delhi. Once breaches had been made by the artillery by a bombardment of the walls, an attempt was made on the city on 14 September. The Kashmir Gate was blown by a party of engineers, accompanied by Bugler Robert Hawthorne of the 52nd, who won the Victoria Cross for his bravery. The 52nd led the assault on the blown gate; amidst the action, Lance Corporal Henry Smith also won the Victoria Cross. After six days of heavy fighting, the city was won.|$|E

The most dramatic moments of my life were crammed into a couple of years from the fall of 1941 to the end of 1943. They seem to symbolize my life...that was when the music of the dance bands was the most popular music in the country, and I was the most popular female band singer in the country and Harry had the most popular band in the country.

40|$|Part two {{describes}} {{the assessment process}} of the diagonals, including the front, back and homolateral structures. We discuss various positions for assessment including patients laying down on their back and side, sitting and standing. We also look at {{the use of the}} balance reaction test Statiek to assess the capability of both the diagonals and homolateral structures. This provides a greater understanding of what the diagonals can do, and what would be considered normal or abnormal as assessing both gives the examiner a greater appreciation of what to expect. We can use this practice to increase our awareness of what to observe and feel for, identifying some tips of where to place your hands to enable you to both apply pressure and feel for the amount of resistance the patient can apply in response. Subtle differences can be observed in patients depending on various individual characteristics they may have such as different leg lengths when comparing the left and right sides, or if somebody has a recognized problems within the structure and function of their backs. We begin to describe “trunk rules” as <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>has</b> the same reaction response when performing movements but these can present differently depending on the individuals level of mobility and selectivity. This article starts to briefly consider body scheme which is the perception of the body and its influence on the reaction of muscle patterns This perception can alter the overall function of the diagonals. In part three Pathology we will go more into developing the understanding of the impact that perception plays in the control and movement of diagonals. In the final section we move on to describing the trunk rules, discussing how both diagonals and the homolateral structures work in collaboration to help control and enable a greater range of movements of the trunk, and how this supports the keypoints of the great joints, identifying which movements are enabled and which are restricted...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. The {{research}} {{essay was}} an attempt to attend to the problems faced by foundation phase pupils on sanitation. This was to explore through in-depth interviews the pupils' sanitation experiences and facilities at home and those available at the schools, and to find whether they impact on the pupils' effective usage of these facilities at school. A conclusion was reached that it was found necessary to involve parents and the general communities in the education of pupils in order to improve their sanitation usage. This could be achieved through community education that addresses the needs of communities. This community education will keep communities abreast with the changing world. This will mean involving everyone in planning and designing the programmes relevant to the community needs. <b>Everyone</b> <b>should</b> see himself/herself <b>having</b> a role to play in bringing about changes {{that could lead to a}} better and healthier lifestyle...|$|R
