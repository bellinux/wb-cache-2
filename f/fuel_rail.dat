25|$|In March 2008, GM {{announced}} a recall on all 1997–2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) {{due to a}} problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM {{sent a letter to}} the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved. The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) valve cover gasket, as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty <b>fuel</b> <b>rail</b> quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.|$|E
25|$|Introduced at the 1993 New York Auto Show, {{the main}} {{changes for the}} P10 came as a midyear refresh in April 1993 (model year 1993.5), when dual airbags {{replaced}} motorized seatbelts, leather interiors came standard with power front seats, matte-black side moldings were replaced by body-colored ones, the refrigerant was converted from R12 to R134a, the audio system was upgraded to six speakers with a CD player instead of the previously-standard cassette deck, and other new options such as remote keyless entry were added. In February 1994, the 1994 model year was given a new larger chrome-plated grille and door handles, a lowport engine (replacing the original highport SR20DE, in which the intake plenum is below the fuel injectors and <b>fuel</b> <b>rail),</b> {{a change in the}} vehicle's self-diagnostic system to OBD-II, and larger 195/65R14 tires. The Touring models, introduced in February 1994, featured a limited-slip differential in the transmission; 195/65R14 Yokohama tires, sportier, more highly bolstered black leather front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats; fog lights; and a spoiler on the rear decklid.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{available}} engines used a Bosch Motronic fully electronic {{engine control}} unit (ECU), with cylinder bank selective knock control, dual-barrel throttle valve, lambda mixture control via intake air volume metering and exhaust gas temperature sensor, and required unleaded petrol.
