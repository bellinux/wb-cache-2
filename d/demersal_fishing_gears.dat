40|$|This {{project has}} been {{developed}} within {{the frame of the}} Nordic Action Plan 2000 - 2004 (Nord 1999 : 29) to review the status and threats of the natural and cultural heritage in Arctic waters. Two of the most commonly used <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gears</b> in the Arctic are the otter trawl and the scallop dredge. Detrimental effects of bottom gear towed over the seabed include incidental catch and direct mortality {{of a wide range of}} organisms and habitat alteration. Any three-dimensional fragile structures rising above the seabed, such as cold-water corals, sponges, geological formations and archaeological remains are easily destroyed. This report reviews the scallop and shrimp fisheries, the distribution and conservation of vulnerable habitats (coral reefs, sponge communities), the status of archaeological remains on the seabed and relevant legislation and the conservation measures and role of protected areas. In addition there are two case studies based on fisheries and survey data from Iceland and recommendations to improve the current situation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{conservation}} of deep-sea corals is of {{growing interest in}} the United States. A range of issues including biodiversity protection, {{conservation of}} seafloor habitats, {{and the role of}} deep-sea corals as essential fish habitat places greater significance on understanding the distributions of these corals and fishing activities. At the same time overfishing of some groundfish populations highlights the need for ecosystem-based management. Here we present records of habitat-forming deep-sea corals from the United States Pacific Fishery Management Council region that we analyze in relation to differential ecological impacts of <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gears.</b> We use an ecological footprint approach combining groundfish catch by gear type with a previously published ecological severity ranking of fishing gears. Deep-sea corals in the Isididae, Paragorgiidae, Primnoidae, Antipathidae and Stylasteriidae families are widespread throughout their depth ranges in the Northeast Pacific, although the scleractinian families Oculinidae and Caryophylliidae are relatively rare. In this qualitative analysis, we highlight areas of relatively high coral concentration such as the West Coast continental shelf break and Montere...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{widespread}} yet manageable pressures imposed on the seabed is that resulting from disturbance of the substrate by towed demersal fishing gear (bottom fishing and dredging). <b>Demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gears</b> are deployed on every continental shelf in the world and, in UK waters, the footprint of fishing is estimated to account for over 99 % of the known footprint of all human pressures on the seabed. It is, therefore, essential that current and future management of fishing activities are based on an improved scientific rationale {{in order to improve}} the long-term sustainability of this activity. While the impacts of demersal fishing on the biological characteristics of the seabed have been well-studied, the approaches have tended to focus on assessing impacts on the structural (e. g. changes in species composition, diversity, etc.) characteristics of seabed biological assemblages. However, it is being increasingly appreciated that observing changes solely in the structural attributes of benthic assemblages provides only a limited capacity to inform us of the implications for, arguably far more important, ecosystem function. The present study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by analysing data regarding the biological assemblages {{of a large number of}} stations covering a range of habitats across the European continental shelf. We perform this using a biological traits analysis (BTA) in which the assemblages, and the differences between them, are quantified by their relative differences in the morphological, behavioural and life history characteristics of their individuals, as opposed to their taxonomic (i. e., based on species identity) differences. This BTA approach affords the opportunity to understand the potential differences in ecological functioning due to fishing impacts, beyond that which would otherwise be possible from structural approaches. Traits data regarding the infauna (those organisms that live within the sediment) were available for 819 sampling stations, while for the epifauna (those living on the sediment), data for 1316 stations were analysed. BTA was undertaken on these two biological components independently. The infaunal stations were categorised into 13 EUNIS habitats (level 4) while the epifaunal data represented seven EUNIS (level 3) habitats. Additionally, the data for the infaunal stations were classed according to habitats that were derived following a k-means clustering approach of the environmental characteristics; this allowed an assessment (for the infauna) of the importance of using different habitat derivation methods for biological traits assessments over large spatial scales. Using data from relatively non-fished stations, fuzzy correspondence analysis (FCA), a multivariate analysis approach particularly suitable for traits data, revealed that traits composition of infaunal and epifaunal assemblages did not vary markedly between habitats. This result was generally observed for all 10 of the infaunal, and 12 of the epifaunal, traits examined. Moreover, the proportional compositions of the various biological traits showed a high amount of within-habitat variability, even in the absence of moderate or high fishing pressure. FCA was then used to allow an assessment of how biological trait compositions were related to total fishing pressure, both within and between habitats. The results suggested that the effects of fishing on trait compositions are complex; assemblages vary in their response both within and between habitats and, while some biological traits showed more-or-less consistent responses across habitats, others displayed varying relationships with fishing pressure across habitats. There is evidence to suggest that at least some of this habitat-specificity in response reflects differences in fishing gear, as opposed to differences in the inherent responses of the biological assemblages between habitats. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the impacts of fishing on the functional properties of seabed biological assemblages, and how the results presented here are to be used further within other work being conducted under Benthis...|$|E
5|$|Though little {{specific}} data are available, the Japanese sleeper ray {{is believed to}} be caught incidentally in shrimp trawls and other <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> throughout its range. It is not utilized economically; however, electric rays tend not to survive being caught and discarded, and shrimp trawling is known to have caused marked population declines in other electric ray species elsewhere. Given the high intensity of fishing activity off East Asia, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|R
5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and perhaps other <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> It is a potential bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|R
40|$|Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) {{can either}} protect all seabed {{habitats}} within them or discrete features.

In Lyme Bay, SW England a MPA excluded towed <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> from 206 km(2) to protect rocky reef habitats and the associated species. The site comprised a mosaic of sedimentary and reef habitats and so 'non reef' habitat also benefited from the MPA. Following 3 years protection, video data showed that sessile Reef Associated Species (RAS) had colonised sedimentary habitat indicating that 'reef' was present. This suggested that the functional extent of the reef was potentially greater than its visual boundary.

5|$|The {{electric}} {{shock of the}} common torpedo can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) {{to be used in}} medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches be treated by the application of a live torpedo to the affected area. The common torpedo is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear,</b> including bottom trawls and trammel nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. The common torpedo has been kept in aquariums, but requires live fish for food.|$|R
40|$|Marine Protected Areas MPA {{have been}} widely used over the last 2 decades to address human impacts on marine {{habitats}} within an ecosystem management context. Few studies have quantified recovery of temperate rocky reef communities following the cessation of scallop dredging or demersal trawling. This is critical information for the future management of these habitats to contribute towards conservation and fisheries targets. The Lyme Bay MPA, in south west UK, has excluded towed <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> from 206 km 2 of sensitive reef habitat using a Statutory Instrument since July 2008. To assess benthic recovery in this MPA we used a flying video array to survey macro epi-benthos annually from 2008 to 2011. 4 treatments (the New Closure, previously voluntarily Closed Controls and Near or Far Open to fishing Controls) were sampled to test a recovery hypothesis that was defined as ‘the New Closure becoming more similar to the Closed Controls and less similar to the Open Controls’. Following the cessation of towed <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing,</b> within three years positive responses were observed for species richness, total abundance, assemblage composition and seven of 13 indicator taxa. Definitive evidence of recovery was noted for species richness and three of the indicator taxa (Pentapora fascialis, Phallusia mammillata and Pecten maximus). While it is hoped that MPAs, which exclude anthropogenic disturbance, will allow functional restoration of goods and services provided by benthic communities, it is an unknown for temperate reef systems. Establishing the likely timescales for restoration is key to future marine management. We demonstrate the earl...|$|R

The Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) {{is the most important}} shellfish resource in UK waters and although the fishing effort has increased considerably over past decades the ecosystem effects of this fishery have yet to be evaluated. This study provides the first assessment of the catch and discard composition from Nephrops trawls in the Clyde Sea area with particular emphasis on invertebrate discards. Nephrops constituted only between 14 and 23 % of the total catch (volume); other invertebrates and fish accounted {{for the remainder of the}} catch. On an average, 9 kg of discards were produced per kilogram of Nephrops. The catch composition differed markedly between samples from the north and south Clyde Sea areas. Trawls from the south yielded a significantly higher biomass of Nephrops (30 % cf. 4 % in the north) and fish discards (55 % cf. 36 % in the north) whereas catches from the north contained more invertebrates (60 % cf. 15 % in the south). Crustaceans and echinoderms accounted for up to 83 and 73 % of the discards, respectively. Samples from the north also contained a greater variety of invertebrate species (93 taxa cf. 51 taxa in the south). The differences between the two study areas are likely to be a reflection of differing bathymetries, hydrographic conditions and ground types in each area...|$|R
40|$|Resting {{eggs are}} {{important}} phases {{in the life}} strategy of many coastal and estuarine copepods. The egg mortality in the sediment layers where they are buried, as well as re-suspension from the sediment into the water column where eggs may hatch are factors that affect {{the success of this}} life strategy. Considering that fishing effort in some coastal areas is high and trawling leads to re-suspension of the bottom sediments, {{it is important to understand}} these effects on the biology of organisms that utilize sediment habitats in part of their life cycle. This study examined the re-suspension and the hatching success of copepod resting eggs in the wake of two different <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> components (doors and discs) that are in contact with the seabed, in two areas off the coast of Scotland that are rarely worked by fishermen. Sediment cores were taken and analysed for resting eggs quantity and hatching performance and compared with samples taken in the water column right after re-suspension of sediment by the gear components. This study demonstrated for the first time that although eggs are re-suspended in the water column together with the sediment, providing them with the opportunity to hatch and recruit nauplii to the pelagic, egg viability was reduced by the passage of the gear components. This study also suggests that the viability is dependent on the gear component and accordingly potential effects must be considered for at this level.

40|$|The {{development}} and interannual variability of sublitoral soft bottom {{communities of the}} German Bight has been studied continuously at four representative permanent stations. A large interannual variability was combined with some changes on roughly decadal time scale. In accordance with large-scale system changes documented for the North Sea, also the composition of benthic communities changed since the late 1960 ies. Possible climatic, oceanographic and anthropogenic influences were evaluated by correlating the faunal development with environmental data. The community development at all stations showed clear correlations to the NAOI. The most dramatic changes followed the severe winters of 1970, 1979, 1986 and 1996, when reductions in species number and abundance were discernible at all stations. The shallower stations are characterised by larger interannual changes, and the situation following severe winters is not as clearly different from other years as {{it is at the}} deeper stations. The main factors affecting benthic community development are biotic interactions as well as climatic conditions, food supply and the disturbance regime. The most common forms of disturbances are extremely cold winters, hypoxia following algal blooms in stratified waters, and physical disturbance of the sediment by turbulent wave erosion during strong storms or by <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> A clear distinction between the effects of climate, eutrophication, pollution or bottom trawling is hardly possible, not only because various factors are predicted to produce similar effects, but also because the observed changes are a result of the synergistic effects of all factors.

This area is highly exploited {{by a number of}} mixed deep-water fisheries. Despite this there has been a lag in management of the area and an overall lack of knowledge of food web interactions. From examining previous literature and carrying out stable isotope analysis on a number of species, it became clear that there is a strong link between the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> population and surface production. Pervious studies have suggested there to be two main sources of food to the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> fauna. The first is via the exploitation of pelagic species on the slops exploitation of mesopelagic and benthopelagic prey species that overlap in depth range, or/and that carry out vertical /horizontal migrations. Carcase falls also fall within this first source of food to the deep-sea as they are a direct link to the surface. The second source of food is that of endemic benthic prey species, which appears to be less prominent in the fishes diet. A large number of <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> are seen to feed on a combination of these sources of food. Stable isotope analysis, appear to confirm the strong link between surface production and <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> as many fish are found with low SN 15 levels normally associated with feeding on pelagic species. The removal of commercial mesopelagic species found to be important prey species to the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> fauna, can have serious implications to the demersal food web and ultimately the management of deep-sea stocks. Issues relating to lack of a holistic approach in management and pollution concerns are mentioned. Keywords: U.
