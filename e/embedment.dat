We have already seen how its <b>embedment</b> in Proto-Indo-European society lies not just in its lexical reconstruction {{but also in the}} proliferation of personal names which contain [...] "horse" [...] as an element among the various Indo-European peoples. Furthermore, we witness the importance of the horse in Indo-European rituals and mythology. One of the most obvious examples is the recurrent depiction of twins such as the Indic Asvins [...] "horsemen," [...] the Greek horsemen Castor and Pollux, the legendary Anglo-Saxon settlers Horsa and Hengist [...] or the Irish twins of Macha, born after she had completed a horse race. All of these attest the existence of Indo-European divine twins associated with or represented by horses.|$|E
6000|$|The {{upper half}} of the cliff, to a {{thickness}} of about thirty feet, consists of Pampean mud, of which the lower part is pale-coloured, and {{the upper part of}} a brighter red, with some irregular layers of an arenaceous variety of tosca, and a few small concretions of the ordinary kind. Close above the marine limestone, there is a thin stratum with a concretionary outline of white hard tosca-rock or marl, which may be considered either as the uppermost bed of the inferior deposits, or the lowest of the Pampean formation; at one time I considered this bed as marking a passage between the two formations: but I have since become convinced that I was deceived on this point. In the section on the Parana, I did not find any mammiferous remains; but at two miles distance on the A. Tapas (a tributary of the Conchitas), they were extremely numerous in a low cliff of red Pampean mud with small concretions, precisely like the upper bed on the Parana. Most of the bones were solitary and much decayed; but I saw the dermal armour of a gigantic Edental quadruped, forming a caldron-like hollow, four or five feet in diameter, out of which, as I was informed, the almost entire skeleton had been lately removed. I found single teeth of the Mastodon Andium, Toxodon Platensis, and Equus curvidens, near to each other. As this latter tooth approaches closely to that of the common horse, I paid particular attention to its true <b>embedment,</b> for I did not at that time know that there was a similar tooth hidden in the matrix with the other mammiferous remains from Punta Alta. It is an interesting circumstance, that Professor Owen finds that the teeth of this horse approach more closely in their peculiar curvature to a fossil specimen brought by Mr. Lyell from North America, than to those of any other species of Equus.

60|$|Geographical Range; Habitats.--The Pedunculated Cirripedes extend {{over the}} whole world; {{and most of the}} {{individual}} species have large ranges, more especially, as might have been expected, those attached to floating objects; excepting these latter, the greater number inhabit the warmer temperate, and tropical seas. Of those attached to fixed objects, or to littoral animals, it is rare to find more than three or four species in the same locality. On the shores of Europe I know of only three, viz., a Scalpellum, Pollicipes, and Alepas. At Madeira (owing to the admirable researches of the Rev. R. T. Lowe), two Pæcilasmas, a Dichelaspis, and an Oxynaspis are known. In New Zealand, there are two Pollicipes and an Alepas, and, perhaps, a fourth form. From the Philippine Archipelago, in the great collection made by Mr. Cuming, there are a Pæcilasma, an Ibla, a Scalpellum, Pollicipes, and Lithotrya. Of all the Lepadidæ, nearly half are attached to floating objects, or to animals which are able to change their positions; the other half are generally attached to fixed organic or inorganic bodies, and more frequently to the former than to the latter. Most of the species of Scalpellum are inhabitants of deep water; on the other hand, most of Pollicipes,[21] of Ibla, and Lithotrya are littoral forms. The species of Lithotrya have the power of excavating burrows in calcareous rocks, shells, and corals; and the singular manner in which this is effected, is described under that genus. Anelasma has its sub-globular peduncle deeply embedded in the flesh of Northern Sharks; and I have seen instances of the basal end of the peduncle of Conchoderma aurita, being sunk into the skin of Cetacea; in the same way the point of the peduncle in the male of Ibla, is generally deeply embedded in the sack of the female. I believe in all these cases, the cementing substance affects and injures the corium or true skin of the animal on which the creature is parasitic, whilst the surrounding parts, being not injured, continue to grow upwards, thus causing the partial <b>embedment</b> of the Cirripede. In the case of Anelasma, we have growth {{at the end of the}} peduncle, and consequently downward pressure, and this may possibly cause absorption to take place in the skin of the shark at the spot pressed on.|$|E

40|$|To {{relieve the}} axial stress induce rature {{high-pressure}} pipelines in deepwater, current design methods leave the pipe unburied {{and allow the}} formation of the lateral buckles along the pipeline in a controlled manner. However, this approach requires {{a better understanding of the}} interaction between the seabed soil and the partially embedded pipeline under both vertical and lateral movements. Research has been carried out to examine the two soil-pipe interaction mechanisms, vertical pipe penetration and lateral pipe movement, involved in the installation and operation of an on-bottom offshore pipeline. The findings reported in this thesis improve the current knowledge of pipe-soil interaction in clay. A series of physical model tests was conducted to investigate the behaviour of pipe penetration and lateral pipe movement in clay. The experiments were carried out using short pipe sections in a I g model tank equipped with a transparent Perspex window in the front panel, from which high quality images were obtained for the measurement of the soil deformation in the tests using an image analysis technique. The computational limit analysis, Discontinuity Layout Optimisation (DLO), was adopted to back-analyse and compare with the experimental results. In addition, parametric studies were conducted using DLO to investigate the effects of the change in soil geometry and soil condition on the pipe resistances and soil flow mechanisms for the vertical pipe penetration and the lateral pipe sweep processes. Experimental results showed that pipe penetration, prior to the fully embedded flow-around failure mechanism at very deep penetrations, involves four distinct stages in development of the failure mechanism from 'soil heave' to 'local flow-around' at shallow and deep pipe <b>embedments,</b> respectively. Good agreement was observed between the experimental and numerical results. The results of the parametric studies suggested that the onset depth of the fully embedded flow-around failure mechanism is strongly dependent on the undrained strength profile and tensile strength of the soil. The lateral resistance of a partially embedded pipe under different loading conditions was measured at both small and large lateral displacements. Results showed that the lateral resistance is strongly affected by the change in soil geometry, soil heave induced by the initial penetration and formation of the active berm in front of the pipe during lateral movements. Based on the results from the numerical and experimental studies, design equations are proposed for the predictions of (i) the pipe penetration resistance at both shallow and deep <b>embedments,</b> and (ii) the lateral resistance of a partially embedded pipe under combined vertical and horizontal loads at both small and large lateral displacements.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that work-hardening plasticity theory provides a suitable framework for interpreting and predicting the load-displacement behaviour of rigid shallow foundations under combined vertical, moment and horizontal loading. Most previous work has, however, been restricted to footings on granular soils. This paper describes a series of laboratory tests conducted at unit gravity using a small circular footing and specimens of reconstituted kaolin. The results indicate that work-hardening plasticity concepts can also be applied to the modelling of shallow foundation behaviour on undrained clay. The footing shape chosen for the experiments is representative of the 'spudcan' foundations which support the legs of jack-up drilling platforms. A novel testing apparatus allows independent control of the vertical, rotational and horizontal footing displacements within a single vertical plane. Tests conducted at constant vertical penetration are used to investigate the shape and size of the combined load yield surface at <b>embedments</b> ranging from 0 to 1 · 6 footing diameters. Tests under vertical load control provide further information about the yield surface, and are used to assess the suitability of an associated flow rule for predicting plastic footing displacements. The yield surface shape determined experimentally is compared with that implied by the general bearing capacity formula of Brinch Hansen, and some significant discrepancies are highlighted...|$|R
60|$|The {{origin and}} manner of {{formation}} of the thick beds of gravel, sandy clay, volcanic detritus, and calcareous tuff, composing these basin-like plains, is very important; because, as we shall presently show, they send arms or fringes far up the main valleys of the Cordillera. Many of the inhabitants believe that these plains were once occupied by lakes, suddenly drained; but I conceive {{that the number of}} the separate breaches at nearly the same level in the mountains surrounding them quite precludes this idea. Had not such distinguished naturalists as MM. Meyen and Gay stated their belief that these deposits were left by great debacles rushing down from the Cordillera, I should not have noticed a view, which appears to me from many reasons improbable in the highest degree--namely, from the vast accumulation of WELL-ROUNDED PEBBLES--their frequent stratification with layers of sand--the overlying beds of calcareous tuff--this same substance coating and uniting the fragments of rock on the hummocks in the plain of Santiago--and lastly even from the worn, rounded, and much denuded state of these hummocks, and of the headlands which project from the surrounding mountains. On the other hand, these several circumstances, as well as the continuous union of the basins {{at the foot of the}} Cordillera, with the great plain of the Rio Rapel which still retains the marks of sea-action at various levels, and their general similarity in form and composition with the many plains near the coast, which are either similarly marked or are strewed with upraised marine remains, fully convince me that the mountains bounding these basin-plains were breached, their islet-like projecting rocks worn, and the loose stratified detritus forming their now level surfaces deposited, by the sea, as the land slowly emerged. It is hardly possible to state too strongly the perfect resemblance in outline between these basin-like, long, and narrow plains of Chile (especially when in the early morning the mists hanging low represented water), and the creeks and fiords now intersecting the southern and western shores of the continent. We can on this view of the sea, when the land stood lower, having long and tranquilly occupied the spaces between the mountain-ranges, understand how the boundaries of the separate basins were breached in more than one place; for we see that this is the general character of the inland bays and channels of Tierra del Fuego; we there, also, see in the sawing action of the tides, which flow with great force in the cross channels, a power sufficient to keep the breaches open as the land emerged. We can further see that the waves would naturally leave the smooth bottom of each great bay or channel, as it became slowly converted into land, gently inclined to as many points as there were mouths, through which the sea finally retreated, thus forming so many watersheds, without any marked ridges, on a nearly level surface. The absence of marine remains in these high inland plains cannot be properly adduced as an objection to their marine origin: for we may conclude, from shells not being found in the great shingle beds of Patagonia, though copiously strewed on their surfaces, and from many other analogous facts, that such deposits are eminently unfavourable for the <b>embedment</b> of such remains; and with respect to shells not being found strewed on the surface of these basin-like plains, it was shown in the last chapter that remains thus exposed in time decay and disappear.|$|E

40|$|Size {{effect is}} studied here with {{reference}} to the bonding of short, deformed bars, embedded in normal-strength concrete (NSC) and high-performance concrete (HPC). Tests on 48 cylindrical specimens reinforced with a single bar and subjected to a pull-out or push-in force show that bond exhibits a strong size effect, which is well described by Bazant's general-type size-effect law. Four diameters are considered (db = 5, 12, 18, and 26 mm), with bonded length-to-bar diameter ratios equal to 3. 5 (HPC) and 5 (NSC). All specimens are highly confined by means of a steel jacket to prevent or control cover splitting and to investigate bond behavior in highly confined conditions. Test results on short, anchored bars were instrumental in working out the local bond stress-slip law, taking into account size effect, which appears in the formulation of the maximum bond stress through the bar diameter. Short <b>embedments</b> also prevented bar yielding. The proposed local bond stress-slip law (1) is formulated {{as an extension of the}} law suggested in European Model Code MC 90, also including some later proposals; (2) fits quite well with the available test data on short, well-confined anchored bars; (3) introduces the favorable effects that the confining reinforcement (generally consisting of stirrups and longitudinal bars) has on bond strength; and (4) may be easily introduced into a design code...|$|R
40|$|The {{build-up}} of pipe-soil {{resistance that}} can be mobilized on a seabed pipeline, particularly in the axial direction, is affected by consolidation of the seabed beneath the pipeline after it is laid. On fine-grained soils the consolidation period may extend well beyond the laying period, and involve a significant gain in pipe-soil resistance: a process analogous to the set-up of piles driven in clay. The available level of pipe-soil resistance affects many aspects of pipeline design, such as stability on route curves and down slopes, geohazard vulnerability, lateral buckling and axial walking behaviour. This paper considers consolidation around on-bottom pipelines through a numerical study, supported by field data. The soil is modeled as an elastic material with coupled Biot consolidation. Pipe <b>embedments</b> of up to 0. 5 diameters have been considered {{and the effect of}} soil berms adjacent to the pipe, formed of the displaced soil, has been explored. The solutions and guidance provided in this paper allow pipeline designers to estimate the 'set-up' periods over which the effective stress at the pipe-soil interface will rise in the period after laying, indicating the build-up of available axial pipe-soil resistance. The results account for the enhancement of this resistance through a 'wedging' action. The dissipation process is retarded by a factor of up to 2 if the displaced soil forms a berm that is collapsed against the pipe wall. Similar solutions for the analogous situation of consolidation ('set-up') around driven piles have existed for many years. This paper provides the equivalent design tool for on-bottom pipelines.

40|$|Steel {{catenary}} risers (SCR) {{are widely}} used in deepwater oil and gas production. Due to environmental loading the riser {{may be subject to}} six degrees of motion; however, in the touchdown zone (TDZ), the vertical penetration into the seabed and uplift are two of the main components. The riser-seabed-water interaction near the touchdown zone {{is one of the main}} concerns in fatigue life design of SCR. During upward displacement, suction develops under the riser and a trench might be formed when it separates from the seabed near the touchdown point (TDP). In subsequent downward movement, the riser penetrates through this trench to the seabed. Therefore, modeling of suction and trench formation is very important. In most of the existing models these factors are incorporated using empirical relationships. It is also recognized that the available finite element (FE) modeling techniques for this large deformation problem are computationally very expensive, although the penetration resistance can be simulated. In the present study, numerical modeling of riser-seabed-water interaction at the TDZ is conducted using ANSYS CFX software to evaluate the response of the riser during its penetration and uplift. A new model for undrained shear strength of soft clay is proposed that is applicable to a wide range of shear strain rates. The models for the effects of strain rate and strength degradation on undrained shear strength are incorporated properly in ANSYS CFX and simulations are performed for one penetration-uplift cycle. The CFX model developed in this study using the subdomain approach is computationally very efficient. It is found that the suction under the riser is the main source of uplift resistance for shallow <b>embedments.</b> The parametric study shows that the maximum uplift resistance and depth of trench depend on uplift velocity and undrained shear strength of clay...|$|R

40|$|The {{intensity}} of negotiations, including war and Peace Talks, {{are driven by}} the threat of identity disintegration. Sri Lanka negotiates to preserve territorial integrity. Tamils argue for secession to preserve their identity. How is each to adapt their identity so that they can peacefully co-exist within the island? The current peace process began in 2002. The principles of Organizational Cybernetics show distinction is warranted between External Self-Determination (secession) and Internal Self-Determination (a single sovereignty recognised by the international community) as the negotiating systems occupy different recursive positions relative to each other. In each context, the systems gravitate differently towards cohesion and autonomy. Equally vital is to distinguish between systems, their <b>embedments</b> and their representatives. Diagnosis of the peace process seeking an internal self-determination solution does not display these distinctions. At the 2002 Peace Talks the only system permitted to negotiate with Sri Lanka (the encompassing system) was confined to one of the embedded systems (the Tamils as represented by the LTTE). Structurally this risked the encompassing system collapsing to represent its missing embedded systems. To rectify this Team Syntegrity is proposed, whose sequence of design in its multiple cascades enables representation issues to be resolved without it being confined to political parties. Content solutions are matters for Sri Lankans to design. However, they are considered in order to design and propose a ‘process’ solution. The journey this thesis takes is to arrive at designing the ‘how’ of negotiations so that it can accommodate the myriad of ‘what’ needs to be negotiated. A meta-level logic is required to resolve the undecidable proposition of preserving territorial integrity or secession. Working with the levels of recursion - the UN, the State and its embedded systems, this thesis proposes a way to absorb residual variety to gain agreement to negotiate internal self-determination based on interlocking negotiations involving those seeking cohesion and those seeking autonomy. This process also opens the way to address the solution design of the other interacting crises afflicting Sri Lanka. The uniqueness and contribution of this research is that {{it is the first time}} Organizational Cybernetics has been conceptually applied to diagnose and design a peace process involving a sovereign State.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for in-service structural health monitoring has stimulated efforts to integrate self and environmental sensing capabilities into materials and structures. The present work is directed towards {{the development of}} a new means of fabricating composites that allows for integrating a high density of small, advanced sensors into a laminated composite in a way that enables sensing without compromising the structural integrity of the host composite material. This work presents efforts to develop structural composite materials which include networks of embedded sensors with decision-making capabilities that extend the functionality of the composite materials to be information-aware. These structurally-integrated embedded microsensors render the composite information-based, so that it can monitor and report on the local structural environment, on request or in real-time as necessary. The integration of sensors, actuators, and their subsequent devices into a structure is vital in smart applications. Essential to the application of smart composites is the issue of the mechanical coupling of the sensor to the host composite material. Therefore, the question of the impact of such devices on the various mechanical properties of the host composite material is both relevant and important. This work characterizes the effects of introducing simulated microsensors, commonly used printed circuit board material (G- 10 /FR 4 Garolite), and various piezo thin film sensors on the mechanical properties of the host structural composite material. Quasi-static tension tests are conducted in order to characterize the mechanical properties of the host composite material as well as the effects the <b>embedments</b> have upon the host material. Quasi- static three-point bending (short-beam shear) and fatigue three-point bending (short-beam shear) tests are conducted in order to characterize the effects of introducing the sensors and such devices on the short-beam shear strength and fatigue life of the host structural composite material. Furthermore, various embedding configurations are examined. The thrust of the research presented here is to characterize the effects of embedding sensors and their subsequent devices on the mechanical properties of the host structural composite material in order to select a sensor and embedding configuration that can seamlessly be integrated into the host composite without compromising the integrity of the structur...|$|R
