Long speculates that Patterson riveted or glued these parts to the suit, but offers {{no evidence to support}} this <b>idea.</b> <b>If</b> Patterson had done so, he must have done it before Heironimus did his test fitting and walk (because Heironimus describes a three-piece suit—head, torso, and legs, omitting separate {{hands and feet}})—i.e., without adjusting their location to his dimensions. And Heironimus never described being measured beforehand.|$|E
500|$|Forman recounted {{this memory}} to fellow film enthusiasts and colleagues Ivan Passer and Jaroslav Papousek {{and asked them}} if {{it might be the}} basis for a good film. [...] "Maybe", replied Passer, [...] "but it still needs one more thing – a billiards table." [...] The trio had a passion for billiards and felt that they could make a success of even the weakest <b>idea</b> <b>if</b> they had ready access to a table. Having found a good one at Dobříš Castle, the three, along with Václav Sasek, wrote a {{screenplay}} that fleshed out Forman's encounter with the young woman from Varnsdorf.|$|E

[...] After Live Another Day {{received}} highly positive reception, a new idea for the feature film surfaced in September 2014, spearheaded by Grazer. In January 2016, Sutherland stated that he has [...] "no <b>idea</b> <b>if</b> the 24 movie will ever happen, or Jack Bauer might end up finding his way into an episode one day and clarifying all of that, or ending all of that." [...] This was in reference to concluding his character's story arc in a future iteration of the franchise.|$|E

[...] Hale uses the expression 'Science Diplomacy' in this context, which he says it's possible he coined. [...] "The sky looks the same from Iran as it does from here in the US.

500|$|Jones, who {{had always}} envisaged herself playing Rachel Bailey when {{the idea of the}} project came in to mind, was given the role, though at the programme's {{pre-production}} stages the character had a different first name, Cathy. It was originally intended that Lindsay would star with Jones in Scott & Bailey, but she became pregnant with twins, so the role of Janet was given to Lesley Sharp instead; Lindsay received the smaller role of Rachel's sister, Alison. Lindsay approved of Sharp playing the role; Jones also felt pleased at the prospect of working with Sharp, saying [...] "I was really excited {{on the day of the}} read-through". Sharp's husband Nicholas Gleaves was awarded the role of Scott's lover, DS Andy Roper. Despite the actors' relationship, Sharp stated that it was not a contributing factor in his casting, stating: [...] "Nick's an actor and I'm an actress— we don't have the same agent. There's a script with a role in it that was right for him and it so happened that there was a role that was right for me and we both got cast, but it wasn't a conversation that we had that it would be a good <b>idea</b> <b>if</b> we did a television series together because that's not the way life works".|$|E

500|$|Television {{critics were}} {{polarized}} with [...] "Elementary School Musical". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'C+' grade. Although he expressed satisfaction towards {{many aspects of}} the episode, such as the character development of Lisa Simpson, VanDerWerff criticized the songs performed in the episode. In response to the appearance of Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of the Flight of the Conchords, he stated: [...] "I have no <b>idea</b> <b>if</b> the writers wrote new songs for the two guys in Flight of the Conchords to sing [...] but the songs they sang were pretty weak." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was critical of the guest appearances of Michele, Riley, and Monteith, and stated: [...] "Bringing in the Glee kids to sing a take on [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] that was, frankly, awful mostly just felt like an attempt to have guest stars in nothing parts so they could be promoted. In contrast, Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt that the [...] "Elementary School Musical" [...] was an enjoyable start to the twenty-second season of the series, and retorted that the appearances of Clement and McKenzie was the highlight of the episode. Similarly, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic wrote, [...] "We actually loved Bret and Jemaine doing what they do best last night: playing characterized versions of themselves. [...] Unlike the Glee kids, our favorite duo from New Zealand were given decent songs and some pretty great lines." [...] Hochberger gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E

2500|$|Tom Francis of PC Gamer criticized how {{the player}} {{was forced to}} work with the Illusive Man and Cerberus in Mass Effect 2, saying that it was an {{interesting}} <b>idea</b> <b>if</b> an option, but [...] "it's just frustrating" [...] if the player was forced to do it.

Some critics suggested that Clarkson's appearance would turn a somber occasion of national mourning into a [...] "giant promotional opportunity". [...] Kelly Clarkson herself considered withdrawing from the commemoration, saying [...] "I think it is a bad <b>idea</b> ... <b>If</b> anybody thinks I'm trying to market anything, well, that's awful."

[...] An Environment Canterbury commissioned discussion paper (Sinclair Knight Merz: The Future of Public Transport in Christchurch Discussion Paper, June 2004) concluded that priority should be given to bus-based public transport, but that future planning should include provision for other public transport options. [...] A report commissioned in 2005 by Environment Canterbury from consultants GHD Limited (Network Level Investigative Report - Proposed Introduction of Commuter Rail Services to Christchurch City and Environs, June 2005) suggested that commuter rail would involve substantial costs and further investigation would be needed to determine what the requirements are.|$|E

And if not now, when?" [...] (Avot 1:14) This third question, from which the album's title is derived, contains the admonition not to postpone any duties. It also echoes the admonition he gives with reference to study (Avot 2:4): [...] "Say not, 'When I have free time I shall study'; for you may perhaps never have any free time." ...|$|E

NY gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino (R) noted: [...] "The vast majority of New Yorkers and Americans have rejected their <b>idea.</b> <b>If</b> a bridge was their intent, why jam it down our throats?
