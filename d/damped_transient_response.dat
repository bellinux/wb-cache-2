40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method is}} presented for {{the solution of}} the <b>damped</b> <b>transient</b> <b>response</b> of tall, slender structures such as towers and telecommunications masts. Mainframe computer packages for structural dynamics are complex to use and often prohibitively expensive. An analysis developed for 'desktop' computers, with an animated display of the response, is shown to be efficient and cost-effective. A time integration procedure and spatially discrete structural idealisation are used, and the performance of the resultant algorithms is investigated and optimised. Pressure loading and base excitation are considered in detail, both as idealised functions and as digitized 'real' data. It is shown that the interaction of different excitation functions can significantly affect the response. A novel form of idealised base restraint facilitates the simulation of various support and excitation conditions. Structural damping is shown to be important, although the conventional viscous damping approach is unsatisfactory for the transient analysis of built-up structures. Several material damping algorithms are examined, a modified 'stiffness proportional' approach being identified as most suitable, and an expression is derived for support damping. The complex nature of energy dissipation mechanisms in structural connections leads to a reliance upon an empirically derived 'interface damping' term. A bolted flange is considered, and a series of static hysteresis and free vibration tests yield useful structural damping data. A power law is shown to adequately describe the relationship between the interface energy loss and the local stress amplitude. A transient test rig capable of decelerations up to 30 g was designed and used to study the response of jointed and unjointed models. Transient recording and digital filtering techniques yielded high quality data, enabling meaningful comparisons to be made with corresponding numerical simulations - an aspect neglected by other workers. As a consequence, the semi-empirical damping algorithms are shown to give adequate practical response predictions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a new auto-tuning method of PID {{controller}} is proposed. It combines: modelling of the closed-loop system, modelling of the process, and tuning formulas {{in terms of}} the relative <b>damping</b> of the <b>transient</b> <b>response</b> to setpoint changes. So that is possible a greater range of specifications in the system response and to provide formulas of estimation and tuning which could be useful in other strategies. The method has been tested in simulation and in real time with SIMULINK. The method produces the best performance with respect to other methods for process with dominant dead time, which are considered the most difficult ones to control. Copyrigh © 2000 IFA...|$|R
40|$|Microgrid is an {{effective}} way to integrate the distributed energy resources into the utility networks. One of the most important issues is the power flow control of grid-connected voltage-source inverter in microgrid. In this paper, the small-signal model of the power flow control for the grid-connected inverter is established, from which it can be observed that the conventional power flow control may suffer from the poor <b>damping</b> and slow <b>transient</b> <b>response.</b> While the new power flow control can mitigate these problems without affecting the steady-state power flow regulation. Results of continuous-domain simulations in MATLAB and digital control experiments based on a 32 -bit fixed-point TMS 320 F 2812 DSP are in good agreement, which verify the small signal model analysis and effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|A {{first order}} in {{frequency}} theory is {{developed for the}} aerodynamic loads on a harmonically oscillating thin wing of finite aspect ratio in a subsonic compressible flow. The downwash {{in the vicinity of}} a horizontal tail behind such a wing is also evaluated to the same order in frequency. The results are then used to determine the stability derivatives of a conventional-type airplane and to set up the stick-free longitudinal equations of motion including the unsteady flow effects. An important conclusion of this study is that, within the limitations of a "lifting-strip" theory, the airloads on the oscillating finite span wing are linear in frequency in the neighborhood of zero frequency. This is in contrast with the two-dimensional results which show a logarithmic singularity there. As an example of a practical application, calculations are made of the frequency, <b>damping</b> and <b>transient</b> <b>responses</b> of the stick-free longitudinal motion of an F- 80 A airplane and the results compared with those obtained using quasisteady aerodynamic coefficients. The indications are that, while nonsteady flow considerations show considerable influence upon the control surface motion, they have a negligibly small effect upon the airplane motion...|$|R

A dynamically similar wing was used to measure frequency and <b>damping</b> ratio from <b>transient</b> <b>response</b> data in the linear aerodynamic regime and the results were compared to quasi-steady and unsteady aerodynamic theory. It was found that at high trim angles of attack, in the nonlinear aerodynamic regime, stall flutter oscillations occurred with typical amplitudes ranging from 15 to 20 deg. Wing control tab deflection was effective in initiating and terminating stall flutter but variations in configuration or operating conditions did not greatly influence the occurrence of characteristics of the oscillations...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with investigating the difference in response between a three-ply elastic plate of infinite lateral extent and a similar plate in which the core elastic layer {{is replaced by a}} layer of viscoelastic <b>damping</b> material. The <b>transient</b> <b>response</b> of the plate to an impulsive loading is governed by the dispersion equations for infinite trains of harmonic waves propagating under traction free conditions on the plate surfaces (see e. g. Achenbach [1]). These dispersion equations express the wavelength and the damping factor as functions of the frequency and they possess an infinite set of roots, corresponding to different modes of wave motion. In addition to their relevance to the impulsive loading problem, the dispersion curves of the various modes, have a significance for the experimental determination of the properties of laminates by ultrasonic techniques (see e. g. Mal and Bar Cohen [2]) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Nano force sensors {{based on}} passive {{diamagnetic}} levitation with a macroscopic seismic mass are a possible alternative to classical Atomic Force Microscopes when the force bandwidth {{to be measured}} {{is limited to a}} few Hertz. When an external unknown force is applied to the levitating seismic mass, this one acts as a transducer that converts this unknown input into a displacement that is the measured output signal. Because the little <b>damped</b> and long <b>transient</b> <b>response</b> of this kind of macroscopic transducer can not be neglected, it is then necessary to deconvolve the output to correctly estimate the unknown input force. The deconvolution approach proposed in {{this article is based on}} a Kalman filter that use an uncertain a priori model to represent the unknown nanoforce to be estimated. The main advantage of this approach is that the end-user can directly control the unavoidable trade-off that exists between the wished resolution on the estimatedforce and the response time of the estimation.

40|$|Two new multi-layered plate bending {{elements}} (DKT/CST and DKT/LST) {{are developed}} {{based on a}} combination of the three model Discrete Kirchhoff theory (DKT) triangular plate bending element, the three model constant strain triangle (CST) and the six noded linear strain triangle (LST). Both frequency independent and frequency dependent damping of viscoelastic materials are considered. An iterative complex eigensolver is used to compute the natural frequencies and model loss factors. Several bench mark problems are solved using these new multi-layer plate elements. As the plate bending elements previously developed on the basis of Kirchhoff's theory are inadequate for thick plate analysis, several quadrilateral Mindlin plate bending elements are developed to study the behaviour of Mindlin plates. The plate bending elements based on Mindlin theory require shear correction factors in their formulations. Hence two new Co assumed strain finite element formulations of a refined third order theory which does not require shear correction factors, are developed and used to analyse isotropic, orthotropic, and layered anisotropic composite and sandwich plates under free vibration, <b>damping</b> and <b>transient</b> loading conditions. Parametric effects of plate aspect ratio, length to thickness ratio, degree of orthotropy, number of layers and lamination scheme on the natural frequencies (free vibration), model loss factors (<b>damping)</b> and dynamic (<b>transient)</b> <b>responses</b> have been shown. The results presented in this investigation could be useful in better understanding the behaviour of sandwich laminates under dynamic conditions and potentially beneficial for designers of sandwich structures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel lightning search algorithm (LSA) using quantum mechanics theories {{to generate a}} quantum-inspired LSA (QLSA). The QLSA improves the searching of each step leader to obtain the best position for a projectile. To evaluate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the QLSA is tested using eighteen benchmark functions with various characteristics. The QLSA is applied to improve {{the design of the}} fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for controlling the speed response of the induction motor drive. The proposed algorithm avoids the exhaustive conventional trial-and-error procedure for obtaining membership functions (MFs). The generated adaptive input and output MFs are implemented in the fuzzy speed controller design to formulate the objective functions. Mean absolute error (MAE) of the rotor speed is the objective function of optimization controller. An optimal QLSA-based FLC (QLSAF) optimization controller is employed to tune and minimize the MAE, thereby improving the performance of the induction motor with the change in speed and mechanical load. To validate the performance of the developed controller, the results obtained with the QLSAF are compared to the results obtained with LSA, the backtracking search algorithm (BSA), the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the proportional integral derivative controllers (PID), respectively. Results show that the QLASF outperforms the other control methods in all of the tested cases in terms of <b>damping</b> capability and <b>transient</b> <b>response</b> under different mechanical loads and speeds...|$|R
