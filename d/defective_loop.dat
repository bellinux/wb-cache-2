40|$|We have {{isolated}} mutants of the pi initiator protein of the plasmid R 6 K {{that are}} <b>defective</b> in DNA <b>looping</b> in vitro but retain their normal DNA binding {{affinity for the}} primary binding sites (iterons) at the gamma origin/enhancer. One such <b>looping</b> <b>defective</b> mutant called R 6 {{was determined to be}} a proline to leucine change at position 46 near the N terminus of the pi protein. Using a set of genetic assays that discriminate between the activation of the gamma origin/enhancer from those of the distantly located alpha and beta origins, we show that the <b>looping</b> <b>defective</b> initiator protein fails to activate the alpha and beta origins but derepresses initiation from the normally silent gamma origin in vivo. The results conclusively prove that DNA looping is required to activate distant replication origins located at distances of up to 3 kb from the replication enhancer...|$|R
40|$|Apurinic/apyrimidinic {{endonuclease}} 1, a {{key enzyme}} in repairing abasic sites in DNA, is an embryonic lethal in mice. We are examining {{its role in}} embryogenesis in zebra fish. Zebra fish contain two genomic copies (zfAPEX 1 a and zfAPEX 1 b) with identical coding sequences. zfAPEX 1 b lacks introns. Recombinant protein (ZAP 1) is highly homologous with and has the same enzymatic properties as its human orthologue. ZAP 1 is highly expressed throughout development. Embryos microinjected with morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) targeting the translation start site die at approximately the midblastula transition (MBT) without apoptosis. They are rescued with mRNA for human wild-type APEX 1 but not for APEX 1 encoding endonuclease-defective protein. Rescued embryos develop dysmorphic hearts, pericardial edema, few erythrocytes, small eyes, and abnormal notochords. Although the hearts in rescued embryos form <b>defective</b> <b>loops</b> ranging from no loop to one that is abnormally shaped, cardiac myosin (cmlc 2) is present and contraction occurs. Embryos microinjected with MO targeting zfAPEX 1 a intron-exon junctions also pass the MBT with similar abnormalities. We conclude that AP endonuclease 1 is involved in both repairing DNA and regulating specific early stages of embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|Mice {{lacking the}} zinc finger {{transcription}} factor specificity protein 3 (Sp 3) die prenatally in the C 57 BL/ 6 background. To elucidate {{the cause of}} mortality we analyzed the potential role of Sp 3 in embryonic heart development. Sp 3 null hearts display <b>defective</b> <b>looping</b> at embryonic day 10. 5 (E 10. 5), and at E 14. 5 the Sp 3 null mutants have developed a range of severe cardiac malformations. In an attempt to position Sp 3 in the cardiac developmental hierarchy, we analyzed the expression patterns of > 15 marker genes in Sp 3 null hearts. Expression of cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (Carp) was downregulated prematurely after E 12. 5, while expression of the other marker genes was not affected. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Sp 3 is bound to the Carp promoter region in vivo. Microarray analysis indicates that small-molecule metabolism and cell-cell interactions are the most significantly affected biological processes in E 12. 5 Sp 3 null myocardium. Since the epicardium showed distension from the myocardium, we studied expression of Wt 1, a marker for epicardial cells. Wt 1 expression was diminished in epicardium-derived cells in the myocardium of Sp 3 null hearts. We conclude that Sp 3 is required for normal cardiac development and suggest {{that it has a}} crucial role in myocardial differentiation. Copyrigh...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} polygonal Markov fields originally {{introduced by}} Arak and Surgailis (1989). Our {{attention is focused}} on fields with nodes of order two, which can be regarded as continuum ensembles of non-intersecting contours in the plane, sharing a number of features with the two-dimensional Ising model. We introduce non-homogeneous version of polygonal fields in anisotropic enviroment. For these fields we provide a class of new graphical constructions and random dynamics. These include a generalised dynamic representation, generalised and <b>defective</b> disagreement <b>loop</b> dynamics as well as a generalised contour birth and death dynamics. Next, we use these constructions as tools to obtain new exact results on the geometry of higher order correlations of polygonal Markov fields in their consistent regime. Comment: 54 page...|$|R
40|$|DiGeorge {{syndrome}} (DGS) is {{the most}} common microdeletion syndrome, and is characterized by congenital cardiac, craniofacial and immune system abnormalities. The cardiac defects in DGS patients include conotruncal and ventricular septal defects. Although the etiology of DGS is critically regulated by TBX 1 gene, the molecular pathways underpinning TBX 1 's role in heart development are not fully understood. In this study, we characterized heart defects and downstream signaling in the zebrafish tbx 1 (-/-) mutant, which has craniofacial and immune defects similar to DGS patients. We show that tbx 1 (-/-) mutants have <b>defective</b> heart <b>looping,</b> morphology and function. <b>Defective</b> heart <b>looping</b> is accompanied by failure of cardiomyocytes to differentiate normally and failure to change shape from isotropic to anisotropic morphology in the outer curvatures of the heart. This is the first demonstration of tbx 1 's role in regulating heart looping, cardiomyocyte shape and differentiation, and may explain how Tbx 1 regulates conotruncal development in humans. Next we elucidated tbx 1 's molecular signaling pathway guided by the cardiac phenotype of tbx 1 (-/-) mutants. We show {{for the first time that}} wnt 11 r (wnt 11 related), a member of the non-canonical Wnt pathway, and its downstream effector gene alcama (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule a) regulate heart looping and differentiation similarly to tbx 1. Expression of both wnt 11 r and alcama are downregulated in tbx 1 (-/-) mutants. In addition, both wnt 11 r (-/-) mutants and alcama morphants have heart looping and differentiation defects similar to tbx 1 (-/-) mutants. Strikingly, heart looping and differentiation in tbx 1 (-/-) mutants can be partially rescued by ectopic expression of wnt 11 r or alcama, supporting a model whereby heart looping and differentiation are regulated by tbx 1 in a linear pathway through wnt 11 r and alcama. This is the first study linking tbx 1 and non-canonical Wnt signaling and extends our understanding of DGS and heart development...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRetinoic acid, {{the active}} vitamin A derivative, has {{pleiotropic}} functions during vertebrate development and postnatal life. Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH 2) {{acts as the}} main retinoic acid-synthesizing enzyme during development. Mouse Raldh 2 germline null mutants are early embryonic lethal and exhibit complex abnormalities that include <b>defective</b> heart <b>looping</b> morphogenesis. To investigate later functions of this enzyme, we have engineered a "floxed" (loxP-flanked) allele allowing Cre-mediated somatic gene inactivations. Mice heterozygous or homozygous for the floxed Raldh 2 allele are viable and fertile. We tested whether the novel Raldh 2 allele behaves as a null mutation after Cre-mediated in vivo excision by crossing the conditional mutants with CMV-Cre transgenic mice. An embryonic lethal phenotype indistinguishable from that of germline mutants was obtained. The conditional allele described herein is a genetic tool for studying tissue-specific, RALDH 2 -dependent functions of retinoic acid during development and in adult life...|$|R
40|$|Endocytosis entails {{selective}} packaging of cell-surface proteins, such as receptors for cyto-kines and adhesion components, in cytoplasmic vesicles (endosomes). The {{series of}} sorting events that determines {{the fate of}} internalized proteins, either degradation in lysosomes or recycling back to the plasmamembrane, relies on intrinsic sequencemotifs, posttranslation-al modifications (e. g., phosphorylation and ubiquitination), and transient assemblies of both Rab GTPases and phosphoinositide-binding proteins. This multicomponent process is en-hanced and skewed in cancer cells; we review mechanisms enabling both major drivers of cancer, p 53 and Ras, to bias recycling of integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Likewise, cadherins and other junctional proteins of cancer cells are constantly removed from the cell surface, thereby disrupting tissue polarity and instigating motile phenotypes. Mutant forms of RTKs able to evade Cbl-mediated ubiquitination, along with overexpression of the wild-type forms {{and a variety of}} <b>defective</b> feedback regulatory <b>loops,</b> are frequently detected in tumors. Finally, we describe pharmacological attempts to harness the peculiar endocytic system of cancer, in favor of effective patient treatment. Cancer cells are fundamentallysimilar to theirnormal counterparts. Their differences li...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Schizophrenia {{patients}} {{suffer from}} a variety of motor symptoms, including parkinsonism, catatonia, neurological soft signs, abnormal involuntary movements and psychomotor slowing. Methods: Literature review of prevalence rates and presentation of own results. Results: Parkinsonism and abnormal involuntary movements are intrinsic to schizophrenia, but may also be evoked by antipsychotic treatment. Reduced motor activity is associated with negative symptoms, catatonia and psychomotor slowing. Furthermore, 40 % of schizophrenia patients are impaired in gesture performance, which is related to executive and basic motor function. Mild motor disturbances are found in the majority of patients, while severe dysfunctions are limited to a minority. Our neuroimaging studies suggest that hypokinesia is caused by <b>defective</b> cortico-subcortical motor <b>loops</b> in schizophrenia. Taken together, a dimensional approach to schizophrenia motor symptoms seems promising. A purely descriptive assessment of motor signs is preferred over theoryladen categorization. Using objective motor parameters allows finding neural correlates of abnormal motor behaviour. Conclusion: The motor dimension of schizophrenia is linked to distinct disturbances in the cerebral motor system. Targeted modification of the defective motor system might become a relevant treatment option in patients suffering from schizophrenia with predominant motor features...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRodent incisors {{are capable}} of growing {{continuously}} and the renewal of dental epithelium giving rise to enamel-forming ameloblasts and dental mesenchyme giving rise to dentin-forming odontoblasts and pulp cells is achieved by stem cells residing at their proximal ends. Although the dental epithelial stem cell niche (cervical loop) is well characterized, {{little is known about}} the dental mesenchymal stem cell niche. Ring 1 a/b are the core Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC 1) components that have recently also been found in a protein complex with BcoR (Bcl- 6 interacting corepressor) and Fbxl 10. During mouse incisor development, we found that genes encoding members of the PRC 1 complex are strongly expressed in the incisor apical mesenchyme in an area that contains the cells with the highest proliferation rate in the tooth pulp, consistent with a location for transit amplifying cells. Analysis of Ring 1 a−/−;Ring 1 bcko/cko mice showed that loss of Ring 1 a/b postnatally results in <b>defective</b> cervical <b>loops</b> and disturbances of enamel and dentin formation in continuously growing incisors. To further characterize the defect found in Ring 1 a−/−;Ring 1 bcko/cko mice, we demonstrated that cell proliferation is dramatically reduced in the apical mesenchyme and cervical loop epithelium of Ring 1 a−/−;Ring 1 bcko/cko incisors in comparison to Ring 1 a−/−;Ring 1 bfl/fl cre- incisors. Fgf signaling and downstream targets that have been previously shown to be important in the maintenance of the dental epithelial stem cell compartment in the cervical loop are downregulated in Ring 1 a−/−;Ring 1 bcko/cko incisors. In addition, expression of other genes of the PRC 1 complex is also altered. We also identified an essential postnatal requirement for Ring 1 proteins in molar root formation. These results show that the PRC 1 complex regulates the transit amplifying cell compartment of the dental mesenchymal stem cell niche and cell differentiation in developing mouse incisors and is required for molar root formation...|$|R
40|$|GATA factors orchestrate {{hematopoiesis}} via multistep transcriptional mechanisms, but the interrelationships {{and importance}} of individual steps are poorly understood. Using complementation analysis with GATA- 1 -null cells and mice containing a hypomorphic allele of the chromatin remodeler BRG 1, we dissected the pathway from GATA- 1 binding to cofactor recruitment, chromatin loop formation, and transcriptional activation. Analysis of GATA- 1 -mediated activation of the �-globin locus, in which GATA- 1 assembles dispersed complexes at the promoters and the distal locus control region (LCR), revealed molecular intermediates, including GATA- 1 -independent and GATA- 1 -containing LCR subcomplexes, both <b>defective</b> in promoting <b>loop</b> formation. An additional intermediate consisted of an apparently normal LCR complex and a promoter complex with reduced levels of total RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and Pol II phosphorylated at serine 5 of the carboxy-terminal domain. Reduced BRG 1 activity solely compromised Pol II and serine 5 -phosphorylated Pol II occupancy at the promoter, phenocopying the LCR-deleted mouse. These studies defined a hierarchical order of GATA- 1 -triggered events at a complex locus and establish a novel mechanism of long-range gene regulation. Transcriptional networks involving coordinated actions of numerous regulatory factors ensure high-fidelity cellular differentiation and organogenesis. In the context of hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|HAND 1 {{is a basic}} helix-loop-helix (bHLH) {{transcription}} factor essential for mammalian heart development. Absence of Hand 1 in mice results in embryonal lethality, {{as well as in}} a wide spectrum of cardiac abnormalities including failed cardiac <b>looping,</b> <b>defective</b> chamber septation and impaired ventricular development. Therefore, Hand 1 is a strong candidate for the many cardiac malformations observed in human congenital heart disease (CHD). Recently, we identified a loss-of-function frameshift mutation (p. A 126 fs) in the bHLH domain of HAND 1 frequent in hypoplastic hearts. This finding prompted us to continue our search for HAND 1 gene mutations in a different cohort of malformed hearts affected primarily by septation defects. Indeed, in tissue samples of septal defects, we detected 32 sequence alterations leading to amino acid change, of which 12 are in the bHLH domain of HAND 1. Interestingly, 10 sequence alterations, such as p. L 28 H and p. L 138 P, had been identified earlier in hypoplastic hearts, but the frequent p. A 126 fs mutation was absent except in one aborted case with VSD and outflow tract abnormalities. Functional studies in yeast and mammalian cells enabled translation of sequence alterations to HAND 1 transcriptional activity, which was reduced or abolished by certain mutations, notably p. L 138 P. Our results suggest that HAND 1 may also be affected in septation defects of the human hearts, and thus has a broader role in human heart development and CHD...|$|R
40|$|Crude oil {{has been}} shown to cause defects in {{cardiovascular}} development in a variety of teleost species. We used the zebrafish, Danio rerio as a model to test the effects of oil and dispersant on cardiac development and function during early embryogenesis. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand the effects of crude oil and chemical dispersant exposure on the gross anatomy and cellular morphology of cardiac development using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. This work was carried out through a histological examination of the phenotypic defects in cardiac development induced by exposure of embryonic zebrafish to crude oil and chemical dispersant. Embryonic exposure to Macondo crude oil and chemical dispersant at 150 - 250 ppm causes teratogenic effects in cardiac development of zebrafish embryos with phenotypic abberations in form and function evident as early as 48 hpf. Developmental effects on cardiac development include a change in chamber morphology and positioning, coupled with a reduction of cardiac function; leading to cardiac stasis and embryonic death. Specifically, there is progressive yolk sac and cardiac edema, <b>defective</b> and reduced <b>looping</b> of the cardiac chambers, alteration in chamber morphology and positioning, reduction of cardiac function and circulation, and even a reduction in size of the eye and otic vesicle. These results provide a basis for further investigation of the toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic mechanisms through which exposure to crude oil and dispersant cause developmental toxicity. In addition, integrating the results of this study with gene expression profiles obtained from genome-wide transcriptomics at comparable time points promotes the formulation of future hypotheses aiming to more thoroughly understanding the pathways and genetic mechanisms though which PAH toxicity affects the zebrafish heart. Understanding the nature and mechanisms of oil exposure is especially critical for assessing toxicity of PAH contaminated environment.   M. S...|$|R
40|$|End-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) is a devastating {{condition}} {{that can only}} be treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation. ESRD treatment costs account for up to 10 % of healthcare budgets in the Western world. The 5 -year survival for patients in dialysis is only about 40 %. Glomerular disease processes are the main cause of ESRD. Despite this, our basic knowledge on the biology and disease processes of the glomerulus is poor. As a result, we still lack effective therapy options to stop the progression of glomerular diseases. In this thesis we have identified a number of candidate genes and proteins that could have an essential role in the glomerular homeostasis. In the first project, we identified a group of neural proteins, Hip 1, Nfasc and Olfml 2, which are enriched in podocytes. We used these markers to provide further evidence that podocytes are present in glomerular crescent lesions that occur in inflammatory diseases of the glomerulus. In project 2, we studied the functional role of another neural protein, dendrin, in the kidney by generating and characterizing a knockout (KO) mouse line. Previously, we and others have shown that dendrin is very specific to podocytes and interacts with cd 2 ap and nephrin, two podocyte proteins imperative for the maintenance of the kidney barrier. The KO mouse model showed that dendrin is not needed for the development or maintenance of the glomerulus filtration barrier. Furthermore, the outcome of glomerular disease in two injury models was unaffected by the absence of dendrin. This suggests that dendrin does not have a {{role in the development of}} glomerular damage in these two models. In project 3, we identified Tmem 234, Slfn 5, Lrrc 49 and Znf 185 as highly podocyte-enriched molecules. Morpholino knockdown experiments in zebrafish showed that the silencing of Tmem 234 results in podocyte foot effacement and proteinuria in pronephros. Thus, Tmem 234 seems to have an important role in the formation of functional filtration barrier in zebrafish pronephros, and therefore it is reasonable to speculate that it can have also an important role in the mammalian kidney. Lastly, in project 4 we identified a mediator protein subunit, Med 22, to be essential for the kidney filtration barrier. In zebrafish pronephros, Med 22 morphants exhibit <b>defective</b> capillary <b>loop</b> formation and leak large proteins to tubuli. In mice, full KO mice die during embryonic development. In podocyte-specific KO animals kidney development proceeds normally. However, these mice exhibit proteinuria starting from 8 weeks of age that progresses to ESRD by 16 weeks of age. Histological analysis shows the accumulation of caveolin-positive vesicles in the cytoplasm of podocytes. As these vesicles became larger, we detected the loss of podocytes that leads to glomerulosclerosis and ESRD. Thus, Med 22 seems to regulate vesicular trafficking in podocytes and be essential for podocyte survival. This thesis provides novel insights into podocyte biology and obviously opens up new possibilities to study these candidate genes in glomerular function and pathology...|$|R
40|$|Gene looping, {{defined as}} the {{interaction}} of the promoter and the terminator regions of a gene during transcription, is emerging as an important gene regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes. The role of promoter bound general transcription factors during initiation is well established. However, recent studies have revealed that some initiation factors also interact with the 32 ̆ 7 end of a gene. The biological role of initiation factors at the 32 ̆ 7 end of a gene is unknown. The general transcription factors TFIIB and TFIIH have been found to interact genetically with Ssu 72, a component of CPF 32 ̆ 7 end processing complex. Accordingly, we found that TFIIB and TFIIH localize to the distal ends of genes in a transcription dependent manner. TFIIB localization at the terminator region during transcription requires a functional CF 1 complex. TFIIB physically interacts with the all subunits of the CF 1 complex in an activator dependent manner. TFIIH also interacts with the CF 1 and CPF 32 ̆ 7 end processing complexes in a manner depending on its kinase activity. Employing affinity chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation, we show that TFIIB associates with poly(A) polymerase and the CF 1 complex in yeast cells to form a holo-TFIIB complex. This complex was resistant to MNase digestion and brief exposure to high salt. The sedimentation coefficient of the holo-TFIIB complex was intermediate between that of TFIIH and TFIID. Initiation factors which remain bound on a promoter scaffold in vitro, were not found in a holo-TFIIB complex with termination factors. The holo-TFIIB complex was observed only in the looping competent strains, but not in the <b>looping</b> <b>defective</b> sua 7 - 1 strain. We further show that in sua 7 - 1 cells, where a holo-TFIIB complex is not formed, the kinetics of activated transcription is altered. These results strongly suggest a role for TFIIB in termination of transcription. Similarly, the kinase dependent presence of TFIIH at the 32 ̆ 7 end of genes suggested a role for the factor in termination. Accordingly, we show that RNAP II read through the termination signal in the absence of Kin 28 kinase activity. Furthermore, the recruitment of CF 1 and CPF subunits at the 32 ̆ 7 end of a gene is impaired in the TFIIH kinase defective mutant. We propose that initiation factors are in contact with the terminator during gene looping and play an active role in transcription termination...|$|R
