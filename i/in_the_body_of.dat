5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is intended to}} analyze <b>the</b> repetition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> text <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements. The objectives of this research are: first, to describe what types of repetitions are used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> text <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements. Second, {{to find out which}} repetition is most often used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> text <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements. Third, to find out why certain repetition is most often used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> text <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements. This is a qualitative research. Therefore, it uses descriptive method with the theories of repetition proposed by Halliday and Hasan (1976), Renkema (1993), Hoey (1991) and Halliday (1994), the theories of discourse proposed by Halliday (1985), Renkema (1993) and Nunan (1993), and the theories of advertisement proposed by Cook (1992) and Moi (1997). At the end of the analyses the writer found that <b>the</b> repetitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> text <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements are classified into simple repetition and complex repetition. Simple repetition is the most dominant types of repetition that used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> text <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements because the use <b>of</b> simple repetition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> text <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements is very important to make the readers or consumers understand and remember the name of the products or brands and the USAge of products. It also makes the relationship between <b>the</b> sentences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> text <b>of</b> shampoo advertisement clear and more communicative...|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> {{expressive}} {{power of}} disjunctive rules involving default negation is analyzed within a framework based on polynomial, faithful and modular (PFM) translations. The analysis {{is restricted to}} the stable semantics of disjunctive logic programs. A particular interest is understanding what is the effect if default negation is allowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heads of disjunctive rules. It is established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paper that occurrences of default negation can {{be removed from the}} heads of rules using a PFM translation when default negation is allowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> rules. <b>In</b> this case, we may conclude that default negation appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heads of rules does not affect expressive power of rules. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case that default negation may not be used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> rules, such a PFM translation is no longer possible. Moreover, there is no PFM translation for removing default negation from <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> rules. Consequently, disjunctive logic programs with default negation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> rules are strictly more expressive than those without...|$|R

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E

Going to an amusement park to buy some concert tickers at Kumiko's request, the protagonist is attacked by demons and saved by Kyouji Kuzunoha, a Summoner belonging to an ancient clan dedicated to protecting Japan from supernatural threats. Shortly after leaving him, Kuzunoha dies under mysterious circumstances. Shortly after this, the protagonist is attacked by a Dark Summoner named Sid Davis.

5|$|Heavy metals are {{generally}} defined as metals with relatively high densities, atomic weights, or atomic numbers. The criteria used, and whether metalloids are included, {{vary depending on}} the author and context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour. More specific definitions have been published, but none of these have been widely accepted. The definitions surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements; only mercury, lead and bismuth meet all of them. Despite this lack of agreement, the term (plural or singular) is widely used in science. A density of more than 5g/cm3 is sometimes quoted as a commonly used criterion and is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> this article.|$|E
5|$|His {{building}} projects were concentrated in Edinburgh, where, from 1637, {{he served as}} principal master mason to the city. For ten years {{he was involved in}} the construction of the Tron Kirk on the High Street, which opened in 1647. The Tron was built to house the congregation of St Giles', which had been raised to cathedral status, and was laid out in the new T-plan form with the pulpit in the centre, to suit reformed worship. The design was informed by contemporary Dutch architecture and, in particular, by the work of Hendrick de Keyser whose Architectura Moderna showcased his church designs in the Netherlands. Mylne worked on the building with master wright John Scott who was responsible for the timber work. The building was executed in a Dutch influenced style with both gothic and classical details. The church was not fully complete before Mylne's death and was subsequently remodelled in the 18th century. A new spire was added in the 19th century following a fire, but Mylne's work can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the kirk. The carved tympanum was executed by Mylne's brother Alexander.|$|E

The research results show that the accumulation <b>of</b> proline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> Populus euphratica {{is closely related}} to the change of groundwater level gradient under drought stress, it increases with the drawdown of groundwater level and the increase of moisture stress degree; the accumulation <b>of</b> proline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> Populus euphratica has two extremely high points at the groundwater depth ranges of 3. 64 - 5. 14 m and 9. 46 - 10. 16 m.

The stress groundwater depth for the normal growth and the critical one for the survival of Populus euphratica are below 4. 5 m and 9 - 10 m respectively at the lower reaches of the Tarim River...|$|R

5|$|Many ligand {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> a multicellular organism.

5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements are used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
