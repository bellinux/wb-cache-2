The NEWTON project intends to replace the existing ceramic hermetic packaging by a novel non-hermetic polymer packaging for high power semiconductors (thyristors). Polymer electrical packaging material candidates have been identified by reverse engineering, by literature review and by using Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) software. The potential materials identified are polyimide (PI), polyetherimide (PEl), liquid crystal polymers (LCP), poly (phenylene sulphide) (PPS), and epoxy (EP). In addition, two design options (ceramic replacement and over moulded) were selected, out of four, based on all the known issues and the requirements. PEl, PI, LCP, PPS and EP were the selected materials for the ceramic replacement design option and PEl, PI and EP for the over-mould design option. Ceramic replacement option was ranked as the best choice {{on the basis of}} the device stability during injection moulding. After a data survey of different producers, a few specific grades for candidate materials were selected. Polymer packaging has to overcome certain identified issues such as non-hermeticity (moisture absorption and transmission), high thermal expansion, voids and micro-voids, weldlines, stress, aging etc., which could be the potential reasons for the device failure. Coatings could also be a good solution to avoid failure due to nonhermeticity. Electrical degradation and breakdown in polymers was facilitated by moisture absorption and transmission, ionic impurities, ionizing radiations, oxidation, poorly dispersed antioxidants, micro-structure defects, aging and low tensile strength etc. A computer generated component model, designed on the ceramic replacement option, was analysed through Moldflow software. The wall shear stress values were compared with the recommended values. The thickness of the model was increased until the wall shear stress values reached just near the recommended values for all the analysed materials. Hence, two models A and 8 were selected for further in depth analysis using pin point tunnel gates. Moldflow results were compared for both models (A and B) and for all the materials. This showed that the PI material and the model A were the best choices. Finally, the candidate materials were quantitatively compared based by reverse engineering, CES materials selection, literature review, electrical degradation, nonhermeticity and Moldflow results. The PI material was the final choice, followed by PEl, PPS, and LCP. Injection moulding was identified as the best processing method. The package quality had to be improved by combined approach of part design, MoldFiow simulation, mould design and controlled processing (plasticising, filling, cooling etc.). Therefore, after 1 the selection of the model 'A', it was further optimised by reducing the fin sizes. This new model was named as 'C' and was further analysed using a <b>disc</b> <b>gate.</b> The parameters and the dimensions of the sprue and the <b>disc</b> <b>gate</b> were selected and optimised based on the Moldflow results. A cooling process phase was designed based on the documented cooling principles. The Moldflow results showed that the designed cooling system was efficient and sufficient. Finally, based on the Moldflow results using a <b>disc</b> <b>gate,</b> a mould has been designed for the polyimide material and the model 'C'...|$|E

40|$|The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, {{is funding}} the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in {{performing}} research investigating {{the performance of}} gate valves subjected to pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. Pressure locking and thermal binding are phenomena that make a closed gate valve difficult to open. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause {{the pressure of the}} fluid in the bonnet (and, in most gate valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. Thermal binding can occur when thermal expansion/contraction effects cause the disc to be squeezed between the valve body seats. If the loads associated with pressure locking or thermal binding are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The authors tested a flexible-wedge gate valve and a double-disc gate valve under pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. The results show that these valves are susceptible to pressure locking; however, they are not significantly affected by thermal binding. For the flexible-wedge gate valve, pressure locking loads (in terms of stem thrust) were higher than corresponding hydrostatic opening loads by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 5. For the parallel <b>disc</b> <b>gate</b> valve, pressure locking loads were higher by a factor of 2. 05 to 2. 4. The results also show that seat leakage affects the bonnet pressurization rate when the valve is subjected to thermally induced pressure locking conditions...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at the {{fundamental}} understanding of all-optical signal processinggates based on semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), for their low-powerconsumption operation in ultrafast frequency region. In particular, modeling of thefrequency-dependent electric power consumption in the SOA and suppression of severalkinds of output waveform degradations in the ultrafast wavelength conversionare discussed in detail. After the introduction in Chapter 1, we present a power consumption model ofan SOA gate in Chapter 2, to clarify its dependence on the operation frequency Band other fundamental parameters. The carrier density dynamics in the SOA wasmodeled using a rate equation with three different carrier-conversion efficiencies ofthe SOA which we introduced as the dominant factors. The validity of this rateequation model was tested with measured characteristics of custom-designed SOAsamples with different structures. Using the model, we predicted that the powerconsumption increase with B 2 in the high frequency limit. This B 2 -dependence wasexperimentally demonstrated for two different SOA samples in the frequency rangeof 20 100 GHz. We expect that this initial model {{will contribute to the}} designingof SOA power consumption or to the future outlook of SOA gates. In Chapter 3, we discuss the generation of small sub-pulses from the delayed interferencesignal-wavelength converter (DISC). This sub-pulse generation is regardedas one potential issue which prevents the practical operation of the DISC. We experimentallyrevealed the sub-pulse generation in a relatively low frequency region(10 25 GHz) through cross-correlation measurements, and verified our sub-pulsegeneration model with high accuracy (1 2 dB). We demonstrated the increaseof sub-pulse intensity up to 10 dB with the carrier recovery rate, which will leadto the trade-off between the sub-pulse intensity and the pattern-induced intensityfluctuation. The sub-pulse model verified in this work will be valuable for futuresolution of this issue. In Chapter 4, we report on our wavelength conversion experiment for 200 Gb/s, 4992 -bit data signal using a <b>DISC</b> <b>gate.</b> For this purpose we developed an originallow jitter, low repetition rate (40 MHz), ultrafast (600 700 fs) and synchronizedsampling pulse generator for the cross-correlator input and succeeded in precise　waveform-monitoring of the ultrafast long-pattern signal. The pattern-induced intensityfluctuation (PIF) of the output waveform was systematically measured, andthe impact of the holding-beam injection and bandpass filter detuning on its suppressionwere compared. We systematically exhibited that the filter detuning efficientlysuppressed the PIF even for 200 Gb/s, long-pattern data signal and it saved therequired holding-beam power by 3 dB. We also discovered a new method usingthe nonlinear polarization rotation in the SOA, and obtained a guideline foruse of this method thorough systematic measurements. These results will provideindispensable backgrounds for the practical, ultrafast, low-power operation of theDISC. In conclusion, we developed the understanding of the SOA gate (DISC) operatedin the frequency range of 10 200 Gb/s, and considerably facilitated its low-power,small signal-degradation operation and the system design. 電気通信大学 200...|$|E
40|$|A special mold with {{mechanically}} driven {{mold surface}} motions (rotation and axial) was developed allowing {{the imposition of}} different molding sequences, thus enlarging the possibilities of controlling the thermomechanical environment, and consequently the manipulation of the developed morphology. In this work, centre <b>gated</b> <b>discs</b> were injection molded with distinct rotation velocities of the mold surface. The moldings were characterized by several structure sensitive techniques. The imposition of a mold surface rotation has a marked effect on the morphology of the moldings, with novel molding morphologies being developed: a laminated skin–core structure featuring a dual shish-kebab structure differently oriented relatively to the flow direction, one {{in each of the}} skin layer...|$|R

5000|$|The el-Jazzar Mosque was {{the project}} of its namesake, Ahmad Pasha el-Jazzar, the Acre-based {{governor}} of the Sidon and Damascus provinces, who was equally famous for his cruelty, impressive public works, and defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Siege of Acre in 1799. El-Jazzar ordered the mosque's construction in 1781 and had it completed within the year. Despite lacking architectural training, el-Jazzar was {{the architect of the}} mosque, drawing up its plans and design, and supervising its entire construction. In addition to the mosque itself, the complex included an Islamic theological academy with student lodging, an Islamic court and a public library. The mosque was built for religious purposes, but its grandiose size and additional functions were also intended by el-Jazzar to serve as a means of consolidating his political legitimacy as ruler of Syria. He modeled the mosque on the mosques of Istanbul, the Ottoman capital. The el-Jazzar Mosque was built over former Muslim and Christian prayer houses and other Crusader buildings. Building materials for the mosque, particularly its marble and granite components, were taken from the ancient ruins of Caesarea, Atlit and medieval Acre. El-Jazzar commissioned several Greek masons as the mosque's builders. There is a tughra or monogram on a marble <b>disc</b> inside the <b>gate,</b> naming the ruling Sultan, his father, and bearing the legend [...] "ever-victorious".|$|R
