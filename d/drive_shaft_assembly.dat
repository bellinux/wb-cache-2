40|$|In {{vehicle drive}} shaft {{is one of}} the most {{important}} component. It transmits torque from the engine to the differential gear of a rear wheel drive vehicle. Generally the drive shaft is made up of steel alloy but the use of conventional steel has disadvantages such as low specific stiffness and strength and high weight. Nowadays this steel drive shaft is replaced by composite material drive shaft. This advanced composite such as graphite, Kevlar, carbon, glass with suitable resin have advantage of higher specific strength, less weight, high damping capacity, longer life, high critical speed and greater torque carrying capacity and can results in considerable amount of weight reduction as compared to steel shaft. The main objective of this research work is to study the structural and vibrational behavior of composite material <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>assembly</b> as compared to conventional steel drive shaft. Heavy duty vehicle transmission drive shaft has been used for the project. The conventional material steel SM 45 C and three composite materials HS carbon epoxy, E-glass epoxy, HM carbon epoxy have been used for drive shaft study so as to determine the suitable composite replacement in order to optimize the performance and design.
