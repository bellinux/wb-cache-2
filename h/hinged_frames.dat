40|$|In the {{graduation}} thesis are presented large finger joints. Large finger joints are glued timber joints, used for connecting wooden elements, usually glulam beams. Frequently {{this kind of}} joints connect corners of three – <b>hinged</b> <b>frames,</b> used for building prefabricated timber structures with spans up to 40 m. In comparison with mechanical joints, glued joints are cheaper and they have excellent load – carrying capacity, but poor ductility. I have installed large finger joints in the glulam frame structure, that is figment of my imagination, used for sports activities. In {{the graduation}} thesis is also presented design of large finger joints according to current standards Eurocode and according to old DIN standards, {{with the purpose of}} comparing the design procedures. I have made a tool in Microsoft Excel for calculating load – carrying capacity of direct and insert type of large finger joints in frame corners and large finger joints at straight beams of constant height. The tool was made with Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications program, which is a development tool build in Microsoft Excel. At the end of the graduation thesis there are examples and a research about which parameters affect load – carrying capacity of large finger joints...|$|E

40|$|Seismic {{assessment}} and seismic strengthening {{are the key}} issues need to be figured out {{during the process of}} protection and reusing of historical buildings. In this thesis the seismic behaviors of the hinged steel structure, a typical structure of historical buildings, i. e. <b>hinged</b> steel <b>frames</b> in Shanghai, China, were studied based on experimental investigations and theoretic analysis. How the non-structural members worked with the steel frames was analyzed thoroughly. Firstly, two 1 / 4 scale <b>hinged</b> steel <b>frames</b> were constructed based on the structural system of Bund 18, a historical building in Shanghai: M 1 model without infill walls, M 2 model with infill walls, and tested under the horizontal cyclic loads to investigate their seismic behavior. The Shaking Table Test and its results indicated that the seismic behavior of the <b>hinged</b> steel <b>frames</b> could be improved significantly with the help of non-structural members, i. e., surrounding elements outside the <b>hinged</b> steel <b>frames</b> and infilled walls. To specify, the columns are covered with bricks, they consist of I shape formed steel sections and steel plates, which are clenched together. The steel beams are connected to the steel column by steel angle, thus the structure should be considered as a <b>hinged</b> <b>frame.</b> And the infilled wall acted as a compression diagonal strut to withstand the horizontal load, therefore, the seismic capacity and stiffness of the <b>hinged</b> steel <b>frames</b> with infilled walls could be estimated by using the equivalent compression diagonal strut model. A SAP model has been constructed with the objective to perform a dynamic nonlinear analysis. The obtained results were compared with the results obtained from Shaking Table Test. The Test Results have validated that the influence of infill walls on seismic behavior can be estimated by using the equivalent diagonal strut model...|$|R

50|$|The {{fuselage}} was a semi-monocoque spruce {{structure with}} plywood covering. The fin was also plywood-covered, carrying a fabric-covered rudder which reached from {{the underside of}} the T-tail {{to the bottom of the}} fuselage. The fixed-incidence tailplane was likewise plywood-covered and the elevator fabric-covered. The latter carried a Flettner-type trim tab on its starboard edge. The Hawk's single seat was forward of the wing and under a <b>hinged,</b> <b>framed</b> canopy. It landed on a single fixed wheel assisted by a tailskid.|$|R

Two differently engined versions were built: the DB-80 had a [...] Hispano-Suiza 6P six cylinder, upright water-cooled inline and the DB-81 a [...] Lorraine 5Pc five cylinder radial engine. The latter was mounted on a <b>hinged</b> <b>frame</b> for easy servicing. The Hispano engined had a Lamblin radiator on the fuselage underside.|$|R
50|$|Genuine Austrian Gasser {{products}} are marked 'L. GASSER PATENT WIEN' or 'L. GASSER OTTAKRING PATENT', and often carry the Gasser trademark {{of a heart}} pierced by an arrow. Gasser also produced revolvers for the commercial market. The Gasser-Kropatschek, for example, appeared with fluted cylinders instead of the smooth-surfaced military pattern. He also produced the 9mm 'Post & Police' solid frame non-ejecting double-action revolver, with a hexagonal barrel. A commercial version of this gun was also made, generally offering better finish. There was also a commercial version of the open-frame M1874 in 9mm, and a 9mm <b>hinged</b> <b>frame</b> self-extracting model with the Galand double-action lock.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{approach}} to design of the equalization procedure of bearing loads on running wheels of a load trolley. Methodological ambiguity in the trolley design issue resulting in complication of the designing process was identified. There was formed and solved the task concerning compensation of variation {{in the position of}} the common resultant of forces acting on the trolley from the point characterizing optimal load distribution between the wheels. This distribution was achieved by introducing a conventional mass and using appropriate dependencies and imposed limitations. Different options for arrangement of actual masses which form the conventional mass under the multi-purpose metal construction scheme were considered. An example on how to address the presented issue for the overhead crane load trolley was considered. The paper presents the findings of usefulness of various schemes of mass arrangement depending on a design situation. The need to apply the <b>hinged</b> <b>frame</b> method for determining bearing loads on the running wheels of the trolley based on the multi-purpose layout drawing was identified. ...|$|R

The quintessential <b>hinged</b> <b>frame,</b> centre-fire revolvers for which the Webley name is best known first began production/development in the early 1870s most notably with the Webley-Pryse (1877) and Webley-Kaufman (1881) models.
