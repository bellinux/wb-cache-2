5|$|A new factory was {{constructed}} at 230 Duffy Avenue, Hicksville, New York, to manufacture <b>electron</b> <b>tubes</b> and semiconductors. Miniature receiving tubes, magnetrons, X-ray tubes, Geiger-Muller tubes, and large transmitting tubes were also manufactured at this location. This location became the headquarters for North American Philips (NAP). The factory {{was completed in}} 1953 and closed in 1989. All assets were then sold to Richardson Electronics of rural Lafox, near Batavia, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency <b>electron</b> <b>tubes</b> for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, a {{group of}} Bell Laboratories {{scientists}} moved to Reading, Pennsylvania, from other locations and started the Laureldale Laboratory in the Laureldale Western Electric Plant. Bell Labs was a division of Western Electric. Initially the Laureldale Laboratory designed <b>electron</b> <b>tubes</b> (vacuum tubes). Eventually, after becoming the Reading Laboratory, it designed semiconductor devices which eventually included integrated circuits, light emitting diodes, and lasers.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{commercial use}} of Bakelite in the electrical industry was the molding of tiny insulating bushings {{the size of}} mustard seeds, made in 1908 for the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation by Richard W. Seabury of the Boonton Rubber Company. Bakelite was soon used for non-conducting parts of telephones, radios and other electrical devices, including bases and sockets for light bulbs and <b>electron</b> <b>tubes,</b> supports for any type of electrical components, automobile distributor caps and other insulators.|$|E
25|$|Application of {{electronic}} amplifiers to protective relays {{was described as}} early as 1928, using vacuum tube amplifiers and continued up to 1956. Devices using <b>electron</b> <b>tubes</b> were studied but never applied as commercial products, because {{of the limitations of}} vacuum tube amplifiers. A relatively large standby current is required to maintain the tube filament temperature; inconvenient high voltages are required for the circuits, and vacuum tube amplifiers had difficulty with incorrect operation due to noise disturbances.|$|E

The <b>Electron</b> <b>Tube</b> Laboratory was merged with Hughes' other research teams in 1954, becoming the Hughes Research Laboratories, with Haeff as their director. He left in 1961, exhausted, and became an independent inventor and consultant, creating a plasma containment device, a volumetric measuring device, and predicting laser-based scanning. He formally retired in 1975, and died at home on 16 November 1990.|$|R
25|$|The FERMIAC was {{an analog}} {{computer}} invented by physicist Enrico Fermi in 1947 {{to aid in}} his studies of neutron transport. Project Cyclone was an analog computer developed by Reeves in 1950 for the analysis and design of dynamic systems. Project Typhoon was an analog computer developed by RCA in 1952. It consisted of over 4000 <b>electron</b> <b>tubes</b> and used 100 dials and 6000 plug-in connectors to program. The MONIAC Computer was a hydraulic model of a national economy first unveiled in 1949.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, {{the company}} {{changed its name}} to Raytheon Manufacturing Company and began {{marketing}} its rectifier, under the Raytheon brand name, with great commercial success. In 1928 Raytheon merged with Q.R.S. Company, an American manufacturer of <b>electron</b> <b>tubes</b> and switches, to form the successor of the same name, Raytheon Manufacturing Company. In 1933 it diversified by acquiring Acme-Delta Company, a producer of transformers, power equipment, and electronic auto parts. By the 1930s, it had already grown {{to become one of the}} world's largest vacuum tube manufacturing companies.|$|E
500|$|Gaseous {{mercury is}} used in mercury-vapor lamps and some [...] "neon sign" [...] type {{advertising}} signs and fluorescent lamps. Those low-pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; reflecting a fluorescent ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice. Gaseous mercury {{is also found in}} some <b>electron</b> <b>tubes,</b> including ignitrons, thyratrons, and mercury arc rectifiers. It is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection. Gaseous mercury is added to cold cathode argon-filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity. An argon-filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly. Lighting containing mercury can be bombarded/oven pumped only once. When added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red/blue spots until the initial burning-in process is completed; eventually it will light a consistent dull off-blue color.|$|E

2500|$|The Shreeve {{mechanical}} repeater and {{the vacuum}} tube {{were the only}} amplifying devices, other than specialized power devices such as the magnetic amplifier and amplidyne, for 40 years. [...] Power control circuitry used magnetic amplifiers until {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century when power semiconductor devices became more economical, with higher operating speeds. Shreeve repeaters were used as adjustable amplifiers in telephone subscriber sets for the hearing impaired until the transistor provided smaller and higher quality amplifiers in the 1950s. [...] The replacement of bulky <b>electron</b> <b>tubes</b> with transistors during the 1960s and 1970s created another revolution in electronics, making possible a large class of portable electronic devices, such as the transistor radio developed in 1954. [...] Today, use of vacuum tubes is limited for some high power applications, such as radio transmitters.|$|E
