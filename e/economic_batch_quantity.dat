40|$|A {{production}} scheduling model {{based on the}} minimisation of inventory costs is proposed for small scale organisations. This is an interactive model characterised by its {{ability to cope with}} continuous changes in production and demand conditions. The model is built on the foundation of the Wagner-Whitin algorithm, and has incorporated factors of safety stock, <b>economic</b> <b>batch</b> <b>quantity,</b> production capacity and past forecast accuracy in inventory and {{production scheduling}}. It has been implemented in a computer programme and tested within a company. Results show that by using this model substantial savings can be achieved in inventory costs.

40|$|When several {{products}} are processed {{one at a}} time on a single machine, the conventional approach of computing the <b>economic</b> <b>batch</b> <b>quantity</b> for each product cannot apply. An example for six products is considered, where the total production capacity on regular time is inadequate, so that overtime has to be used at an extra cost. A simple method is described for solving this problem when each product is produced once during a production cycle, the objective being to minimize the total set-up and holding costs per day. Schedules which involve batch splitting can reduce these costs further, and a guideline is proposed for the construction of sub-cycles. The results compare favourably with lower bounds computed for the purpose. ...|$|E

A relationship is formulated between the percentage increase in total unit cost for given variations from the batch size: so that companies may determine what alteration to this batch size is acceptable or desirable under given operating conditions.

40|$|The {{multi-product}} single machine {{scheduling problem}} is not new in the literature. The usual method of solution offered consists of determining the <b>Economic</b> <b>Batch</b> <b>Quantities</b> (EBQ) and then finding an acceptable way of scheduling these quantities on the single facility. However, past experience shows that EBQs cannot be scheduled in the same solution because of some limitations, mostly when a product produced earlier has run out of stock. Eventually, an acceptable <b>batch</b> <b>quantity</b> has to be selected that will satisfy a set of given conditions or objectives. Before calculating the EBQ, it is generally necessary to determine the main cost factors, namely, the set up cost of the machine and the inventory holding cost of the product. A case study is described in this paper, in which the scheduling was carried out without the determination of these costs. However, deviations from this solution {{may have to be}} considered. A simple way of calculating the costs incurred by such deviations is described. batch production scheduling inventory control...|$|R
40|$|The {{inventory}} {{problems of}} most of the manufacturing or trading organization are of great concern. The end item has independent demand and all its component and parts have dependent demand. These component and parts of end item are produced at different stages of production process. Thus, manufacturing of these dependent materials is done at multilevel. Depending upon the capacity of production, cost of setup and carrying inventories, the various parts and components are produced or procured at different level. MRP computes these requirements of material as per time schedule. In order to fulfill these demands of materials at multilevel situation, the production or procurement orders are released for <b>economic</b> <b>batch</b> or lot <b>quantities.</b> In the present paper, the order quantity or lot sizing is obtained by minimizing the cost of ordering plus the cost of carrying the item in stock certainly. Apart from that some constraint such as the availability of space and storing the inventory of these multiple items need to be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an imperfect production system which produces good and defective items {{and assume that}} defective items can be reworked. Due {{to the nature of}} rework process we do not restrict the rework rate to be equal to normal production rate or constant and assume that it is a random variable with an arbitrary distribution function. We also assume as it is true in most real world situation that the unit rework processing cost need not to be equal to unit normal processing cost. We consider the case in which during a specified period of time consisting of several cycles the rework process takes place only in its last cycle. For practical reasons such as the ease of production scheduling and resource planning we require that the length of the last cycle must have the same length as the other cycles of this period. For this purpose we assume in the last cycle of this period first the normal production starts after which the rework of all defective units produced in the period begins. After {{the end of the last}} cycle of the period the whole process will start all over again. Further we assume that, for reduction of set up cost for rework per unit time, the total number of setups for rework must be as small as possible. For this system we derive the expected total cost function consisting of inventory holding, waiting time of defectives for rework, setup, and processing costs per unit time. Then we obtain the <b>economic</b> <b>batch</b> <b>quantity</b> which minimizes this expected cost...|$|E
40|$|Modern injection-moulding {{machinery}} {{which produces}} several, pairs of plastic footwear {{at a time}} brought increased production planning problems to a factory. The demand for its footwear is seasonal but the company's manning policy keeps a fairly constant production level thus determining the aggregate stock. Production planning must therefore be done within the limitations of a specified total stock. The thesis proposes a new production planning system with four subsystems. These are sales forecasting, resource planning, and two levels of production scheduling: (a) aggregate decisions concerning the 'manufacturing group' (group of products) to be produced in each machine each week, and (b) detailed decisions concerning the products within a manufacturing group to be scheduled into each mould-place. The detailed scheduling is least dependent on improvements elsewhere so the sub-systems were tackled in reverse order. The thesis concentrates on the production scheduling sub-systems which will provide most. of the benefits. The aggregate scheduling solution depends principally on the aggregate stocks of each manufacturing group and their division into 'safety stocks' (to prevent shortages) and 'freestocks' (to permit batch production). The problem is too complex for exact solution but a good heuristic solution, which {{has yet to be}} implemented, is provided by minimising graphically immediate plus expected future costs. The detailed problem splits into determining the optimal safety stocks and batch quantities given the appropriate aggregate stocks. It. is found that the optimal safety stocks are proportional to the demand. The ideal batch quantities are based on a modified, formula for the <b>Economic</b> <b>Batch</b> <b>Quantity</b> and the product schedule is created week by week using a priority system which schedules to minimise expected future costs. This algorithm performs almost optimally. The detailed scheduling solution was implemented and achieved the target savings for the whole project in favourable circumstances. Future plans include full implementation...|$|E
40|$|Intermediation is {{a central}} concept in the {{marketing}} channel literature where it is used for analyzing how specific firms, intermediaries, connect producers and users. It is argued that intermediation is primarily about increasing transaction efficiency when intermediaries undertake functions for closing the gap between producer stocks and consumer assortments, thus bridging discrepancies in time and place between supply and demand. Current changes of business reality in terms of postponement, specialization, customization and outsourcing call for an extended perspective on intermediation, since existing interpretations {{do not seem to}} fit very well with today’s business reality. As a supplement to the previous focus on intermediation between actors, this thesis explores intermediation also in the activity and resource layers of business networks, with the aim of creating a framework for analyzing intermediation in contemporary business networks. Models and concepts from the industrial network approach (e. g. Håkansson, 1987; Håkansson et al., 2009) are used in order to regain a holistic view of intermediation justified by the need to “bring together heterogeneous supply on the one hand with heterogeneous demand on the other” (Alderson, 1965, p. 200). A qualitative case study in the textile and clothing industry is used to empirically address intermediation. It involves a Swedish shirt manufacturer, SM, and its demand side and supply side, which have very different features. The demand side is characterized by a huge variety of product ranges, volumes of different types of shirts, changes of models demanded and a call for rapid modifications both quantitatively and in terms of variants. On the supply side, large-scale facilities appear with an inherent logic of large <b>economic</b> <b>batch</b> <b>quantities</b> to obtain cost efficiency. The intermediating challenge for SM is thus to balance the flexibility requirements on its demand side with the call for stability on its supply side. A broadened scope of intermediation contributes to improved understanding of current conditions in business reality. The activity analysis shows that the way a specific activity intermediates between two other activities will impact on their economies of scale, interdependences, economic efficiency and diversity. The resource analysis reveals that resource utilization owing to resource intermediation is an intricate balancing of obtaining cost efficiency and individualization. The analysis of the actor layer shows that intermediation among actors is ever more important since resource combining and activity interdependence increasingly cross the borders of firms. In today’s business reality all firms are involved in intermediation. Hence, ‘intermediary’ has lost its relevance as a theoretical construct since it can no longer be used as a meaningful discriminator between various types of actors.

40|$|A problem {{relating}} to the manufacture of automotive body panels concerns the appropriate choice of production size or <b>batch</b> <b>quantity</b> of a body panel production run that ensures a minimum inventory profile is maintained while not compromising production efficiency. Due to underlying variation within the body panel production process {{it is difficult to}} determine a relationship between the <b>batch</b> <b>quantity</b> and production efficiency. This thesis determines the appropriate production batch size through the creation of an iterative modelling methodology that initially examines the nature of the variation within the panel production process. Further iterations of the methodology apply appropriate analytical modelling methods until a satisfactory solution is achieved. The modelling construction is designed so that it is potentially applicable to a wider range of manufacturing problems. As there is variation inherent within the system, regression analysis, experimental design (traditional and Taguchi) are considered. Since an objective of creating the modelling methodology is the potential of apply the methodology to a wider variety of manufacturing problems, additional modelling methods are assessed. These include the operational research methods of mathematical programming (linear and non-linear and dynamic programming) and queuing systems. To model discrete and continuous behaviour of a manufacturing system, the application of hybrid automata is considered. Thus a suite of methodologies are assessed that assess variation, optimisation and networks of manufacturing systems. Through the iterative stages of the modelling approach, these analytical methods can be applied as appropriate to converge on to the appropriate solution for the problem under investigation. The appropriate methods identified to quantify a relationship between the <b>batch</b> production <b>quantity</b> and production efficiency include regression modelling and traditional experimental design. The conclusion drawn from the application of both methods is that relative to the inherent variation present in the production system, lower <b>batch</b> <b>quantities</b> can be chosen for production runs without affecting the production performance. Consequently, a minimum inventory profile can be maintained satisfying the objective of a lean system...|$|R
