5|$|IUPAC {{committee}} {{has a long}} history of officially naming organic and inorganic compounds. <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature</b> is developed so that any compound can be named under one set of standardized rules to avoid duplicate names. The first publication, which is information from the International Congress of Applied Chemistry, on <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature</b> of organic compounds, can be found from the early 20th century in A Guide to <b>IUPAC</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> of Organic Compounds (1900).|$|E
5|$|IUPAC was {{established}} in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry {{for the advancement of}} chemistry. Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (<b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature)</b> is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds. Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities. These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature, finding ways to bring chemistry to the world, and publishing works.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are all shiny, soft, highly {{reactive}} metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge +1. They {{can all be}} cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen (and {{in the case of}} lithium, nitrogen). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals. In the modern <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements, excluding hydrogen (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals. All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.|$|E

5|$|The {{need for}} an {{international}} standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz. This committee was the first international conference to create an international naming system for organic compounds. The ideas that were formulated in that conference evolved into the official <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature</b> of organic chemistry. IUPAC stands as a legacy of this meeting, {{making it one of}} the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies. Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization held with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature. IUPAC as such was established in 1919. One notable country excluded from this early IUPAC is Germany. Germany's exclusion was a result of prejudice towards Germans by the Allied powers after World War I. Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC during 1929. However, Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II.|$|E
25|$|In <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> organic {{compounds}} that have a–C≡N functional group are called nitriles. Thus, nitriles are {{organic compounds}}.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{naming of}} haloalkanes should follow <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> which put the halogen as a prefix to the alkane. For example, ethane with bromine becomes bromoethane, methane with four {{chlorine}} groups becomes tetrachloromethane. However, {{many of these}} compounds have already an established trivial name, which is endorsed by the <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> for example chloroform (trichloromethane) and methylene chloride (dichloromethane). For unambiguity, this article follows the systematic naming scheme throughout.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "polylactic acid" [...] {{does not}} comply with <b>IUPAC</b> {{standard}} <b>nomenclature,</b> and is potentially ambiguous or confusing, because PLA is not a polyacid (polyelectrolyte), but rather a polyester.|$|R
25|$|This naming {{standard}} {{may not be}} {{in compliance}} with <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> which encourages that carbons be identified by number, not by Greek letter, but it nonetheless remains very popular, in particular because it is useful in identifying the relative location of carbon atoms to other functional groups.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, an alkyne is an {{unsaturated}} hydrocarbon containing {{at least one}} carbon—carbon triple bond. The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other functional groups form a homologous series with the general chemical formula n2n−2. Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name acetylene also refers specifically to C2H2, known formally as ethyne using <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic but {{tend to be more}} reactive.|$|E
25|$|Terminal alkynes {{have the}} formula RC2H. An example is methyl{{acetylene}} (propyne using <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature).</b> Terminal alkynes, like acetylene itself, are mildly acidic, with pKa values of around 25. They {{are far more}} acidic than alkenes and alkanes, which have pKa values of around 40 and 50, respectively. The acidic hydrogen on terminal alkynes can {{be replaced by a}} variety of groups resulting in halo-, silyl-, and alkoxoalkynes. The carbanions generated by deprotonation of terminal alkynes are called acetylides.|$|E

25|$|In 1866, the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann {{proposed}} {{a system of}} hydrocarbon nomenclature in which the suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to denote the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogens than their parent alkane. In this system, ethylene became ethene. Hofmann's system eventually {{became the basis for}} the Geneva nomenclature approved by the International Congress of Chemists in 1892, which remains {{at the core of the}} <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> However, by that time, the name ethylene was deeply entrenched, and it remains in wide use today, especially in the chemical industry.|$|E
25|$|Under the 2005 {{revisions}} of <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature</b> of inorganic chemistry, {{there is no}} single correct name for every compound. The primary function of chemical nomenclature is to ensure that each name refers, unambiguously, to a single substance. It is considered less important to ensure that each substance should have a single unambiguous name, although the number of acceptable names is limited. Water is one acceptable name for this compound, even though it is neither a systematic nor an international name and is specific to just one phase of the compound (its liquid form). The other IUPAC recommendation is oxidane, which is used by hoax industry groups promoting DHMO as a safe industrial chemical while hinting at dangers and government conspiracies.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{pharmaceutical}} drugs, there is standardization {{of the drug}} nomenclature for radiopharmaceuticals, although various standards coexist. The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as atomic weight, no space, element symbol) in parentheses with no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). It is common to see square brackets and superscript superimposed onto the INN name, because chemical nomenclature (such as <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature)</b> uses those. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) name gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as element symbol, space, atomic weight) with no parentheses, no hyphen, and no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). The USP style is not the INN style, despite their being described as {{one and the same}} in some publications (e.g., AMA, whose style for radiopharmaceuticals matches the USP style). The United States Pharmacopeial Convention is a sponsor organization of the USAN Council, and the USAN for a given drug is often the same as the USP name.|$|E

25|$|BIND {{offers several}} “features” {{that many other}} {{proteomics}} databases do not include. The authors of this program have created an extension to traditional <b>IUPAC</b> <b>nomenclature</b> to help describe post-translational modifications that occur to amino acids. These modifications include: acetylation, formylation, methylation, palmitoylation, etc. {{the extension of the}} traditional IUPAC codes allows these amino acids to be represented in sequence form as well. BIND also utilizes a unique visualization tool known as OntoGlyphs. The OntoGlyphs were developed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and provide a link back to the original GO information. A number of GO terms have been grouped into categories, each one representing a specific function, binding specificity, or localization in the cell. There are 83 OntoGlyph characters in total. There are 34 functional OntoGlyphs which contain information {{about the role of the}} molecule (e.g. cell physiology, ion transport, signaling). There are 25 binding OntoGlyphs which describe what the molecule binds (e.g. ligands, DNA, ions). The other 24 OntoGlyphs provide information about the location of the molecule within a cell (e.g. nucleus, cytoskeleton). The OntoGlyphs can be selected and manipulated to include or exclude certain characteristics from search results. The visual nature of the OntoGlyphs also facilitates pattern recognition when looking at search results. ProteoGlyphs are graphical representations of the structural and binding properties of proteins at the level of conserved domains. The protein is diagrammed as a straight horizontal line and glyphs are inserted to represent conserved domains. Each glyph is displayed to represent the relative position and length of its alignment in the protein sequence.|$|E
