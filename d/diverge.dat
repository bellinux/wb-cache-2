5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will <b>diverge,</b> and follow {{different}} routes. The inbound track will hook up with the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will <b>diverge</b> at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E

40|$|There {{tend to be}} more crashes {{occurring}} in freeway <b>diverging</b> segments due to increasing traffic conflicts between <b>diverging</b> vehicles and nondiverging vehicles. The <b>diverging</b> segments have a safety impact on the precedent basic segments and the following off ramps. It is always a challenge to accurately define the safety influential area of freeway <b>diverging</b> segments. In previous studies, fixed buffer in size is pregiven for crash frequency analysis in <b>diverging</b> segments, which lacks theoretical and practical support. In this study, the safety influential area was investigated from the statistical point of view. Data from a geocoded GIS crash database for Colorado Springs metropolitan area was used; the statistically significant factors associated with crash frequency were examined for the spatial influence of freeway <b>diverging</b> segments. Also, the generalized linear models with negative binomial link function were applied to predict the crash frequency for freeway <b>diverging</b> segments and off ramps based on the influential area. The results may give some insights into the causation of crashes on <b>diverging</b> segments and off-ramp intersections...|$|R

The name {{is derived from the}} wheel on the <b>diverging</b> rail being lifted over the through rail. No guard rail is required on the through route, but is critical on the <b>diverging</b> route to keep rail vehicles in gauge. Common applications are set-out tracks or lightly used industry tracks (both of which are special types of sidings <b>diverging</b> from high-speed, high-tonnage mainlines.) ...|$|R
5|$|At Carroll Street, {{the express}} tracks ramp up {{to rejoin the}} local tracks, and all four tracks rise onto the Culver Viaduct, curving onto Ninth Street.

This {{is one of two}} places in the subway where the express tracks <b>diverge</b> from the local tracks, the other being on the IND Queens Boulevard Line between 65th Street and 36th Street. The express tracks rejoin the {{right-of-way}} at approximately Terrace Place and Prospect Avenue, running on a lower level under Prospect Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway near the Prospect Park Parade Grounds, then rise up as the line curves onto McDonald Avenue. The line then parallels the route of the original Culver Line surface railroad into Church Avenue station, the last stop of the original IND service.|$|E

40|$|<b>Diverging</b> {{segments}} {{are potential}} bottlenecks because of frequent lane change and deceleration maneuvers. Speed {{study has been}} proven {{to be an effective}} way to understand the safety performance of <b>diverging</b> segments. This paper addresses the safety level of <b>diverging</b> segments in terms of speed consistency. Speed data is extracted by Tracker based on aerial video imager collected at the <b>diverging</b> segment of MaQun interchange of G 42 in Nanjing, China. The operating speed of vehicles is assumed to follow the Linear Regression Model with two explanatory variables—initial velocity and running distance, and the estimated operating speed is amended un der actual traffic conditions. Furthermore, average speed, speed difference and the coefficient of variation are used as safety indicators to establish the speed evaluation criteria. Last but not the least, based on vague set of material-units, the safety level of <b>diverging</b> segments in terms of the velocity arrives at level III, which means that consideration must be given about the safety of <b>diverging</b> segments. The proposed methodology can be used to estimate the safety of <b>diverging</b> segments...|$|R
