40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new order-based method, {{which has been}} developed to automatically identify resonances from operational data in an engine run-up. The method considers the run-up as a multi-sine sweep excitation and combines advanced Order Tracking with Operational Modal Analysis to identify the resonances. A three-steps approach is used. In a first step, an automatic order detection algorithm is applied to identify the significant engine orders in the measured data. These significant orders are then accurately tracked in both amplitude and phase by using an advanced time-varying DFT Order Tracking method. Once this is achieved, the PolyMAX modal parameter estimation algorithm {{is applied to the}} tracked engine orders to identify the resonances.

A drawback of pose estimation using vision only is that it fails when image information is poor.

We propose to combine standard <b>in-vehicle</b> sensor <b>data</b> and vehicle motion models with the accuracy of local visual bundle adjustment. This means that pose estimates are optimized with regard not only to observed image features but also to a single-track vehicle model and standard in-vehicle sensors.

The vehicle motion model in combination with in-vehicle sensors exhibit good accuracy in estimating planar vehicle motion. Results show that this property is preserved, when combining these information sources with vision. Furthermore, the accuracy obtained from vision-only in direction estimation is improved, primarily in situations in which there are few matched visual features...|$|R

The hand gesture-based visual user interface {{may be more}} natural and intuitive to the user than the current tactile interaction interface. Consequently, it may encourage a gaze-free interaction, which can alleviate driver distraction without limiting the user’s infotainment experience. The system uses visible and depth images of the dashboard and center-console area in the vehicle.

The goal of the research was to determine if crash risk is more related to absolute speed or to some measure of variation of the speed distribution. Data on crashes were obtained from the Iowa DOT crash data base. Roadway segments were selected utilizing criteria to avoid problems of over-long sections as were encountered by Solomon in his 1964 report. Aggregated speed metrics were calculated from raw ATR data provided by the Iowa DOT. Visual Basic programs were developed to calculate the basic speed metrics. Standard statistical tests were used to compare the speed distributions as well as their mean and variance. Logistic regression models were developed to explore the relationship between the dependent variable crash probability and the explanatory variables variance, road type, number of lanes, time of day, and day of week. The evaluation included considering two cases, one with all crashes in the segment and the other with weather-related crashes removed. The hypothesis, that {{one or more of the}} speed metrics could be used to determine crash risk, was not supported by the results of the analyses.
