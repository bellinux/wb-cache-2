5000|$|The gray fox {{is mainly}} {{distinguished}} from most other canids by its grizzled upper parts, black-tipped tail and strong neck, while the skull {{can be easily}} distinguished from all other North American canids by its widely separated temporal ridges that form a U-shape. There is little sexual dimorphism, save for the females being slightly smaller than males. The gray fox ranges from 76 to 112.5 cm in total length. The tail measures 27.5 to 44.3 cm of that length and its hind feet measure 100 to 150 mm. The gray fox typically weighs 3.6 to 7 kg, though <b>exceptionally</b> <b>can</b> weigh as much as 9 kg. It is readily differentiated from the red fox {{by the lack of}} [...] "black stockings" [...] that stand out on the latter and the stripe of black hair that runs along the middle of the tail. In contrast to all Vulpes and related (Arctic and fennec) foxes, the gray fox has oval (instead of slit-like) pupils.|$|E

Extraskeletal Ewing Sarcoma is of neuroectodermal origin and usually involves extremities, retroperitoneum and paravertebral regions. In literature, we have found only two case reports of Extraskeletal Ewing Sarcoma involving abdominal wall in adults.

The overall prevalence of BCC is 3 times higher than that of SCC, but this can vary when looking at specific locations such as the hand, where SCC is much more common than BCC. Carcinoma (or epithelioma) cuniculatum is a rare variant of SCC.
