5|$|Darren {{arrives in}} Hollyoaks with parents Celia (Carol Noakes) and Jack from America. Celia discovers that Jack has been {{having an affair}} with Dawn Cunningham (Lisa Williamson) and returns to America, taking Darren with her. Darren returns to live with his father two years later. Darren becomes friends with Luke; {{together}} they stand up to bully Mark. When Mark's bullying of Luke becomes more severe, Darren decides to befriend Mark in the hope he will go <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> Luke. His attempts do not succeed and Mark rapes Luke. After the attack, Luke's relationship with Mandy begins to fail, so Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Mandy. Darren suggests that Luke might be gay and that he was responsible for his own rape. Mandy breaks up with Darren. Darren trashes his sister Ruth's (Terri Dwyer) flat and is evicted; he leaves the village soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|During their investigation, Pembleton and Bayliss learn Kaja {{has been}} in a Haitian prison for four months, {{eliminating}} him as a lead. Gee announces the Baltimore Sun is running a story that Kaja has been cleared as a suspect, leaked from the police. Pembleton accuses Ballard and Gharty of leaking the story, while Gharty accuses Pembleton of going <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> Felix Wilson because he is a successful black man. The discussion prompts a heated argument with accusations of racism from both sides. Pembleton agrees to interview Felix Wilson alone because he believes it will clear him. When Pembleton tells Wilson he needs a blood test from him and his son, Wilson admits that he had consensual sex with Brierre the night of the murder, but said he does not kill her. Later, a devastated Pembleton and Gee still insist he should not necessarily be treated as a suspect, much to the disbelief of Ballard and Gharty. The detectives are interrupted by Wilson's attorney, who says the family will not submit to a blood and hair test without a court order.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{return to}} the {{homicide}} unit after a rotation in robbery, {{only to find the}} highest murder clearance rate in five years. A delighted Gee (Yaphet Kotto) credits much of the success to the new detectives Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety) and, particularly, Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne). Lewis (Clark Johnson) asks Gee for a different partner, but dodges questions about problems with his old partner Kellerman (Reed Diamond); Gee assigns him to Falsone (Jon Seda), one of the newer detectives, and Kellerman is partnered with Munch (Richard Belzer). That evening, Gee attends a black-tie dinner honoring his friend Felix Wilson (James Earl Jones), a wealthy businessman and respected Baltimore philanthropist. In that same hotel, a woman is found beaten to death in the men's bathroom, and Pembleton and Bayliss are called to investigate. Felix and his wife Regina (Lynne Thigpen) see the body and identify her as Melia Brierre, a Haitian expatriate working as one of their domestic workers. The Wilsons leave after only brief interviews, and Pembleton becomes agitated when Bayliss asks whether Pembleton went <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> them because of his respect for Wilson's contributions to the African American community.|$|E

Seventy-five percent of the participants conformed at least once during the experiment.|$|E
25|$|Relationships {{with the}} Italian Social Republic were not <b>easy.</b> <b>On</b> January 14, 1944 Benito Mussolini arrested Borghese while {{receiving}} him in Gargnano, {{in order to}} gain direct control of the Xª MAS. Word of the arrest reached the officers of the Decima, who considered marching on Mussolini's capital at Salò. However, the German command used their influence to have Borghese released, as they needed the equipment, expertise and manpower of the Xª MAS as an anti-partisan force.|$|E
25|$|In his State of the Nation Address (SONA), President Benigno Aquino III bared the {{anomalies}} {{during the}} Presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo {{such as a}} budget deficit {{in the first half}} of the year, a depleted calamity fund that mostly went to Pampanga, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's home province, corruption at the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, Department of Public Works and Highways, National Power Corporation, Metro Rail Transit Corporation and the National Food Authority. Aquino announced steps to weed out tax evaders, and asked the Commission on Appointments to be <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> his Cabinet.|$|E

25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{made it a point to}} take it <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and he was not going to hurt her.|$|E
25|$|Johnson was {{fortunate}} in finding talented men to staff his administration. Police Chief Frederick Kohler, a stubborn, incorruptible martinet, gained national renown {{for cleaning up}} and professionalizing the force, and clamping down on vice. While laws were strictly enforced, Kohler made sure his men went <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> young first offenders and honest citizens in trouble. City Solicitor Newton D. Baker led the successful fight for 'Home Rule', working to give Cleveland a charter that would allow it greater independence from state oversight; Baker's efforts would pay off in 1912, when he wrote the amendment to the state constitution that brought full Home Rule to all Ohio's cities. Both Baker and Kohler would become mayors in their own right, continuing Johnson's policies, and Baker later served as Secretary of War under Woodrow Wilson.|$|E
25|$|In the Canadian oil sands, bitumen {{produced}} by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as synthetic crude oil. This makes delivery {{of oil to}} market through conventional oil pipelines quite <b>easy.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, bitumen {{produced by}} the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to synthetic crude is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported {{to the site of}} upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the synthetic crude.|$|E

25|$|Barkley {{came under}} fire by some in 2006, due to his {{criticism}} of Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant. After Game 6 of the Lakers' first round series against the Phoenix Suns (when Bryant scored 50 points and the Lakers lost in overtime), Barkley criticized him for scoring too much and not getting his teammates involved. After Game 7 of the same series (when Bryant did not score and hardly attempted any shots in the second half), Barkley ripped him for being unselfish. Some columnists thought that Barkley was being hypocritical. Bryant and Barkley exchanged several text messages about the issue, and during {{the second round of}} the playoffs, Bryant appeared on TNT's studio show. Bryant and Barkley had a mild debate about the issue, and some observers thought that Barkley was too <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> Bryant, considering his previous comments about him.|$|E
25|$|Night {{operations}} {{gave the}} Luftwaffe valuable experience in using night navigation equipment, such at the Knickebein (crooked leg). By taking bearings and cross-bearings on German medium-wave transmitters, aircraft could find their position sufficiently accurately {{to make the}} discovery of landmarks <b>easy.</b> <b>On</b> the night of 6/7 June, the first Luftwaffe bomb to fall on Greater London was dropped on at Addington, and small raids continued through the month. Thirteen airfields, 16 factories and 14 ports were bombed to little effect. By flying at low altitudes, {{it was possible for}} British defences to detect German bombers with searchlights. Two were shot down in June by anti-aircraft guns. After this period, the bombers flew too high for anti-aircraft fire to be effective. Fighter Command claimed 21 German bombers at night over Britain in June. Seven German aircraft crashed and were credited to fighters. Fighter Command defences at night were weak. The British lacked a specialised night fighter or widespread use of reliable Airborne interception radar. Coastal radar looked out to sea, once a raider had penetrated into the interior, they became difficult to track. Until the following year, night fighter defences remained ineffective at finding enemy aircraft and shooting them down. At the beginning of The Blitz in October, the Luftwaffe flew 5,900 sorties and lost 23—a 0.4 percent loss rate. The failures would cost Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Hugh Dowding, his command in November 1940.|$|E
500|$|Walsh was {{partnered with}} new-signing Paul Stewart for the 1988–89 season, whilst fellow new arrival Paul Gascoigne boosted both the club's attacking {{potential}} and drinking culture. Spurs had a poor {{start to the}} season and were in a relegation battle by December, and only Gascoigne and Chris Waddle were creating and scoring goals. Walsh felt that manager Terry Venables was too <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> the players, and particularly too <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> Walsh himself who [...] "needed someone on my case a bit more". He later described the season as [...] "just a blur" [...] as Spurs turned their campaign around to finish in sixth place despite Walsh scoring just six goals from 32 starts and five substitute appearances.|$|E

Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters. She's that person you want in the trenches with you who can take lemons and make lemonade." ...|$|E
