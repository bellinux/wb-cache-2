5|$|As a {{composer}} and pianist, Sorabji was largely self-taught, and he <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the main currents of contemporary musical life {{early in his}} career. He developed a highly idiosyncratic musical language, with roots in composers as diverse as Busoni, Debussy and Szymanowski, and he dismissed large portions of the established and contemporary repertoire.|$|E

5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire to {{distance}} himself from the legacy of the robbery may {{have been one of the}} sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin.

5|$|Yeats was an Irish Nationalist, {{who sought}} {{a kind of}} {{traditional}} lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'.

5|$|Around 1636 the Sejm (Polish parliament) {{opposed the}} {{marriage}} of King Władysław IV Waza to Wiśniowiecki's sister, Anna. Following this, Jeremi <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the royal court, although he periodically returned to Warsaw, usually {{as one of the}} deputies to the Sejm from the Ruthenian Voivodeship. Soon afterward, Jeremi himself married Gryzelda Zamoyska, daughter of Chancellor Tomasz Zamoyski, on 27 February 1639, on Gryzelda's 16th birthday.|$|E

5|$|Because of Barkley's role in {{crafting}} the Railway Labor Act, the Associated Railway Labor Organizations endorsed him {{to unseat}} Ernst {{even before he}} formally announced his candidacy on April 26, 1926. Since the 1923 gubernatorial contest, he had <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> Haly and promised the conservatives {{that he would not}} push a ban on parimutuel betting if elected. Consequently, he had no opposition in the primary. Congressman (and later Chief Justice) Fred M. Vinson managed his general election campaign.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{part of his}} career, Tzara {{combined}} his humanist and anti-fascist perspective with a communist vision, joining the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II, and serving a term in the National Assembly. Having spoken in favor of liberalization in the People's Republic of Hungary just before the Revolution of 1956, he <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the French Communist Party, {{of which he was}} by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the Algerian War.|$|E
5|$|In 1702, Swedish forces {{invaded the}} Commonwealth {{as part of}} the Great Northern War, which had begun in 1700 between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia. Augustus II, king of Poland and Elector of Saxony, was an ally of the Russian tsar Peter I. Augustus's forces were defeated, and the king himself was forced back to Saxony. He was {{replaced}} by Charles with Stanisław Leszczyński, a Polish nobleman and count of the Holy Roman Empire. Poniatowski, serving as a negotiator between the Wielkopolska Confederation and Charles XII, took the side of Leszczyński and <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the Sapiehas, formerly his patrons.|$|E

5|$|In 1910 Yeats {{thought his}} {{horoscope}} suggested {{a return to}} Olivia; he <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently. Pound was fond of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, Pound met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an occasion when Yeats was extremely rude to Pound. A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to Georgie Hyde-Lees, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.|$|E
5|$|In late October, Andrić {{left for}} Belgrade. He became {{involved}} in the city's literary circles and soon acquired the distinction of being one of Belgrade's most popular young writers. Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him, Andrić disliked being a public figure, and went into seclusion and <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> his fellow writers. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupović asking for a transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 20 February, Andrić's request was granted and he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's mission at the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the revelation}} of the character's new design as a cyborg ninja, writers noted how Raiden <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> his {{previous}} appearance that imitated Solid Snake. They also emphasized how Raiden becomes {{a different type of}} game hero with a new, direct fighting style. Since Raiden has become more powerful than Solid Snake in physical strength and weaponry to the point of exaggeration, writers have compared him favorably to other popular game heroes and find his actions still in-character considering the fight scenes throughout the series.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th {{century in}} Japan, peasant revolts, known as ikki, {{became much more}} commonplace. During the turmoil of the Ōnin War (1467–1477) and {{subsequent}} years, these rebellions increased in both frequency and success. Many of these rebels became known as Ikkō-ikki, a collection of peasant farmers, Buddhist monks, Shinto priests, and jizamurai (lesser nobles) who all espoused belief in the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism. Rennyo, the Hongan-ji abbot who led the Jōdo Shinshū movement, attracted a large following in Kaga and Echizen Province, but <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the political goals of the ikki, advocating violence only for self-defense or defense of one's religion.|$|E
5|$|Lenin never {{witnessed}} {{this violence}} or {{participated in it}} first-hand, and publicly <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> it. His published articles and speeches rarely called for executions, but he regularly did so in his coded telegrams and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability. The Party tried to restrain its activities in February 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde was {{succeeded by}} Néstor Kirchner on May 25, 2003. Kirchner soon <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> Duhalde, and removed {{all the people}} close to Duhalde from the {{government}} to reduce his political influence. Kirchner also sought supporters from all {{the social and political}} spectra to counter the influence of Duhalde within the party. However, both men delayed an open dispute and stuck together during the 2003 legislative elections, held in October. The dispute continued in the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their respective wives run for the office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ, and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which was kept by the Kirchners. Cristina Kirchner won those elections.|$|E

5|$|General {{elections}} were held on 10 October 2002 under Musharraf to elect the National Assembly. Abbasi {{ran for a}} seat from Constituency NA-50 (Rawalpindi) as a candidate of the PML (N), but lost to PPP candidate Ghulam Murtaza Satti with 63,797 votes (37.21%) to 74,259 (43.31%). Abbasi indicated that the exile of Sharif disappointed the people, due to which PML (N) only won 19 out of 342 seats in the National Assembly. People from his constituency claim he contested the election unwillingly, explaining why he lost it. After his defeat, he <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> politics to focus on Airblue Limited, which he founded in 2003. He served as its first chairman until 2007 {{and then went on}} to become its chief operating officer. According to BBC Urdu, he had close contacts with Shujaat Hussain, leader of the then ruling party, and from whom Abbasi gained support for his airline.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1796, {{following}} the death of Catherine the Great, Potocki retired to Kurów, Galicia (southern Poland). There he devoted himself to historical studies, publishing several books, translations and commentaries. He also wrote poems, but those were never published during his lifteime. Historians still debate over his potential authorship of several anonymous works (primarily political brochures). He <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> activists discussing a new insurrection, but was nonetheless arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian authorities again in the years 1798–1800. In 1801 he joined the Warsaw Scientific Society. He returned to politics shortly after much of Galicia was liberated by Napoleon and attached to the Duchy of Warsaw. During the negotiations with Napoleon in Dresden he contracted severe diarrhea and died on 30 August 1809. He was buried in Wilanów.|$|E
5|$|Heliade {{progressively}} <b>distanced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> {{the more}} radical groups, especially after discussions began {{on the issue of}} land reform and the disestablishment of the boyar class. Initially, he accepted the reforms, and, after the matter was debated within Frăţia just before rebellion broke out, he issued a resolution acknowledging this (the document was probably inspired by Nicolae Bălcescu). The compromise also set other goals, including national independence, responsible government, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, five-year terms of office for Princes (and their election by the National Assembly), freedom of the press, and decentralization. On June 21, 1848, present in Islaz alongside Tell and the Orthodox priest known as Popa Şapcă, he read out these goals to a cheering crowd, in what was to be the effective start of the uprising (see Proclamation of Islaz). Four days after the Islaz events, the revolution succeeded in toppling Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government which immediately attracted Russian hostility. Presided over by Metropolitan Neofit, it included Heliade, who was also Minister of Education, as well as Tell, Ştefan Golescu, Gheorghe Magheru, and, for a short while, the Bucharest merchant Gheorghe Scurti.|$|E
