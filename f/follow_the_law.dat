5|$|Ramanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is an {{orthodox}} Brahmin and a straightforward consumer protection advocate living in Triplicane, Chennai. He expects everyone to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidence {{always seems to}} favour the accused. He also fails to raise civic awareness due to pervasive corruption and {{a general lack of}} seriousness. Frustrated at his inability to bring about a change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter-ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed serial killer who punishes corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers from his site, and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.|$|E
25|$|When Thorbjørn Jagland gave {{evidence}} in the case, he agreed with Stoltenberg {{that it was not}} necessarily wrong to 'advance' money for memberships, provided that the members in question reimbursed this fee later on. He did, however, tell the court that it was unacceptable to transfer money from AUF's main bank account to pay for membership fees. He also agreed, when pressed by the prosecutor, that membership numbers were too high when he was the leader. In his defense he stated that if AUF were to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> too rigidly, they would only have ended up with a quarter of the membership numbers that the Young Conservatives operated with. He said {{that it would have been}} absurd to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> to the letter.|$|E

The {{destruction}} of the Kingdom of Judah by Babylon in 586BC and the end of kingship was the occasion of much reflection and theological speculation among the Deuteronomistic elite, now in exile in the city of Babylon. They explained the disaster as Yahweh's punishment of their failure to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and created a history of Israel (the books of Joshua through Kings) to illustrate this.|$|E

25|$|In the South, {{church leaders}} and Christians {{began to use}} the Bible and church {{doctrine}} to defend slavery. They had biblical, charitable, evangelistic, social, and political reasonings behind their defense of slavery, including arguments like Biblical figures having owned slaves and that slavery allows African Americans to become Christian. Another prominent reason used to justify slavery {{was the idea that}} Christians should focus on evangelism, stay out of politics, and <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> By 1860, one year {{before the start of the}} American Civil War, 11% of African Americans belonged to a Christian church.|$|E
25|$|The case {{arose from}} a claim by a New Jersey {{manufacturer}} that a Maryland firm had misrepresented {{itself in a}} transaction and thus the contract between the two was unenforceable, precluding the arbitration agreed upon {{in the event of}} a dispute. Abe Fortas wrote for a 6-3 majority that the FAA was broad enough to require arbitration of all issues save the arbitration clause itself. Hugo Black's dissent called the majority's interpretation overbroad and at odds with Congressional intent in passing the law. He feared it would put legal matters in the hands of arbitrators with little or no legal understanding of it nor duty to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{being denied}} a {{marriage}} license, a lesbian couple {{filed a lawsuit}} on October 30, 2013 in the Seventeenth Judicial District. The case, Brinkman v. Long, seeks to overturn the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. The couple was joined on February 18, 2014, by nine other same-sex couples who filed a lawsuit, McDaniel-Miccio v. Hickenlooper, also in state district court, seeking the same outcome. Four of the couples are raising children, and five of the couples have married in other states. The suit named Governor John Hickenlooper and Denver City Clerk Debra Johnson as defendants. Hickenlooper responded by noting Colorado's support for civil unions. Johnson said she supported marriage rights for same-sex couples but was obligated to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> by denying them marriage licenses. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers, a Republican, announced he would defend the state's ban.|$|E

25|$|The {{message of}} St. Paul, (see Paul of Tarsus and Judaism), {{stressed}} that faith in Jesus constituted a new covenant with God, a covenant which essentially provides a 'free gift' of salvation from the harsh edicts of the Mosaic Law (see also Christian liberty). The Law of Moses was considered therefore {{to have little}} relevance to the Pauline Christian community, (see Pauline passages supporting antinomianism), as the sacrifice of the Christ {{was seen as a}} liberation from the demand that a person <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> without deviation, see also Abrogation of Old Covenant laws. This message was taken up by the God-fearers, who already represented a sizable group of people. In Paul's message of salvation through faith as opposed to works, the God-fearers found an essentially Jewish group to which they could belong without the necessity of their accepting Jewish Law. Aside from earning Paul's group a wide following, this view was generalized in the eventual conclusion that converts to Christianity need not first accept all Jewish Law, (see Apostolic Decree), a fact which was indispensable to the popularity of the early Christian movement and which would eventually lead to the distinction between Judaism and Christianity as two separate religions.|$|E
25|$|If {{references}} are made, the Court of Justice {{will give a}} preliminary ruling, {{in order for the}} member state court to conclude the case and award a remedy. The right to an effective remedy is a general principle of EU law, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights article 47. Most of the time Regulations and Directives will set out the relevant remedies to be awarded, or they will be construed from the legislation according to the practices of the member state. It could also be that the government is responsible for failure to properly implement a Directive or Regulation, and must therefore pay damages. In Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss. The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals, and there is a causal link between a member state's violation of EU and a claimant's loss, damages must be paid. The fact that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament is no defence. So, in Factortame it was irrelevant that Parliament had legislated to require a quota of British ownership of fishing vessels in primary legislation. Similarly, in was Brasserie du Pêcheur v Germany the German government was liable to a French beer company for damages from prohibiting its imports, which did not comply with the fabled beer purity law. It was not decisive that the German Parliament had not acted willfully or negligently. It was merely necessary that there was (1) a rule intended to confer rights, (2) that a breach was sufficiently serious, and (3) there was a causal link between the breach and damage. The Court of Justice advised a breach is to be regarded as 'sufficiently serious' by weighing a range of factors, such as whether it was voluntary, or persistent. In Köbler v Republik Österreich the Court of Justice added that member state liability could also flow from judges failing to adequately implement the law. On the other hand, {{it is also clear that}} EU institutions, such as the Commission, may be liable according to the same principles for failure to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> The only institution whose decisions appear incapable of generating a damages claim is the Court of Justice itself.|$|E

O'Connor said Ferraro [...] "has given the world to understand that Catholic teaching is divided {{on the subject of}} abortion", which he said was wrong. Ferraro said that her personal pro-choice views were not something she would force on the nation; she said she would <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of the land as interpreted by the Supreme Court.

In his cases he referred to the parties by name in his judgments rather than as [...] "plaintiff" [...] and [...] "defendant" [...] and used short sentences and a [...] "storytelling" [...] style of speech shown in the case Beswick v Beswick where his judgment started:Old Peter Beswick was a coal merchant in Eccles, Lancashire. He had no business premises. All he had was a lorry, scales, and weights. He used to take the lorry to the yard of the National Coal Board, where he bagged coal and took it round to his customers in the neighbourhood. His nephew, John Joseph Beswick, helped him in his business. In March 1962, old Peter Beswick and his wife were both over 70. He had had his leg amputated and was not in good health. The nephew was anxious to get hold of the business before the old man died. So they went to a solicitor, Mr. Ashcroft, who drew up an agreement for them.|$|E
