40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [67]- 69). Automated Visual Inspection (AVI) has wide {{quality control}} applications. When applying the machine vision for mensuration, AVI {{requires that the}} vision camera is mounted vertically {{to the surface of}} the <b>inspection</b> <b>table.</b> A misalignment makes the acquired visual information dependent of the inspected unit’s position. No inspected unit is placed without positioning errors. Thus, the normal alignment between vision camera and <b>inspection</b> <b>table</b> needs to be verified in order for the risk of unreliable results to be reduced. In this thesis, the unique verification method which checks the required normal alignment is explored and implemented. The normality is verified using the image of a standard reference square collected by the to-be-verified vision camera. The image of a square is a parallelogram if and only if the vision camera is normal to the <b>inspection</b> <b>table.</b> Hence, the parallelism hypotheses are tested to verify the normal alignment. Sensitivity analysis discloses the desirable experimental settings. In addition, field experiments are also carried out. In addition to the normal alignment, the scale factor, the conversion ratio of the scanned image to the acquired image, is needed for mensuration. Once the normal alignment is verified, the scale factor can be identified accurately at negligible cost using the scale calibration method explored in this thesis. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

Animals were bred in confinement and slaughtered in officially inspected facilities in western Parana, Brazil. Thefollowing samples were collected in five replications, at different moments of the slaughter process: 30 chains of mesenteric lymph nodes; 12 swabs of white viscera inspection tables; eight swabs of knives used in lymph nodes inspection; and four swabs of gloves of theinspection staff. Microbiological analysis of the lymph nodes of 150 animals showed Salmonella sp in 17. 3 % (26 / 150) of them.

This document provides a brief comparison of the LIFE laser point design to other state-of-the-art solid-state lasers. Table I compares the attributes of the current LIFE laser point design to other systems. the state-of-the-art for single-shot performance at fusion-relevant beamline energies is exemplified by performance observed on the National Ignition Facility. The state-of-the-art for high average power is exemplified by the Northrup Grumman JHPSSL laser. Several items in Table I deal with the laser efficiency; a more detailed discussion of efficiency can be found in reference 5. The electrical-to-optical efficiency of the LIFE design exceeds that of reference 4 due to the availability of higher efficiency laser diode pumps (70 % vs. {approx} 50 % used in reference 4). LIFE diode pumps are discussed in greater detail in reference 6. The 'beam steering' state of the art is represented by the deflection device that will be used in the LIFE laser, not a laser system. <b>Inspection</b> of <b>Table</b> I shows that most LIFE laser attributes have already been experimentally demonstrated. The two cases where the LIFE design is somewhat better than prior experimental work do not involve the development of new concepts: beamline power is increased simply by increasing aperture (as demonstrated by the power/aperture comparison in Table I), and efficiency increases are achieved by employing state-of-the-art diode pumps. In conclusion, the attributes anticipated for the LIFE laser are consistent with the demonstrated performance of existing solid-state lasers...|$|R

Surrogate standard recoveries from the GSCs were 79 - 120 % except {{as noted in the}} table. One sample was returned with the valve opened. The two general criteria used to assess air quality are the total-non-methane-volatile organic hydrocarbons (NMVOCs) and the total T-value (minus the CO 2 and formaldehyde contributions). Control of atmospheric alcohols is important to the water recovery system engineers, hence total alcohols (including acetone) are also shown for each sample. Octafluoropropane (OFP) has leaked from heat-exchange units in large quantities, so its concentration is tracked separately. Because formaldehyde is quantified from sorbent badges, its concentration is also listed separately. The table shows that the air quality in general was acceptable for crew respiration through the middle of December 2002. No conclusions can be made about the air quality after that date due to NASA's inability to return air samples from the ISS. Alcohols are not being controlled to the recently lowered guideline of 5 mg/m 3, which was recommended to protect the water recovery systems. The airlock sample was taken during the regeneration of Met ox canisters in the adjacent Node. The trace pollutants were not increased above background; however, <b>inspection</b> of <b>table</b> 1 in the appendix shows a CO 2 concentration of 17, 000 mg/cu m, which is a relatively high concentration, but still below the 24 -hour SMAC of 23, 000 mg/cu m. The control of OFP continues to be adequate at least through December 2002. Formaldehyde concentrations suggest that the high levels that were being found in the Lab atmosphere have subsided. This is probably attributable to the restoration of IMV in early February 2003. Before the obstructing material was removed from ducts the Lab formaldehyde concentrations approached 0. 06 mg/cu m, whereas after the repair the levels were near 0. 04 mg/m 3.

The performance of modularity detection algorithms is commonly quantified using simulated networks data. However, a comparison of the modularity algorithms utility for real biological data is scarce. Here we investigate the utility of network modularity algorithms for the classification of ecological plant communities. Plant community classification by the traditional approaches requires prior knowledge about the characteristic and differential species, which are derived from a manual <b>inspection</b> of vegetation <b>tables.</b> Using the raw species abundance data we constructed six different networks that vary in their edge definitions. Four network modularity algorithms were examined for their ability to detect the traditionally recognized plant communities. The use of more restrictive edge definitions significantly increased the accuracy of community detection, that is, the correspondence between network-based and traditional community classification. Random-walk based modularity methods yielded slightly better results than approaches based on the modularity function. For the whole network, the average agreement between the manual classification and the network-based modules is 76 % with varying congruence levels for different communities ranging between 11 % and 100 %. The network-based approach recovered the known ecological gradient from riverside – sand and gravel bank vegetation – to dryer habitats like semidry grassland on dykes.

Now, <b>inspection</b> of the <b>tables</b> contained in the just-published fourth edition of Chambers' Descriptive Astronomy (vol. I) shows that whereas the planetoids discovered in 1868 (the year Prof. Newcomb singles out for comparison) have an average magnitude of 11·56 those discovered last year (1888) have an average magnitude of 12·43. Further, it is observable that though more than ninety have been discovered since Prof. Newcomb wrote, they have by no means become rare: the year 1888 having added ten to the list, and having therefore maintained the average rate of the preceding ten years. If, then, the indications Prof. Newcomb names, had they arisen, would have implied a limitation of the number, these opposite indications imply that the number is unlimited. The reasonable conclusion appears to be that these minor planets are to be counted not by hundreds but by thousands; that more powerful telescopes will go on revealing still smaller ones; and that additions to the list will cease only when the smallness ends in invisibility.|$|R

When Tony Blair's New Labour administration took control in 1997, it sought to establish a programme of organizational, performance, and democratic reform. Initially badged as the modernizing government programme, it was later developed in the Best Value regime for local government, which imposed a centrally-controlled performance regime on all local authorities. This was characterized by a managerialist regime of external <b>inspections,</b> league <b>tables,</b> and reliance on extensive performance management, overseen by the Audit Commission. One of the first acts of the 2010 Coalition government was to dismantle this regime, along with announcing {{the abolition of the}} Audit Commission. This research sought to examine the legacy of the 1997 - 2010 performance regime on six English local authority case studies, identified via a deviant case analysis. An examination of the literature developed a conceptual model of seven dimensions of reform, and the research used an exploratory approach to examine the legacy of the performance regimes through a range of qualitative interviews and focus groups. The inductive analysis of interview data found that financial austerity dominated the local government environment, and the impacts of these cuts were felt across the entire group of case studies. These savings requirements had effectively broken the expectation of continuous improvement explicit in the Best Value duty what we refer to here as the death of improvement. Authorities were reducing staffing, which resulted in the loss of expertise and skills. They were also scaling back many universal services through managed decline, and deregulation of performance regimes was stimulating divergent responses to performance management arrangements, as well as influencing the relationship between politicians and performance management, and central performance staff and departmental staff. There were challenges raised around the residual inspections, largely restricted to social care and education, and how these interacted with central performance team models. The discussion develops a three-part model of performance as a system of governance, which integrates three key areas of theoretical and empirical development: performance management frameworks, accountability, and value for money. This allows four main contributions to knowledge: The concept of public value for money, Further development of our understanding of multiple forms of accountability A new model of performance management zones that articulates different roles for performance management at points within the organization A categorisation of the main changes in reform paradigms It concludes that understanding the values underpinning public sector reforms through a range of interpretive lenses is essential to fully comprehending the impact of reforms at three levels: conceptualization, operationalization, and implementation. The legacy of Comprehensive Performance Assessment and Comprehensive Area Assessment {{can be seen in the}} increased capacity and capability of local authorities to engage with performance management, and data and evidence-driven policy making. Yet, these capabilities may not have prepared authorities sufficiently for the demands of significant budget cuts driven by the post- 2010 political environment...|$|R
