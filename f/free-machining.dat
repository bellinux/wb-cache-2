5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the price rose rapidly {{as a result}} of {{increasing}} demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel.

500|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of a}} broach is the rise per tooth (RPT), which is how much material is removed by each tooth. The RPT varies for each section of the broach, which are the roughing section (tr), semi-finishing section (ts), and finishing section (tf). The roughing teeth remove most of the material so the number of roughing teeth required dictates how long the broach is. The semi-finishing teeth provide surface finish and the finishing teeth provide the final finishing. The finishing section's RPT (tf) is usually zero so that as the first finishing teeth wear the later ones continue the sizing function. For <b>free-machining</b> steels the RPT ranges from [...] For surface broaching the RPT is usually between [...] and for diameter broaching is usually between [...] The exact value depends on many factors.

50|$|A {{practical}} example is as follows. An aircraft maker contracts with a vendor to make parts. A certain {{grade of steel}} is specified for the part because it is strong enough and hard enough for the part's function. The steel is machinable although not <b>free-machining.</b> The vendor decides to mill the parts. The milling can achieve the specified roughness (for example, ≤ 3.2 µm) {{as long as the}} machinist uses premium-quality inserts in the end mill and replaces the inserts after every 20 parts (as opposed to cutting hundreds before changing the inserts). There is no need to add a second operation (such as grinding or polishing) after the milling as long as the milling is done well enough (correct inserts, frequent-enough insert changes, and clean coolant). The inserts and coolant cost money, but the costs that grinding or polishing would incur (more time and additional materials) would cost even more than that. Obviating the second operation results in a lower unit cost and thus a lower price. The competition between vendors elevates such details from minor to crucial importance. It was certainly possible to make the parts in a slightly less efficient way (two operations) for a slightly higher price; but only one vendor can get the contract, so the slight difference in efficiency is magnified by competition into the great difference between the prospering and shuttering of firms.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{machinability}} of BN (Boron Nitride) <b>free-machining</b> steel in turning. Tested work materials were plane carbon steel JIS S 45 C and BN <b>free-machining</b> steel. The JIS S 45 C used as the standard. The tool wear in turning BN <b>free-machining</b> steel was smaller than that in turning standard steel. BN <b>free-machining</b> steel showed slightly lower cutting temperature and smaller cutting force to compare with standard steel at the tested cutting speeds. At the tool wear region of P grade carbide tool after turning BN <b>free-machining</b> steel at high cutting speed, Al and N were detected as a layer. It is thought {{that one of the}} main reasons of outstanding machinability of BN <b>free-machining</b> steel is the deposited layer containing Al and N acts as diffusion barrier at the tool-chip interface.

40|$|Titanium alloys {{are widely}} used in the {{aerospace}} and power generation industries due to their high specific strength and corrosion resistance. Titanium alloys like the modern (α+β) Titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 2 Sn 4 Zr 6 Mo (Ti- 6246) are difficult to machine due {{to the formation of}} long chips which hinders automated manufacturing. In the present study, Lanthanum has been added to Ti- 6246 alloy to improve its machinability, i. e. to reduce the chips’ length. As Lanthanum and Tin form La 5 Sn 3 intermetallic phase, the 2 % of Tin had to be replaced by 3 % of Zirconium. The matrix of Ti 6 Al 7 Zr 6 Mo with Lanthanum contains pure metallic Lanthanum precipitates which have a relatively low melting point compared to Titanium. Besides the standard alloy Ti- 6246 two modifiedalloys, namely, Ti 6 Al 7 Zr 6 Mo 0. 9 La and Ti 6 Al 7 Zr 6 Mo 0. 5 La were investigated. During machining of these new <b>free-machining</b> alloy short and strongly segmented chips are observed enabling automation of machining operations. This can be explained by softening of Lanthanum particles during segmented chip formation. The microstructure, phase composition and the deformability of the new <b>free-machining</b> alloys were analysed after different thermo-mechanical treatments. In addition, the mechanical properties of the modified alloys are investigated which are similar compared to the standard alloy...|$|E

The research presented in this article evaluates the machinability of CuZn 21 Si 3 P as compared to more common, lead-containing <b>free-machining</b> brasses. The results show a marked decrease in the machinability of CuZn 21 Si 3 P. When longitudinally turning CuZn 21 Si 3 P the cutting tool failed after 142  min of machining.

CuZn 21 Si 3 P appears as a viable substitute for lead-containing brasses, thus implying the possibility for improving the sustainability of modern production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the mach {{inability}} of BN <b>free-machining</b> steel in turning with a supplied current of various values and different directions of electrical current. The tested work pieces were, standard steel AISI 1045 and BN added steel (AISI 1045 -BN) based AISI 1045 which has good mach inability at high cutting speed. Turning tests were performed by carbide tool P 30 and the power source for additional electrical current supply was a direct current source and the maximum electrical current in the circuit was 20 milliamperes (mA). To investigate the influence of electrical conditions of closed circuit system on the cutting mechanism of AISI 1045 -BN. The tool life, cutting force, and others were determined experimentally. The testing results show that when turning with carbide tool P 30 the maximum crater depth in the tool was reduced drastically when the value of supplied current reached 5 mA, regardless of its direction of flow, compared with depths at lower current values; the additional electrical current cutting showed smaller cutting force than those of conditions when turning AISI 1045 -BN...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{conductance}} of uncoated oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) copper, 6061 -T 6 aluminum, <b>free-machining</b> brass, and {{304 stainless steel}} sample pairs which were augmented with a gold coated 6061 -T 6 aluminum washer inserted between the contact surfaces was measured over the temperature range of 1. 6 to 6. 0 K, with applied forces from 22 to 670 N. The contact surfaces of the sample pairs were prepared with a 0. 8 micron lapped finish, while the finish of the aluminum washer was 0. 2 micron lapped. The contribution to the overall thermal impedance by the bulk conductance of the aluminum washer was negligible. It was found that addition of the washer offered no significant conductance improvement over an uncoated single contact pair; any benefits from using the gold plated washer were counteracted {{by the addition of}} two more contact surfaces. Additionally, the {{thermal conductance}} of a 'combination' aluminum sample pair having one gold coated and one uncoated surface was measured and compared to the washer pair. The ratio of the conductance of the washer pair to half the conductance of the 'combination' pair was found to be constant and near unity over the temperature range of the data obtained, within experimental error...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to model}} the microstructure development of Si-containing bainitic <b>free-machining</b> steel, including allotriomorphic ferrite, idiomorphic ferrite, pearlite, Widmanstatten ferrite, bainite and martensite. The effect of recalescence has been included to give a better estimation of the cooling curve under natural cooling conditions. A model for estimating retained austenite size distribution in the carbide-free bainitic microstructure has been developed. Manganese sulphide particles {{are used in the}} <b>free-machining</b> steel to break chips during machining; its effect on the prior austenite grain size has been investigated, taking account of the sulphide shape. The theories of all the major solid state phase transformations involved in steel are reviewed in chapter 2. The theory of the simultaneous transformation model is presented in chapter 3. uu A recalescence model dealing with the heat of reaction has been developed in chapter 5 for bar-shaped products. The model is based on the integration of a heat transfer model, considering latent heat generation, into the simultaneous transformation framework. It has been found that latent heat can greatly affect the transformation, {{especially in the case of}} pearlite and Widmanstatten ferrite. Chapter 6 presents the model for estimating the size distribution of retained austenite regions. The model builds on the random division of an austenite grain by bainite sheaves, which means the sizes of the two new compartments generated by the division of an austenite grain by a bainite sheaf are allocated randomly. The next compartment to be divided is also chosen at random. Good agreement between prediction and experiment has been achieved for high carbon carbide-free bainitic microstructures. The transition temperature from upper to lower bainite is modelled in chapter 7. The model compares the time required for decarburising a supersaturated bainitic ferrite platelet and that for cementite precipitation within the ferrite platelet. Manganese, silicon and chromium are considered in the model. It is suggested that carbon and manganese favour lower bainite, whereas silicon promotes upper bainite. The effect of manganese sulphide particles on austenite grain boundary motion has been studied in chapter 8. These rod-shaped particles span many austenite grains; the result shows that the long rod-shaped particles are more effective in pinning the austenite grain boundary than spheres of the same volume, or even strings of identical spheres with the same total volume. Experimental work is presented in chapters 9 and 10. In situ synchrotron X-ray study of the bainite transformation reveals that the distribution of carbon in the residual austenite becomes heterogeneous as transformation progresses. Low carbon regions transform preferentially into martensite during cooling after isothermal bainite transformation. The partitioning of carbon was found to lag behind the bainite transformation; more time is needed as the transformation temperature is reduced. Tetragonality was not observed in either the bainitic ferrite or martensite, because the carbon content of the alloy is relatively low, and the Zener ordering temperature is below the bainite and martensite transformation temperature. No significant difference was observed in the kinetics of bainite transformation between the high sulphur and low sulphur steel. Swiss Steel A...|$|E
40|$|<b>Free-machining</b> brass {{containing}} 2 – 3 % of lead is {{a preferred}} industrial material as it shows excellent machinability where low cutting forces, short chips and reduced tool wear are attained. However this addition of lead, a highly toxic and hazardous material, leads {{to health and}} environmental issues. Alternative lead-free brasses are known for poor chip control and accelerated tool wear. The current study focuses on wear mechanisms of uncoated and coated cemented carbide tools when high-speed machining lead-free CuZn 21 Si 3 P silicon brass. The study shows that severe crater formation on the rake is the dominant tool failure mode. Microscopy observations indicate the diffusion wear mechanism {{to be driven by}} diffusion of cobalt binder into the chips and minor cross-diffusion of copper and zinc. Loss of the binder in cemented carbide is accompanied by adhesive pluck-out of WC grains. As a way to hinder the loss of Co, the diffusion preventing capacity of a-C:H diamond like carbon and (Ti,V,Zr,Nb,Hf,Ta) N nitride coating were tested. SEM, EDX and TEM data show that formation of amorphous SiO 2 and stoichiometric β-SiAlON stable layers was observed on the nitride coating, thus preventing diffusional tool wear. O-rich and N-rich glassy amorphous layers in Si-Al-O-N system with ZnS inclusions were found on the DLC coating. Partial delamination of the DLC coating and removal of the glassy phases resulted in localized crater formation associated with diffusional wear...|$|E
