40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the price stabilizing properties of puttable and <b>extendible</b> <b>bonds,</b> their potential {{to help develop}} interest-rate derivative markets, and their use by governments. Their stabilizing properties imply that, when bond prices fall, prices for puttable and <b>extendible</b> <b>bonds</b> fall by less. Their embedded options work as a cushion and replicate the trading gains from hedging long-term bonds with interest rate derivatives. These bonds can help develop interest-rate derivative markets in developing countries and eventually increase demand for long-term government bonds. Informal evidence from OECD countries suggests that these bonds were useful in the 1980 s, when interest rates were volatile.

40|$|This paper proposes new {{measures}} that {{provide us with}} the level of sequential arbitrage in bond markets. All the measures vanish in an arbitrage-free market and all of them are positive otherwise. Each measure is generated by a dual pair of optimization problems. Primal problems permit us to compute optimal sequential arbitrage strategies, if available. Each dual problem generates a concrete proxy for the term structure of interest rates. The set of proxies allows us to obtain the exact market price of any bond and may measure several effects. For instance, the credit risk spread of nondefault free bonds, or the embedded option price of callable or <b>extendible</b> <b>bonds.</b> The developed theory has been tested empirically.

50|$|<b>Extendible</b> <b>bond</b> (or {{extendable}} bond) is {{a complex}} bond with the embedded option for a holder to extend its maturity date {{by a number of}} years. Such a bond may be considered as a portfolio of a straight, shorter-term bond and a call option to buy a longer-term bond. This relatively rare type of bond works to the advantage of investors during periods of declining interest rates. Pricing of the <b>extendible</b> <b>bond</b> will be similar to that of a puttable bond.|$|E
50|$|An {{embedded}} option is {{a component of}} a financial bond or other security, and usually provides the bondholder or the issuer {{the right to take}} some action against the other party. There are several types of options that can be embedded into a bond. Some common types of bonds with {{embedded option}}s include callable bond, puttable bond, convertible bond, <b>extendible</b> <b>bond,</b> exchangeable bond, and capped floating rate note. A bond may have several options embedded if they are not mutually exclusive.|$|E
