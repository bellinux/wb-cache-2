5|$|Wiseau {{has been}} secretive about {{exactly how he}} {{obtained}} the funding for the project, but he did tell Entertainment Weekly that <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> of the money by importing leather jackets from Korea. According to Sestero in his book The Disaster Artist, Wiseau was already independently wealthy at the time production began, having amassed a fortune over several years of entrepreneurship and real estate development in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco. The budget for The Room reached , all of which was spent on production and marketing. Wiseau has stated that the reason the film was relatively expensive was because {{many members of the}} cast and crew had to be replaced, and each of the cast members had several understudies. According to Sestero, Wiseau made numerous poor decisions during filming that unnecessarily inflated the film's budget, such as building sets for sequences that could have been filmed on location, purchasing unnecessary equipment, and filming identical scenes multiple times using different sets. Sestero further wrote that the film's budget skyrocketed as a result of minutes-long dialogue sequences taking hours or days to shoot due to Wiseau's inability to properly remember his lines or move to the appropriate place on camera.|$|E
