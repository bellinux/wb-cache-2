25|$|Traditional {{computational}} problems {{take the}} perspective that we ask a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes {{the question for}} a while, and then produces an answer and stops. However, there are also problems where we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> system to ever stop. Examples of such problems include the dining philosophers problem and other similar mutual exclusion problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or deadlocks occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{wearing of}} hijab in France {{has been a}} very {{controversial}} issue since 1989. The debate essentially concerns whether Muslim girls who choose to wear hijab may do so in state schools. A secondary issue is how to protect the free choice and other rights of young Muslim women who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> veil, but who may face strong pressure from families or traditionalists. Similar issues exist for civil servants and for acceptance of male Muslim medics in medical services.|$|E

I hope the time will come when the Chemical Warfare Service can be entirely abolished.|$|E
25|$|A survey {{from the}} Justice Ministry reveals that 80% of the {{domestic}} violence victims <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> aggressor to be imprisoned. The victims offer alternative solutions, such as psychological treatment (40%), aggressors discussion groups (30%) and mandatory services to the community (10%) and 9% of the women interviewed reported they felt totally or partially guilty by the violence suffered. To the professor Cristiane Brandão, Criminal Law professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), these numbers {{are the result of}} the predominant patriarchal and sexist Brazilian society.|$|E
25|$|Along with Jiangxi, Henan {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{unbalanced}} gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many parents <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government. Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1–4 age group; this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} get to some of the items and {{progress}} through the game, Bart must use equipment such as rockets and cherry-bombs, which are bought with coins that can be collected by getting rid of aliens. Bart is controlled by the player both on foot and on a skateboard. To get rid of aliens, which are disguised as real humans, he needs to jump on their heads, although some are just regular humans. The game increases in difficulty for every level, and Bart meets up with a boss {{at the end of the}} first four. The levels are familiar to fans of The Simpsons and some of the television humor appears in the game: for example, in the first level Bart can make a prank call to the bartender Moe in order for him to run outside so that the player can spray paint his purple apron (an example of an item that the aliens need) into a red color that the aliens <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want.</b> <b>The</b> game also includes some minigames.|$|E

[...] Senator George was ideal as an opponent as he was a hero to conservatives of both parties for his opposition to the New Deal and his survival of President Franklin D.

We want an immediate response. If we do not receive such a response, we will destroy {{the city and the}} ships that are not revolting." [...] Fonseca, however, refused to allow any direct contact between himself and the mutineers. Instead, the rebel force moved to Ilha do Viana at 1am on 23 November to coal and take on supplies to guard against the possibility of an extended siege. After the sun rose, the bodies of the dead sailors from Minas Geraes were sent on a launch to Ilha das Cobras, along with a letter from João Cândido Felisberto—who was in command of the rebel armada—and his fellow sailors to the Brazilian president Hermes da Fonseca, the nephew of the first president who had been in office for only one week.

The resolution also commended the [...] "current and former government officials, media outlets, and other entities that have encouraged the Washington Redskins franchise to change its team name or that have refused to be complicit in promoting the current team name". In response, the team released a brief statement reiterating their previous position, and quoting two individuals as being both Native American and Redskins fans who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> name to change. The LCCHR issued a press release in 2014 applauding the decision to cancel the trademark protection for the team's name.
