[...] Coach Rene Lachemann said, [...] "If you're one run down, there's nobody you'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey." [...] Teammate Mitchell Page said, [...] "It wasn't until I saw Rickey that <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> {{baseball}} was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1–0. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it." ...|$|E

Crazy Mohan and comedian Aarthi also listed Kadhalikka Neramillai among their favourite films. The film {{was featured in}} a list by The Hindu named [...] "Bring on the laughs". During the celebrations of the film's 50th anniversary, Kamal Haasan appreciated Gopu's dialogue in the film while Y. G. Mahendra said, [...] " [...] was Wodehouseian humour at its best—unadulterated and pure." [...] Director Vasanth noted in 2016, [...] "when I watched Sridhar’s [...] that guarantees three hours of non-stop laughter, <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> filmmaking is all about. A director par excellence is someone who can handle all subjects and infuse all kinds of emotions in the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Eventually, the {{personal}} horror stories Falle heard from {{other women in}} her situation convinced her {{that she needed to}} get out of prostitution. Her substance dependence became so severe that she almost died. Her best friend was killed by her pimp. By this point, many of her friends in the sex industry had died, and she thought that she would be next. One night, Falle was hiding alone in a hotel room when she found a Bible placed there by Gideons International. She began reading the Psalms and later said, [...] "For the first time <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> God was saying to me. That night my life began to move in a new direction." [...] On her 27th birthday, Falle left her husband and returned to her mother. Because of the delusions, Falle did not recognize her mother, thinking she had been replaced with a clone. Falle told her mother about being dependent on cocaine, entering prostitution, and marrying her pimp. Her mother accepted her back. It took several more years before Falle gave up hope that her husband would change.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1989 {{interview}} with radio host Timothy White, Townshend apparently acknowledged his bisexuality, referencing the song [...] "Rough Boys" [...] on his 1980 album, Empty Glass. He called the song a [...] "coming out, {{an acknowledgment of}} the fact that I'd had a gay life, and that <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> gay sex was about." [...] However, in a 1994 interview for Playboy, he said, [...] "I did an interview about it, saying that [...] "Rough Boys" [...] was about being gay, and in the interview I also talked about my [...] "gay life," [...] which—I meant—was actually about the friends I've had who are gay. So the interviewer kind of dotted the t's and crossed the i's and assumed that this was a coming out, which it wasn't at all." [...] Townshend later wrote in his 2012 autobiography Who I Am that he at one point felt as if he was [...] "probably bisexual". Townshend also stated jokingly that he once felt sexually attracted to The Rolling Stones lead singer, Mick Jagger.|$|E
2500|$|Nimoy {{continued}} to develop Spock alongside individual directors. When work was underway on [...] "Amok Time", he discussed with Joseph Pevney how Vulcans would greet each other. Nimoy suggested {{the use of}} a hand signal from the Priestly Blessing as performed by Jewish Kohen. He had seen this as a child, although Nimoy's father had told him not to look as they performed the blessing. This became the basis for the Vulcan salute. Solow later said that Nimoy was the key contributor to the character's depiction, saying that the [...] "Mr Spock character was 20% created by Gene Roddenberry, 20% created by me and 60% created by Leonard Nimoy". Nimoy recalled, [...] "As a Jew from Catholic Boston, <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> it was like to feel alienated, apart from the mainstream... {{there were a number of}} values in Star Trek that I felt very comfortable with as a Jew". The character influenced Nimoy as well; years after the show he wrote that [...] "To this day, I sense Vulcan speech patterns, Vulcan social attitudes and even Vulcan patterns of logic and emotional suppression in my behavior." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Jerry Buss died in 2013, his 66% {{controlling}} {{ownership of}} the Lakers passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote. [...] Jerry's succession plan had Jeanie assume his previous title as the Lakers' governor {{as well as its}} team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings. After the season, the Lakers were unable to resign the free agent Howard, who joined the Houston Rockets while accepting $30 million less than the Lakers offer. Sister Jeanie commented that she [...] "would be more comfortable [...] if <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> the [...] decision process was, and I’m not always involved in it." [...] In 2013–14, Jeanie became Lakers president, and her role included overseeing the team's basketball operations while working with Buss, who continued as Lakers executive VP of basketball operations. Former Lakers player and part owner Magic Johnson, who was also close to Buss' father, believed that Buss needed to put aside his ego and seek assistance to help the Lakers recruit against rival teams for free agent players. That season, Buss signed Bryant to a two-year extension worth $48.5 million, even before Bryant had recovered from an Achilles tendon tear. The Los Angeles Times called the deal [...] "one of many terrible Lakers moves" [...] that year.|$|E
