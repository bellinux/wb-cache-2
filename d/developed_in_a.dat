5|$|In {{parallel}} with the work on uranium {{was an effort to}} produce plutonium. After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor was demonstrated in Chicago at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium.

5|$|The Arabian <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{desert climate}} and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and {{protection}} from theft. Selective breeding for traits including {{an ability to}} form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.|$|E

The German leadership hoped that a barrage of rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war.

5|$|The second {{version of}} the project, {{tentatively}} called Chrono Trigger: Brink of Time then Chrono Resurrection, started development in April 2003. Lazur has given several reasons to explain his willingness to restart the project, including his experience coding for the Dreamcast Visual Memory Unit, programming for game developer DC Studios, and playing Chrono Cross, the official sequel to Chrono Trigger for PlayStation. Unlike CT64, the second version would be a short demo <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cross-platform engine with a single 3D playing mode. The Windows version was planned for a free Internet release, while Nintendo GameCube and Xbox ports would be reserved for official developers with access to development kits of {{either of the two}} consoles.|$|E

5|$|Andrei Kolmogorov <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1931 paper a {{large part}} of the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes. Kolmogorov was partly {{inspired}} by Louis Bachelier's 1900 work on fluctuations in the stock market as well as Norbert Wiener's work on Einstein's model of Brownian movement. He introduced and studied a particular set of Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes. Independent of Kolmgorov's work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, now called the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement. The differential equations are now called the Kolmogorov equations or the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations. Other mathematicians who contributed significantly to the foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in the 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|During {{the concept}} phase {{there were four}} people working on the Hitman Go. Initial prototypes were built on paper using printed out characters. The project was pitched and greenlit for {{production}} in mid 2013. Daniel Lutz served as creative director, and the team size peaked at eleven people throughout {{the remainder of the}} game's development. The studio looked at several different engines for building the game, but opted with Unity early on as it had a low barrier of entry, provided support for the main mobile platforms, and some members of the development team had previous experience creating projects in the game engine. An initial working prototype and a basic level editor were <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few days and after two weeks the first version of the game was presented to the remainder of the studio.|$|E
5|$|Only six {{tropical}} cyclones {{were observed}} in the Eastern Pacific during this season, which is well below the 1949–2006 average of 13 per year. Of the six tropical cyclones, two only attained hurricane status. In addition, none of the tropical cyclones became a major hurricane, which is Category 3 or greater on Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Although it is an oddity for no major hurricanes to occur during a season since the satellite era began, nearly all hurricane seasons during this time period lacked a major hurricane. However, {{it is likely that}} other tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific basin in 1949 went operationally unnoticed, due to lack of modern technology such as satellite imagery. In addition to the six tropical cyclones, another tropical cyclone developed in the Eastern Pacific basin, but was included in the Atlantic basin hurricane database, rather than the Eastern Pacific. Most of the seven tropical cyclones did not differentiate in intensity during the duration, with the exception of Hurricane Six. The first two tropical cyclones of the season formed in quick succession in during mid-June, however, the months of July and August went dormant in terms of tropical cyclogenesis. The last five tropical cyclones, including the additional storm, also <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quick sequence, all of which forming from in a span of 17 days. By October 1, all tropical cyclonic activity had completely ceased.|$|E

5|$|The 1984–85 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} an average cyclone season. Tropical {{cyclones}} in this basin are {{monitored by the}} Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Réunion. The first storm formed in mid-November, {{though it was not}} officially named. A few days later, the first official storm of the year (Anety) formed. In December, one storm formed. During January 1985, two tropical cyclones formed {{towards the end of the}} month. Three more systems <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> short period of time in early to mid-February. After nearly two more months of inactivity, an unusually powerful late season storm developed (Helisaonina) in mid-April, which was the strongest storm of the year. While a number of storms during the season reached severe tropical storm status, only one of those intensified further. Even though two tropical cyclones this year made landfall, no known damage was recorded.|$|E
5|$|The PS3 {{client was}} <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{collaborative}} effort between Sony and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March23, 2007. Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s. On September18 {{of the following}} year, the PS3 client became a channel of Life with PlayStation on its launch. In the types of calculations it can perform, {{at the time of}} its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed. However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home. The PS3's uniform console environment made technical support easier and made Folding@home more user friendly. The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclogenesis}} in the 1992 Atlantic {{hurricane season}} {{began with the}} development of Subtropical Storm One on April 21. However, over the next three months, minimal activity occurred, with only two depressions developing, one in June and the other in July. Although wind shear was relatively weak in August, only one tropical cyclone occurred in that month. However, that one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Andrew, was the strongest and costliest of the season. Though September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, an increase in wind shear prevented tropical cyclogenesis {{in the first half of}} the month. After September 16, however, five tropical cyclones <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> span of nine days, from September 17 to 26. Thereafter, activity abruptly halted, and only one tropical cyclone developed in October, Hurricane Frances. By October 27, Frances became extratropical, which was more than a month before the official end of the season on November 30.|$|E

5|$|Unable to move north, the North Koreans {{attempted}} to breakout {{across the open}} rice fields to the west, through {{the gap between the}} 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and US 187 RCT. The North Koreans again suffered heavy casualties, with many cut down by tank and rifle fire from C Company, 3 RAR. Some of the survivors took refuge among a number of haystacks and rice stooks in front of 9 Platoon, from where they engaged the Australians with sniper fire. Others fled east, escaping to the higher ground where they dispersed. D Company, 3 RAR was subsequently ordered to clear pockets of resistance remaining within the battalion position. Meanwhile, the Middlesex battalion passed through the Australians and, with the tanks, linked up with US 187 RCT at 11:00. Following three hours of fighting the battle was largely over by midday; however, many of the North Koreans that had been unable to escape continued to refuse to surrender, hiding or feigning death until individually flushed out. After clearing their objectives 7 and 8 Platoon had moved forward towards 9 Platoon, which then clashed with a number of North Korean stragglers in the paddy fields. C Company, 3 RAR subsequently deployed in an extended line and a substantial action soon <b>developed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> scene Coad later likened to driving snipe, the Australians subsequently proceeded to sweep the area, kicking over stacks of straw and shooting the North Korean soldiers they found hiding in them as they {{attempted to}} flee.

5|$|Vamei <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vortex {{that appears}} every winter along the {{northwest}} coast of Borneo and is {{maintained by the}} interaction between monsoonal winds and the local topography. Often, the vortex remains near the coastline, and {{in an analysis of}} 51winters, only six reported the vortex as being over the equatorial waters for four days or more. As the area in the South China Sea between Borneo and Singapore is only 665km (415mi) wide, a vortex needs to move slowly to develop. A persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days, which is needed to enhance the vortex, is present, on average, nine days each winter. The probability for a pre-existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10–30percent. Thus, the conditions which resulted in the formation of Vamei are believed to occur once every 100–400years.|$|E
