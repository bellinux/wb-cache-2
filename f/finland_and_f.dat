40|$|We {{recently}} reported a high divergence among African subtype F strains. Three well-separated groups (F 1, <b>F</b> 2, <b>and</b> <b>F</b> 3) {{have been shown}} based on the phylogenetic analysis of the p 24 gag and envelope sequences with genetic distances similar to those observed for known subtypes. In this study, we characterized the near-full-length genomes of two strains from epidemiological unlinked individual belonging {{to each of the}} subgroups : F 1 (96 FR-MP 411), F 2 (95 CM-MP 255 and 95 CM-MP 257), <b>and</b> <b>F</b> 3 (96 CM-MP 535 and 97 ZR-EQTB 11). Phylogenetic analysis of the near-full-length sequences and for each of the genes separately showed the same three groups, supported by high bootstrap values. Diversity plotting, BLAST subtyping, and bootstrap plotting confirmed that the divergent F strains correspond to nonrecombinant viruses. The divergence between <b>F</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>F</b> 2 is consistently lower than that seen in any other intersubtype comparison, with the exception of subtypes B and D. Based on all the different analyses, we propse to divide subtype F into two subclades, with F 1 gathering the known subtype strains from Brazil <b>and</b> <b>Finland,</b> <b>and</b> our African strain (96 FR-MP 411), <b>and</b> <b>F</b> 2 containing the 95 CM-MP 255 and 95 CM-MP 257 strains from Cameroon. The F 3 strains, 97 ZR-EQTB 11 from the Democratic Republic of Congo and 96 CM-MP 535 from Cameroon, meet the criteria of a new subtype designated as K. The equidistance of subtype K to the other subtypes of HIV- 1 suggests that this subtype existed as long as the others, the lower distance between B and D, <b>and</b> between <b>F</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>F</b> 2 suggest a more recent subdivision for these latter strains.
