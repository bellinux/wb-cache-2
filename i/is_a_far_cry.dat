The Shoah must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality....The Shoah has become our instant raison d'etre, the {{short-cut}} answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? Why should I join a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? Why should I be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' That answer will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from living 'yes' to Judaism.|$|E

[...] John Mitchel of MTV included the video on the list [...] "Beyonce, Britney And Madonna: What To Expect When You're Expecting— Music Video Edition" [...] in 2011.

500|$|In 1928, a {{year after}} Cushing opened, Keene Richards, Vassar College's general manager, wrote to college {{president}} Henry Noble MacCracken that Cushing was [...] "neither luxurious nor extravagant." [...] Authors Karen Van Lengen and Lisa Reilly countered this sentiment in their 2004 architectural guide to the campus, noting that [...] "Cushing's cozy domesticity <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the institutional nature of collegiate residential architecture found on other college campuses" [...] and concluding that the dorm {{was one of the}} most beautiful buildings on campus. Another guide, compiled in 2003 by the staff of the Yale Daily News, identified the dorm as one of the two most popular at the college, along with Jewett House. Cushing has drawn comparisons to the fictitious Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry according to The Miscellany News. The building's parlor was singled out in College Prowler's 2012 guide to the college as the most beautiful at Vassar.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{received}} {{moderate to}} poor reviews. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times termed it [...] "a pleasant, lazy romance... Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hammerstein {{in a minor}} key". John Chapman of the Daily News stated, [...] "Perhaps Hammerstein and Rodgers are too gentlemanly {{to be dealing with}} Steinbeck's sleazy and raffish denizens." [...] Walter Kerr of the Herald Tribune suggested, [...] "Someone seems to have forgotten to bring along that gallon of good, red wine." [...] John McClain of the Journal-American stated, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the exalted talents of the team that produced South Pacific. They must be human, after all." [...] Steven Suskin, in his book chronicling Broadway opening night reviews, stated that Pipe Dream received one favorable review from the seven major New York critics, two mixed, and four unfavorable. Louis Kronenberger, in Time magazine, summed it up as [...] "roficient, professional, and disappointing." [...] Billy Rose said of Pipe Dream, [...] "You know why Oscar shouldn't have written that?

2500|$|During {{the large}} {{condominium}} real estate {{boom of the}} 2000s, nearly 50 new condominium buildings were constructed in the greater downtown area, which along with fare elimination, correlated with a doubling in Metromover ridership throughout the decade. The mid 2010s is seeing another large development boom [...] Two very large projects are incorporating Metromover stations for direct access. Brickell City Centre closed the Eighth Street Station in 2014 to renovate and incorporate it into their project; Miami Worldcenter may incorporate both the Freedom Tower and Park West stations, {{in addition to a}} possible connection to All Aboard Florida's MiamiCentral station. This dense downtown development cannot be considered exclusive transit-oriented development, however, as many locations throughout the region have many high-rise and other large buildings without permanent transit infrastructure. It is more a reflection of zoning allowance; the current Miami 21 zoning code in the city of Miami lends itself to larger development, with densities up to 1,000 units per acre, and taller buildings downtown or in transit corridors, though it also sets strict and controversial parking space minimums. In addition, public transit is not considered a priority to the many high-income condo buyers, who often seek ample parking; despite this, proximity to transit if often included in the marketing of these towers. In contrast to traditional transit-oriented development, much of the real estate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from affordable housing geared toward lower and middle income residents. Real estate developers are generally required to pay high impact fees for these large buildings, the profits of which are intended to go to public infrastructure such as schools and transportation. The City of Miami impact fees ordinance was amended in 2005 due to the high amount of development at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, {{said that}} the Supreme Court has never ruled that {{companies}} have religious beliefs and that [...] "it has never held that religious exercise provides a license to harm others, or violate the rights of third parties." [...] Louise Melling, ACLU deputy legal director, said religious freedom [...] "gives us all the right to hold our beliefs, but it doesn't give {{you the right to}} impose your beliefs on others, to discriminate against others." [...] The editorial board of The New York Times wrote that the decision [...] "swept aside accepted principles of corporate law and religious liberty to grant owners of closely held, for-profit companies an unprecedented right to impose their religious views on employees." [...] A Fox News columnist wrote, [...] "..., with all of the debate about the religious beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners, what about the religious beliefs of their employees? They are just as important, and should not be trampled upon." [...] The director of the United Church of Christ's Washington, D.C. office, {{said that the}} ruling [...] "may embolden private employers to claim religious objections to particular health care services, in effect forcing their own religious views upon their employees." [...] Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, [...] "It's the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means that the ... corporation's employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees." [...] The Center for American Progress said that the ruling [...] "moves in the direction this court has been moving already, which is talking about corporate personhood—really treating corporations like people, saying that the corporation has a religion itself and that should be imposed on its employees." [...] Interfaith Alliance leader Rev. Welton Gaddy said, [...] "The First Amendment is at its best when it is used {{to protect the rights of}} minorities from the whims of the powerful. Today's decision, which gives the powerful the right to force their religious beliefs on those around them, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the best traditions of religious freedom." ...|$|E
