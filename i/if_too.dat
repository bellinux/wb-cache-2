5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy <b>if</b> <b>too</b> many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E
5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. <b>If</b> <b>too</b> thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. <b>If</b> <b>too</b> many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, {{the company}} spun-off its box, locks, and packing and moving {{supplies}} business into the PS Orangeco subsidiary; Public Storage {{said this was}} done to avoid {{the risk of losing}} the company's tax-free REIT status <b>if</b> <b>too</b> large a portion of the company's business is no longer related to real estate. This frustrated institutional investors that can only invest in real estate companies and could no longer invest in the new non-real estate subsidiaries. By 1998, Public Storage had $141 million in quarterly revenues, $2 billion in assets and 1,200 facilities in 38 states. Later that year, Public Storage acquired a competing storage company called Storage Trust Realty in a $600 million transaction.|$|E
5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. <b>If</b> <b>too</b> many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
5|$|Each {{state was}} allowed to cast a single vote either for or against a {{proposal}} during the debates {{in accordance with the}} majority opinion of the state's delegates. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly come and go, with only 30–40 being present on a typical day. Consequently, if a state's delegates were equally divided in their views on a given proposal, or <b>if</b> <b>too</b> few of the state's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal, that state's delegation had essentially no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal. Thus, for example, after two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates.|$|E

5|$|When {{producing}} a particular chocolate {{for the first}} time, a mini-game is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon. The ingredients and quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe. Each time a circle {{is filled with the}} correct ingredients, it is removed and an empty circle put in its place. The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. <b>If</b> <b>too</b> many ingredients are wasted by misfiring the cannon, production is brought to a halt and the mini-game must be attempted again. The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week. The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct ingredients, and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory. Playing the mini-game advances in-game time by one week. Different chocolate types, such as truffles and squares, require the factory to be upgraded first, costing money.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Jodie, the game {{includes}} interactive objects {{marked with a}} white dot, which can be interacted with by tilting the controller stick in its direction. If Jodie must perform a specific action, icons pop {{up on the screen}} to prompt the player to press and/or hold certain controller buttons. Conversation prompts float in the air, defaulting to a certain choice <b>if</b> <b>too</b> much time passes before selection. During action sequences, like chases or hand-to-hand combat, the cinematography moves into slow motion whilst Jodie performs the physical manoeuvre; during this time, the player must determine the direction Jodie is moving and push the controller stick in that direction to complete the action. Other sequences require real-time stealth, which has the player sneak Jodie through environments while coordinating certain actions with Aiden. Failing certain action sequences will alter the course of a chapter (and sometimes later chapters) and in some cases lead to the death of a non-playable character.|$|E

25|$|To improve {{tenderness}} of beef, it {{is often}} aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished using vacuum packaging to reduce spoilage and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, <b>if</b> <b>too</b> humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.|$|E

25|$|Air entraining agents add and entrain tiny {{air bubbles}} in the concrete, which reduces damage during {{freeze-thaw}} cycles, increasing durability. However, entrained air entails a trade off with strength, as each 1% of air may decrease compressive strength 5%. <b>If</b> <b>too</b> much air becomes {{trapped in the}} concrete {{as a result of}} the mixing process, Defoamers can be used to encourage the air bubble to agglomerate, rise to the surface of the wet concrete and then disperse.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{is killed}} by hitting {{it with the}} hooked beak, aiming for the skull in vertebrates. <b>If</b> <b>too</b> large to swallow in {{one or a few}} chunks, it is transported to a feeding site by {{carrying}} it in the beak or (<b>if</b> <b>too</b> large) in the feet. The feet are not suited for tearing up prey, however. It is rather impaled upon a sharp point – thorns or the barbs of barbed wire – or wedged firmly between forking branches. Thus secured, the food can be ripped into bite-sized pieces with the beak. Orthoptera that the birds have recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days, until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded. Great grey shrikes have also been observed to impale common toads (Bufo bufo) and skin them – by ripping open the back skin and pulling it over the head – to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions. Large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested, but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
