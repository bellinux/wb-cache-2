5|$|The X-Files {{was filmed}} in the hiatus between the show's {{fourth and fifth}} seasons and re-shoots were {{conducted}} during the filming of the show's fifth season. Due {{to the demands of}} the film shoot on the actors' schedules, some episodes of the fifth season did not revolve around both Mulder and Scully but <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two lead stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrangement}} of genitalia {{is important in}} courtship and mating as they prevent cross-specific mating and hybridisation. The uniqueness of a species' genitalia led {{to the use of}} the morphological study of genitalia as one of the most important keys in taxonomic identification of taxa below family level. With the advent of DNA analysis, the study of genitalia has now become <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> techniques used in taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to form two groups, Belle Amie and One Direction, from soloists {{at the end}} of the bootcamp stage was branded unfair by some of the other groups, as neither had entered the competition as groups. The controversy deepened after Cowell put through both Belle Amie and One Direction and picked <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original applicants. Cowell defended the decision, saying that the existing groups were not good enough and other groups such as The Wanted and the Spice Girls were created similarly.|$|E

5|$|The {{male and}} female {{dichotomy}} of polar opposites with the former oppressing the latter at all times is refuted in the Indian context because it was men who initiated social reform movements against various social evils. Patriarchy is <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hierarchies. Relational hierarchies between women within the same family are more adverse. Here women are pitted against one another. Not all women are powerless at all times.|$|E
5|$|At 03:13, U-156 {{attacked}} the Texaco-owned tanker SS Arkansas which was berthed at Eagle Beach {{next to the}} Arend/Eagle Refinery. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torpedoes struck Arkansas and partially sank her but the damage was moderate and caused no casualties. Commander Hartenstein then steamed further around Aruba and directed his men {{to take to the}} deck guns and prepare for a naval bombardment of the large oil tank of the Lago Oil and Transport Company The crew of the 10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun forgot to remove the tampion from the barrel, so when Hartenstein ordered them to fire, the gun blew up. Gunnery Officer Dietrich von dem Borne was wounded badly, one foot having been severed. His comrade and trigger man Heinrich Büssinger was badly wounded as well and died several hours after the attack. Hartenstein ordered the 3.7cm flak gun to continue the attack, causing only superficial damage.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City were {{struggling}} in the Second Division {{at the time}} of Cowan's signing, having won just one of their first ten games of the 1935–36 season. Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2–2 draw with Swindon Town, {{but it was not until}} Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season. Cowan missed just three of the club's remaining fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th. The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North).|$|E

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} enquiries {{from other}} clubs, he stayed at Vicarage Road for pre-season, {{in the hope}} of regaining his match fitness. After proving that he had recovered, Gibbs was offered a short term contract at the club, which was eventually extended. Newly relegated Watford finished 13th of 24 teams in 1996–97. They conceded 38 goals in 46 league matches, the joint-best defensive record in the division. Gibbs missed <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's 57 fixtures, scoring in a game against Brentford. The defender later noted the irony that having been released as an injury concern, he ended up playing more games the following season than any of his teammates.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, the {{production}} of weapons and equipment was highly centralised (and presumably standardised) {{in a number of}} major state-run arms factories, or fabricae, documented in the Notitia. It is unknown when these were first established, but they certainly existed by the time of Diocletian. In the 2nd century, there is evidence of fabricae inside legionary bases and even in the much smaller auxiliary forts, staffed by the soldiers themselves. But there is no evidence, literary or archaeological, of fabricae outside military bases and staffed by civilians during the Principate (although their existence cannot be excluded, as no archaeological evidence has been found for the late fabricae either). Late fabricae were located in border provinces and dioceses. Some were general manufacturers producing both armour and weapons (fabrica scutaria et armorum) or <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two. Others were specialised in {{one or more of the}} following: fabrica spatharia (sword manufacture), lanciaria (spears), arcuaria (bows), sagittaria (arrows), loricaria (body armour), clibanaria (cataphract armour), and ballistaria (catapults).|$|E
5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, {{as noted by}} Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even lighter than the main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female {{is evident in the}} fact that the female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E

5|$|In {{first-class}} matches during 1892, Peel scored 772 runs at 19.79 {{and took}} 121 wickets at 16.80. Additionally, in a non-first-class games against Leicestershire, he scored 226 {{as well as}} taking five wickets in Leicestershire's first innings. In the 1893 season, he took slightly more wickets at a lower average (126 at 14.51) but his run aggregate fell to 550 runs at 13.75. He {{was part of a}} successful Yorkshire team. The county won their first official County Championship title and the team was no longer as dependent on Peel with the ball—Ted Wainwright took more wickets than he did. The Australians toured England once again, but Peel played in <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three Test matches. He did not take a wicket, did little with the bat, and was left out of the team for the second Test. As the Australians had proved poor on the field, Lord Hawke withdrew Peel and Stanley Jackson from the team for the third Test so that they could play for Yorkshire. In 1894, Peel scored 699 runs at 16.25, failing to score a half-century. With the ball, he took 145 wickets at 13.44. During the season, he was awarded a benefit match at Bradford, which raised £2,000. The retirement of George Ulyett that season made Peel the team's senior professional, an important position at the time.|$|E
5|$|On July 10, 2005 a new trolley station {{opened on}} the SDSU campus, after {{construction}} began in 1999. The station connected students and faculty with other areas in San Diego county and helped to combat the low availability of parking around campus. The $103 million station was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university's several construction projects {{that occurred in the}} 2000s. Starting in the late 1990s, a $500 million College Community Redevelopment Project {{led to the development of}} the $8.5 million Piedra del Sol Apartments, the $14.3 million Fraternity Row, and future developments of a $15 million Sorority Row, a $150 million Paseo retail, office, and apartment project, as well as a $125 million research and office park. In 2003, a pedestrian bridge opened, connecting several of the dorms to the main campus. In the same year, the campus's most technologically advanced and largest classroom (capable of holding 500 students) was completed. Through 2008 and 2009, the campus began work on constructing a new alumni center, expanding Aztec Center, and modifying Storm Hall and Nasitir Hall to add more office and classroom space.|$|E
5|$|Production of the D-1 variant {{started in}} 1941 with 495 ordered. These {{aircraft}} were delivered between May 1941 and March 1942. The RLM wanted 832 machines produced from February 1941. The Weserflug company was tasked with their production. From June to September 1941, 40 Ju 87 Ds {{were expected to}} be built, increasing to 90 thereafter. Various production problems were encountered. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planned 48 was produced in July. Of the 25 the RLM hoped for in August 1941, none were delivered. Only in September 1941 did the first two of the planned 102 Ju 87s roll off the production lines. The shortfalls continued to the end of 1941. During this time, the WFG plant in Lemwerder moved production to Berlin. Over 165 Ju 87s had not been delivered and production was only 23 Ju 87 Ds per month out of the 40 expected. By the spring of 1942 to the end of production in 1944, 3,300 Ju 87s, mostly D-1s, D-2s and D-5s had been manufactured.|$|E

5|$|Sledd had not {{anticipated}} that the Lake City campus would be abandoned, and had assumed {{that it would be}} selected as the location of the newly consolidated men's university, placing him in a strong position to become the first president of the new institution. The selection of Gainesville for the campus of the new men's university put Sledd's future as its first president in question. The University of Florida in Lake City was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four existing institutions that were to be merged to form the new university, and there were other possible candidates for the presidency. Albert A. Murphree, president of Florida State College in Tallahassee, was the favorite of several prominent members of the legislature. But Sledd had Governor Broward's backing, and the Board of Control ultimately selected him to be the first president on June 7, 1905; Sledd's appointment was for a single year, but renewable on an annual basis, as was typical in the university's early years when the Board of Control appointed or re-appointed the presidents of the state's public colleges for each academic year. Murphree remained the president of the newly consolidated women's college in Tallahassee until 1909.|$|E
