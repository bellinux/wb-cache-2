After the protracted ground-controlled interception, the three Su-15 fighters (from nearby Dolinsk-Sokol airbase) and the MiG-23 (from Smirnykh Air Base) managed to make visual contact with the Boeing. The pilot of the lead Su-15 fighter fired warning shots, but recalled later in 1991, [...] "I fired four bursts, more than 200 rounds. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> it did.

500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{gave it a}} [...] "fresh" [...] 95% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 43 reviews and Metacritic gave it a 73, signifying [...] "generally favorable reviews". Many focused on the film's ending title cards: several compared them to a public service announcement, and Philip Kemp of Sight & Sound wrote, [...] "All that's missing is the address we should send donations to." [...] Zhang Xiaoling, on the other hand, considered the titles to be an implicit criticism {{of the state of}} rural education in China, saying, [...] "the news that voluntary contributions have helped 15 percent of the pupils to return to school is aimed to give rise to a question: what about the remaining 85 percent?" [...] The disagreement about the title cards is also reflected in the critical reaction {{to the rest of the}} film's resolution. Kemp described the ending as [...] "feelgood" [...] and criticized the film for portraying officials and generous cityfolk as coming to the rescue, The Washington Posts Desson Howe called the ending [...] "flag-waving", and The Independents Gilbert Adair called it [...] "sugary". Alberto Barbera of the Venice Film Festival, on the other hand, said that while the end of the film may have been like propaganda, the rest was a [...] "strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for the country children". Likewise, Zhang Xiaoling argued that although the film superficially appears to praise the city people and officials, its subtext is harshly critical of them: he pointed out that the apparently benevolent TV station manager seems to be motivated more by audience ratings than by altruism, that the receptionist's callous manner towards Wei is a result of Chinese [...] "bureaucratism and nepotism", and that <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> things about the city, Zhang Huike's clearest memory of city life is having to beg for food. Zhang and Kraicer both argued that critics who see the film as pro-government propaganda are missing the point and, as Kraicer put it, [...] "mistaking [...] layer as the message of the film... mistaking the part for the whole". David Ansen of Newsweek and Leigh Paatsch of the Herald Sun each pointed out that, while the film is [...] "deceptive" [...] positive at face value, it has harsh criticism [...] "bubbling under the surface". Chinese critics Liu Xinyi and Xu Su of Movie Review recognized the dispute abroad over whether the film was pro- or anti-government, but made no comment; they praised the film for its realistic portrayal of hardships facing rural people, without speculating about whether Zhang intended to criticize or praise the government's handling of those hardships. Hao Jian of Film Appreciation, on the other hand, was more critical, claiming that the movie was organized around a political message and was intended to be pro-government. Hao said that Not One Less marked the beginning of Zhang's transformation from an outspoken independent director to one of the government's favorites.|$|E

50|$|Sphinx, like classic SQL databases, {{works with}} a {{so-called}} fixed schema, that is, a set of predefined attribute columns. These work well {{when most of the}} data stored actually has values: mapping sparse data to static columns can be cumbersome. Assume for example that you’re running a price comparison or an auction site with many different products categories. Some of the attributes like the price or the vendor are identical across all goods. But from there, for laptops, you also need to store the weight, screen size, HDD type, RAM size, etc. And, say, for shovels, you probably want to store the color, the handle length, and so on. So it’s manageable across a single category, but <b>all</b> <b>the</b> distinct fields that you need <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> across <b>all</b> <b>the</b> categories are legion. The JSON field can be used to overcome this. Inside the JSON attribute you don’t need a fixed structure. You can have various keys {{which may or may not}} be present in all documents. When you try to filter on one of these keys, Sphinx will ignore documents that don’t have the key in the JSON attribute and will work only with those documents that have it.|$|R
