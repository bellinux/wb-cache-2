40|$|AIMS: Thrombin plays a {{key role}} in the {{clinical}} syndrome of unstable angina. We investigated the safety and efficacy of five dose levels of <b>efegatran</b> sulphate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, compared to heparin in patients with unstable angina. METHODS: Four hundred and thirty-two patients with unstable angina were enrolled. Five dose levels of <b>efegatran</b> were studied sequentially, ranging from 0. 105 mg. kg(- 1). h(- 1) to 1. 2 mg. kg(- 1). h(- 1) over 48 h. Safety was assessed clinically, with reference to bleeding and by measuring clinical laboratory parameters. Efficacy was assessed by the number of patients experiencing any episode of recurrent ischaemia as measured by computer-assisted continuous ECG ischaemia monitoring. Clinical end-points were: episodes of recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, coronary intervention (PTCA or CABG), and death. RESULTS: <b>Efegatran</b> demonstrated dose dependent ex-vivo anticoagulant activity with the highest dose level of 1. 2 mg. kg(- 1). h(- 1) resulting in steady state mean activated partial thromboplastin time values of approximately three times baseline. Thrombin time was also increased. Neither of the <b>efegatran</b> doses studied were able to suppress myocardial ischaemia during continuous ECG ischaemia monitoring to a greater extent than that seen with heparin. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcome or major bleeding between the <b>efegatran</b> and heparin groups. Minor bleeding and thrombophlebitis occurred more frequently in the <b>efegatran</b> treated patients. CONCLUSION: Administration of <b>efegatran</b> sulphate at levels of at least 0. 63 mg. kg(- 1). h(- 1) provided an anti-thrombotic effect which is at least comparable to an activated partial thromboplastin time adjusted heparin infusion. There was no excess of major bleeding. The level of thrombin inhibition by <b>efegatran,</b> as measured by activated partial thromboplastin time, appeared to be more stable than with heparin. Thus, like other thrombin inhibitors, <b>efegatran</b> sulphate is easier to administer than heparin. However, no clinical benefits of <b>efegatran</b> over heparin were apparent...|$|E
40|$|<b>Efegatran</b> is a {{thrombin}} inhibitor {{which is}} being developed by IVAX for the potential treatment of thromboembolic disorders [343400]. <b>Efegatran</b> was synthesized by the Hungarian Institute for Drug Research (IDR), which conducted phase II trials for angina in Hungary, and phase II trials for thrombosis in collaboration with Lilly in the US [182552]. However, nodevelopment has been reported by Lilly since IDR {{was taken over by}} IVAX in 1999 [343400]. In phase I/II trials in patients with unstable angina, the drug produced a dose-dependent increase in clotting time [279819]. In preliminary dose-ranging trials in unstable angina, the compound had a similar efficacy to heparin at the highest dose studied (0. 1 mg/kg bolus plus a 48 h infusion of 0. 84 mg/kg/h). Thrombophlebitis was the only side effect observed [169368]. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cardiac {{biomarkers}} {{are routinely}} {{obtained in the}} setting of suspected myocardial ischemia and infarction. Evidence suggests these markers may correlate with functional and clinical outcomes, but the strength of this correlation is unclear. The relationship between enzyme measures of myocardial necrosis and left ventricular performance and adverse clinical outcomes were explored. Methods Creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB data were analyzed, as were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by angiogram, and infarct size by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging in patients in 2 trials: Prompt Reperfusion In Myocardial-infarction Evolution (PRIME), and <b>Efegatran</b> and Streptokinase to Canalize Arteries Like Accelerated Tissue plasminogen activator (ESCALAT). Both trials evaluated <b>efegatran</b> combined with thrombolysis for treating acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Results Peak CK and CK area-under-the-curve (AUC) correlated significantly with SPECT-determined infarct size 5 to 10 days after enrollment. Peak CK had a statistically significant correlation with LVEF, but CK-AUC and LVEF correlation were less robust. Statistically significant correlations exist between SPECT-determined infarct size and peak CK-MB and CK-MB AUC. However, there was no correlation with LVEF for peak CK-MB and CK-MB AUC. The combined outcome of congestive heart failure and death were significantly associated with CK AUC, CK-MB AUC, peak CK, and peak CK-MB measurements. Conclusion Peak CK and CK-MB values and AUC calculations have significant correlation with functional outcomes (LVEF- and SPECT-determined infarct size) and death or CHF outcomes {{in the setting of}} STEMI. Cardiac biomarkers provide prognostic information and may serve as valid endpoint measurements for phase II clinical trials. </p...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the in vitro effects of different anticoagulant drugs on fibrinopeptide A (FPA) generation inhibition and to identify whether there is any correla-tion between FPA generation, Hemochron ® ACT, global clotting as-says, and chromogenic assays. Unfractionated heparin is a conven-tionally used anticoagulant. New anticoagulant drugs such as low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), pentasaccharide, and an-tithrombin drugs are now approved for various indications. Anti-Xa drugs are in various phases of clinical development. The influence of different anticoagulant agents has been studied on fibrinopeptide A generation, Hemochron celite ACT, global clotting assays, and chro-mogenic anti-Xa and anti-Ila assays. Different LMWHs (Clivarin, Dalteparin, Enoxaparin, and Tinzaparin), anti-Xa agents (Penta-saccharide, DX- 9065 a and unfractionated heparin), and anti-Ila agents (PEG-Hirudin, Hirudin, <b>Efegatran</b> and Argatroban) were stud...|$|E
