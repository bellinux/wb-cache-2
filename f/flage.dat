2500|$|In {{objecting to}} the design of Union Flag adopted in 1606, whereby the cross of Saint George surmounted that of Saint Andrew, a group of Scots took up the matter with John Erskine, 18th Earl of Mar, and were {{encouraged}} by him to send a letter of complaint to James VI, via the Privy Council of Scotland, which stated that the flag's design [...] "will breid some heit and miscontentment betwix your Majesties subjectis, and it is to be feirit that some inconvenientis sail fall oute betwix thame, for our seyfaring men cannot be inducit to resave that <b>flage</b> as it is set down". Although documents accompanying this complaint which contained drafts for alternative designs have been lost, evidence exists, at least on paper, of an unofficial Scottish variant, whereby the Scottish cross was uppermost. There is reason to think that cloth flags of this design were employed during the 17th century for unofficial use on Scottish vessels at sea.

40|$|In the Oil & Gas {{industry}} {{the fundamental}} element to control {{major accident hazard}} is {{the establishment of an}} efficient barrier management system. On the NCS the PSA has renewed the strong focus on the barrier and barrier management. According to the PSA (Petroleum Safety Authority, 2015 a), the industry has to reinforce the link between the risk assessment and the barrier management and special interest should be given on the degradation of the barrier and the system and methodology used to measure it. The barrier management in operation should be strongly and uniquely linked to the performance requirement, defined in the design phase. As explained in Falck, <b>Flage,</b> and Aven (2015) several methods may be used to identify the performance deviation from the design and operational basis. However, the main challenge is to find models able to reflect the effect of such deviations. In this thesis work, a new methodology to measure the effect of deterioration of the barrier on risk is proposed. The methodology has been developed for the gas detection system of offshore installations, however it is believed that the methodology could be easily adapted to different barrier system. The key aspect of the method is the identification of specific indicators; such indicators shall be easily updated by the operators using field data and connected to failure mechanisms of the barrier. The combination of all indicators is used to build a total score of the barrier that is believed to measure the deviation from the barrier performance requirements; each indicator is combined considering their criticality with respect to the barrier function. Finally, a relationship between the degradation of the barrier and the risk level is proposed. The methodology is applied to a case study: an unmanned platform in North Sea...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Paul J. Olscampâs The Moral philosophy of George Berkeley (1970), {{research has focused on}} Berkeleyâs theory of immaterialism as the defining element of his thinking. New readings of his work gathered in this volume position immaterialism as a component of a much broader, overarching apologetic project, which is highly pragmatic in nature. Through close examinations of Berkeleyâs writings on key political, economic, social, moral and ethical debates, leading experts demonstrate that his writings are not simply theoretical but also bound to a practical concern with the well-being of humanity. The volume opens with nuanced analyses of Berkeleyâs utilitarianism, which contributors position more precisely as a theological utilitarianism, a facet of natural law and a theory with a distinctly pragmatic basis. This doctrine is reconsidered in the context of Berkeleyâs moral philosophy, with contributors highlighting the implications of free will for the evaluation of personal (or divine) responsibility for oneâs actions. Berkeleyâs concept of desire is reconfigured as a virtue, when channelled towards the common good of society. Contributors close by reassessing Berkeleyâs political and economic thought and uncover its practical dimension, where individualism is sacrificed for the greater, national interest. The George Berkeley to emerge from this book is a philosopher deeply concerned with the political, economic and social problems of his time, and whose writings proposed practical and not simply theoretical solutions to the challenges facing Britain in the eighteenth century.

40|$|Elkem has got {{smelting}} plants worldwide. Five of {{them are}} located in Norway. Smelting of metal takes place in electrical arc furnaces, for example, in Elkem Thamshavn. The electrical arc occurs between furnace electrodes and furnace charge. Thereby it causes a melting (Schei, Tuset, & Tveit, 1998), (Elkem AS, 2016 a). Elkem smelting plants have many working areas with potential hazards related to the personnel which refer to current, high temperatures, amount of energy concentrations etc. Due to its industry specialty, smelting industry needs tailored standards. Therefore, a need {{for the implementation of}} the methodology appeared. It should identify critical areas that could be a starting point {{in the development of a}} standard. The assessment of working areas’ criticality regarding to low voltage will be in focus in this thesis. Identification of such critical areas is an important task, since management can prioritize the areas that have been identified (Aven, 2009). A common definition of criticality is following (Aven, 2009, p. 404) : “A system is considered critical if its failure or malfunctions may results in severe consequences”. The consequences can involve environmental damage, loss of lives, etc. By identification of critical areas it can be identified how one can distribute resources and activities concerning investments in safety and risk reducing measures (Aven, 2009). What kind of tool will be the best to use in this case? Is it the best to use methods that are well established as, for example, risk matrix or is it more useful to introduce other tools? The selection of methods in many cases depends on the available historical data. By using the available data, the following sources were found: -	Information from external sources, for instance, Accident statistic from Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection [DSB] did not contain required information. -	Data from internal sources, as Synergi Life database, were limited. Risk matrix is a widespread tool in many companies and it is used for qualitative risk assessment. However, it is a tool with limitations (<b>Flage</b> & Røed, 2012). Issues related to the risk matrix, among other things are the subjective classification of the probability and consequence, the consistency between quantitative measures and risk matrix, etc. Thus, risk matrix is used to performing a crude risk analysis and cannot be used alone for decision-making. It is questionable whether this method will be the best option for smelting industry. Thus, an alternative approach may be suggested. It is related to expected values and uncertainties in underlying phenomena and processes (Aven, 2009). This alternative approach does not need a large amount of data and can be applied for ranking a few areas. For instance, it could be used to identify top five most critical working areas. Using of this ranking tool requires high knowledge related to smelting plants and the actual process. It is clear, that by including the uncertainty in the assessment of criticality the accuracy of the results will be higher. Nevertheless, the approach suggested by Aven (2009) needs some adjustments before it can be used in practice. For instance, when different areas have the same type of consequences but probabilities P (A) is different or when some areas have the same type of uncertainties but different probabilities. In such cases, there is not a straight way forward how to rank the actual areas. In addition, the alternative method for identification of critical areas was introduced in 2009. Since then there have been new studies related to this approach. Goerlandt and Reniers (2015) introduce how the assessment of uncertainties can be improved. Moreover, Aven (2013) showed the different new risk perspectives, inter alia, uncertainties based risk definitions in real-life situations. The risk description done in this way has a great impact on risk management and decision-making (Aven, 2009). In light of new research the alternative approach could be modified. The suggested improvement are as following: -	Insert the colors for assessment of risk indices expressing the expected consequences. -	Use the improved classification scheme for uncertainties. -	Include the assessment of knowledge in risk assessment. Since the focus was to develop a method for identifying the critical areas for own workers and contractors, the results will be hypothetical...|$|E
