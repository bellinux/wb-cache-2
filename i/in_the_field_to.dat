5|$|The Douglas XCG-17 was an American assault glider, {{developed}} by the conversion of a C-47 Skytrain twin-engine transport during World War II. Although the XCG-17 was successful in testing, the requirement for such a large glider had passed, and no further examples of the type were built; one additional C-47, however, was converted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>to</b> glider configuration briefly during 1946 for evaluation, but was quickly reconverted to powered configuration.|$|E
5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider type, a single C-47 was converted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>to</b> glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out {{in much the same}} manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine mountings, with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>to</b> distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are saffron to orange coloured; {{and the lack}} of any distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H.rufa has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while H.macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H.aurantiaca. H.tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H.aurantiaca by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3µm.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fields</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{north and}} east of the mound have also been known to produce small artifacts, such as stone chips and flakes. Unlike the mound, <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} <b>fields</b> have never been excavated professionally; however, as all other known mounds of the Clemson Island culture are associated with villages, the presence of <b>the</b> artifacts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> indicates that a village site was once located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the mound.|$|R
5|$|During this period, the United States Army {{had been}} {{introducing}} the UH-1 Iroquois into service. First used in its intended {{role as a}} transport, it was soon modified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>to</b> carry more machine guns in {{what became known as}} the helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the AH-1 Cobra was introduced. This was an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire. The helicopter was effective, and prompted the U.S. military to change its defensive strategy in Europe by blunting any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the tactical nuclear weapons that had been the basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Mackinolty was {{promoted}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>to</b> flight sergeant in June 1916, and mentioned in despatches on 19October. When the Australian members of No.30 Squadron were dispersed, he was posted to Kantara, Egypt, where {{he joined the}} newly established No.2 Squadron AFC (also numbered No.68 Squadron RFC by the British). Commanded by Major Oswald Watt, the unit relocated to England in January 1917. Following his service with No.2 Squadron, Mackinolty was assigned to No.5 (Training) Squadron AFC, which formed at Shawbury, Shropshire, in June 1917. Praised for his organisational and leadership abilities, he was commissioned as an equipment officer in March 1918, with the rank of second lieutenant. The following month he was given command of an aircraft repair unit in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, home of two squadrons of the AFC's 1st Training Wing.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>to</b> aid {{in the identification of}} S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} winning the Kentucky Derby, American Pharoah entered the second leg of the Triple Crown, the 2015 Preakness Stakes, run over {{nine and a half}} furlongs at Pimlico Race Course. Despite an {{unfavorable}} inside draw of the number one post position, he was installed as the morning line favorite ahead of Firing Line and Dortmund. No horse had won the Preakness starting from the rail since 1994. Immediately before post time, the weather changed to a heavy downpour with thunder. The last time the Preakness had been run on a sloppy track was in 1983, and American Pharoah was the only horse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>to</b> have previously faced similar conditions, having won the Rebel Stakes running in rain and mud.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>to</b> continue.|$|E
5|$|On March 2, 1864, Lincoln {{promoted}} Grant to lieutenant general, {{giving him}} command of all Union Armies, answering {{only to the}} President. Grant assigned Sherman the Division of the Mississippi and traveled to Washington to meet with Lincoln to devise a strategy of total war against the Confederacy. Grant established his headquarters with General George Meade's Army of the Potomac in Culpeper, Virginia. Grant developed an overall master plan of five coordinated Union offensives, attacking the rebel armies {{at the same time}} to keep the Confederates from shifting reinforcements within their interior lines. Sherman was to pursue Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee, while Meade would lead the Army of the Potomac, with Grant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>to</b> attack and destroy Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Major General Benjamin Butler was to advance towards Richmond from the south, up the James River, while a joint army-navy operation was to be launched against Mobile, Alabama. If Lee was forced south as expected, Grant would join forces with Butler's armies and be fed supplies from the James. Major General Franz Sigel was to capture the railroad line at Lynchburg, move east, and attack from the Blue Ridge Mountains. Grant knew that Lee had limited manpower and that a war of attrition fought on a battlefield without entrenchments would lead to Lee's defeat.|$|E

50|$|Gleaning is the {{traditional}} Biblical practice of gathering crops {{that would otherwise be}} left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> rot or be plowed under after harvest. Because the food is unmarketable, usually due to cosmetic reasons, some growers allow crews of gleaners to pick what is left after harvest to donate to those who are needy. It is also often more cost-effective for farmers to have their crops gleaned than to have paid pickers go back through <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> for <b>the</b> missed produce.|$|R
