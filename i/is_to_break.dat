25|$|Glucose {{is mainly}} metabolized {{by a very}} {{important}} ten-step pathway called glycolysis, the net result of which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This also produces a net two molecules of ATP, the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidised form) to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to lactate (lactic acid) (e.g., in humans) or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide (e.g., in yeast). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.|$|E
25|$|On 31 May Stanning, partnered by Helen Glover, won {{her first}} European title at the 2015 European Rowing Championships held in Poznan Poland. They won both their {{heat and the}} semi-final and set a new European record time of 6:58.28 in the final. They {{defeated}} the silver medallists, Noemie Kober and Marie Le Nepvou of the Netherlands, by over six seconds. Glover said: It's good to keep them tallying up and keep it exciting, but we don't go flat out on the start line thinking {{the aim of the}} day <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> records. Quadruple Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent, reporting in The Times, described Glover and Stanning as Within reach of sporting immortality.|$|E

25|$|Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung {{argued that}} a father is very {{important}} to a boy's development of identity. In his book Absent Fathers, Lost Sons Canadian Jungian analyst Guy Corneau writes that the presence of the father's body during the son's developmental phases is integral in the son developing a positive sense of self as masculine. Corneau also argues that if the son does not develop positively towards the father's male body, then the son runs the risk of developing negatively towards all bodies. Jacques Lacan argued that in the son's mind, the father's body represents the law, and that the role of the father's body <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the attachment the son feels to the mother and by extension his own.|$|E
25|$|Having {{received}} the secret message, Artemis decides {{the only option}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> into Koboi Laboratories and return all weapon control to the LEP, interrupting the rescue mission. Root bitterly acknowledges the only fairy who ever succeeded in doing so was the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums, who {{had worked as a}} builder of the facility, but was presumed dead following his break-in to Fowl Manor. Holly then reveals that Foaly had a hunch that Mulch had survived by placing the iris cam that scanned his vitals into local wildlife. Foaly realized that some of the gold returned by Artemis to the fairies was missing, and then traced several bars to Los Angeles, where Mulch was living as diminutive millionaire and legendary Oscar thief. The group then head to Los Angeles and apprehend Mulch once again.|$|E
25|$|Roti is eaten widely {{across the}} Caribbean, {{especially}} {{in countries with}} large Indo-Caribbean populations such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica. Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Guyana, and Jamaica. In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flat-bread (roti) itself {{as well as the}} more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling {{in the form of a}} wrap.|$|E

25|$|Numerical {{solution}} of either {{is performed using}} the moment method solution which requires expansion of that current into a set of basis functions; one simple (but not the best) choice, for instance, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up the conductor into N segments with a constant current assumed along each. After setting an appropriate weighting function the cost may be minimized through the inversion of a NxN matrix. Determination of each matrix element requires at least one double integration involving the weighting functions, which may become computationally intensive. These are simplified if the weighting functions are simply delta functions, which corresponds to fitting the boundary conditions for the current along the conductor at only N discrete points. Then the NxN matrix must be inverted, which is also computationally intensive as N increases. In one simple example, Balanis performs this computation to find the antenna impedance with different N using Pocklington's method and finds that with N>60 solutions have approached their limiting values to within a few percent.|$|E
25|$|Crudely {{described}} {{the purpose of}} the operation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the connection between the patient’s thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve the connection between the patient’s thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve mental tension, to take the sting out of experience and thus to favour improvement or to hasten recovery from mental disorder. Risks were listed as death due to cerebral haemorrhage or infection; epilepsy; and personality changes. A text book of the day went into more detail about personality changes, suggesting that they always occurred to greater or lesser extent and left the patient with diminished judgement, childish behaviour, carelessness, loss of ambition, and generally living at a lower level than previously. There was also the possibility of intellectual deterioration. Overall in the Board of Control survey six per cent of patients had died (half of them directly {{as a result of the}} operation); 36 per cent had left hospital and 58 per cent remained in hospital (often described as quieter or easier to nurse). Patients who were depressed and had not been ill for long were much more likely to have left hospital than those who had a schizophrenic illness and had been in hospital longer.|$|E
25|$|The Carol Ferris {{version of}} Star Sapphire appears in , voiced again by Olivia d'Abo but without her accent this time. Her costume here {{is similar to}} the one {{currently}} worn by the Star Sapphires. She is hired to be part of Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom since she is the counterpart to Green Lantern. Her plan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Hal Jordan's will by making him believe he had let a hostage (almost identical to Carol) get killed by a terrorist that he could have easily defeated before harm befell her. As Hal mourns the dead girl, Carol walks up to him and berates him for his failure to save the woman and for hurting Carol, driving her into becoming Star Sapphire. Weeping, Hal takes off his ring, becoming a broken man as he continues to mourn the dead woman. When Batman arrives, he reveals that the woman was an android used by Star Sapphire to trick him, and that she had exposed him to the Scarecrow's fear gas in order to break his will, to which Hal dons his ring and becomes Green Lantern once more. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she faces off against him again. As they fight, Hal expresses anger over Carol's plan, saying that he couldn't believe what she did, only for her to coldly remark that he broke her heart, and she would never stop trying to kill him for it. She manages to capture him but he escapes and knock her out. Hal proceeds to take away Carol's Star Sapphire gem, reverting her back to normal, and admits that he keeps hurting her. This version is shown to be able to create both energy blasts and hard constructs. She was the only one to use the non-lethal version of Batman's contingency plans and was the last member to be defeated.|$|E

500|$|Likewise, it {{has been}} argued that Siward brought Cumberland, thought by some historians to have been lost to Strathclyde, back under Northumbrian lordship. The {{evidence}} comes from a document known to historians as [...] "Gospatric's Writ".

500|$|The brittle ice zone {{typically}} returns poorer quality samples {{than for}} the rest of the core. [...] Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. [...] Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid. [...] In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. [...] Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. [...] Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> them into 1m lengths in the hole. [...] Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.|$|E

At the prison, he is living luxuriously, having his own personal [...] "butler", Herman, as well as other inmates who act as his fan club and protection from other inmates. Looking on at the attention Slattery receives in the cafeteria is Justin Hammer, who wonders what makes him so special. Slattery has been talking with a documentary filmmaker, Jackson Norriss, to chronicle the events of the Mandarin situation seen in Iron Man 3. Norriss, trying to learn more about Slattery personally, recounts his past from his first casting as a child as well as starring in a failed CBS pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> him out of prison so he can meet the actual Mandarin.
