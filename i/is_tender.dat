5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast <b>is</b> <b>tender,</b> a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E

25|$|Over time, {{the muscle}} {{proteins}} denature in varying degree, {{with the exception}} of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue, and rigor mortis resolves. Because of these changes, the meat <b>is</b> <b>tender</b> and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during rigor. As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidates, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing proteolysis also contributes to conditioning. Hypoxanthine, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.|$|E
