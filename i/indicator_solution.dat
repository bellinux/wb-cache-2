40|$|A fully {{automatic}} photometric titration method {{was developed for}} the determination of anionic and cationic surfactants in a one-phase aqueous system with tetrabromophenolphthalein ethyl ester (TBPE) used as an indicator. To avoid decomposition of the TBPE indicator {{in the presence of}} an anionic surfactant in acidic solutions, the buffer and <b>indicator</b> <b>solutions</b> were automatically added to sample solutions just before titration. In an indirect titration method for cationic surfactants, cationic surfactants were automatically determined under the same conditions as in the titration of anionic surfactants. The usual samples were analyzed for less than 10 min at concentrations of 10 (- 6) 10 (- 3) mol dm(- 3). The relative standard deviations of the determination of various surfactants were 0. 20. 3 %. The proposed method was applied to many practical samples. The results, except for those for anionic surfactants possessing polyoxyethylenyl groups and several cationic surfactants, were in good agreement with the results obtained by the JIS titration method (Epton method). 微分光度滴定法を用いて,水溶液でのイオン性界面活性剤の自動分析システムの構築について検討した. 滴定終点決定の指示薬であるテトラブロモフェノールフタレインエチルエステル(TBPE) は界面活性剤との共存系では経時的に分解するため滴定直前に自動添加すること,及び陽イオン界面活性剤は逆滴定法の採用により自動化システムを構築し,同一条件下で陰イオン及び陽イオン界面活性剤の自動連続定量(10 分/件) が可能となった. 本滴定法で 10 (- 6) ～ 10 (- 3) Mの濃度範囲の陰イオン及び陽イオン界面活性剤が定量でき,再現性は 0. 2 ～ 0. 3 %と良好であった. 各種実際試料について応用した結果,陰イオン界面活性剤において,一部の親水性の高い活性剤(オキシエチレン基を特に多数含む活性剤) 以外はJIS法(Epton法) と非常に良い一致を示し,又陽イオン界面活性剤においても,JIS法とほぼ一致した...|$|R
50|$|Bipolar {{electrochemistry}} is {{a phenomenon}} in electrochemistry based on the polarization of conducting objects in electric fields. Indeed, this polarization generates a potential {{difference between the two}} extremities of the substrate that is equal to the electric field value multiplied {{by the size of the}} object. If this potential difference is important enough, then redox reactions can be generated at the extremities of the object, oxidations will occur at one extremity coupled simultaneously to reductions at the other extremity. In a simple experimental setup consisting of a platinum wire in a weighing boat containing a pH <b>indicator</b> <b>solution,</b> a 30 V voltage across two electrodes will cause water reduction at one end of the wire (the cathode) and a pH increase (OH− formation) and water oxidation at the anodic end and a pH decrease.

50|$|For example, the {{transport}} numbers of hydrochloric acid (HCl(aq)) may {{be determined by}} electrolysis between a cadmium anode and a Ag-AgCl cathode. The anode reaction is Cd → Cd2+ + 2 e− so that a cadmium chloride (CdCl2) solution is formed near the anode and moves toward the cathode during the experiment. An acid-base indicator such as bromophenol blue is added to make visible {{the boundary between the}} acidic HCl solution and the near-neutral CdCl2 solution. The boundary tends to remain sharp since the leading solution HCl has a higher conductivity that the <b>indicator</b> <b>solution</b> CdCl2, and therefore a lower electric field to carry the same current. If a more mobile H+ ion diffuses into the CdCl2 solution, it will rapidly be accelerated back to the boundary by the higher electric field; if a less mobile Cd2+ ion diffuses into the HCl solution it will decelerate in the lower electric field and return to the CdCl2 solution. Also the apparatus is constructed with the anode below the cathode, so that the denser CdCl2 solution forms at the bottom.|$|E
