5|$|In 1935, Ambedkar {{announced}} his intentions to leave Hinduism and join Buddhism. According to Sankar Ghose, the announcement shook Gandhi, who reappraised <b>his</b> <b>views</b> and wrote many essays with <b>his</b> <b>views</b> on castes, inter-marriage and what Hinduism {{says on the}} subject.
