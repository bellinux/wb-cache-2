5|$|Judge Kevin McNulty {{heard the}} case on remand. After {{considering}} the parties' motions for summary judgment again, <b>he</b> <b>ruled</b> in the city's favor in 2014. Heffernan, <b>he</b> <b>ruled,</b> had not engaged in any protected speech or expressive conduct. Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected, per Ambrose v. Robinson Township, a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association. He decided that Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission, {{a case in which}} the Sixth Circuit had held that the First Amendment reached perceived political association, was not a precedent he could rely on since Dye itself explicitly rejected Ambrose, and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.|$|E

5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas became {{governor}} of Buenos Aires after the {{brief period of}} anarchy {{following the end of}} the Cisplatine War in 1828.

Although {{he was one of the}} Federalists, a faction which demanded greater provincial autonomy, in practice Rosas exercised control over the other provinces and become the virtual dictator of Argentina. During his 20-year government, the country witnessed the resurgence of armed conflicts between the Unitarians (his rival political faction) and the Federalists.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{then and}} now have been divided over Wilfrid. His {{followers}} commissioned Stephen of Ripon to write a Vita Sancti Wilfrithi (or Life of Wilfrid) shortly after his death, and the medieval historian Bede also wrote extensively about him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. <b>He</b> <b>ruled</b> {{a large number of}} monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the Rule of Saint Benedict into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly as a champion of Roman customs against the customs of the British and Irish churches, others as an advocate for monasticism.|$|E

5|$|Not all of Diocletian's {{plans were}} successful: the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), {{his attempt to}} curb {{inflation}} via price controls, was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while <b>he</b> <b>ruled,</b> Diocletian's tetrarchic system collapsed after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of Maxentius and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The Diocletianic Persecution (303–11), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of Christianity, did not destroy the empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, Constantine.|$|E
