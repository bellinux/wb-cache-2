5|$|Most modern cultivars lack any {{fragrance}} although 'Dancing Queen' {{represents an}} exception. Fragrance is genetically related to flower colour (white, or pastel shades) {{and is a}} recessive characteristic, so that when <b>fragrant</b> and non <b>fragrant</b> varieties are crossed, not all progeny will be <b>fragrant,</b> whereas two <b>fragrant</b> progenitors will produce an all <b>fragrant</b> progeny.|$|E

5|$|Kamadhenu {{is often}} {{addressed}} by the proper name Surabhi or Shurbhi, which is also used as a synonym for an ordinary cow. Professor Jacobi considers the name Surabhi—"the <b>fragrant</b> one"—to have originated from the peculiar smell of cows. According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit–English Dictionary (1899), Surabhi means <b>fragrant,</b> charming, pleasing, as well as cow and earth. It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu, the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a Matrika ("mother") goddess. Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are Sabala ("the spotted one") and Kapila ("the red one").|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} is Finland's {{national}} tree. Leafy, <b>fragrant</b> boughs of silver birch (called vihta or vasta) {{are used to}} gently beat oneself in the Finnish sauna culture.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>Fragrant</b> Hill project neared completion, Pei {{began work}} on the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, for which his {{associate}} James Freed served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution {{in what was then}} a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate space frame of interconnected metal rods and spheres.|$|E
5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very <b>fragrant,</b> and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old <b>fragrant</b> cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, {{with a mild}} {{taste and}} a slight odor of maple syrup. American author David Arora suggests that the fruit bodies {{may be used in}} a manner similar to the candy cap mushrooms, despite being not as <b>fragrant.</b> Chefs in the San Francisco Bay Area have been known to use it for desserts such as ice creams, cakes and caramels.|$|E
5|$|Kalpavrikshas are wish-granting trees which {{fulfill the}} desires of people in initial stages of worldly cycle as per Jain Cosmology. In initial times {{children}} are born in pairs (boy and girl) and don't do any karma. There are 10 Kalpavrikshas which grant 10 distinct wishes such as an abode to reside, garments, utensils, nourishment including fruits and sweets, pleasant music, ornaments, <b>fragrant</b> flowers, shining lamps and a radiant light at night.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Fragrant</b> Hill Hotel {{opened on}} 17 October 1982 but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff {{returned}} for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings. The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered {{on the work of}} American postmodernists such as Michael Graves.|$|E
5|$|Thelephoric acid {{is present}} in several Hydnellum species. This compound, derived metabolically from the shikimic acid pathway, {{inhibits}} the enzyme prolyl endopeptidase, which is involved in deteriorating certain neuropeptides that are believed to contribute to memory and learning. Hydnellum caeruleum and H.concrescens have several para-terphenyl derivatives named thelephantins (specifically, variants thelephantins I–N), some of which can inhibit the enzyme alpha-glucosidase. The compounds hydnellins A and B are terphenyls found in H. suaveolens and Hydnellum geogerirum. The chemicals responsible for the <b>fragrant</b> anise-like aroma of H.suaveolens {{have been identified as}} coumarin and para-anisaldehyde.|$|E
5|$|With 130,000 {{hectares}} of greenery and over 180,000 palm trees in its Palmeraie, Marrakesh is {{an oasis of}} rich plant variety. Throughout the seasons, <b>fragrant</b> orange, fig, pomegranate and olive trees display their color and fruits in Agdal Garden, Menara Garden and other gardens in the city. The city's gardens feature numerous native plants alongside other species that have been imported {{over the course of}} the centuries, including giant bamboos, yuccas, papyrus, palm trees, banana trees, cypress, philodendrons, rose bushes, bougainvilleas, pines and various kinds of cactus plants.|$|E
5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for {{a new wave of}} engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with <b>Fragrant</b> Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|Many unique {{varieties}} of mango are {{native to the}} country, most having been developed {{during the second half}} of the 20th century. New and improved mango varieties are still introduced to markets every few years. Arguably the most popular variety is the Maya type, which is small to medium in size, <b>fragrant,</b> colourful (featuring 3-4 colours) and usually fiberless. The Israeli mango season begins in May, and the last of the fruit ripen as October draws near. Different varieties are present on markets at different months, with the Maya type seen between July and September. Mangos are frequently used in fusion dishes and for making Sorbet.|$|E
5|$|Robert Shaffer defined four {{forms of}} R.densifolia in a 1962 {{monograph}} on section Compactae, differentiating them by spore print color, fruiting pattern, odor, gill spacing, {{and the intensity}} of the color change with bruising. Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America: form dilatoria has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray; form fragrans has a <b>fragrant</b> odor and widely spaced gills; form cremeispora produces a light yellow spore print and has an obscurely two-layered cap cuticle. Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously in jack pine and Scotch pine forests. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum lumps these forms, as well as f. subrubescen, published by Patrick Reumaux in 1996, together into synonymy. Other synonyms include Rolf Singer's 1931 variety caucasica, Roger Heim's 1938 variety latericola, and C. Dagron's 1999 variety colettarum.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s the IMA has {{continually}} improved accessibility for visitors; {{the initiative}} was {{a contributing factor}} to the museum receiving the National Medal for Museum and Library Service in 2009. The IMA provides captioning on videos produced by the museum, large print binders for exhibits, accessible seating and sign language interpretation in Tobias Theater, and wheelchair-accessible trails in 100 Acres. The museum also maintains partnerships with the Indiana School for the Deaf and the Indiana School for the Blind. In 1993 the IMA opened the Garden for Everyone, a wheelchair-accessible garden designed to emphasize multiple senses. The garden includes varieties of <b>fragrant</b> and textured plants {{as well as a}} number of sculptures, including La Hermana del Hombre Boveda by Pablo Serrano.|$|E
5|$|The main factor which boosted {{industry}} and trade under the Ayyubids {{was the new}} interests Europeans developed when they {{came into contact with}} the Muslims. Commodities included incense, scents, <b>fragrant</b> oils, and aromatic plants from Arabia and India, as well as ginger, alum, and aloes. Likewise, Europeans developed new tastes in the matter of fashions, clothing, and home furnishing. Rugs, carpets, and tapestries manufactured in the Middle East and Central Asia were introduced to the West through Crusader-Ayyubid interaction. Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem returned with Arab reliquaries for the keeping of relics. In addition, eastern works of art in glass, pottery, gold, silver, etc., were highly prized in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, a geisha {{was paid}} {{for the number of}} senkodokei (incense sticks) that had been {{consumed}} while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924. Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals. The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which incense was placed. These clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of <b>fragrant</b> woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails. Different powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. The length of the trail of incense, directly related {{to the size of the}} seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.|$|E
5|$|Pei's {{first major}} {{recognition}} {{came with the}} National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the John F. Kennedy Library in Massachusetts. He went on to design Dallas City Hall and the East Building of the National Gallery of Art. He returned to China {{for the first time}} in 1975 to design a hotel at <b>Fragrant</b> Hills, and designed Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong, a skyscraper in Hong Kong for the Bank of China fifteen years later. In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy when he designed a glass-and-steel pyramid for the Musée du Louvre in Paris. He later returned to the world of the arts by designing the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, the Miho Museum in Japan, the Suzhou Museum in Suzhou, and the Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar.|$|E
5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of <b>fragrant</b> and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
5|$|The main trade route {{leading into}} Han China passed first through Kashgar, yet Hellenized Bactria further west {{was the central}} node of {{international}} trade. By the 1st century AD, Bactria and much of Central Asia and North India were controlled by the Kushan Empire. Silk was the main export item from China to India. Indian merchants brought various goods to China, including tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, fine cloth, woolen textiles, perfume and incense, crystal sugar, pepper, ginger, salt, coral, pearls, glass items, and Roman wares. Indian merchants brought Roman styrax and frankincense to China, while the Chinese knew bdellium as a <b>fragrant</b> item from Persia, although it was native to West India. The tall Ferghana horses imported from Fergana were highly prized in Han China. The newly introduced exotic Central Asian grapes (i.e. vitis vinifera) were used to make grape wine, although the Chinese had rice wine before this. Glass luxury items from ancient Mesopotamia {{have been found in}} Chinese tombs and dated to the late Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC). Roman glasswares have been found in Chinese tombs dating to the early 1st century BC, with the earliest specimen found at the southern Chinese seaport of Guangzhou. Silverwares from Roman- and Arsacid territories have also been found at Han tomb sites.|$|E
25|$|Bark: Commonly used barks include {{cinnamon}} and cascarilla. The <b>fragrant</b> oil in sassafras root bark {{is also used}} either directly or purified for its main constituent, safrole, which {{is used in the}} synthesis of other <b>fragrant</b> compounds.|$|E
25|$|Steam distillation: Steam from {{boiling water}} is {{passed through the}} raw material, which drives out their {{volatile}} <b>fragrant</b> compounds. The condensate from distillation are settled in a Florentine flask. This allows for the easy separation of the <b>fragrant</b> oils from the water. The water collected from the condensate, which retains some of the <b>fragrant</b> compounds and oils from the raw material is called hydrosol and sometimes sold. This is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as flowers, leaves, and stems.|$|E
25|$|Supercritical fluid extraction: A {{relatively}} new technique for extracting <b>fragrant</b> compounds from a raw material, which often employs Supercritical CO2. Due {{to the low}} heat of process and the relatively nonreactive solvent used in the extraction, the <b>fragrant</b> compounds derived often closely resemble the original odor of the raw material.|$|E
25|$|Aromatic rices have {{definite}} aromas and flavors; {{the most}} noted cultivars are Thai <b>fragrant</b> rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese <b>fragrant</b> rice, and a hybrid cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild popcorn-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, {{there are also}} red and black cultivars.|$|E
25|$|Absolute: <b>Fragrant</b> {{materials}} that are purified from a pommade or concrete by soaking them in ethanol. By using a slightly hydrophilic compound such as ethanol, most of the <b>fragrant</b> compounds from the waxy source materials can be extracted without dissolving any of the fragrantless waxy molecules.
