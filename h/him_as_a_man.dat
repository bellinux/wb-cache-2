5|$|Dundas {{subsequently}} {{became a}} journalist for the Yorkshire Post and its editorial staff. Another {{who worked on}} the paper at the time, Richard Pape, recalled <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> indifferent to his personal appearance, who wore frayed trousers, frequently had ink-stained hands and would spill beer over himself when drinking, yet who was also popular with the newspaper's younger, female staff members.|$|E
5|$|David Jenkins, who was {{a student}} and {{assistant}} to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic {{to be a good}} conductor and too impatient for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of great musical ability.|$|E
5|$|Having {{divorced}} Rynning Koren, Hambro eventually married Christine Holter (born 1931). One of {{his wives}} bore him the daughter Ellen Hambro, {{who would later}} become director of Norway's Climate and Pollution Agency. Carl Joachim Hambro died on 19 February 1985 and was buried in Grefsen. Hambro's obituarist Finn Jor described <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> fond of debate with {{a keen interest in}} societal issues, yet who was no front person in public dialogue, not possessing the eloquence of his father.|$|E

5|$|Sharaf {{writes that}} Reich's {{personality}} changed after {{his experience in}} Oslo. He became socially isolated and kept his distance even from old friends and his ex-wife. His students in the United States came to know <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> that no colleague, no matter how close, called by his first name. In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling {{her that he was}} in despair and that he believed he would end up dying like a dog.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, biographers {{began writing}} about Lenin {{soon after his}} death; some – like Christopher Hill – were {{sympathetic}} to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and Robert Gellately – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived {{him as a person}} who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, revisionists in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.|$|E

25|$|Addressing the Lau Provincial Council in Ratu Mara's honour, Fiji's current vice-president, Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi praised <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{of vision}} and compassion, who hated lies and lived by the truth. He praised him as a {{committed}} Christian who practised what he preached, and who did not differentiate between people but treated all men alike whatever their race or religion. Madraiwiwi called on Lauans today to follow Mara's example.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that he wrote on Babylon and Meroe; he visited Egypt, and Diodorus Siculus states that he lived there for five years. He himself {{declared}} that among his contemporaries none had made greater journeys, seen more countries, and met more scholars than himself. He particularly mentions the Egyptian mathematicians, whose knowledge he praises. Theophrastus, too, spoke of <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who had seen many countries.|$|E
25|$|Khalid was {{described}} as warm and cheerful and adored by his sisters and brothers, and as attentive and devout. Falconry and horse-riding were Khalid's favorite pastimes, leading to the description of <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of the desert. He bought the first Toyota Landcruiser in 1955 for falconry. In December 1975 Khalid bought the then longest Cadillac at 25 feet and 2 inches long. Khalid bought Beechwood House in the north London suburb of Highgate for £1.9 million in March 1977.|$|E

In 99 BC he was curule aedile, and in the games celebrated by him {{elephants}} were for the first time exhibited in the circus, and painting employed in the scenic decorations. In 85 BC he was praetor in Sicily, and, by direction of the senate, gave laws to the Halesini respecting the appointment of their senate. The Mamertines made him their patronus. He was consul in 92 BC. Cicero speaks of <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> possessed of great power and some ability as an orator.|$|E
25|$|Moritz Yomtov {{was born}} on 5 November 1921 in Sofia, Bulgaria. He {{graduated}} from the American College of Sofia and afterwards studied chemistry. His friends described <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of brilliant erudition and a person of encyclopedic knowledge. He had a professorship in biochemistry but also had {{a great interest in}} jokes and the humorous stories. Yomtov held high posts in the Federation of European Biochemical Societies for years, finally reaching the position of secretary-general. Aside from his native Bulgarian, he spoke English, French, German and Russian. Moritz Yomtov died in 1992 in Israel at the age of 71.|$|E
25|$|President Mary McAleese {{described}} <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{steeped in}} the history of the State who constantly strove to make Ireland a better place for all its people. His thoughtful writing, distinctive voice and probing intellect all combined to make him one of our national treasures. Above all, Garret Fitzgerald was a true public servant... Long after he departed active politics, Garret continued to contribute to public life through his voluminous writing and scholarship. His weekly columns in The Irish Times were essential reading for those who sought enlightenment on the issues and debates of the day.|$|E

25|$|Heinz Hopf, who {{had been}} in Berlin before his {{appointment}} to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held - as is clear from oral statements and also from letters - Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - If I have to characterize <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E
25|$|In the {{old days}} I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine {{presence}} and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.|$|E
25|$|But {{his enemies}} were not merely those whose errors he had exposed and whose hostility he had {{excited by the}} {{violence}} of his language. The results of his method of historical criticism threatened the Catholic controversialists and the authenticity {{of many of the}} documents on which they relied. The Jesuits, who aspired to be the source of all scholarship and criticism, saw the writings and authority of Scaliger as a formidable barrier to their claims. Muret {{in the latter part of}} his life professed the strictest orthodoxy, Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome, Isaac Casaubon was supposed to be wavering, but Scaliger was known to be an irreconcilable Protestant. As long as his intellectual supremacy was unquestioned, the Protestants had the advantage in learning and scholarship. His enemies therefore aimed, if not to answer his criticisms or to disprove his statements, yet to attack <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> and to destroy his reputation. This was no easy task, for his moral character was strong.|$|E

50|$|When his son, Martijn, {{was killed}} in a {{motorcycle}} accident, he became thoroughly absorbed in his work. In 1941, the Jüdische Wochenblatt Amsterdam described <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> modest <b>man</b> of high standards who opposed injustice.|$|R
25|$|As a {{solution}} to the panic, he supported an Independent Treasury system, which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation. However, a coalition of conservative Democrats and Whigs opposed the bill, and it was not passed until 1840. During the delay, no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression. Van Buren grew deeply unpopular. A unified Whig Party nominated popular war hero William Henry Harrison and former Jacksonian John Tyler in the 1840 presidential election. The Whigs' campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the Democrats during Jackson's campaigns. They depicted Van Buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary Americans, while glorifying Harrison's military record and portraying <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of the people. Jackson campaigned heavily for Van Buren in Tennessee. He favored the nomination of James K. Polk of Tennessee for vice president at the 1840 Democratic National Convention over unpopular incumbent Richard Mentor Johnson. However, no nominee was chosen, and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors.|$|E
25|$|Raymond Leslie Morris {{was born}} on 13 August 1929 in Walsall, Staffordshire. He lived in Walsall his entire life and was {{reported}} to have an IQ of 120. Morris went through a variety of jobs before landing a position as a foreman engineer at a precision instruments factory in Oldbury, West Midlands, in 1967. In 1951, he married 'the girl next door", who was two years younger than him, and fathered two boys. He kicked her out of the house after eight years of marriage, then divorced her on the grounds of adultery when she had another man's child. Morris's first wife would later describe <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with a need to express violent sexual dominance. At the age of 35, Morris was married again, this time to a 21-year-old woman named Carol. He had been suspected of taking indecent photographs of schoolgirls in October 1966, though he was not arrested as police failed to find any evidence. At the time the A34 murders were committed, Morris and his wife lived at Flat 20, Regent House, Green Lane, Walsall – a council-owned flat in Birchills, directly opposite the police station.|$|E

He lit a cigarette and ordered a bourbon and soda. On-board witnesses described <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in his mid-forties, between [...] and [...] tall.
