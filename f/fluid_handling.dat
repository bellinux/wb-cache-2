40|$|International audienceWe {{have applied}} {{the law of}} {{corresponding}} states to measurements fo two-phase mass flow rates obtained with five different fluids (water, butane, R 11, ethyl acetate, methanol). That enables us {{to point out that}} the critical mass flow rate (which is used as source term within the loss of containment scenario in liquefied gas tanks) is a "universal" function of the reduced tank pressure, usable with most pure <b>fluids</b> <b>handled</b> by the process industry. It is thus possible to estimate it rather precisely (uncertainty o < 15 %) without using any model. we show in addition that an improvment of the models can probably not be obtained by taking into account the kinetics of vaporisation. On the contrary, taking the drift between phases into account appears definitely more promising to us...|$|R

50|$|A {{separator}} <b>handling</b> corrosive <b>fluid</b> {{should be}} checked periodically {{to determine whether}} remedial work is required.

Expendable anode can be used in separators to protect them against electrolytic corrosion. Some operators determine separator shell and head thickness with ultrasonic thickness indicators and calculate the maximum allowable working pressure from the remaining metal thickness.

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} novel grid-based method for {{simulating}} multiple unmixable fluids moving and interacting. Unlike previous methods {{that can only}} represent the interface between two fluids (usually between liquid and gas), the method can handle arbitrary number of fluids through multiple independent level sets coupling with a constrain condition. To capture the fluid surface more accurately, we extend the particle level set method to a multi-fluid version. It shares the advantages of particle level set method, and {{has the ability to}} track the interfaces of multiple <b>fluids.</b> To <b>handle</b> the dynamic behavior of different fluids existing together, we use a multiphase fluid formulation based on a smooth weight function...|$|R

40|$|Virtual reality based {{simulation}} is {{an appealing}} option to supplement traditional clini-cal education. However, the formal integration of training simulators into the medi-cal curriculum is still lacking. Especially, {{the lack of}} a reasonable level of realism sup-posedly hinders the widespread use of this technology. Therefore, we try to tackle this situation with a reference surgical simulator of the highest possible fidelity for procedural training. This overview describes all elements that have been combined into our training system as well as first results of simulator validation. Our frame-work allows the rehearsal of several aspects of hysteroscopy—for instance, correct <b>fluid</b> management, <b>handling</b> of excessive bleeding, appropriate removal of intra-uterine tumors, or the use of the surgical instrument. ...|$|R

40|$|Process design {{requires}} {{knowledge of}} the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the <b>fluids</b> being <b>handled.</b> The measurement of a range of properties of two pyrolysis liquids is described. The pyrolysis liquid properties reported are: density, viscosity, refractive index, thermal capacity, thermal conductivity, and their variation with temperature, time, exposure to air/oxygen and history. The oils follow conventional behaviour for most properties except that there is marked differences in viscosity behaviour above around 50 °C compared to below 50 °C. There is a noticeable effect from exposure to oxygen/air which increases viscosity. This may be due to removal of volatiles, removal of water or reaction. There is clear evidence that some reaction occurs even under ambient conditions...|$|R
