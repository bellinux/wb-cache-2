Effective detection methods need to be developed to eliminate the influence of speed variation. This paper proposes an incipient fault detection method for bearings under varying speed conditions.

Then, a health <b>indicator</b> <b>named</b> selected negative log-likelihood probability (SNLLP) is constructed to fuse a feature set including RR features and non-dimensional features.

Kilian’s index of global real economic activity also accurately predicts World GDP growth rates. When extending the analysis to an out-ofsample exercise, both Kilian’s index of global real economic activity and the World steel production produce accurate forecasts for World GDP, confirming evidence provided by the econometric properties.

Seven financial indicators capable of explaining business failure at a 1 -year prediction horizon are identified. Using the model estimated in this way, an aggregate indicator of the creditworthiness of the Czech corporate sector (the JT index) is then constructed and its evolution over time is shown. This indicator aids the estimation of the risks of this sector going forward and broadens the existing analytical set-up used by the Czech National Bank for its financial stability analyses. The results suggest that the creditworthiness of the Czech corporate sector steadily improved between 2004 and 2006. However, the JT index for 2007 and 2008 deteriorated what could be explained through global market turbulences while the further decrease in 2009 rather by the global recession. The used methodology for the construction of the JT index might be suitable for decision makers when evaluating the economy´s financial stability.

For this purpose a set of GMRs with specific properties should be selected. The code-based approaches propose to select a set of records which shall be compatible with a target spectrum e. g.

Recently the Conditional Mean Spectrum (CMS) has been proposed by Baker et al. which uses the epsilon indicator advantages. Consideration of the correlation of the response spectrum values is the most important feature which was employed in the CMS concept. The epsilon based CMS can reduce the bias in the estimation of the structural seismic response.

Continuous assessment of the system voltage stability is vital to ensure a secured operation of the system. Several voltage stability indicators have been proposed and used {{in an attempt to}} quantify proximity to voltage collapse. Some of these are computationally expensive, and others are reported not to perform as expected under all conditions. In this work a new voltage stability <b>indicator</b> <b>named</b> the P-index is proposed.

The index has been tested on static and dynamic test platforms, and for both platforms offered a correct assessment of proximity to voltage collapse and weakest system buses. Furthermore, a method for topology change detection suitable for online systems was proposed. Dynamic stability monitoring with PMU measurements was simulated in real-time on the well-known Kundur 10 -bus system and the appropriate load shedding using the P-index was calculated.

40|$|The modal {{assurance}} criterion and normalized cross-orthogonality check {{are widely}} {{used to assess the}} correlation between the experimentally determined dynamic characteristics and the finite element model predictions. In this paper, the effectiveness of these criteria on the base excitation responses of three spacecraft models is carried out. The dynamic characteristics obtained from a nominal finite element model are considered as experimental or true characteristics, and those obtained from a model produced by introducing errors in the nominal model are considered as analytically predicted characteristics. It is observed that these criteria are not suitable, particularly when the model is used to predict forced response characteristics such as the force transmitted to the base, peak acceleration response, and dynamic displacement in the spacecraft. Thus, a qualitative <b>indicator</b> <b>named</b> as base-force assurance criterion is defined by comparing the experimentally determined dynamic force at the base and the finite element predicted force such that the criterion can state the possible error in the peak acceleration and the dynamic displacement under the base excitation. The method is applied to assess the performance of three spacecraft structures, and the results show that new criterion can better correlate with the acceleration and the dynamic displacement error than the conventional criteria.

Moreover, we apply this architecture to future professional high-speed railway wireless communication system to fulfill the wireless access desire of train passengers. However, for such emerging architecture, there still exist many problems to be solved to guarantee the reliable transmission. In this article, {{the problem of how}} to appropriately evaluate the transmission reliability of C/U-plane decoupled architecture is investigated. Due to the lack of ability to reflect the importance of C-plane, conventional outage probability cannot properly indicate the transmission reliability of C/U-plane decoupled architecture whose primary design consideration is that C-plane more heavily affects the transmission reliability thereby being kept at dependable lower frequency bands. Based on this, a novel <b>indicator</b> <b>named</b> unreliability factor (URF) is proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that URF can exactly highlight the effects of C-plane on the entire transmission process. Hence, it is more appropriate to employ URF as the indicator to evaluate the transmission reliability of C/U-plane decoupled architecture.|$|R
