25|$|Laudrup went on {{to guide}} Real Madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the Barça stranglehold, making him the only player ever to win the Spanish league five {{times in a row}} playing for two {{different}} clubs. After the initial success at Real, a lacklustre season would be in store for the club. Despite only playing two seasons at Real Madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in Real Madrid history in an <b>internet</b> <b>survey</b> by Spanish newspaper Marca when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. While playing with Barcelona, he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals Real Madrid in the 1993–94 season. The following season while playing for Real Madrid, he aided in the revenge beating Madrid gave Barça, the final score also ending 5–0.|$|E

500|$|The game {{makes use}} of the Hedgehog Engine, the game engine Sonic Team used for {{developing}} Unleashed. To help decide which levels would appear in the game, Sega polled all their employees on their favorite Sonic levels, researched the core fanbase, and conducted an <b>internet</b> <b>survey,</b> with the levels they found most popular being {{the ones that were}} incorporated into the game. One of the main rules Sonic Team made during development was not to use older assets or level designs, and certain levels were given a new visual element to provide a new dynamic, such as the underground caves in Green Hill. In choosing levels for the 3DS version, the team opted to use levels from the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS Sonic games rather than the original Game Gear games, wanting to use levels from games of more recent memory. According to Iizuka, one of the hardest parts of developing Generations was adapting 3D levels to 2D, since their [...] "defining" [...] elements and themes were designed to specifically work in 3D. Recreating the [...] "classic"-style Sonic gameplay using the Hedgehog Engine was also cited as challenging, since the engine was designed for [...] "modern" [...] gameplay. The Spin Dash ability was also made quicker to use to help younger players unfamiliar with it. The team faced bigger difficulties developing on the 3DS; Iizuka claimed they were unfamiliar with the system's capabilities and limitations.|$|E

The probability sample surveys were consistently more accurate than the non-probability sample surveys, even after post-stratification with demographics. The non-probability sample survey measurements were much more variable in their accuracy, both across measures within a single survey and across surveys with a single measure.
