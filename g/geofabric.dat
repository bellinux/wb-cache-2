50|$|Deep {{drainage}} trenches {{consist of}} unbroken cuts {{with a small}} cross-section that can be covered at the bottom with <b>geofabric</b> canvas having a primary filter function. They are filled with draining material that has a filtering function and exploits the passive drainage to carry away the drained water downhill. The effectiveness of these systems {{is connected to the}} geometry of the trench and the continuity of the draining material along the whole trench. As far as the geometry of the cut is concerned attention should be paid to the slope given {{to the bottom of the}} cut. In fact, deep drainage trenches do not have bottom piping that is inserted in the end part of the trench, downhill, where the depth of the cut is reduced until the campaign level is reached.|$|E
40|$|Permeable {{pavements}} {{are commonly}} used around commercial and industrial buildings to reduce the environmental impact. Results are presented from a forensic investigation of a permeable interlocking concrete paving (PICP) system {{that has been in}} service for over eight years. The aims were to quantify the sediment accumulation processes that occurred in the different pavement layers and to improve understanding of the change in the pavement hydraulic conductivity due to the trapped sediments. The majority of the sediment (by mass) was retained in the 2 – 5 mm aggregate bedding layer, irrespective of the pavement blockage conditions. While geofabrics are efficient at retaining sediment particles less than 33 µm in diameter, a maximum of only 8. 3 % of the total sediment mass was retained in the <b>geofabric</b> layers. Over 90 % of the sediments were trapped in the paving and bedding aggregate layers. The beneficial role of <b>geofabric</b> in filtering out sediments and protecting the integrity of the underlying basecourse may not be significant enough to warrant its inclusion in permeable pavement installations. The PICP system was very effective at filtering and retaining sediments from stormwater runoff. While this resulted in reduced permeability over time, the overall infiltration performance of the PICP system was still satisfactory after eight years of continuous service...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} {{studies have shown}} that {{granular}} pile-anchor foundations (GPAF) are a promising foundation system {{that can be used to}} reduce the detrimental effects of reactive soils. This paper presents results from finite element analyses undertaken on granular pile-anchor foundations in a reactive soil using PLAXIS software. The study investigated the ability of a single pile to resist forces induced by both heave and shrinkage. The results confirmed the efficiency of the granular pile-anchor foundations in resisting heave induced by moisture gain. However, in order to resist shrinkage, the GPAF system has to be reinforced with <b>geofabric</b> to assist resisting bulging of the granular pile into the surrounding soil. The analyses showed that success of the GPAF in heave resistance may be adversely influenced by the high stiffness of the interface, which requires only small relative movement to mobilize full resistance. Using a group of piles instead of a single pile under a footing can reduce the efficiency of the GPAF system...|$|E

Where there is water or the anchors are embedded in a clayey sub-layer, the adherence of the anchor to the ground must be confirmed. The surface contained within the grid of the beam frame should also be protected, using <b>geofabrics,</b> in order to prevent erosion from removing the ground underlying the beam frame.|$|R
40|$|Design and {{construction}} of pavements on weak soils pose lot of problems due to its low load carrying capacity. Roads cause rut formation due to the high axle loads of vehicle on expansive clayey subgrades. There are many techniques to modify the properties of such soils. Among them, soil reinforcement with <b>geofabrics</b> is more promising in improving the load carrying capacity of expansive subgrades. In this paper, emphasis is given to investigate the feasibility of using abundantly available indigenous resources, coir and jute in road construction. In addition to the above mentioned natural fabrics, geogrid, a synthetic material is also considered. The influence of varied number of reinforcing layers on CBR values is investigated. CBR method is employed {{for the design of}} flexible pavements in most of the design offices even though it is empirical in nature, since the method is simple and convenient to apply and the CBR value of the subgrade indirectly gives the strength of subgrade soil. The results are analyzed effectively by introducing two non-dimensional factors namely, Effective Depth Ratio (EDR) and Strength Benefit Ratio (SBR). It is found that both CBR and SBR values increases with increase in number of reinforcing layers. Based on the favorable results obtained, it can be concluded that expansive soil can be successfully stabilized using <b>geofabrics...</b>|$|R

The tensile properties of geosynthetics including tensile strength, strain at maximum load and tensile load at specified strain have been determined. The creep and relaxation tests were carried out. The structure type was found to significantly affect the viscoelastic properties of the geosynthetics materials.

Odour samples were collected {{from the surface of}} the covers, the surface of the exposed liquor and from the surface of an uncovered (control) pond at one of the piggeries. Relative to the emission rate of the exposed liquor at each pond, the polypropylene, shade cloth and straw covers reduced average emission rates by 76 %, 69 % and 66 %, respectively. At the piggery with an uncovered control pond, the polypropylene covers reduced average odour emission rates by 50 % and 41 %, respectively.

40|$|The Rulison Site {{is located}} in Section 25, {{township}} 7 South, Range 95 West, Garfield County, Colorado. The site is approximately 19 kilometers (km) (12 miles [mi]) southwest of Rifle Colorado, and approximately 65 km (40 mi) northeast of Grand Junction, Colorado. Project Ruhson was an experiment conducted jointly by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission and Austral Oil Company to test the feasibility of using a nuclear device to increase natural gas production in low permeability geological formations. The experiment was conducted on September 10, 1969, and consisted of detonating a 43 -kiloton nuclear device {{at a depth of}} 2, 568 meters (m) (8, 426 feet [ft]) below the ground surface (DOE, 1994). The Rulison Drilling Effluent Pond (called `the pond`) is an engineered structure covering approximately 0. 2 hectare (0. 5 acre), which was excavated and used to store drilling fluids during drilling of the device emplacement well. The drilling fluids consisted of bentonitic drilling mud with additives such as diesel fuel and chrome lignosulfonate. Most of the drilling muds were removed from the pond when the site was decommissioned in 1976, and the pond was subsequently stocked with rainbow trout by the land owner and used as a fishing pond. In 1994 and 1995, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) conducted sampling of the pond to evaluate residual contamination from the drilling fluids. Based on the results of this sampling, the DOE conducted a voluntary cleanup action {{in order to reduce the}} levels of total petroleum hydrocarbons and chromium in pond sediments. The cleanup was conducted between August and mid-November of 1995. At the end of cleanup activities, the pond was lined with a clay <b>geofabric</b> and left dry. The <b>geofabric</b> was covered with sod to protect it. The pond has since been refilled by snowmelt and inflow from a spring. Prior to remediation, the pond apparently had sufficient water quality and food resources to support stocked rainbow trout. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the present ecological status of the pond and to determine if post-remediation water quality and food resources are adequate to support stocked rainbow trout. Sampling of the pond was conducted by IT Corporation (IT) on September 10, 1996...|$|E

Significant portions of the crown of this outfall pipe had been exposed during Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and were slated to be covered again with ambient material, <b>geofabric</b> and armor matting in 1997. 271 reef-building stony corals (primarily Solenastrea bournoni and Siderastrea siderea) growing on the pipe were collected prior to repair work and subsequently transplanted back onto the concrete tiles of armor matting. Corals were typically transplanted to the upper 4 rows of cement tiles of the armor matting. One coral specimen was usually attached per tile, {{but in the case}} of the smallest corals, as many as three were placed on a tile. Equal portions of Portland type II cement and molding plaster was used for colony attachment. All corals were catalogued and macrophotographed with a scale for monitoring. There was a 97 % survival rate 3 months following transplantation. Survival rate after one year will be presented...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} problem {{encountered by}} foundation engineers involves partially saturated soils which possess considerable in-situ dry strength {{that is largely}} lost when the soils become wetted. Foundation design in such soils is difficult at best. In many cases, deep foundations {{may be required to}} transmit foundation loads to suitable bearing strata below the 'collapsible' soil deposit. This research has studied the behaviour and performance of stone columns confined and not confined by <b>geofabrics</b> and rigid piles, as deep foundations, in collapsible soil subjected to inundation. Laboratory tests were carried out, under controlled conditions of sand density and surcharge pressure, using six different types of foundation supports (a sand column, sand columns confined by T 700, T 1000, T 1500 or T 2000 <b>geofabrics</b> and a rigid pile). Each type of foundation was considered in three different lengths 250 mm, 300 mm and 410 mm. This work consisted of installing and loading 'model' foundations into a stress controlled pot containing a collapsible soil and allowing a slow rise of the water level inside it. The tests were designed to investigate the efficiency of these types of foundation supports on the improvement of the carrying capacity and on the reduction of settlement of the ground. The reduction in vertical compression of the 'piles' was also studied analytically using an analytical approach adopted and developed from models applied to soft soils. The experimental results are compared with analytical predictions. The comparisons show that the reduction in vertical compression of the 'pile' is governed by its stiffness and its length. These variables are of prime importance in the general performance of the 'pile'...|$|R
40|$|The {{container}} yard of {{the port}} of Lirquen will reach its capacity {{in a few years}} and the container terminal has no landward expansion possibilities to meet the future demand of container throughput. The bulk terminal has a lack of berths, due to increased throughput and insufficient depth, but does have possibilities for landward expansion. Looking at the actual growth of container throughput and the expected growth for the far future, {{it is clear that the}} main problem is the surface area. For efficient port operations it is necessary to expand. The planned expansion of 10 ha is far enough until 2016. The 2 berths are in fact sufficient until 2017, but to keep the waiting time low it is necessary to install 2 extra mobile cranes. One is already planned in February 2006 and the second should be installed before 2013. Both planned and recommended expansions are necessary to maintain the efficiency and the competitive status {{of the port}} of Lirquen. Different alternatives for the expansion of the piers were considered and it was decided by the port authorities that the pier number 2 has to be expanded by 250 meters. The basic design of the old pier was optimized to a new construction. After that, calculations were made to determine the dimensions that are achievable. Because there are many things that have to be investigated, recommendations were made to correctly design the pier in detail. The execution of the expansion area (without water, electricity services, etc.) of 10 ha can be finished in about 12 weeks. This time span mainly depends on the equipment and the supply rate of Bio Bio sand. The total costs have been calculated at 17, 4 million dollars. The lifetime of the expansion is 50 years. The revetment consists of 2 layers of loose rock with stone class LMA 40 - 200, applied at the toe and to LLWL. From LLWL up to the limit of the wave run-up (+ 5, 1 m LLWL) stone class LMA 60 - 300 kg is applied. To prevent soil wash out and pressure build up, a geotextile is applied.

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{method was}} demonstrated to seal leaks in geomembrane liners by attracting clay particles to the leaks using electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is {{the movement of}} electrically charged particles suspended in a liquid {{by the action of}} an electric field. A direct-current voltage impressed across the liner causes electrical current to flow through the leaks. The current produces a strong electric field at leaks. When a clay slurry is dispersed into the liquid in the impoundment, electrophoresis attracts the clay particles to the leaks, thereby sealing them. The method can seal leaks in liquid impoundments without removing the liquid or locating or accessing the leaks. The laboratory and full-scale test results were remarkable in that electrophoresis sealed the leaks completely when a layer of <b>geofabric</b> was under the liner, and electrophoresis reduced the leakage rate through holes as large as 10 mm in diameter by a factor of 1600 in the field test with gravel under the liner, and by a factor of 1667 in the laboratory basin with geonet under the liner. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades bioretention (biofiltration) systems have been {{commonly}} constructed in urban areas to manage stormwater runoff by moderating peak flows and reducing downstream pollution loads. Bioretention systems are generally soil-plant based systems which typically include a filter medium above a drainage layer. They are often either lined with a <b>geofabric</b> to support infiltration, or with an impermeable membrane to prevent infiltration and/or to allow stormwater harvesting and reuse. Bioretention systems are known to treat a range of stormwater pollutants through physical, chemical and biological processes such as mechanical filtering, sedimentation, adsorption, and plant and microbial uptake. However, the long-term pollution removal performance, particularly of heavy metals, remains largely unknown. It is generally accepted that the filter media used in bioretention systems has a finite life span, after which time it should be replaced. However, there is only very limited information available on when this should occur, or how to assess this. It is also recognised that contaminated filter media may require regulated disposal. This study presents results from a series of controlled field experiments conducted over two years which evaluated the pollution removal performance of a series of 10 year old bioretention systems located in an industrial state in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Part 2 : Information Systems, Information Modelling and SemanticsInternational audienceInformation about {{localized}} phenomena may {{be represented}} in multiple ways. GIS systems {{may be used to}} record the spatial extent of the phenomena. Observations about the state of one or more properties of the phenomena are available from real-time sensors, models, or from archives. The relationships between these data sources, or specific features in different data products, cannot easily be specified. Additionally, features change over time, their representations use different spatial scales and different aspects of them are of concern to different stakeholders. This greatly increases the number of potential relationships between features. Thus, for a given feature we can expect that heterogeneous information systems will exist, holding different types of data related to that feature. We propose the use of Linked Data to describe the relationships between them. We demonstrate this in practice using the Australian Hydrologic Geospatial Fabric (<b>Geofabric)</b> feature dataset and observational data of varying forms, including time-series and discrete measurements. We describe how different resources, and different aspects and versions of them, can be discovered and accessed.

The review identified four typical pervious paving surfaces porous concrete (PC) porous asphalt (PA), permeable inter locking concrete pavers (PICP) and concrete and plastic grid pavers (CGP and PGP). All four pavement surfaces were found to have high stormwater pollutant removal performance in a variety of conditions, {{with a wide range of}} designs. Maintenance procedures can have a significant impact on the rate of clogging of pervious pavements which can impact on the effective life span and there is conflicting and unreliable evidence to support the inclusion of a <b>geofabric</b> layer within pervious paving systems [...] This paper summarises the literature review findings and is intended as a practical resource for designers and researchers of pervious pavement systems...|$|E
40|$|There is {{widespread}} acknowledgement in the Republic of South Africa that bituminous pavement cracks are formed {{either from the}} top down or from the bottom up. The top open cracks normally are associated with environmental conditions such as heat, cold thermal movements, etc. It is also caused by overloaded tyre contact stresses, which exceed the limiting strain offered by the asphalt materials. These cracks are normally wide open and crack sealing from the top is possible and relatively easy. This paper describes the South African method (materials, machine and procedures) for sealing top down cracks. The top closed crack caused by fatigue, structural inadequacies etc., are normally witnessed as fine cracks, too narrow to be sealed from the top. Because of the tightness of the bottom up cracks, they are invariably treated by applying a sheet type sealant system. The normally used sealant sheets comprise either a bitumen impregnated <b>geofabric,</b> geogrids, patented sealant sheets, chip and spray constructions or asphalt overlays. In the RSA use is made of chip and sprays to seal the entire width of roads which then acts as a stress absorbing membrane (SAM).

40|$|The {{results of}} a study to {{evaluate}} {{the behavior of a}} flexible culvert with the inclusion of a goefabric above the culvert are presented. In the soil-fabric-culvert system the <b>geofabric</b> becomes an interactive stress-carrying component of the system. Insight into the phenomenon of the stress-attenuation due to the inclusion of a semimechanical reinforcement, like <b>geofabric,</b> is also obtained from this research. The numerical technique of the finite element method is used for the analysis of the soil-fabric-culvert system. In the finite element model, two-dimensional triangular and quadrilateral elements having nonlinear, stress-dependent material properties are used for representing the soil. Beam elements are used to model the culvert, no-compression bar elements are used for the fabric, and two-dimensional interface elements for the contact surfaces between the soil and fabric. Incremental construction sequence and approximate nonlinear geometry are adapted in the analysis. Because of the relatively recent usage of fabrics for engineering purposes, no information regarding their employment as an inclusion in a soil-culvert system is available in the open literature. However, {{a review of the literature}} is conducted to bring out the current state of understanding of the behavior of soil-culvert systems without the presence of a fabric. The classical design concepts which reflect the development of the design methodology for flexible culverts are reviewed. The phenomenological concepts of soil-culvert interaction, particularly those of arching in the soil above the culvert and buckling of the soil-surrounded culvert wall are discussed. The burial depths of D/ 2 and D are considered for the horizontal configuration of the fabric when D = diameter of culvert. A burial depth of 2 D is considered for the inclined configuration of the fabric. The following surface concentrated loading conditions are considered for the horizontal configuration of the fabric. Loads of 10 kip are placed symmetrically at S/D = 1 / 4, 1 / 2, 1, or 2 and 20 kip load at S/D = 0 (S = distance from vertical centerline of culvert). For the inclined configuration of the fabric above culvert, 50 kip surface concentrated loads are placed at S/D = 0, 1 / 4, and 1 / 2 simultaneously. This study shows that the fabric alters the stresses in the soil-fabric-culvert system by two mechanisms: the fabric can carry part of the load in tension and/or it can distribute the load more uniformly over a wider area. Under most practical conditions, the inclusion of fabric causes a significant reduction in the magnitudes of the following culvert design parameters: maximum axial force, maximum moment, vertical crown deflection, and horizontal springline deflection. The presence of fabric is more effective in attenuating the culvert design parameters for the location of surface loads within the horizontal projection of the culvert and for shallow depths of soil cover...|$|E

Biofiltration systems are generally soil-plant based systems which typically include a filter medium (usually sandy) above a gravel drainage layer. They are often lined with a <b>geofabric</b> to support infiltration, or with an impermeable membrane to prevent infiltration and/or allow stormwater harvesting and reuse. Biofiltration systems are popular due to the design flexibility they offer in terms of size and configuration, and this leads to their easy integration into existing urban areas (retrofitting). They are also seen to contribute a range of benefits beyond their main stormwater mitigation and treatment functions. However, these systems often have limitations on their hydrologic performance due to their size compared to the contributing catchment. Biofiltration systems are known to treat stormwater a range of pollutants through physical, chemical and biological processes such as mechanical filtering, sedimentation, adsorption, and plant and microbial uptake.
