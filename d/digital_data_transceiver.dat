This data communication method uses the human body itself as the signal propagation medium. It is significant to investigate the signal characteristics for baseband <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> <b>transceiver</b> design in IBC. In this paper, we present preliminary channel attenuation characteristics for baseband digital signal transmission. A digital block implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board {{as well as a}} digital Pulse Generator are employed as the IBC transmitters. The measurements using FPGA indicate the signal attenuation of 32. 76 and 27. 82 dB at frequency of 10 and 25 MHz, respectively, for digital signals with 50 % duty cycle. In addition, the attenuation of signal with 20 % and 50 % duty cycle at 50 MHz are 32. 76 and 30. 63 dB when Pulse Generator is used as the IBC transmitter. The variation of duty cycle in pulses was then used to simulate a time division multiplexed transmission scheme. It was then observed that the attenuation decreases around 4 dB when data pulses are increasingly present from 1 to 5 timeslots. Therefore, digital baseband signals deployed in a time division multiplexed mode with higher timeslo...|$|E

Using a number of filter examples, this paper shows that the proposed Nyquist filters can be a good option for applications that need to fulfill strict limits of adjacent and alternate channel power attenuation while providing a low level of residual intersymbol interference and group delay of the digital filter.|$|R

40|$|Firms {{automatically}} and continuously {{capture a}} high amount of <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> through social media, RFID tags, clickstreams, smart meters, manufacturing sensors, equipment logs, and vehicle tracking systems. However, empirical {{evidence on the}} effects of the generation of these <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> on firm performance remains scarce in the Information Systems and Management literature. Therefore, from a dynamic capability perspective, this paper examines whether companies' ability to leverage <b>digital</b> <b>data,</b> which we call their <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capability, leads to better financial performance, and whether there are moderating effects on this relationship. In order to achieve these goals, the following research questions are addressed: 1) To what extent do firms that develop <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capabilities achieve better financial performance? 2) To what extent do organisational and industry-related environmental conditions moderate the relationship between a firm's <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capability and financial performance? We empirically test our hypotheses through partial least square modelling using a financial database and a survey of sales managers from 125 firms. We find that the development of <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capability provides value in terms of firm financial performance and that the moderating effects are influential: under high levels of dynamism and munificence in younger firms, the relationship is stronger. Overall, this study evaluates the potential business value of firm <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> use and addresses a lack of empirical evidence on this issue in the Information Systems literature.
