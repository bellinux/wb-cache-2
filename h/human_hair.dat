5|$|By 1871, the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln was the {{principal}} landowner and Lord of the Manor of Navenby. A witch bottle was discovered in the foundations of a Navenby farmhouse in 2005, thought to date back to about 1830. Containing pins, <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> and urine, the bottle was believed to protect a household against evil spells.|$|E
5|$|The killer murders another woman, {{disposing}} {{of the body}} in a post office's dead letter office. Investigating, Black finds a <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> with a message etched into it—"hair today, gone tomorrow"—which he takes as an indication that the murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as insignificant. Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{is usually}} used (in {{the form of}} hypochlorous acid) to kill {{bacteria}} and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather sodium hypochlorite, formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide, or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the proteins in <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> and skin (see Hypochlorous acid), and becomes chemically bonded. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.|$|E

5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca, as the {{indigenous}} {{groups in the}} west of Colombia, developed a variety of textiles from fique or cotton. Cords were made of fique or <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> The people of the cold climate Altiplano {{did not have a}} major cotton production, yet traded most of their cotton with their neighbours; the Muzo in the west, Panche in the southwest, Guane in the northwest, and the Guayupe in the east. From the raw cotton, the Muisca women made fine cotton mantles that were traded on the many markets in the Muisca territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, more {{products}} and techniques {{have been developed}} to make lip augmentation more effective and patient friendly. The relative ease of many injections is due to surgeons using tiny 30 and 31 gauge (about as thick as a dozen <b>human</b> <b>hairs)</b> needles that are used to inject the very sensitive lips. Nonetheless, topical anesthesias are often used for lip augmentation procedures.|$|R
5|$|The {{escape route}} led {{up through a}} fan vent; the prisoners removed the fan and motor, {{replacing}} them with a steel grill and leaving a shaft large enough for a prisoner to enter. Stealing a carborundum abrasive cord from the prison workshop, the prisoners then removed the rivets from the grill. In their beds, they placed papier-mâché dummies made with <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> stolen from the barbershop. The escapees also constructed an inflatable raft over many weeks from over 50 stolen raincoats, which they prepared {{on the top of}} the cellblock, concealed from the guards by sheets which had been put up over the sides. They escaped through a vent in the roof and departed Alcatraz.|$|E

25|$|The early Japanese {{version was}} a {{refinement}} to stenciling that used <b>human</b> <b>hairs</b> {{to hold together}} parts of the stencil, such as the outside and center of a circle, so that visible bridges could be eliminated.

50|$|Opuntia microdasys has no spines, {{but instead}} has {{numerous}} white or yellow glochids 2-3 mm long in dense clusters; these glochids are barbed and thinner than the finest <b>human</b> <b>hairs,</b> detaching {{in large numbers}} upon the slightest touch. If not removed they will cause considerable skin irritation so the plants must be treated with caution. Despite this, {{it is a very}} popular cactus in cultivation.|$|R

25|$|Certain {{features}} {{of an animal}} are often of a contrasting tincture. The charge is then said to be armed (claws and horns and tusks), langued (tongue), vilené or pizzled (penis), attired (antlers or very occasionally horns), unguled (hooves), crined (horse's mane or <b>human</b> <b>hair)</b> of a specified tincture.|$|E
25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{index of}} hair bending stiffness is calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of <b>human</b> <b>hair,</b> and this index differs by race. The hair stiffness indexes of Mongoloids, Africans and Europeans are: 4.23, 2.75 and 1.59, respectively. This means that Mongoloids {{with the highest}} hair stiffness index value of 4.23 have the most rigid hair and Europeans with the lowest hair stiffness index value of 1.59 have the least rigid hair. The eccentricity of hair cross-sectional shape index is also calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of <b>human</b> <b>hair,</b> and this index also differs by race. The hair eccentricity indexes of Africans, Europeans and Mongoloids are: 1.74, 1.49 and 1.30, respectively. This means that Africans with the highest hair eccentricity index value of 1.74 have the curliest hair and Mongoloids with the lowest hair eccentricity index value of 1.30 have the least curly hair.|$|E
25|$|Although humans appear hairless {{compared}} to other primates, with notable hair growth occurring chiefly {{on the top of}} the head, underarms and pubic area, the average <b>human</b> has more <b>hair</b> follicles on his or her body than the average chimpanzee. The main distinction is that <b>human</b> <b>hairs</b> are shorter, finer, and less heavily pigmented than the average chimpanzee's, thus making them harder to see. Humans have about 2 million sweat glands spread over their entire bodies, many more than chimpanzees, whose sweat glands are scarce and are mainly located on the palm of the hand and on the soles of the feet.|$|R
50|$|In <b>humans,</b> <b>hair</b> is {{commonly}} present {{on all the}} basal segments of the digits and invariably absent from all the terminal ones. On the middle segments, there is wide fluctuation with apparent familial and racial tendencies. Hair is present on the middle segment of the fingers more frequently than on the middle segment of the toes. Hair is most often found on the middle segment of the fourth finger.|$|R
50|$|Later in 2007, the FBI {{performed}} DNA {{tests on}} two <b>human</b> <b>hairs</b> found {{on one of}} the victims. The mitochondrial DNA sequence in the hairs would eliminate 99.5% of persons by not matching their DNA. The mitochondrial DNA sequence in the hairs would eliminate 98% of African American persons by not matching their DNA. However, they matched Williams' DNA and so did not eliminate the possibility that the hairs were his.|$|R
25|$|Low {{levels of}} {{catalase}} {{may play a}} role in the graying process of <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced by the body and broken down by catalase. If catalase levels decline, hydrogen peroxide cannot be broken down so well. The hydrogen peroxide interferes with the production of melanin, the pigment that gives hair its color.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> occurs {{everywhere}} {{on the body}} except for the soles of the feet, the lips, palms of the hands, some external genital areas, the navel, scar tissue, and, apart from eyelashes, the eyelids. Like skin, hair is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium made of multi-layered flat cells whose rope-like filaments provide structure and strength to the hair shaft.|$|E

40|$|Although the microscopical {{comparison}} of <b>human</b> <b>hairs</b> {{has been accepted}} in courts of law for over a century, recent advances in DNA technology have called this type of forensic examination into question. In a number of cases, post-conviction DNA testing has exonerated defendants who were convicted {{in part on the}} results of microscopical hair comparisons. A federal judge has held a Daubert hearing on the microscopical {{comparison of}} <b>human</b> <b>hairs</b> and has concluded that this type of examination does not meet the criteria for admission of scientific evidence in federal courts. A review of the available scientific literature on microscopical hair comparisons (including studies conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) leads to three conclusions: (1) microscopical comparisons of <b>human</b> <b>hairs</b> can yield scientifically defensible conclusions that can contribute to criminal investigations and criminal prosecutions, (2) the reliability of microscopical hair comparisons is strongly affected by the training of the forensic hair examiner, (3) forensic hair examiners cannot offer estimates of the probability of a match of a questioned hair with a hair from a randomly selected person. In order for microscopical hair examinations to survive challenges under the U. S. Supreme Court’s Daubert decision, hair microscopists must be better trained and undergo frequent proficiency testing. More research on the error rates of microscopical hair comparisons should be undertaken, and guidelines for the permissible interpretations of such comparisons should be established. Until these issues have been addressed and satisfactorily resolved, microscopical hair comparisons should be regarded by law enforcement agencies and courts of law as merely presumptive in nature, and all microscopical hair comparisons should be confirmed by nuclear DNA profiling or mitochondrial DNA sequencing...|$|R
25|$|A {{gene for}} type I hair keratin {{was lost in}} the human lineage. Keratins are a major {{component}} of <b>hairs.</b> <b>Humans</b> still have nine functional type I hair keratin genes, but the loss of that particular gene may have caused the thinning of <b>human</b> body <b>hair.</b> The gene loss occurred relatively recently in human evolution—less than 240,000 years ago.|$|R
25|$|These mites {{are found}} in <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> follicles, {{normally}} found in greater numbers around the cheeks, nose, eyebrows, eyelashes, and forehead. They could {{also be found in}} other parts of the body such as arms, chest, and ears. It is a species of tiny mites that have been thought to contribute to hair loss (though this hypothesis is under debate) and lives in pores and hair follicles.|$|E
25|$|Very thin {{strands of}} albumen could be soft and fine {{enough to allow}} the {{trapdoor}} to close completely; these would not be drawn in any further unless the trigger hairs were indeed stimulated again. On the other hand, a <b>human</b> <b>hair,</b> finer still but relatively hard and unyielding, could prevent a seal being formed; these would prevent the trap from resetting at all due to leakage of water.|$|E
25|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Beineman's body further revealed {{she had been}} raped prior to her murder, and that her torn panties had been forcefully placed inside her vagina; these panties revealed the presence of human semen and 509 <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> clippings measuring less than three-eights of an inch upon the material. These hair clippings were predominantly blond, and as such {{did not belong to}} the victim, whose own hair color had been dark brown.|$|E
40|$|In this study, it was {{investigated}} how estrogens (17 -β-estradiol, E 2) affect the estrogen receptor (ER) expression and gene regulation of male versus female <b>human</b> scalp <b>hair</b> follicles in vitro. Anagen VI follicles from frontotemporal scalp skin were microdissected and organ-cultured {{for up to}} 9 d {{in the presence of}} E 2 (1 – 100 nm). Immunohistochemistry was performed for ERβ-expression, known to be predominant in <b>human</b> scalp <b>hair</b> follicles, and for TGF-β 2 -expression (as negative key hair growth modulator), and E 2 -responsive genes in organ-cultured <b>human</b> scalp <b>hair</b> follicles (48 h, 10 nM) were explored by cDNA microarray, using a commercial skin focus chip (Memorec, Cologne, Germany). The distribution pattern of ERβ and TGF-β 2 -immunoreactivity differed between male and female hair follicles after 48 h culture. Of 1300 genes tested, several genes were regulated sex-dependent differently. The study reveals substantial sex-dependent differences in the response of frontotemporal <b>human</b> scalp <b>hair</b> follicles to E 2. Recognition and systematic dissection of the E 2 -dependent gene regulation will be crucial for the development of more effective, gender-tailored management strategies for female versus male pattern balding...|$|R
