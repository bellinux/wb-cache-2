5|$|In 2012, Rodney Gomes {{modelled}} {{the orbits}} of 92 Kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted. He concluded that the simplest <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> the gravitational pull of a distant planetary companion, such as a Neptune-sized object at 1500 AU or a Mars-sized object at around 53 AU.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2009, Sörenstam, who {{was ranked}} third the {{previous}} week despite having announced her retirement effective {{at the end of}} the 2008 season, was removed from the rankings. No official <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> given for her removal. Sörenstam later posted in her personal blog that she asked to be removed.|$|E
5|$|A {{controlled}} {{comparative study}} by the Navy Experimental Diving Unit in the NEDU Ocean Simulation Facility wet-pot comparing the VVAL18 Thalmann Algorithm with a deep stop profile suggests that the deep stops schedule had {{a greater risk of}} DCS than the matched (same total stop time) conventional schedule. The proposed <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> that slower gas washout or continued gas uptake offset benefits of reduced bubble growth at deep stops.|$|E
5000|$|According to Dennett, {{the debate}} between Stalinesque and Orwellian <b>explanations</b> <b>is</b> unresolvable [...] - [...] no amount of {{scientific}} information could ever answer the question. Dennett therefore argues (in accord with the philosophical doctrine of verificationism) that, since {{the differences between the}} two <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> unresolvable, the point of disagreement is logically meaningless so both <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> mistaken.|$|R

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|US {{intelligence}} officers believe {{the most likely}} <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> that someone in the cockpit of Flight 370 re-programmed the aircraft's autopilot before it travelled south across the Indian Ocean. Police searched {{the homes of the}} pilots and seized financial records for all 12 crew members, including bank statements, credit card bills and mortgage documents. On 2 April 2014, Malaysia's Police Inspector-General said that more than 170 interviews had been conducted as part of Malaysia's criminal investigation, including interviews with family members of the pilots and crew.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hastings returned, {{he had decided}} to become a barrister. There were various {{problems}} with this aim: in particular, he had no money, and the training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change of career, and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he chose this particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with the Bar, {{was a member of the}} Inner Temple), but the most likely <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a barrister were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of £100 when he was called to the Bar – £100 in 1901 would be worth approximately £ in 2015 – and Hastings was literally penniless.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Renormalization group (RG) {{methods are}} an {{established}} strategy {{to explain how}} it is possible that microscopically different systems exhibit virtually the same macro behavior when undergoing phase-transitions. I argue – in agreement with Robert Batterman – that RG <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> non-causal <b>explanations.</b> However, Batterman misidentifies the reason why RG <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> non-causal: it is not the case that an <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> non-causal if it ignores causal details. I propose an alternative argument, according to which RG <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> non-causal <b>explanations</b> because their explanatory power is due to the application mathematical operations, which do not serve the purpose of representing causal relations...|$|R
40|$|I {{offer one}} {{possible}} explanation of why inertial and gravitational mass are equal in Newtonian gravitation.

Moreover, this form of <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> particularly important, at least in physics, because demands for this kind of <b>explanation</b> <b>are</b> used to motivate and shape research into the next generation of physical theories...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{speculation}} about a sequel being developed to Uprising, Sakurai confirmed {{that there was}} no sequel planned for the game. Uprising was the only game Project Sora ever produced; just four months after the game's release, it was announced that the studio had closed down with no <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> given for the closure, while Sakurai and Sora Ltd. were working on the next entry in the Super Smash Bros. series. Pit returned from Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, while fellow Kid Icarus characters Dark Pit and Palutena were also introduced as playable characters. The games' Classic Mode also incorporate a difficulty slider similar to the Fiend's Cauldron in Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Episode I in 2002, the Xenosaga project was reevaluated and staff reshuffled to allow newer staff members a chance to handle the series. Series creator and Monolith Soft co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi stepped down as director, taking on other {{responsibilities}} within the company {{in addition to being}} given wider creative input on projects. Takahashi's <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> {{that he did not want}} to limit the scope and direction of the Xenosaga series, and that his style of direction as seen for Episode I could result in the development period becoming extended exponentially. During this period the Xenosaga series, originally planned by Takahashi as a six-part series, was rearranged into a trilogy, with the possibility of further episodes should the series meet continued success. The new director was Koh Arai, while Tomohiro Hagiwara became lead producer, both of whom had worked on Episode I in minor roles; Takahashi on an executive role overseeing Episode II, in addition to keeping the staff informed with the lore of Xenosaga.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a {{favorite}} subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1953, the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features. The <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} three inquests into the death of Leon Patterson. The first inquest was adjourned and there have <b>been</b> two {{different}} <b>explanations</b> for this. The first <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> “problems with a juror”. The second <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that the coroner was sacked because of some remarks he made to Patterson’s twin sister, Stephanie Lightfoot-Bennet, who was representing the family at the inquest.

5|$|In total, Crawford {{played in}} eight games in 1919, scoring 488 runs and taking 20 wickets. Wisden commented that his batting {{was as good}} as it had ever been, but his bowling lacked spin and accuracy. He played only four more times in {{first-class}} cricket. Part of the <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> that he joined Dunlop Rubber as a manager at one of its mills in Rochdale. He played as an amateur for Rochdale Cricket Club in 1920, but by 1921 he had left the club—the Manchester Guardian speculated that he had returned to Surrey. He returned to live with his family in Merton Park, and played for the local cricket club. Of his first-class matches, one was for Surrey against the Australian touring team of 1921 and the others were for teams representing the Gentlemen. In his entire first-class career, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at 20.66.|$|E
5|$|Rand {{was portrayed}} by American actress Grace Lee Whitney, who had {{previously}} worked with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in both The Lieutenant and a pilot for a show he created called Police Story. Whitney as Rand was involved in promoting Star Trek before it aired, but did {{not appear in the}} first two pilots. Roddenberry set out the role of Rand to Whitney, saying that she and Kirk were meant to have feelings for one another, but should never act on them. Part way through the first season, Whitney was released from her contract. The official <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> that the production team wanted to free up Kirk to have relationships with other women, but it was actually necessitated because the series was over budget and was looking to cut costs. It is unclear as to who suggested that her contract should be terminated, or who made the final decision. Roddenberry later blamed NBC for her release and said he regretted it. Whitney later directly linked her departure from the show to her alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Soma Bringer was not {{released}} outside Japan: no <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> given by Nintendo, {{although there was}} some speculation that its high text content was to blame. Its exclusivity to Japan has drawn both disappointment and criticism from some journalists, in addition to continued hope for a Western release: an article from IGN cited the release of Glory of Heracles as a possible precursor to a Western release, while gaming site Siliconera reported that Nintendo might release it in the West during the transitional phase between the DS and its successor the Nintendo 3DS, although the writer noted that Soma Bringers text-heavy approach {{made it more difficult}} and thus less appealing to localize. To date, it remains exclusive to Japan. An unofficial open fan translation patch was created: while not complete, it translated the greater majority of text into English.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with making sense of current ways of explaining housing policy. Four different types of <b>explanation</b> <b>are</b> identified and analysed in detail: explanations in terms of systems of actors, hypothetico‐deductive explanations, realist explanations, and culturalist explanations. The characteristic ontology and epistemology of each type of <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> made explicit. The four types of <b>explanation</b> <b>are</b> then evaluated, partly in their own terms, and partly in relation to each other. It <b>is</b> argued that <b>explanations</b> in terms of systems of actors are inherently superficial, so {{it is essential to}} go beyond and below them in order to achieve an acceptable level of explanatory adequacy. Hypothetico‐deductive <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> rescued from realist and culturalist criticisms which tend to dismiss them altogether, but they are recognised as having serious limitations in terms of conceptual vagueness/ambiguity and contextual fragmentation. Realist <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> considered in greater depth through an examination of regulation theory. This examination amounts to a critique of the theory as regards its application to housing policy. Finally, culturalist <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> assessed by using Kemeny's theory as an illustration, with both ontological and epistemological problems being identified. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the logical relations and differences between explanations of the four different types...|$|R
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Deus Ex was {{revealed}} by Eidos in 2001 through job listings advertising for designers {{to work on}} the game. Later that month at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Eidos confirmed that both the second Deus Ex and the next Thief game would be coming to consoles before arriving on PC; the <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> that taking the restrictions of console hardware into account would make later ports to PC more effective. Eidos officially announced the game E3 2002; the platforms listed were PC, Xbox and PS2. It was later revealed that Ion Storm were struggling to work out how to port the game to PS2 given the extensive hardware differences between the three platforms, and were reluctant to do so due to these issues. Following the game's release, it was clarified that no PS2 version would be developed. As part of the promotion, the soundtrack was made available for download through the game's website. A demo was released in November 2003. The game was released in North America on December 2, 2003. Following the North American release, Ion Storm released a patch to fix issues with the graphics and additional gameplay elements such as quick saves. The game released in Europe on March 5, 2004. The Xbox version was also released in Japan. First announced in March 2004, the game was released on June 17.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E
