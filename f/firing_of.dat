50|$|Fire is {{also known}} as Agni and is the fourth element. It is also eternal and perishable. The {{essential}} character <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> is to generate heat. According to Hindu Mythology, Agni is one of the Eight guardians who guards our universe and is known as Asta-dik-palakas. In Indian mythology there are mentions of various types <b>of</b> <b>fires.</b> The four important ones are <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the earth, <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the sky, <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the stomach, which can mean hunger or digestive power, and the fire we commonly use.|$|R

5000|$|The {{department}} {{was the first}} in the world to utilize the telegraph to alert <b>fire</b> fighters <b>of</b> an emergency, installing the system in 1851. [...] The first fire alarm was transmitted via the Fire Alarm Telegraph system on April 29, 1852. The famous Boston <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> 1872 led to the appointment of a board <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> commissioners. The Boston Fire Department also provided assistance in the Great Chelsea <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1908 and the Great Salem <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1914.

5|$|Bond {{encounters}} Chinese agent Wai Lin, {{who is also}} {{investigating the}} matter and the two agree to work together.

They blow a hole in the ship, exposing it to radar, leading to its sinking averting war between Britain and China.|$|E
5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the barrels. The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E
5|$|Four of the {{officers}} were {{of the line and}} responsible for the handling of the vessel and operation of guns during battle, while the engineering officers were considered a class unto themselves. In Monitors turret, Greene and Stodder supervised loading and <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> the two 11-inch Dahlgrens. Each gun was crewed by eight men. Thus, during battle, at least 18 men were present in the turret. In Worden's report of 27 January 1862 to Welles, he stated he believed 17 men and 2 officers would be the maximum number in the turret that allowed the crew to work without getting in each other's way.|$|E

5|$|However, {{instead of}} {{being used as a}} coastal defense ship, Deutschland was broken up in 1920–1922. Hannover was to be {{converted}} into a target vessel, although this was never done. She was eventually broken up in 1944–1946. Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein were the only two vessels of the class to see continued front-line service in the Reichsmarine and later the Kriegsmarine. Both ships saw limited duty during World War II, which was inaugurated by the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> Schleswig-Holsteins main guns at the Polish fortress at Westerplatte. Near {{the end of the war}} the two ships were both sunk.|$|E
5|$|In {{the video}} game Halo 2 (2004), {{a member of the}} Covenant Prophet triumvirate, Regret, arrives at Earth with a fleet. Most of his fleet is destroyed; Regret's ship flees to another ring, Delta Halo, and is {{followed}} by the human ship In Amber Clad and the Master Chief aboard her. The Chief kills Regret before the majority of the Covenant fleet arrives at Delta Halo, along with the Covenant's holy city of High Charity. The death of Regret leads the remaining Prophets to promote the Brutes as their guards, replacing the Elites. The Elites, outraged, threaten to resign from the Covenant high council; in turn the Prophets give the Brutes carte blanche to kill the Elites, sparking a civil war. In the midst of these developments, the Flood are again released; the High Prophet Mercy is killed by the parasite, while the last remaining leader, Truth, flees to Earth in a Forerunner ship, entrusting the activation of Halo to the Brute Tartarus. The Elites ally with the humans of In Amber Clad to stop the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> the ring, but inadvertently set all the remaining Halo rings to be remotely activated from a location known as the Ark, placed outside the range of the Halo Array to protect certain species from the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> the Halo rings, built as a foundry for the rings including replacing any that get destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> the guns {{under the command}} of the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E
5000|$|David E. James {{described}} <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> Waters {{as one of}} Brakhage's {{most interesting}} films, in large part due to its use of sound.

Daniel Barnett, in his book Movement as meaning: in experimental film, wrote of his first encounter with <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> Waters, [...] "I can't ever remember art making me so angry," [...] citing the film's apparent incomprehensibility on initial viewing.|$|R
