5000|$|Written Manchu {{was close}} to being called an [...] "open syllable" [...] {{language}} because the only consonant that came regularly {{at the end of}} native words was , similar to the situation in Beijing Mandarin, Northeastern Mandarin, Jilu Mandarin and Japanese. This resulted in almost all native words ending in a vowel. In some words, there were vowels that were separated by consonant clusters, as in the words ilha ('flower') and abka ('heaven'); however, in most words, the vowels were separated from one another by only single consonants. This open syllable structure might not have been found in all varieties of spoken Manchu, but it was certainly found in the southern dialect that became the basis for the written language. It is also apparent that the open-syllable tendency of the Manchu language had been <b>growing</b> <b>ever</b> <b>stronger</b> for the several hundred years since written records of Manchu were first produced: consonant clusters that had appeared in older forms, such as abka and abtara-mbi ('to yell'), were gradually simplified, and the words began to be written as aga or aha (in this form meaning 'rain') and atara-mbi ('to cause a commotion').|$|E
5000|$|The manga also {{introduces}} {{three other}} Spawns {{who are also}} active, and {{who have been on}} Earth for some time. The first is actually a Spawn introduced in the McFarlane toyline, Zombie Spawn, who has been [...] "alive" [...] for about five hundred years, doing his best to resist Malebolgia and give as much grief as possible to the lord of the eighth circle of Hell. A female spawn from the 19th century is also introduced, as is a creature {{which may or may not}} be a wolf, resurrected and transformed into a 'werewolf' Spawn. Unlike Kurosawa and Simmons, these Spawns do not wear the now iconic armor which is associated with the character, though the female pirate spawn and the werewolf spawn both have markings on their face which are the same as those on the cowl of the Spawn mask. The Zombie Spawn does not wear any version of the markings or armor at all. [...] There are several references to the Al Simmons incarnation of the character, who is implied to be active simultaneously with Kurosawa. There are, however, no references to the 'Youngbloods', a group of heroes that Image comics produced, and which Simmons was mistakenly believed to be by at least three to six people in the beginnings of the American comic. Simmons himself does not appear in any way in the manga, except for a one-panel shot of his arm after the battle with Violator. Malebolgia is also briefly shown in some panels. A new angel is introduced in the manga as well: Mikaela, who appeared to be designed in homage to Angela. [...] Only three volumes of the series were released; the Japanese edition was canceled on a cliffhanger. The manga is not intended to have any direct relationship with the normal comic continuity. [...] One other key difference between the original comic and the manga version of Spawn, was that the Hellspawns in the manga are said to not die off completely and return to Hell, as was supposedly going to happen to Simmons at first, but rather they would be recharged and sent back to Earth, potentially losing more and more of themselves as each time happened, supposedly <b>growing</b> <b>ever</b> <b>stronger,</b> but also becoming just flat out evil, or else simply losing touch with that which made them originally wish to return to life to begin with. Cheveyo is the eldest active Spawn out of the four in the manga, and Cogliostro himself, as he is five hundred years old. This is another key difference, because in the American book, A Spawn is only born once every four hundred years and they lose power eventually, but none of them are supposed to be able to live the full four hundred years between each birth, let alone a century past it. Since Kurosawa is brought back to Earth seven years after his death, he apparently is 'born' as a Spawn literally simultaneously with Al Simmons, as, again, events in the American comic book, at least partially, had an effect on a character in the manga (namely Clown/Violator), and thus the Spawn manga may be viewed to be an alternate universe that has unofficial, but still partially visible ties to the original material.|$|E

The present study employed Cialdini’s framework in the analysis of SNSs design characteristics that facilitate social influence leading to the fulfillment of site marketing objectives, such as member acquisition, member retention and user loyalty. We examined social application features of the three major Romanian SNSs, i. e.

40|$|A novel {{laboratory}} experiment for investigating statistically steady rotating turbulence is presented. Turbulence is produced nonintrusively {{by means of}} electromagnetic forcing. Depending on the rotation rate the Taylor-based Reynolds number {{is found to be}} in the range of 90 ¿Re¿¿ 240. Relevant properties of the turbulence, both with and without rotation, have been quantified with stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV). This method enables instantaneous measurement of all three velocity components in horizontal planes at a distance H from the bottom. The root-mean-square turbulent velocity decreases inversely proportional to H in the nonrotating experiments and is approximately constant when background rotation is applied. The integral length scale shows a weak H-dependence in the nonrotating experiments which is presumably due to the spatial extent of the forcing. Based on the behavior of the principal invariants of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor, the rotating turbulence has been characterized as a three-dimensional two-component flow. Furthermore, these SPIV measurements provide supporting evidence for (i) reduction of the dissipation rate, (ii) suppression of the vertical velocity as compared to the horizontal velocity, and (iii) increased spatial and temporal correlation of the horizontal velocity components, with the temporal correlation <b>growing</b> <b>ever</b> <b>stronger</b> as the rotation rate is increased. A less commonly known feature of rotating turbulence, quantified {{here for the first time}} in a laboratory setting, is the reverse dependence on the rotation rate of the spatial horizontal velocity correlation functions. Another interesting result concerns the linear (anomalous) scaling of the longitudinal spatial structure function exponents in the presence of rotation, consistent with a study by Baroud et al.
