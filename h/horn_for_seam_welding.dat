This enables the arc to work under the weld pool surface (a so-called ‘buried arc’) and take advantage of the arc pressure of the shielded CO 2 to trap spatter. According to Nishiguchi et al. (1975), the buried arc welding technique is capable of achieving higher welding speeds and filler metal deposition rates than a globular arc. Weld speed can reach 2, 540  mm/min and clean-up is minimal (Lienert et al. 2011). Stol et al. (2006) studied the use of buried arc GMAW <b>for</b> <b>seam</b> <b>welds.</b> The buried arc approach has great potential for use in the automotive, railroad, and marine industries for welding subassemblies. An example application is welding of edges and sides of aluminium parts as an alternative to GMAW. Controlled globular arc mode can be used <b>for</b> fillet or <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> in lap or T-joints and square groove butt joints. It is suitable for the mechanized welding of thin section material at high speeds and can be used in fully mechanized or automatic gas metal arc welding. It is also used in the welding of pipe cylinders. A buried arc can be used in car applications in butt welding for the body and semi-automatic welding for the frame and body (Kielhorn et al. 2001; Aoki et al. 2003; Kah et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|The {{reproducibility}} {{of laser}} welded joints in highly reflective {{materials such as}} copper and aluminum is a difficult issue. Fluctuating energy deposition resulting from unsteady material and surface properties leads to unreliable processing conditions. The adaptation of the energy deposition to the material and workpiece properties achieved by a precise temporal and spatial control of the laser power offers new opportunities for such applications. Spatial power modulation influences the vertical and lateral melt flow velocity significantly and can be achieved for different welding applications {{with the use of}} highly dynamic galvoscanners. Together with fibre laser and Nd:YAG lasers capable of pulse durations of 100 ms, a modulation frequency of 2 kHz is possible. As <b>for</b> <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> applications linear feed and oscillation shapes are superposed, the actual feed rate of the laser beam varies during the process. To ensure a consistent energy deposition, the temporal power modulation must be adapted to the spatial modulation. Furthermore the status of the keyhole can be influenced by fast power modulation with a frequency up to 10 kHz. In this paper the influence of power modulation on the melt flow is examined by means of high speed photography...|$|R

We can solve these problems by applying the welding production technology. For this {{it is necessary to}} conduct a research of the structure and mechanical properties of welded joints of sintered titanium alloys produced by flash welding. Methodology. Titanium industrial powders, type PT 5 - 1 were used as original substance. Forming of blanks, whose chemical composition corresponded to BT 1 - 0 alloy, was carried out using the powder metallurgy method. Compounds were obtained by flash welding without preheating. Microstructural investigations and mechanical tests were carried out. To compare the results investigations of BT 1 - 0 cast alloy were conducted. Findings.

In this study, an insufficient pressure problem occurring in <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> on an aluminum extrusion profile section is investigated.

40|$|A kind of {{intelligent}} visual sensor system, which is mainly {{composed of a}} laser lighting source and an intelligent camera based on FPGA and DSP, is designed using the triangle structured light principle <b>for</b> laser <b>welding</b> <b>seam</b> recognition. Intending to meet the high-precision demands, on one hand, {{the components of the}} sensor such as the lighting source, the optical lens, the optic sensor of the camera are selected and the errors caused by these parts are analyzed. Furthermore, the triangle structured light principle models are built and the simulation is given to opt imize the light path parameters. On the other hand, the methods of the image processing <b>for</b> <b>seam</b> recognition using intelligent camera based on FPGA and DSP are explained. Experiments results proved that the sensor design is reasonable and the image recognition methods are rational and effective. Very compact structure, high-precision and high-real-time performance are integrated in this sensor, so it can be applied well in the seam tracking and inspection system in the laser welding and arc welding fields...|$|R
