5000|$|At 9:50 that evening, {{the crew}} mated the bell to the {{entrance}} lock as planned, but during the lock‑on procedure a gas leak developed between the mating flanges. The bell was removed, the flange surfaces were cleaned, and on the second attempt the bell was successfully sealed to the system. After Holmes and Baldwin equalized the bell {{with the rest of}} the complex, they opened the inside door and were in the process of transferring in{{to the entrance}} lock when the gas leak suddenly returned. With the needle on the Heise gauge dropping, an attempt was made to isolate the divers from the leak by sealing the door of the entrance lock that led to the bell, but according to the dive log this effort was “abandoned.” To protect Holmes and Baldwin from further pressure loss, the supervisor ordered them to climb into chamber one. There, they leaned against the inside hatch while the supervisor injected a small amount of helium inside the chamber to seal the door. At this point—perhaps due to the distractions of the emergency—the supervisor made the kind of nightmarish mistake that all supervisors who bear such enormous responsibilities fear; he forgot to reset the valves to reconnect the Heise gauge with chamber one. And because chamber one was not equipped with a dedicated depth gauge, Holmes and Baldwin were now in a part of the system not being monitored by any gauge at all. Meanwhile, the Heise gauge was still recording a pressure drop, which the supervisor erroneously believed was reading chamber one. Had he glanced down at his console and examined the telltale positions of the valve handles, he would have instantly realized that his divers were safe and that the Heise gauge was merely reading the continuing bell/entrance lock gas leak. But the supervisor thought that he had failed to achieve a seal on chamber one’s hatch, and so he began to feed large quantities of pure helium into the chamber where the two divers were stationed. By the time he realized his error, Holmes and Baldwin had been pressurized from 310 feet to 650 feet over the course of several minutes. The rapid compression, combined with the high thermal transfer property of helium, plus the high <b>humidity</b> <b>factor</b> of the atmosphere, turned the chamber into an oven, sending the temperature of the atmosphere soaring from an estimated 90 degrees F to 120. Frantic, the two divers began pulling desperately on the chamber hatch to escape the inferno, but nothing they could do would budge the door. The only minimal relief they received was to take the mattresses off their bunks and lie spread-eagled on the somewhat cooler aluminum surfaces. With no place to flee to, and forced to breathe an intolerable atmosphere, the men died several hours later of hyperthermia.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Statistical {{analyses}} {{were used to}} develop predictive models of rice blast and to relate the favorability of environment to disease incidence and severity on different rice cultivars at five sites in Asia. The WINDOW PANE program was used to search for weather factors highly correlated with blast. Stepwise and r-square linear regression procedures were then applied to generate the predictive models at each site. Models developed at Icheon, South Korea included relative <b>humidity</b> and rainfall <b>factors</b> {{as the most important}} predictors of disease. Temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and relative <b>humidity</b> <b>factors</b> were components of models at Cavinti and the IRRI blast nursery in the Philippines. Rainfall, temperature, and solar radiation factors were important at Gunung Medan and Sitiung, Indonesia. Model validation was done to verify accuracy of models for predictions. Model predictions were also used to determine the effects on blast of sowing time, nitrogen amount, and increase in temperature. Limitations of the models are discussed. Path coefficient analysis was used to identify direct and indirect influences exerted by weather factors on blast. The largest direct influence on disease was exerted by <b>humidity</b> <b>factors</b> at Icheon; temperature, rainfall, and wind speed factors at Cavinti; temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>factors</b> at IRRI; rainfall factors at Gunung Medan; and temperature factors at Sitiung. Although path coefficient values (Py) were estimated from the decomposition of correlation coefficients, factors that had a high correlation with disease parameters did not always give high Py. Multivariate analysis was used {{to determine the effects of}} sowing times on proneness of tropical rice to blast. Cluster analysis of 24 hypothetical sowing months at Cavinti, the IRRI blast nursery, and Sitiung sites revealed three blast proneness groups. Principal component analysis showed that IR 50 cultivar would be susceptible at Cavinti at any time of the year. Sowing C 22 cultivar at Cavinti in Group I and III months would make it prone to panicle and leaf blast, respectively. At the IRRI blast nursery, leaf and panicle infections on IR 50 would be probable only in Group I and II months.

Recently, researchers showed that annealing can also provide additional benefits, such as strain and humidity sensitivity enhancement and augmented temperature operational range.

In this paper, the annealing effects on the stress and force sensitivities of PMMA fibre Bragg grating sensors are investigated. The incentive for that investigation was an unexpected behaviour observed in an array of sensors which were used for liquid level monitoring. One sensor exhibited much lower pressure sensitivity and that {{was the only one that}} was not annealed. To further investigate the phenomenon, additional sensors were photo-inscribed and characterised with regard their stress and force sensitivities.

40|$|Comfortable {{and human}} health are {{affected}} more by climate than any {{other elements of the}} physical environment. Physiological functions of the human and animal body respond to changes in the weather, and incidence of certain disease shows a close correlation with climate and seasons. Of the climatic elements which affect the human body, the most important one is wet bulb temperature. The body 2 ̆ 7 s response to wet bulb temperature is affected by the rates of conduction, convection, and radiation heat away from the body, and by cooling due to evaporation at the skin surface and in the respiratory tracts. The resulting temperature affect is known as the sensible temperature. It varies not only with the <b>humidity</b> <b>factor</b> and air movement at skin surface but also from one person to another, and it is, therefore, not measurable by any instrument. The values of sensible temperature and the wet bulb temperature however, are approximately the same when the skin is moist and is exposed to calm air at normal dry bulb temperature, since evaporation will then be the principal cooling process. From the point of view the wet bulb temperature is the most suitable element of human sensation and human life. (1) The average insensible comfortable temperature in the thermal sensation varied in a year as follows: [表省略] (2) Bioclimatic charts in Japan were built up with wet bulb temperature mainly.

40|$|With {{the impacts}} of climate change and {{impending}} crisis of potable water, potential sustainable sources of water are under investigations. One of such potential sources is fog water collection. In the past, collection of fog water was considered negligible and non-worthy. However, recent studies suggest that fog-water collection can be a reasonable sustainable source of water depending on favorable topographic and atmospheric conditions. This paper presents {{development of a mathematical}} model for fog-formation and eventual quantification of fog-water collection. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) equation for dew point calculation has been modified and extended to incorporate effects of different climatic parameters on fog formation. A new parameter named Fog Potential Index (FPI), which is a function of difference between dew point and air temperature for a particular location has been introduced and defined. NOAA proposed an equation to calculate dew point based on actual water vapor pressure in the air, which can be calculated from dry bulb temperature of the air and relative humidity. Following calculation of average dew point using NOAA equation between a timestep, FPI was calculated for a particular time step. FPI for each timestep was multiplied with the <b>humidity</b> <b>factor,</b> wind velocity factor and area of the fog collector to incorporate the effects of humidity ratio, wind velocity and fog collector area in the quantification of fog water. Effect of wind velocity on fog formation has been discussed. It was found that wind velocity has got two-fold impacts on the formation of fog; (i) for a lower wind velocity upto a certain threshold value, fog formation increases with velocity as old condensed moist air is continuously replaced by new moist air, and (ii) for a higher wind velocity (beyond the threshold value), fog formation decreases with velocity due to disturbance in the formation of fog. The developed model was calibrated using fog-water collection experimental data from Asir region of Saudi Arabia...|$|E

Specifically, this project also reveals the breakdown characteristics of air, carbon dioxide (CO 2) and the gas mixture (air + CO 2) {{with the purpose of}} making a comparison. The gas mixture has a ratio of 70 % of CO 2 and 30 % of air. These gases were tested inside the pressure vessel and subjected to 1 bar (abs) pressure. Standard (1. 2 / 50 μs) lightning impulse was applied alongside with three electrode arrangements. The gap distance between electrodes is also varied ranging from 0. 5 cm to 2 cm. It was found that highest U 50 was recorded at the furthest gap length and when the insulating medium used was CO 2. The rising trend of U 50 is more obvious at sphere gaps as it provides more uniform fields. This U 50 was calculated by using up and down method. Moreover, the highest maximum electric field (Emax) was found at non-uniform field gap namely rod-sphere gaps whereas the values were obtained with the help of FEMM simulation software. The Emax of rod-sphere when the air is used as an insulating medium has revealed that it is directly proportional to the gap length in which probably due to the self-restoration of air at the non-uniform field is less compared to other gas hence causing the dropoff insulation strength. As the gap distance between electrodes is small, the highest field utilization factor was recorded which is 0. 93 (5 cm sphere), 0. 86 (2 cm sphere) and 0. 11 (rod-sphere) {{as a result of the}} field dispersed uniformly at short gaps.

Serum witha titer of 1 : 100 or more against one or more tested positive for serovar. Micro Aglutination Test result wasthe dependent variable (Y), while the independent variables (X) were factors of farmers, animal factors,enclosure factors, and feed factors. Univariate analysis was done to see descriptively each variable studied. Association between the prevalence of leptospirosis and risk factors was analyzed by Chi Square. Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis was used to build models of leptospirosis disease to investigatethe risk factors associated with leptospirosis. Variables that influence the prevalence of leptospirosiswere measured magnitude of association by Odd Ratio. The results of study that the prevalence of bovineleptospirosis in Girimulyo subdistrict, Kulonprogo district was 7. 6 %. Risk factors for the prevalence ofleptospirosis in cattle in Girimulyo subdistrict, Kulonprogo district were livestock purchased factor (OR 5. 49) and a high <b>humidity</b> <b>factor</b> (OR 1. 65). These results can be concluded that leptospirosis infection incattle is high (7. 6 %) in the area of human leptospirosis. The possibility cattle as a source of infection inhumans still needs further research...|$|E
