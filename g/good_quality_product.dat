40|$|In the UK, Open Learning {{has been}} used in {{industrial}} training for at least the last decade. Trainers and Open Learning practitioners have been concerned about the <b>quality</b> of the <b>products</b> and services being delivered. The argument put forward in this thesis is that there is ambiguity amongst industrialists over the meanings of `Open Learning' and `Quality in Open Learning'. For clarity, a new definition of Open Learning is proposed which challenges the traditional learner-centred approach favoured by educationalists. It introduces the concept that there are benefits afforded to the trainer/employer/teacher {{as well as to the}} learner. This enables a focussed view of what quality in Open Learning really means. Having discussed these issues, a new quantitative method of evaluating Open Learning is proposed. This is based upon an assessment of the degree of compliance with which products meet Parts 1 & 2 of the Open Learning Code of Practice. The vehicle for these research studies has been a commercial contract commissioned by the Training Agency for the Engineering Industry Training Board (EITB) to examine the quality of Open Learning products supplied to the engineering industry. A major part of this research has been the application of the evaluation technique to a range of 67 Open Learning products (in eight subject areas). The findings were that <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> <b>products</b> can be found right across the price range - so can average and poor quality ones.

40|$|The {{structural}} and optical properties of technologically interesting pyrolytic carbons formed from cured novolac resin and cured novolac/biomass composites were studied by X-Ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Pyrolysis of the cured materials {{took place at}} temperatures in the range 400 - 1000 degreesC. The most important weight loss, shrinkage and structural changes of pyrolyzed composites are observed at temperatures up to 600 degreesC due to the olive stone component. In the same temperature range, the changes in pyrolyzed novolac are smaller. The spectroscopic analysis shows that novolac pyrolyzed up to 900 degreesC has less defects and disorder than the composites. However, above 900 degreesC, pyrolyzed novolac becomes more disordered compared to the pyrolyzed composites. It is concluded that partial replacement of novolac by olive stone in the composite materials leads {{to the formation of}} a low cost, <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> <b>product...</b>|$|E

The newly developed process had marked benefits over conventional processing in terms of a lowered energy usage (73 %), processing time (47 %) as well as water use (49 %), but had been developed as a “proof of principle’’. The objective of this work was to develop the process further to a stage ready for adoption by industry. A process ready for adoption by industry is one that is able to generate <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> <b>products</b> (<b>good</b> <b>quality</b> <b>products</b> are those that has solids removed to industry standards, without visible damages to grain surface, evenly dyed etc.), require minimal changes to plant or operation layout and reduce usage of resources (e. g. water and chemicals). Mass balancing was used to investigate potential modifications for the process based on the understanding developed from a detailed analysis of preliminary design trials. Results showed that a configuration utilising a 2 stage counter-current system for the washing stages and segregation and recycling of enzyme float prior to dilution in the neutralization stage was a significant improvement. Benefits over conventional processing include a reduction of residual TDS by 50 % at the washing stages and 70 % savings on water use overall. Benefits over the un-optimized LASRA process are reduction of solids in product after enzyme treatment and neutralization stages by 30 %, additional water savings of 21 %, as well as 10 % savings of enzyme usage. The optimized (new) LASRA process uses existing equipment and requires no additional outlay of capital. The process is now developed to a point where it should be trialled at industrial scale...|$|R
