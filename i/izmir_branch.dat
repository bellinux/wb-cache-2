50|$|Initially, TÖMER served {{within the}} main {{building}} of the Faculty of Letters of Ankara University. In later years, classes and administrative units were established in the Social Sciences Institute and the Morphology Department of the same university. In addition to Turkish, TÖMER started organizing English language courses in 1986, {{to be followed by}} German language courses in 1987. In 1989, French was added to the list of languages taught at TÖMER. Ankara University opened TÖMER branches in the Republic of Northern Cyprus, as well as in Berlin and Frankfurt; however, these branches were short-lived. Istanbul and <b>Izmir</b> <b>branches,</b> among the first opened in Turkey, on the other hand, still serve language learners. When several Central Asian Turkic republics gained independence and a large number of students from these newly independent countries arrived in Turkey to receive university education, TÖMER Tunalı Hilmi Branch in Ankara was established; other TÖMER branches in these years included those in such cities as Edirne, Trabzon, Samsun, Konya, Kayseri, Eskişehir and Antalya. In the same years, several Turkish teachers were sent to these Central Asian Turkic republics to teach Turkish in universities. In time, some of these TÖMER branches - such as those in Eskişehir, Konya and Edirne - were closed down while some new additions - Alanya, Ankara ORAN, Denizli, and the like - were set up.To the February, 2014, there are 11 branches and a central office in TÖMER. Central office and two branches are in Ankara, two more branches are situated in Istanbul. There are also branches in Trabzon, Giresun, Samsun, Marmaris, Izmir, Bursa, Antalya and Alanya.|$|R

50|$|In 1888, Homeland Funds {{was renamed}} Ziraat Bankası (Agriculture Bank), and Ziraat Bankası's head office in Istanbul began to function. The Greco-Turkish War between 1919 and 1922 {{affected}} the bank's policy. The Greek invasion forces opened a Ziraat Bank Management Center in <b>İzmir</b> and occupied <b>branches</b> and funds {{were taken to}} the new Center's management. On the other hand, the Turkish Grand National Assembly charged the Ankara branch of Ziraat Bank with the management of branches and funds. With the Liberation of İzmir by Turkish forces on September 9, 1922, the İzmir organization was re-unified with the Ankara branch; and on October 23, the Istanbul organization too was re-unified with the Ankara branch. After the Turkish War of Independence ended in late 1923, Ziraat Bank became a united entity once again. Since the 1930s Ziraat {{played an important role in}} financing agricultural mechanisation in Turkey, which in the postwar period benefitted from support from the US Marshall Plan.|$|R

40|$|Objective: QOL is {{a multidimensional}} concept set as {{indicator}} {{to assess the}} effect of interventions applied to the Alzheimer patients. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the validity and reliability of the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) scale for the Turkish society. Methods: This research is a methodological study. The sample was composed of 72 individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. Research data were collected in the dementia outpatient clinic of a university hospital and <b>İzmir</b> <b>branch</b> of the Alzheimer's Association. QOL-AD gives information about the QOL of the patient. The scale is composed of 13 items, each of which is assessed over a 4 -point scale (1 point is bad, 4 point is excellent). The minimum score obtained from the scale is 13, maximum score is 52. Results: Translation and back translation were performed to evaluate the language validity of the scale. Besides, it was determined that the expert opinions regarding the content validity were compatible (Kendall's W=. 223, p=. 095). Internal consistency reliability coefficient (cronbach alpha) of QOL-AD scale for the patients was found as 0. 84 while intraclass correlation coefficient was found as 0. 79. However, internal consistency reliability coefficient (cronbach alpha) of caregivers' reports on patients' quality of life (C-PQOL) was 0. 77 while intraclass correlation coefficient was 0. 72. Conclusion: The results indicate reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the QOL-AD in the Turkish society...|$|E
