40|$|A nonintrusive optical {{technique}} for the quantitative measurement of molecular density and velocity at <b>a</b> point or <b>in</b> <b>an</b> entire <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> of <b>a</b> compressible flowfield is reported. Iodine molecules, seeded into the flowfield reservoir, are excited by a tunable narrow-bandwidth laser {{and the resulting}} spatially-resolved fluorescence is collected by a single- or multiple-element detector. A theoretical model for the iodine laser-induced fluorescence process is essential for quantitative measurements and is developed using a rate-equation approach. Density measurements using laser-induced fluorescence are normally complicated by collisional quenching; however, the theory predicts that the off-resonant fluorescent signal is directly proportional to density. Velocity {{is directly related to}} the Doppler shift of the iodine absorption line, determined by monitoring the broadband fluorescent signal as the laser is tuned in frequency. Experiments <b>in</b> <b>a</b> steady supersonic flowfield are compared with numerical calculations to demonstrate the accuracy of the approach for density and velocity measurement and the lack of perturbation to the flowfield by the iodine seeding.

For instance, a load acting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> of a beam is considered to induce not only bending and torsion but also distortion.

40|$|The {{formulation}} of a co-located equal-order Control-Volume-based Finite Element Method (CVFEM) for {{the solution of}} two-fluid models of two-dimensional, planar or axisymmetric, incompressible, gas-solid particle flows is presented in this thesis. The main {{focus is on the}} development of a numerical method that allows computer simulation of gas-solid particle flows over a wide range of solid-phase volume concentration in complex irregular geometries. A general two-fluid mathematical model is presented. This model is essentially borrowed from published works in the area of granular flows. It is established here that this model is applicable to gas-solid flows over a wide range of solid-phase concentration. The governing equations of the fluid phase are obtained by volume averaging the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid. The solid-phase macroscopic equations are derived using an approach that has been successfully used earlier for the description of granular materials, and is based on the kinetic theory of dense gases. This approach accounts for particle/particle collisions, and permits the determination of the solid-phase macroscopic properties such as viscosity and pressure. The proposed CVFEM is formulated by borrowing and extending ideas put forward in earlier CVFEMs for single-phase flows. In axisymmetric problems, the calculation domain is discretized into torus-shaped elements and control volumes: <b>in</b> <b>a</b> longitudinal <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane,</b> or <b>in</b> planar problems, these elements are three-node triangles, and the control volumes are polygons obtained by joining the centroids of the three-node triangles to the midpoints of the sides. In each element, mass-weighted skew upwind functions are used to interpolate the volume concentrations. An iterative variable adjustment algorithm is used to solve the discretized equations. The chosen mathematical model, along with its specializations to single-phase flows and dilute gas-solid flows, and the proposed CVFEM have been applied to several test problems and some demonstration problems. These test and demonstration problems include single-phase flows, dilute-concentration gas-solid particle flows and dense-concentration gas-solid particle flows. The CVFEM results have been compared with results of independent numerical and experimental investigations whenever possible. These comparisons and the results of the demonstration problems are quite encouraging...|$|R
40|$|Global hydroelastic effects due to wetdeck {{slamming}} on a catamaran at Froude numbers between 0. 30 and 0. 33 {{in regular}} head waves are studied theoretically and experimentally. The wetdeck has a horizontal transverse cross-section. The important elastic {{properties of the}} experimental model are theoretically accounted for by using small elastic beam elements connecting three rigid bodies. The hydrodynamic loads on the side hulls {{are based on the}} strip theory by Salvesen et al. (1970) without hull interaction. The forward speed causes end terms at the forward ends of the second and third body counted from forward perpendicular (FP). A modal based method is used to include heave, pitch, two-node and three-node vertical bending modes. The three-body theoretical model without wetdeck slamming agrees well with experimental eigenvalues, relative vertical motions at the bow, vertical shear forces and bending moments at two transverse cuts. Mode shapes agree with Finite Element Method (FEM) results. Five analytically based wetdeck slamming models are presented. The structure is locally rigid and the flow due to slamming is two-dimensional <b>in</b> <b>a</b> longitudinal <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane.</b> It is shown sufficient from a global response point of view, to use a Von Karman type of method and a linear approximation of the relative impact velocity. The effect of high forward speed on the slamming loads is investigated by modifying the dynamic free surface condition and including a Kutta condition at the aft end of the wetted deck. The flow is mathematically equivalent to the 2 D linear unsteady lifting problem of <b>a</b> thin foil <b>in</b> infinite fluid. An important difference is that the wetted length is time dependent. The Kutta condition model may matter. Both the water entry and exit phases during the slamming are important for global response. The theory gives generally good agreement with experimental results for slamming loads and wetdeck slamming induced global vertical shear forces and bending moments at the two transverse cuts. However, there is one slamming case with unsatisfactory agreement. This is believed to be due to the neglection of piston mode resonance of the fluid motion between the two side hulls. Both theory and experiments show a strong influence of two-node bending on global loads. There is also some influence of the three-node bending, but this is not satisfactorily predicted. An error analysis in the experiments is made for the most severe slamming case. Since the experiments were not done as a part of this thesis and each test condition was done only once, random errors can not be identified. Systematic errors are discussed and error estimates of experimentally predicted vertical shear forces and bending moments are made by extensively using the theoretical model. It is shown that the trim angle is the most important error source. The changing incident wave amplitudes along the track of the model and the wave measurement inaccuracies are equally the second most important error source for vertical bending moment at the two transverse cuts investigated in the experiments. The error associated with roll, yaw and sway is the second most important for vertical shear force at the two cuts. The estimated combined relative errors in experimentally predicted vertical shear forces and bending moments are between 0. 17 and 0. 29. Error sources in the theory are also discussed. Since no benchmark theoretical model that properly includes all physical effects exists, we must to some extent rely on experimental results. The discussion covers side hull hydrodynamics and hull interaction, slamming modelling, structural modelling and effect of transient phase. It is shown that hydrodynamic hull interaction may matter. A future perspective is to develop a numerical method that can predict wetdeck slamming induced global response of multihull vessels in any sea state and at any forward speed. This involves long term statistical description of combined load effects due to both transient slamming induced whipping and steady state linear and nonlinear wave loads. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether direct measurement of multiple-jet vena contracta (VC) areas by real-time 3 -dimensional (3 D) transesophageal echocardiography is an accurate method for measuring the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with multiple MR jets. BackgroundBecause of the conflicting requirements of Doppler and imaging physics, measuring VC using 2 -dimensional (2 D) echocardiography is a difficult procedure for assessing MR severity. A real-time 3 D echocardiographic measurement of the VC area has been validated in a single jet of MR, but the applicability of this method for multiple jets is unknown. MethodsTwo-dimensional and 3 D transesophageal echocardiography was performed in 60 patients with multiple functional MR jets. MR severity was assessed quantitatively using the effective regurgitant orifice area derived from 3 D left ventricular volume and thermodilution data (EROAstd). Manual tracings of multiple 3 D VC areas <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> through the VC were obtained, and the sum of the areas was compared using EROAstd. Similarly, 2 D measurement of VC diameter was obtained from a 2 D transesophageal echocardiographic view to optimize the largest legion size in each jet. All VC diameters were summed and compared with EROAstd. ResultsThe correlation of the sum of the multiple 3 D VC areas with EROAstd (r = 0. 90, p < 0. 01) was higher than that of the sum of the multiple 2 D VC diameters (r = 0. 56, p < 0. 01), particularly with MR degrees greater than mild (r = 0. 80, p < 0. 01 vs. r = 0. 05, p = 0. 81) and in cases of 3 or more regurgitant jets (r = 0. 91, p < 0. 01 vs. r = 0. 46, p = 0. 05). ConclusionsDirect measurement of multiple VC areas using 3 D transesophageal echocardiography allows for assessing MR severity in patients with multiple jets, particularly for MR degrees greater than mild and in cases of more than 2 jets, for which geometric assumptions may be challenging...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to numerically simulate a fluid jet injected into a crossflow of the same or another fluid, respectively. Such flows are encountered in many engineering applications in which cooling or mixing plays an important role, e. g. gas turbine combustors. The jet in crossflow (JICF) is used both for cooling and for injecting liquid fuel into the air stream prior to combustion. The numerical simulations regard three space dimensions and track also the flow dynamics by integrating the governing equations in time. The spatial and the temporal resolution are such that the large-scale flow structures are resolved. Such an approach {{is referred to as}} large eddy simulations (LES). The motion of the fuel droplets is treated by Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) with the stochastic parcel method, along with submodels for evaporation, collision, breakup, and a novel submodel for aerodynamic four-way coupling: The particle drag is corrected depending on relative positions of the particles. Mixture fraction and temperature transport equations are solved to enable the modeling of droplet evaporation and the mixing of the gaseous fuel with ambient air. In the simulations of multiphase JICF, several computed results are shown to be inconsistent with the underlying assumptions of the LPT approach: The magnitude of the Weber numbers indicates that droplets are not spherical in large portions of the flow field in wide ranges of parameters which are relevant for gas turbine operation. The magnitude of the droplet spacing suggests that aerodynamic interaction (indirect four-way coupling) among droplets may be important. The LES with aerodynamic four-way coupling reveals significant effects compared to two-way coupling for monodisperse particles in a dense multiphase flow. For single-phase JICF, the impact of nozzle shape on the large-scale coherent structures and the mixing is studied. Effects of circular, square, and elliptic nozzles and their orientation are considered. It is demonstrated that square and elliptic nozzles with blunt orientation raise turbulence levels significantly. The scalar distribution <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> is found to be single-peaked for these nozzles whereas circular and the nozzles with pointed orientation show double-peaked scalar distribution. It is the nozzles with a single-peaked distribution which are the better mixers.

Objectives: Endodontic and implant {{surgery in the}} anterior mandible carries the risk of potential complications. Knowledge of the location and position of the root in the mandible, the morphology of the root and mandible, and proximity to adjacent anatomic structures are important in prevention of complications. The aims {{of this study were}} to 1) determine the prevalence and course of the incisive canal with respect to the anterior root apices and mandible, 2) acquire normative information regarding the location of the anterior roots in relation to the mandible, 3) evaluate the anterior mandibular height and width and 4) determine whether gender or age correlated with any of the measurements. Methods: Cone-beam computed tomography scans of 106 patients were evaluated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> for the presence of the mandibular incisive canal (IC) at the radiographic apex of the six mandibular anterior teeth. When the IC was present, ten anatomic measurements were made. Four measurements were made when the IC could not be identified. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare measurements with pairwise comparisons being made if p≤ 0. 05. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Tukey method. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to compare the change in measurements with gender and age. Results: An IC was identified in 80. 6 % of the images and 98 % of patients had the IC identifiable in least one image. The presence of the incisive canal significantly decreased from the area of the canines to the central incisors. The amount of buccal bone overlying the root decreased as the tooth was located more anteriorly in the arch. The mean buccal bone over the IC increased from the area of the canines to the central incisors. There {{was no significant difference in}} the IC diameter in relation to its location. The distance from the tooth apex to the IC increased with a more anterior tooth location. The mean horizontal distance from the tooth apex to the IC was to the lingual for all tooth types. The mean mandibular width at a level 3 mm coronal to the apex decreased toward the midline, whereas the mean mandibular width at the level of the IC increased toward the midline. The mandibular height and the distance from the alveolar crest to the incisive canal had no significant differences at any point measured. The only significant difference with regard to sex and age was the height of the mandible with the distance being smaller at all locations in females.

40|$|Micro {{heat pipes}} {{have been used}} to cool micro {{electronic}} devices, but their heat transfer coefficients are low compared with those of conventional heat pipes. In this work, a dual-wet pipe is proposed as a model to study heat transfer in micro heat pipes. The dual-wet pipe has a long and narrow cavity of rectangular cross-section. The bottom-half of the horizontal pipe is made of a wetting material, and the top-half of a non-wetting material. A wetting liquid fills {{the bottom half of the}} cavity, while its vapour fills the rest. This configuration ensures that the liquid–vapour interface is pinned at the contact line. As one end of the pipe is heated, the liquid evaporates and increases the vapour pressure. The higher pressure drives the vapour to the cold end where the vapour condenses and releases the latent heat. The condensate moves along the bottom half of the pipe back to the hot end to complete the cycle. We solve the steady-flow problem assuming a small imposed temperature difference between the two ends of the pipe. This leads to skew-symmetric fluid flow and temperature distribution along the pipe so that we only need to focus on the evaporative half of the pipe. Since the pipe is slender, the axial flow gradients are much smaller than the cross-stream gradients. Thus, we can treat the evaporative flow <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> as two-dimensional. This evaporative motion is governed by two dimensionless parameters: an evaporation number E defined as the ratio of the evaporative heat flux at the interface to the conductive heat flux in the liquid, and a Marangoni number M. The motion is solved in the limit E→∞ and M→∞. It is found that evaporation occurs mainly near the contact line in a small region of size E− 1 W, where W is the half-width of the pipe. The non-dimensional evaporation rate Q* ~ E− 1 ln E as determined by matched asymptotic expansions. We use this result to derive analytical solutions for the temperature distribution Tp and vapour and liquid flows along the pipe. The solutions depend on three dimensionless parameters: the heat-pipe number H, which is the ratio of heat transfer by vapour flow to that by conduction in the pipe wall and liquid, the ratio R of viscous resistance of vapour flow to interfacial evaporation resistance, and the aspect ratio S. If HRxs 226 B 1, a thermal boundary layer appears near the pipe end, the width of which scales as (HR) − 1 / 2 L, where L is the half-length of the pipe. A similar boundary layer exists at the cold end. Outside the boundary layers, Tp varies linearly with a gradual slope. Thus, these regions correspond to the evaporative, adiabatic and condensing regions commonly observed in conventional heat pipes. This is the first time that the distinct regions have been captured by a single solution, without prior assumptions of their existence. If HR ~ 1 or less, then Tp is linear almost everywhere. This is the case found in most micro-heat-pipe experiments. Our analysis of the dual-wet pipe provides an explanation for the comparatively low effective thermal conductivity in micro heat pipes, and points to ways of improving their heat transfer capabilities...|$|E

A laser light sheet illuminated <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> normal to the axis of the jet, and two charge-coupled device cameras captured particle images in the same region of interest but from different directions. The stereo-PIV algorithm had been applied to obtain two-dimensional, three-component (2 D- 3 C) velocity distributions on various <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>planes</b> along the axis downstream. All nine components of the velocity gradient tensor were reconstructed from time-dependent 2 D- 3 C velocity data by locally assuming Taylor 2 ̆ 7 s frozen field hypothesis based on the convective velocity evaluated from the mean flow profile. Isosurfaces of the swirling strength lambdai revealed {{that the existence of}} a group of hairpinlike vortex structures was quite evident around the rim of the shear layer of the jet. The center of curvature of the head of the hairpin was typically observed around r/b = 1. 5, and the azimuthal spacing between the legs of the hairpin was roughly 0. 9 b. A similar hairpin structure was estimated by linear stochastic estimation. The typical spacing between the legs of the estimated hairpin was 0. 65 b, which is generally constant over the range of Re = 1500 – 5000...|$|R

40|$|Reconstruction is the {{abstract}} rebuilding {{of something that}} has been torn apart. In the medical imaging context, it is often necessary to acquire data from methods that essentially tear data apart {{in order to be able}} to view what is inside. Also, a big part of reconstruction is then being able to view, or visualise, all the data once it is been put back together again. In MRI, the imaging device acquires data of <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> of the tissue being studied. The process of reconstruction then involves rebuilding of the cross-sectional view of that plane from the acquired data. Usually, the imaging device acquires data from <b>a</b> number of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>planes</b> of the tissue being examined. Then, in reconstruction, all these planes are stacked back together to obtain a complete picture of the tissue. Image reconstruction in MRI is usually performed by dedicated hardware. A typical system usually consists of multiprocessors, application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and uses parallel processing techniques. These systems are capable of high speed image reconstruction, both 2 D and 3 D, high resolution image display and manipulation. Obviously, these systems are fairly expensive. <b>In</b> this project <b>a</b> general purpose PC operating on Microsoft® Windows" 98 operating system was used to reconstruct a 2 D image of a slice through the human head, using head scan data available from a MRI scanner. The FID signals from the scanner were available as projection data, which have been collected by suitably rotating the magnetic gradients. The filtered back-projection algorithm with nearest neighbour interpolation scheme was used in the reconstruction program, which was written in Matlab ®. The resulting image from this system is acceptable.

40|$|Particle-laden {{turbulent}} flow through a straight square duct at Re? = 300 is studied using {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS) and Lagrangian particle tracking. A parallelized 3 -D particle tracking direct numerical simulation code has been developed to perform the large-scale turbulent particle transport computations reported in this thesis. The DNS code is validated after demonstrating good agreement with the published DNS results for the same flow and Reynolds number. Lagrangian particle transport computations are carried out using a large ensemble of passive tracers and finite-inertia particles and the assumption of one-way fluid-particle coupling. Using four different types of initial particle distributions, Lagrangian particle dispersion, concentration and deposition are studied in the turbulent straight square duct. Particles are released <b>in</b> <b>a</b> uniform distribution on <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> at the duct inlet, released as particle pairs in the core region of the duct, distributed randomly in the domain or distributed uniformly in planes at certain heights above the walls.

40|$|Abstract—Colorectal cancer {{can easily}} be {{prevented}} provided that the precursors to tumors, small colonic polyps, are detected and removed. Currently, the only definitive examination of the colon is fiber-optic colonoscopy, which is invasive and expensive. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is potentially a less costly and less invasive alternative to FOC. It would be desirable to have computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms to examine {{the large amount of}} data CTC provides. Most current CAD algorithms have high false positive rates at the required sensitivity levels. We developed and evaluated a postprocessing algorithm to decrease the false positive rate of such a CAD method without sacrificing sensitivity. Our method attempts to model the way a radiologist recognizes a polyp while scrolling <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> through three-dimensional computed tomography data by classification of the changes in the location of the edges in the two-dimensional plane. We performed a tenfold cross-validation study to assess its performance using sensitivity/specificity analysis on data from 48 patients. The mean specificity over all experiments increased from 0. 19 (0. 35) to 0. 47 (0. 56) for a sensitivity of 1. 00 (0. 95).

40|$|Abstract Conventional {{approaches}} to measuring animal vibrational signals on plant stems use a single transducer {{to measure the}} amplitude of vibrations. Such an approach, however, will often underestimate the amplitude of bending waves traveling along the stem. This occurs because vibration transducers are maximally sensitive along a single axis, which may not correspond to the major axis of stem motion. Furthermore, stem motion may be more complex {{than that of a}} bending wave propagating along a single axis, and such motion cannot be described using a single transducer. Here, we describe a method for charac-terizing stem motion in two dimensions by processing the signals from two orthogonally positioned trans-ducers. Viewed relative to <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane,</b> <b>a</b> point on the stem surface moves <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ellipse at any one frequency, with the ellipse’s major axis corre-sponding to the maximum amplitude of vibration. The method outlined here measures the ellipse’s major and minor axes, and its angle of rotation relative to one of the transducers. We illustrate this method with mea-surements of stem motion during insect vibrational communication. It is likely the two-dimensional nature of stem motion is relevant to insect vibration percep-tion, making this method a promising avenue for studies of plant-borne transmission...|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic concept}} {{was a way}} to modify the torus layout so that it {{addressed}} Fermi's concerns though the device's geometry. By twisting one end of the torus compared to the other, forming a figure-8 layout instead of a circle, the drift caused by the magnet windings being too close together {{on one side of the}} device would be counteracted by them being too far apart on the other. The particles would alternately drift one way and then the other. The cancellation was not perfect, but it appeared this would so greatly reduce the net drift rates that the fuel would remain trapped long enough to heat it to the required temperatures. His 1958 description was simple and direct: Magnetic confinement in the stellarator is based on a strong magnetic field produced by solenoidal coils encircling a toroidal tube. The configuration is characterized by a 'rotational transform', such that a single line of magnetic force, followed around the system, intersects <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> points which successively rotate about the magnetic axis. ... A rotational transform may be generated either by <b>a</b> solenoidal field <b>in</b> <b>a</b> twisted, or figure-eight shaped, tube, or by the use of an additional transverse multipolar helical field, with helical symmetry.|$|R
