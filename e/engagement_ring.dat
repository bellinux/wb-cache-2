50|$|The double-ring {{ceremony}} {{describes the}} exchange of wedding rings by and for both spouses. In several European nations such as the Nordic countries, {{it is common to}} exchange plain <b>engagement</b> <b>rings</b> of the same form for both sexes, and typically, an additional, more precious, and bejeweled wedding ring is given to the bride. In the nuptials, the groom's ring becomes a wedding ring also, and can be bestowed anew by the bride {{as a part of the}} wedding ceremony. The engagement is commonly a matter of agreement between the two, and the wedding rings are chosen together. Both <b>engagement</b> and wedding <b>rings</b> are worn on the left hand, the bride having both rings together. Occasionally, the groom receives a separate wedding ring. In Germany and Austria, both parties use <b>engagement</b> <b>rings</b> worn on the left hand. At the nuptials, a wedding ring is placed on the right hand, as in several east European nations, including Bulgaria, Poland, and Russia. This can be a new ring for the bride or both, or reusing the <b>engagement</b> <b>rings.</b> Any <b>engagement</b> <b>rings</b> can then remain on the left hand or be transferred to the right hand. In Germany, in has been customary for both the bride and the groom to wear a wedding ring since at least the 1870s and mentions of couples exchange rings during the wedding ceremony in the Netherlands can be found at least as far back as 1815. In Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Spain both sexes also wear <b>engagement</b> <b>rings,</b> and the groom's ring often becomes a wedding ring in the nuptial exchange ceremony.|$|R
