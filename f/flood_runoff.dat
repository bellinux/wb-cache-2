In the months of August and September, intense cyclonic precipitation also occurs over the catchment for one of two days as the low-pressure area formed in the Bay of Bengal and the cyclone moved in North West direction. On such occasions, intense rainfall is followed by flash <b>flood</b> <b>runoff</b> in the catchment. In view of these meteorological aspects heavy floods have been very common feature in this catchment. For such a flashy type of catchment with varying topography, runoff estimates at dam site are an involved process. The catchment drained at the dam site is of 4302 km2 and is fan shaped. The parameters of slope, soil and vegetation cover, which influence the hydrology of the project, vary widely. The average annual rainfall in the catchment is 840 mm, with 95% of occurring during monsoon period from June to September. The average annual inflow to the Upper Wardha Reservoir is estimated at 783 million cubic metres. The 75% dependable runoff is estimated as 500,720,000 cubic metres.|$|E

This study therefore presents a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport model {{investigation into the}} sediment transport behaviour following severe flooding which occurred in the Brisbane River catchment. It {{was found that the}} flood-driven sediment plume formed in the adjacent Moreton Bay and then spread into {{the northern part of the}} bay. Based on analysis of the variations in horizontal sediment flux, four distinct characteristics of sediment transport were identified, corresponding to the combined effects of <b>flooding</b> <b>runoff</b> and tidal currents. Firstly, within the estuary, sediment was driven by the flood discharge and primarily transported in the seaward direction. Secondly, at the river mouth, the transport pattern of the sediment was similar that of the first region, however, the horizontal flux was significantly smaller by 50 %. Thirdly, a short distance from the river mouth, variations occurred not only in magnitude but also in transport pattern. Lastly, within the coastal bay, the sediment transport was mainly driven by tides, resulting in the changing direction of sediment movement. It was estimated that approximately 1. 01 × 106 tonnes was discharged from the Brisbane River estuary into the bay during the flood event in January 2011. This study exhibited the characteristics of sediment transport within a tidal dominant estuary following a severe flood event. The results would be used to assist the implementation of coastal management strategies. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R

To quantify the hydrologic sensitivity, this study simulated long-term rainfall–runoff and inundation for the entire river basin (160 000 km 2). The simulation suggested that the flood inundation volume was 1. 6 times more in 2011 than for the past flood events.
