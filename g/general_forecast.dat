To get realistic results, the techno-economic study has been applied on a municipality network in the city of Ghent, located in Belgium.

40|$|Domestic mineral {{consumption}} {{is defined as}} a net sum of apparent consumption plus embodied mineral contained in net imported goods. The U. S. is a net importer of copper-containing products, such as automobiles, electrical products, and construction and industrial machinery. Embodied copper which is contained in net imports of these products constitute part of domestic copper consumption. On the other hand, the U. S. is a net exporter of sulfur-using/embodying products, such as fertilizers and grains. The sulfur which is contained/employed in manufacturing exported products is not actually part of domestic sulfur consumption. Net embodied U. S. imports (exports) of copper (sulfur) are estimated. For copper, it is shown that domestic U.

30|$|A {{limitation}} of the model {{is the absence of}} covariates to estimate the age-specific SR changes over time. Sex differences in mortality are determined by the differential risk factors between females and males associated with health-related behaviors (Kingston et al. 2014, 2015; Van Oyen et al. 2013; Oksuzyan et al. 2008; Trovato and Lalu 2007; Gjonça et al. 2005; Meslé 2004 a; Kalben 2000). For example, a reasonable statement would be that forecasting sex differences in mortality should be based on disparities in tobacco and alcohol consumption between females and males (Janssen et al. 2013). These patterns are, however, often harder to forecast than the aggregated measures; their relationship with mortality is often miscalculated and assumptions about future behaviors are often required (Raftery et al. 2014; Booth and Tickle 2008). Until reasonable strategies to overcome these limitations are found, forecasting aggregated measures tends to provide more reliable forecasts (Alho 1991; Wilmoth 1995). Also, the model cannot capture selection effects acting on specific cohorts and how they affect time trends in mortality and sex ratios. However, such effects will tend to be population-specific and not within the scope of the presented SR model, which aims to introduce a <b>general</b> <b>forecast</b> approach based on sex differences in mortality for low mortality countries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{two independent}} firms {{that invest in}} resources such as capacity or inventory based on imperfect market forecasts. As time progresses and new information becomes available, the firms update their forecasts and {{have the option to}} trade their resources. The trade contract is determined as the bargaining equilibrium or, alternatively, as the price equilibrium. Assuming a fairly general form of the profit functions, we characterize the Nash equilibrium investment levels, which are first-best under the price equilibrium trade contract, but not under the bargaining equilibrium trade contract. To gain additional insights, we then focus on firms that face stochastic demand functions with constant price elasticity and have contingent pricing power. Assuming a <b>general</b> <b>forecast</b> evolution process, we characterize the impact of the option to trade and the firms' cooperation on equilibrium investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus. Finally, to study the main driving forces of trading, we employ a well-established and empirically tested forecast updating model in which the forecast evolution process follows a two-dimensional geometric Brownian motion. Under this model, we prove that the equilibrium investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus are nondecreasing in the quality and timing of forecast revisions, in market variability, and in foreign exchange volatility, but are nonincreasing in market correlation. forecast updating, pricing, risk pooling, subcontracting, transshipment...|$|E
40|$|In our paper {{published}} earlier {{we discussed}} forecasts of earthquake focal mechanism {{and ways to}} test the forecast efficiency. Several verification methods were proposed, but they were based on ad hoc, empirical assumptions, thus their performance is questionable. We apply a conventional likelihood method to measure the skill of earthquake focal mechanism orientation forecasts. The advantage of such an approach is that earthquake rate prediction can be adequately combined with focal mechanism forecast, if both {{are based on the}} likelihood scores, resulting in a <b>general</b> <b>forecast</b> optimization. We measure the difference between two double-couple sources as the minimum rotation angle that transforms one into the other. We measure the uncertainty of a focal mechanism forecast (the variability), and the difference between observed and forecasted orientations (the prediction error), in terms of theseminimum rotation angles. To calculate the likelihood score we need to compare actual forecasts or occurrences of predicted events with the null hypothesis that the mechanism’s 3 -D orientation is random (or equally probable). For 3 -D rotation the random rotation angle distribution is not uniform. To better understand the resulting complexities, we calculate the information (likelihood) score for two theoretical rotational distributions (Cauchy and von Mises-Fisher), which are used to approximate earthquake source orientation pattern. We then calculate the likelihood score for earthquake source forecasts and for their validation by future seismicity data. Several issues need to be exploredwhen analyzing observational results: their dependence on forecast and data resolution, internal dependence of scores on forecasted angle and random variability of likelihood scores. Here, we propose a simple tentative solution but extensive theoretical and statistical analysis is needed...|$|E
40|$|Piñon and juniper {{tree species}} have species-specific climatic requirements, {{resulting}} in unique distributions and differential responses to climate change. Piñons and junipers co-dominate the arid woodlands of North America as groups with widespread hybridization. Two piñons, Pinus edulis; P. monophylla, and four junipers, Juniperus deppeana var. deppeana; J. monosperma; J. occidentalis; J. osteosperma, are endemic to the midlatitude interior west and form {{three groups of}} hybridizing sister species, P. edulis-P. monophylla; J. deppeana var. deppeana-J. monosperma; J. occidentalis-J. osteosperma. Recent droughts have caused widespread mortality among piñons, but have had less impact on junipers and indicate shifts in co-occurrence have already begun in response to global climate change. Within these groups hybridization likely {{plays an important role}} in such distribution changes. The central objective of this thesis is to forecast the distributions of piñons and junipers endemic to the US under modeled climate change for the 21 st century. Species distribution models are built with an emphasis placed on aligning the life cycle dynamics of the species within the temporal and spatial resolution of predictor variables, and within the modeling technique. Two concerns surrounding species distribution modeling are addressed. First, concerns regarding the extent to which species are at equilibrium with the current climate are addressed by incorporating dispersal into the model building process. Second, concerns regarding the potential role of hybridization between closely related species are addressed by building distribution models for each of the three sister species groups as well as the six component species. Species distribution models exhibited individualistic responses to modeled climate change. Modeled areal loss was greater than gain for all species, which is reflected in changes of co-occurrence. Piñon-juniper richness is forecast to increase in the northern Colorado Plateau, eastern Great Basin, and Rocky Mountains. The sister-species models forecast greater areal gain, and less areal loss, along hybridization zones for P. edulis-P. monophylla and for J. occidentalis-J. osteosperma, but forecast greater areal loss along the periphery of the component species distributions. The sister-species model for J. deppeana var. deppeana-J. monosperma forecasts overall greater areal loss than the component species.
