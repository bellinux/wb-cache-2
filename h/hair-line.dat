25|$|A small tablet, not fluted, of Pacific {{rosewood}} (Orliac 2005), 22 × 6.8 × 1.8cm. One end is chipped off, but no glyphs are missing. However, {{there appears}} to have been reworking, with the glyphs of line r5 planed off and the adjacent line v1 cut into the planed edge. Fischer also notes underlying <b>hair-line</b> glyphs which suggest to him that K may be a palimpsest. The later, deeper cuts may have been made with a steel blade. These glyphs are rather crude, of about the quality of side b of Echancrée.|$|E

Later PCB Chairman requested Khan to take back his resignation and Khan did it under his conditions. However, after captaining the team for a three-match series against New Zealand Younis took a break for Test matches in New Zealand and the series in Australia the captaincy was given to Mohammad Yousuf and since then Younis has not captained the national team.|$|E
50|$|Colour: chestnut-brown, with dark-brown spiral <b>hair-lines</b> {{of varying}} width; dotted with tiny white spots, which, below the suture, are {{aggregated}} into small pyramidal blotches with their apex upward, {{six in the}} body whorl. A white band, scalloped on both edges of these aggregated dots, encircles the periphery. An articulated white-and-brown spiral ornaments the lira bordering the umbilicus, a second lies just outside this, and another with more distant double white spots beyond. The rest of the base, which is of a lighter tint than the dorsum, has scattered tiny white dots. The umbilicus is white. Over all is a transparent glaze, with a bronze reflex.|$|R
50|$|Theodore Low De Vinne, {{publisher}} of the Century Magazine, wanted a more legible font for his magazine. He commissioned his friend Linn Boyd Benton from the newly formed American Type Founders to devise such a face. Over {{the course of the}} nineteenth century, largely because of the influence of Bodoni, common printing fonts had become thin, making a weak impression on the page. De Vinne and aesthete William Morris decried this “growing effeminacy” and called for a reversion to blacker faces. The face L.B. Benton produced, Century Roman, had a larger x-height than most faces and thicker <b>hair-lines</b> than was common, yet the proportions of a condensed face because De Vinne believed this to be more legible. This was made only in foundry type and later an accompanying face of normal width was produced by L.B. Benton, called variously Century Broad Face or Century No. 2. Despite being the original member of the Century family, it is not popular compared to the later members of the family with more normal proportions.|$|R
6000|$|From General Warren we have {{a letter}} dated January 14, 1775, {{only a few months}} before he attested the sincerity of his patriotism, in his own blood, on Bunker Hill. His {{handwriting}} has many ungraceful flourishes. All the small d's spout upward in parabolic curves, and descend at a considerable distance. His pen seems to have had nothing but <b>hair-lines</b> in it; and the whole letter, though perfectly legible, has a look of thin and unpleasant irregularity. The subject is a plan for securing to the colonial party the services of Colonel Gridley the engineer, by an appeal to his private interests. Though writing to General Palmer, an intimate friend, Warren signs himself, most ceremoniously, [...] "Your obedient servant." [...] Indeed, these stately formulas in winding up a letter were scarcely laid aside, whatever might be the familiarity of intercourse: husband and wife were occasionally, on paper at least, the [...] "obedient servants" [...] of one another; and not improbably, among well-bred people, there was a corresponding ceremonial of bows and courtesies, even in the deepest interior of domestic life. With all the reality that filled men's hearts, and which has stamped its impress on so many of these letters, it was a far more formal age than the present.|$|R
25|$|By late March sports {{writers were}} already penciling in Landrith as the {{definite}} opening day starter behind home plate for San Francisco, but on April 3 Landrith had a freak accident {{with his hand}} in an exhibition game against the Cubs, suffering a <b>hair-line</b> fracture {{on the back of}} his index finger. He hit the bat or helmet of Cubs hitter Lou Johnson when Lou got out in front of the plate after a swinging strike out in the 4th inning. Landrith attempted to throw the ball to second base as Johnson swung his bat, causing the injury. Frank Bowman, trainer for the Giants, expected him to miss 10 days and opening day. He returned to batting practice on April 19 and pinch hit for the Giants on April 22 against the Cubs, but did not return to full action until almost a full month later on May 2.|$|E
500|$|According to oral tradition, scribes used {{obsidian}} flakes {{or small}} shark teeth, presumably the hafted tools still used to carve wood in Polynesia, to flute and polish the tablets {{and then to}} incise the glyphs. The glyphs are most commonly composed of deep smooth cuts, though superficial <b>hair-line</b> cuts are also found. In the closeup image at right, a glyph is composed of two parts connected by [...] a <b>hair-line</b> cut; this is a typical convention for this shape. Several researchers, including Barthel, believe that these superficial cuts were made by obsidian, and that the texts were carved in a two-stage process, first sketched with obsidian and then deepened and finished with a worn shark tooth. The remaining <b>hair-line</b> cuts were then either errors, design conventions (as at right), or decorative embellishments. Vertical strings of chevrons or lozenges, for example, are typically connected with <b>hair-line</b> cuts, {{as can be seen}} repeatedly in the closeup of one end of tablet B below. However, Barthel was told that the last literate Rapanui king, Nga‘ara, sketched out the glyphs in soot applied with a fish bone and then engraved them with a shark tooth.|$|E
2500|$|The monumental {{sculpture}} of ancient Egypt is world-famous, but refined and delicate small works exist in much greater numbers. The Egyptians used the distinctive technique of sunk relief, which {{is well suited}} to very bright sunlight. The main figures in reliefs adhere to the same figure convention as in painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown from the side, but the torso from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 [...] "fists" [...] to go from the ground to the <b>hair-line</b> on the forehead. This appears {{as early as the}} Narmer Palette from Dynasty I. However, there as elsewhere the convention is not used for minor figures shown engaged in some activity, such as the captives and corpses. [...] Other conventions make statues of males darker than females ones. Very conventionalized portrait statues appear from as early as Dynasty II, before 2,780 BCE, and {{with the exception of the}} art of the Amarna period of Ahkenaten, and some other periods such as Dynasty XII, the idealized features of rulers, like other Egyptian artistic conventions, changed little until after the Greek conquest.|$|E

60|$|The man flung a {{look back}} {{along the way he}} had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow. It was all pure white, rolling in gentle {{undulations}} where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed. North and south, as far as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark <b>hair-line</b> that curved and twisted from around the spruce-covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island. This dark <b>hair-line</b> was the trail—the main trail—that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.|$|E
60|$|His first {{adornment}} was the sleeveless dimity B.V.D. undershirt, {{in which}} he resembled a small boy humorlessly wearing a cheesecloth tabard at a civic pageant. He never put on B.V.D.'s without thanking the God of Progress that he didn't wear tight, long, old-fashioned undergarments, like his father-in-law and partner, Henry Thompson. His second embellishment was combing and slicking back his hair. It gave him a tremendous forehead, arching up two inches beyond the former <b>hair-line.</b> But most wonder-working {{of all was the}} donning of his spectacles.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, the one {{accident}} hinged upon the other. It was the failure of his left hand, with its useless fingers, to do its duty, that brought the ax down upon his foot. The pain {{was not so much}} physical as mental. To think that he, who could hew to a <b>hair-line,</b> right and left hand, should cut his own foot like a ten-year-old boy--that scared him. It brought age and decay close to him. For {{the first time in his}} life he felt that he was fighting a losing battle.|$|E
6000|$|Next, {{we come to}} the {{fragment}} of a letter by Samuel Adams; an autograph more utterly devoid of ornament or flourish than any other in the collection. It would not have been characteristic, had his pen traced so much as a <b>hair-line</b> in tribute to grace, beauty, or the elaborateness of manner; for this earnest-hearted man had been produced out of the past elements of his native land, a real Puritan, with the religion of his forefathers, and likewise with their principles of government, taking the aspect of Revolutionary politics. At heart, Samuel Adams was never so much a citizen of the United States, as he was a New-Englander, and a son of the old Bay Province. The following passage has much of the man in it: [...] "I heartily congratulate you," [...] he writes from Philadelphia, after the British have left Boston, [...] "upon the sudden and important change in our affairs, in the removal of the barbarians from the capital. We owe our grateful acknowledgments to Him who is, as he is frequently styled in Sacred Writ, 'The Lord of Hosts.' We have not yet been informed with certainty what course the enemy have steered. I hope we shall be on our guard against future attempts. Will not care be taken to fortify the harbor, and thereby prevent the entrance of ships-of-war hereafter?" ...|$|E
60|$|When {{he opened}} his eyes again he was in his corner, and he heard the yelling of the {{audience}} like the roar of the surf at Bondi Beach. A wet sponge was being pressed against the base of his brain, and Sid Sullivan was blowing cold water in a refreshing spray over his face and chest. His gloves had already been removed, and Sandel, bending over him, was shaking his hand. He bore no ill-will toward the man who had put him out and he returned the grip with a heartiness that made his battered knuckles protest. Then Sandel stepped to the centre of the ring and the audience hushed its pandemonium to hear him accept young Pronto's challenge and offer to increase the side bet to one hundred pounds. King looked on apathetically while his seconds mopped the streaming water from him, dried his face, and prepared him to leave the ring. He felt hungry. It was not the ordinary, gnawing kind, but a great faintness, a palpitation at the pit of the stomach that communicated itself to all his body. He remembered back into the fight to the moment when he had Sandel swaying and tottering on the <b>hair-line</b> balance of defeat. Ah, that piece of steak would have done it! He had lacked just that for the decisive blow, and he had lost. It was all because of the piece of steak.|$|E
60|$|While going one day {{on shore}} near Wollaston Island, we pulled {{alongside}} a canoe with six Fuegians. These {{were the most}} abject and miserable creatures I anywhere beheld. On the east coast the natives, as we have seen, have guanaco cloaks, and on the west they possess seal-skins. Amongst these central tribes the men generally have an otter-skin, or some small scrap about {{as large as a}} pocket-handkerchief, which is barely sufficient to cover their backs as low down as their loins. It is laced across the breast by strings, and according as the wind blows, it is shifted from side to side. But these Fuegians in the canoe were quite naked, and even one full-grown woman was absolutely so. It was raining heavily, and the fresh water, together with the spray, trickled down her body. In another harbour not far distant, a woman, who was suckling a recently-born child, came one day alongside the vessel, and remained there out of mere curiosity, whilst the sleet fell and thawed on her naked bosom, and on the skin of her naked baby! These poor wretches were stunted in their growth, their hideous faces bedaubed with white paint, their skins filthy and greasy, their hair entangled, their voices discordant, and their gestures violent. Viewing such men, one can hardly make oneself believe that they are fellow-creatures, and inhabitants of the same world. It is a common subject of conjecture what pleasure in life some of the lower animals can enjoy: how much more reasonably the same question may be asked with respect to these barbarians! At night five or six human beings, naked and scarcely protected from the wind and rain of this tempestuous climate, sleep on the wet ground coiled up like animals. Whenever it is low water, winter or summer, night or day, they must rise to pick shellfish from the rocks; and the women either dive to collect sea-eggs, or sit patiently in their canoes, and with a baited <b>hair-line</b> without any hook, jerk out little fish. If a seal is killed, or the floating carcass of a putrid whale is discovered, it is a feast; and such miserable food is assisted by a few tasteless berries and fungi.|$|E

50|$|Valves {{should be}} {{inspected}} for damage which will prevent proper operation and {{could lead to}} catastrophic failure. Cracking, pitting, channeling, and burning are typical problems leading to valve replacement. Even <b>hair-line</b> cracks make a valve unusable. Pitting is permissible in small amounts, but should not be present on the face, margin, or stem. Channeling {{is a result of}} uneven heating of a valve (typically from improper seating during operation), and is evident by heat discoloration in an oval shape {{on the bottom of the}} valve and often visible at the base of the valve stem. Channeling that continues will lead to a burnt valve, which leads to melting away of a portion of the valve. If an engine is subjected to excessive RPM or sudden stoppage, all valves should be inspected for straightness. If a valve is bent, it will lead to failure very quickly and often damage other parts such as pistons, cylinder walls, other valves, valve guides, and valve-train components.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{differences}} between the two Supermen were established to clarify the distinction. The Earth-One names [...] "Kal-El", [...] "Jor-El" [...] and [...] "Jonathan and Martha Kent" [...] became [...] "Kal-L", [...] "Jor-L" [...] and [...] "John and Mary Kent" [...] on Earth-Two, as in the original Golden Age stories. Kal-L's costume was largely adapted from the 1940s drawing style, retaining the famous sweatshirt wrist cuffs, while his S-shield symbol was originally very different from the main Superman S symbol, adapting the 1940s six-sided version with the tail endings and hard left tilt of the S edges. George Pérez famously redesigned Kal-L's 1940's S shield (starting in JLA (Vol 1) #197) to be mostly the main S symbol with five sides and to merely reflect the tilt connecting the upper edge to the side of shield. Some artists such as Alex Ross and others including Justice Society series artist Dale Eaglesham continued to use the specific 6 sided 1940's S shield after Perez' change for Kal-L. Stories featuring both Supermen also indicated that Kal-L was the older of the two, being depicted as late-middle-aged, with grey or solid white hair at the base <b>hair-line</b> and face wrinkles, while his Earth-One counterpart was a youthful man of modern times.|$|E
