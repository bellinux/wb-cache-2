5|$|By {{the end of}} the season, the Browns had {{a perfect}} 14–0 record and led the league's Western Division, setting up a {{championship}}-game matchup with the Bills, who had won a playoff to take the Eastern Division. Cleveland beat Buffalo 49–7 <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> win the championship and preserve its unbeaten record. After the season, Graham, Motley and Speedie were included in many news organizations' All-Pro teams, alongside several other teammates. Graham was named the co-Most Valuable Player of the league alongside Albert. Browns games were televised {{for the first time in}} 1948.|$|E

5|$|After scoring two {{consecutive}} ducks in the Test series against Sri Lanka, Pathan was elevated to {{opening in the}} second innings of the Second Test in Delhi, after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness. Having taken 3/34 from 22 overs in the first innings, Pathan scored 93 runs, building on a first innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436. In the following match in Ahmedabad, he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall {{during the first half}} of the opening day. He also took seven wickets at an average of 26.00 runs in the series, which India won 2–0. Pathan later admitted that he had been disappointed in failing to score a Test century. Following his strong performances in 2005, Pathan was promoted <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> an A-grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.|$|E
5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from Medicaid for abortions. To accept the appointment, she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined that the poor should have equal access to abortion {{as long as it}} was legal.|$|E
5|$|During the Normandy {{landings}} of 6 June 1944, {{the brigade}} {{took part in}} Operation Mallard, holding the southern flank of the Normandy bridgehead over the River Orne. In August 1944, during {{the final stages of}} the Battle of Normandy, {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Airborne Division, the brigade took part in the advance to the River Seine. Withdrawn to England in September, the brigade, with the rest of the division, returned to mainland Europe <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> counter the German Army's surprise offensive in the Ardennes, better known as the Battle of the Bulge. Their final airborne mission of the war was Operation Varsity in March 1945, an airborne assault crossing of the Rhine, after which they advanced through Germany, reaching the Baltic Sea at Wismar by the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|Figard {{spent the}} summer of 1995 working {{at a hotel in}} Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the {{opportunity}} to improve her English. She returned to the UK <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc. After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the Channel the following day, arriving in Ashford, Kent. She intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train; her escort found another French lorry driver, Roger Bouvier, who was willing to take her to Chieveley Services near Newbury, Berkshire. When they arrived, Figard tried to phone Jean-Marc to ask him to pick her up, but misdialed. She was offered a lift to Salisbury by the driver of a white Mercedes lorry. Bouvier had reservations about the driver, but let her go with him nonetheless. Figard left the service station with the driver at around 4:30 pm. She never arrived at her destination, and was reported missing.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Botha {{suffered}} a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, {{he stepped down}} {{as leader of the}} National Party, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk. In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, {{for the first time in}} 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In October 1966, strike force F-105 Thunderchiefs were {{equipped}} with QRC-160 radar jamming pods whose effectiveness virtually ended their losses to surface-to-air missiles. As a result, SAM attacks {{shifted to the}} Phantoms, unprotected because of a shortage of pods. To protect the F-4s, rules of engagement that allowed the MiGCAP to escort the strike force {{in and out of}} the target area were revised <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> restrict MiGCAP penetration to the edge of SAM coverage. MiG interceptions increased as a result, primarily by MiG-21s using high-speed hit-and-run tactics against bomb-laden F-105 formations, and although only two bombers had been lost, the threat to the force was perceived as serious.|$|E

5|$|It {{was also}} in September 1941 that the Squadron {{received}} the proto-type Lancaster bomber, the first squadron of the RAF to receive the new aircraft. On {{a visit to the}} Squadron in December, Guest and Meredith were taken on a flight in the new plane. Although the order was given <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> cease operations in the Hampdens, it was not until 3 March 1942 that the Lancaster was put on active service on its first battle mission for the entire RAF. The Squadron, with its Lancasters, was given key targets to bomb: on 17 April 1942, six Lancasters from 44 Squadron alongside six from 97 Squadron, bombed the MAN diesel engine factory, which produced {{more than half of the}} German U-boats, as well as engines for ships, tanks and transport vehicles. The success – at a cost of five planes and crew to 44 Squadron – earned the thanks of the Prime Minister himself. The Squadron was further involved in the obliteration of Rostock on 8 May and took part in the 1,000-aircraft attack on Cologne on 30 May.|$|E
5|$|The May-Johnson bill soon {{ran into}} difficulties. Although the Interim Committee was {{discharged}} in November, it met {{one more time}} <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> discuss amendments to the May-Johnson bill. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative Senate bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control of atomic energy. In 1946, several major revisions were made to the McMahon bill in order to appease the more conservative elements in the Senate. The resulting bill passed both the Senate and the House without major modifications. On August 1, 1946, Truman signed the McMahon bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Lupit first {{affected}} Pohnpei with tropical storm-force winds, {{and later}} it {{damaged or destroyed}} about 200homes in Chuuk State. There, high waves flooded roads and homes, while high winds damaged crops. Damage was heaviest in Yap State, mostly in the small Ulithi atoll and Fais Island. On both islands, the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked crops. Rainfall reached 263mm (10.35in) on Ulithi, and gusts reached 158km/h (98mph). Throughout the FSM, damage totaled about $1.7million, although there were no deaths. The damage prompted the FSM government to declare two states as disaster areas, {{as well as a}} disaster declaration from the United States federal government. While Lupit was becoming extratropical, it became the first typhoon <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> threaten Japan in 13years. There, the storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight cancellations.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, the Jets {{won their}} first two games. NFL players then staged a strike; a team {{composed}} mostly of replacement players lost two of the next three games. The locker room was divided after the strike due to the decision of a few players, led by Gastineau, to cross the picket line. The Jets remained in contention in a mediocre AFC East {{through much of the}} season, but dropped all four games <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> finish 6–9, in last place. In 1988, the Sack Exchange era ended as Joe Klecko failed his offseason physical and was waived, linebacker Lance Mehl announced his retirement during training camp, and Mark Gastineau retired midseason, citing personal reasons. In spite of these departures, the Jets finished with an 8–7–1 record. They secured a winning record by ending the season with a victory over the Giants, which cost their in-state rivals a playoff berth. The team performed badly in 1989, finishing 4–12. On December 18, 1989, the Jets hired executive Dick Steinberg from the New England Patriots to take over as general manager. Three days after New York's final game of the season, a 37–0 loss to the Bills at Giants Stadium, Steinberg fired Walton and began to search for the team's 10th coach. The disastrous 1989 campaign cost Walton the chance to be the first Jets coach to complete his career with a winning record, a statistic he later admitted he cared about deeply.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Spain from September 1964 until April 1965, with a break in filming from late December until late February. Welles's {{limitations}} on the film included a budget of $800,000 and actors Jeanne Moreau and John Gielgud being available for five and ten days respectively, while Margaret Rutherford was only available for four weeks. Welles later joked that during one scene which included seven principal characters, none of the actors were available and stand-ins were used for over-the-shoulder shots of all seven characters. Filming began in Colmenar and included all of John Gielgud's scenes. Welles then traveled to Cardona, where the Royal Court scenes and Marina Vlady's scenes were shot, and to Madrid's Casa de Campo Park, where the Gadshill robbery scene was filmed. Madrid was also {{the location of the}} Boar's Head Tavern set, where Welles shot Moreau's and Rutherford's scenes. The production then traveled to Pedraza for some outdoor street scenes, and then to Soria to shoot in the snow for the opening shots. After shooting some scenes with Justice Shallow and Justice Silence in the Basque country, Welles returned to Madrid <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>to</b> film the battle scenes in Casa de Campo Park for ten days.|$|E
