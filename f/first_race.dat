With that <b>first</b> <b>race,</b> the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s on a revised course that largely resembles today's marathon route. Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions, world records were continually sought, and the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, Sega's Turbo was the <b>first</b> <b>racing</b> game {{to feature}} a third-person perspective, rear view format. It {{was also the}} <b>first</b> <b>racing</b> game to use sprite scaling with full-colour graphics. Pole Position by Namco {{is one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>racing</b> games to use the {{trailing}} camera effect that is now so familiar. In this particular example, the effect was produced by linescroll—the practice of scrolling each lineindependently in order to warp an image. In this case, the warping would simulate curves and steering. To make the roadappear to move towards the player, per-line color changes were used, though many console versions opted for paletteanimation instead.|$|R
