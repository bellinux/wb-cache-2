Although the level of PD heating is generally low for DC and power line frequencies, it can accelerate failures within high voltage <b>high-frequency</b> <b>equipment.</b> The integrity of insulation in high voltage equipment can be confirmed by monitoring the PD activities that occur through the equipment's life. To ensure supply reliability and long-term operational sustainability, PD in high-voltage electrical equipment should be monitored closely with early warning signals for inspection and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} of the pre-World War II five-year plans (1929-1940), there was a rapid {{development}} of the Soviet communication system and industry. <b>High-frequency</b> <b>equipment</b> was introduced for long-distance communication. Use of such equipment allowed to transmit three, four, or 12 telephone calls over a pair of wires or 16 telegrams over a single telephone channel. In 1939, construction of a high-frequency three-channel line between Moscow and Khabarovsk (8,600 km) provided dependable communication between the USSR central regions and the Far East. By late 1940, the Moscow Central Telegraph Office had 22 facsimile lines. In 1941, a 12-channel line between Moscow and Leningrad was put into operation that meant the concurrent transmission of 12 telephone calls over a single pair of wires.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound imaging of the skin is {{becoming}} more and more popular. Skin ultrasound examinations are used both in order to assess healthy skin and to evaluate pathological lesions. They are mainly performed in dermatology as well as in broadly understood aesthetic medicine and cosmetology. At present, skin imaging is enabled by <b>high-frequency</b> <b>equipment</b> and high-quality conventional devices. The introduction of high-frequency electronic transducers which are supported by conventional scanners may be a turning point in skin ultrasound equipment. Irrespective of the ultrasound scanner, three layers may be distinguished in the image of the healthy skin: epidermal echo, dermis and subcutaneous tissue. <b>High-frequency</b> <b>equipment</b> allows for detailed imaging of the epidermal echo, dermis and upper part of the subcutaneous tissue. It is also possible to visualize the skin appendages (hair with follicles and nails) as well as slight vessels that run in the dermis and upper subcutaneous tissue. Contrary to <b>high-frequency</b> <b>equipment,</b> conventional scanners do not allow for a detailed assessment of the epidermal and dermal echoes. Instead, they enable the visualization of the entire subcutaneous tissue. The following parameters are used for the assessment of skin ultrasound images: thickness of individual skin layers, caliber of blood vessels, echogenicity of the dermis or its individual layers, echogenicity of the subcutaneous tissue as well as the presence or absence of flow in slight venous vessels. Currently, the studies on the usage of sonoelastography for skin assessment are in progress. Considering the dynamic development of skin imaging equipment and its diagnostic possibilities, one might suspect that high-frequency examinations will become more common and will be fundamental for the evaluation of both healthy and pathologically altered skin. This paper is an introduction to a series of articles on the clinical application of high-frequency ultrasound. The next articles will be published in the subsequent issues...|$|E

The AFC system digitally counts the frequency of all frequency-determining oscillators in the controlled equipment, computes and displays the operating frequency to the nearest Hertz. When the AFC is engaged, any deviation of the computed operating frequency from the desired frequency causes an error correction voltage to be generated. Use of this system requires that the controlled equipment be modified for voltage trimming of the tuning oscillator. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of high austenite stiffness of {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) on the response of base-isolated benchmark building has been investigated. Dynamic analysis was performed by solving the governing equations of motion using Newmark-beta method under three near-fault earthquake motions. The super-elastic behavior of SMA was modeled by the Grasser-Cozzarelli model. Structural response parameters such as top-floor acceleration, base displacement, and base shear were chosen for investigation. Three near-fault earthquakes with bidirectional ground motions were considered. It was observed that because of high austenite stiffness of SMA, higher accelerations associated with high frequencies are transmitted to the superstructure. The isolation device with high austenite stiffness of SMA excites the higher modes of the base-isolated structure and thus magnifies the floor accelerations. This phenomenon can be detrimental to the <b>high-frequency</b> internal <b>equipments</b> mounted in the base-isolated structure. On the other hand, the high austenite stiffness of SMA {{does not affect the}} base displacement and base shear of the base-isolated structure significantly. Furthermore, the {{influence of}} high austenite stiffness of SMA is dependent on the transformation strength of SMA and flexibility of the isolator. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|LDRD Project 105876 was a {{research}} project whose primary goal was to discover the currently unknown science underlying the basic linear and nonlinear electrodynamic response of nanotubes and nanowires {{in a manner that}} will support future efforts aimed at converting forefront nanoscience into innovative new high-frequency nanodevices. The project involved experimental and theoretical efforts to discover and understand high frequency (MHz through tens of GHz) electrodynamic response properties of nanomaterials, emphasizing nanowires of silicon, zinc oxide, and carbon nanotubes. While there is much research on DC electrical properties of nanowires, electrodynamic characteristics still represent a major new frontier in nanotechnology. We generated world-leading insight into how the low dimensionality of these nanomaterials yields sometimes desirable and sometimes problematic high-frequency properties that are outside standard model electron dynamics. In the cases of silicon nanowires and carbon nanotubes, evidence of strong disorder or glass-like charge dynamics was measured, indicating that these materials still suffer from serious inhomogeneities that limit there high frequency performance. Zinc oxide nanowires were found to obey conventional Drude dynamics. In all cases, a significant practical problem involving large impedance mismatch between the high intrinsic impedance of all nanowires and nanotubes and <b>high-frequency</b> test <b>equipment</b> had to be overcome...|$|R
40|$|Background: Accurate {{diagnosis}} {{and management of}} hearing loss (HL) is based on valid and accurate ear-specific and frequency-specific information. This is especially relevant as non-optimal hearing amplification as part of early hearing detection and intervention programmes may result in further delays in the speech and language development of children with HL. Audiological measures utilised may {{vary according to the}} age, cognitive ability and physical ability of the infant or child. It is therefore important to compare and critically evaluate current clinical practice in order to recommend guidelines for paediatric audiology in South Africa. Objectives: To determine the availability of audiological equipment and clinical protocols used by audiologists in Gauteng for paediatric audiological assessment and hearing aid (HA) fitting. Method: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey research design was utilised to describe the availability of clinical audiological equipment and protocols used by audiologists in Gauteng, South Africa for paediatric assessment and HA fitting. Eighteen audiology departments, eleven public hospitals and seven private practices were included in the study. Results: Results revealed the limited availability of departmental protocols within departments for paediatric assessment and HA fitting. Although there appeared to be a wide variety of equipment available to audiologists in public sector hospitals and private practice, a lack of <b>high-frequency</b> tympanometers and <b>equipment</b> for real ear measurements was revealed. Conclusion: These findings highlight the need for the development and use of current, evidence-based practice guidelines for paediatric audiological assessment and HA fitting in South Africa. These guidelines should include a list of essential equipment required for paediatric assessment and HA fitting. Current, evidence-based practice guidelines for paediatric HA fitting are important in ensuring that secondary developmental delays associated with a delay in early intervention for children with HL are reduced. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the applicability of the seismic reflection method for exploration at shallow depths (100 m) and to develop a high-resolution system capable of achieving such objectives. This would have a wide range of applications including engineering scale surveys and hydrogeological studies. The system used comprised <b>high-frequency</b> response <b>equipment</b> coupled with a data-logging microcomputer. Trial surveys were made at two sites in the Bardon Hill area (Charnwood Forest) where Triassic sediments (0 - 100 m thick) overlie a Precambrian basement, providing large acoustic impedance contrasts. Site 1 was characterized by a thin (1 - 2 m) weathered layer, shallow water table (2 m) and a firm topsoil while in Site 2 the weathered layer was 2 to 4 times as thick as that in the first site, the water table was deeper and the soil was cultivated. The variations in near-surface material strongly affected the quality of the results. Detailed comparisons were made of a number of different modifications of the signal production, data acquisition and data processing aspects of the seismic reflection system. Among the most important factors needed to produce the most successful reflection system was the nature of the seismic energy source: the 'Buffalo gun' proved most effective in providing high frequency energy required for this scale of survey; modifications to it in the course of this study further increased its effectiveness. The high-frequency (100 Hz) geophone and the nature of its coupling with the ground were crucial in extracting and recording high-resolution data. Another important element in the system was the field microcomputer, useful for storing data and providing immediate quality control of data in addition to being a cheap processor. Both preliminary processing on a microcomputer and a standard processing package on a mainframe computer were used. The effectiveness of all types of process was dependent on the quality of the seismic field records. Preliminary processing was adequate to produce a satisfactory image of subsurface geology provided that field data were of high quality (in Site 1) and a number of programs were developed to enable this. The common mid-point stacking technique provided an improved image of shallow subsurface structure by increasing the signal to noise ratio and enhancing reflections. The most useful advantages of using the standard processing package were in improving the continuity and increasing the resolution of the reflections by the application of residual statics and deconvolution, respectively. The dependence of signal quality on variation in physical properties of the near-surface material were analysed in detail. The thickness of the weathered layer and the firmness of the topsoil were the most important factors affecting the transmission and recording of high frequencies. The reflection data can be directly compared with both seismic refraction results and borehole logs obtained along the same survey lines. The reflection data provided a significantly more accurate model of the sub-Triassic surface than did the refraction data; in addition, they provided information on the internal structure of the Triassic strata. The resolution and accuracy of the reflection data demonstrate the applicability of this method in engineering geophysical investigations. Further refinement of this system may be effected by investigating the use of lower-energy sources and more powerful field microcomputers with additional software...|$|R
