30|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the personalized APRV (P-APRV) used to set time-controlled PEEP [109, 110] and inverse inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio are not at all the same mechanical breath. Although there are many differences between P-APRV and inverse I:E, I will focus on the large difference in the time at expiration between these two ventilation strategies. It was shown by Neumann et al. that the ARDS lung collapses very rapidly, their data showing collapse in 0.6  s after the initiation of expiration [17]. Our work using direct observation of alveoli during mechanical ventilation has also shown a very rapid alveolar collapse in the ARDS lung [40, 111 – 113]. Unlike APRV, inverse ratio ventilation does not allow direct and independent adjustments of the expiratory and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>times.</b> Thus, if the expiratory duration with inverse I:E is not less than 0.4 – 0.6  s, which is most often the case, alveoli would have sufficient time to collapse with each breath and inverse I:E would not be defined as time controlled PEEP, since the lung was allowed time to empty.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the influence of sex and body position on respiratory characteristics {{and the effects of}} thoracic, abdominal and paced breathing, and relaxation training on psychological and physiological indices of arousal. Two separate experiments were conducted, each using equal numbers of male and female subjects. The psychological measures of arousal used were: the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, a self-report measure of arousal, and Time Estimation. Physiological data collected included: Skin Conductance, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, thoracic-abdominal index and the inspiration/expiration ratio. Respiratory characteristics were measured using mercury-in-rubber strain gauges. In Experiment 1 the respiratory patterns of 28 subjects were assessed in two body positions: sitting and supine. Subjects were divided according to sex, and allocated randomly to either the sitting-supine order, or the supine-sitting order. In this way four experimental groups were formed. The differences in respiratory patterns, psychological measures, and physiological indices could, therefore, be attributed to either: sex, body position, or the order in which assessment occurred. Experiment 1 revealed that in the sitting position female subjects breathe relatively more thoracically than do male subjects. In the supine position both sexes breathe predominantly abdominally. Thoracic I/E ratios were found to be higher in male subjects than in female subjects and both thoracic and abdominal I/E ratios were effected by •body position and order of position. In the supine position subjects displayed longer <b>inspiratory</b> <b>times</b> than in the sitting position. Similarly, in the sitting-supine order subjects displayed longer <b>inspiratory</b> <b>times</b> than in the supine-sitting order. It was shown that predominantly abdominal breathing was associated with longer thoracic and abdominal inspirations than was thoracic breathing. • Experiment 2 used 48 subjects who were also divided according to sex and randomly allocated to one of four treatment conditions: thoracic, abdominal or paced breathing, or relaxation training. In this experiment subjects were assessed only in the sitting position. Thoracic and abdominal training was accomplished with the aid of visual and auditory feedback procedures. Subjects in the paced breathing treatment were required to inhale and exhale as indicated by the sweep of an analogue meter indicator. Relaxation training required subjects to perform tape-recorded relaxation exercises. Subjects in the paced breathing condition served as attention controls, whilst the subjects in the relaxation training condition served as an arousal control group. Experiment 2 revealed that training subjects to breathe thoracically or abdominally failed to produce consistent changes in the indices of arousal. Both male and female subjects reported feeling less aroused following relaxation training. Time Estimation and the physiological indices failed to parallel the self-report data. The present results are discussed in respect to current respiratory literature and major methodological issues were identified for future research...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{triggering}} performance of mid-level ICU mechanical ventilators {{with a standard}} ICU mechanical ventilator. Design: Experimental bench study. Setting: The respiratory care laboratory of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Subject: A computerized mechanical lung model, the IngMar ASL 5000. Interventions: Ten mid-level ICU ventilators were compared to an ICU ventilator at two levels of lung model effort, three combinations of respiratory mechanics (normal, COPD and ARDS) and two modes of ventilation, volume and pressure assist/control. A total of 12 conditions were compared. Measurements and main results: Performance varied widely among ventilators. Mean <b>inspiratory</b> trigger <b>time</b> was < 100 ms for {{only half of the}} tested ventilators. The mean <b>inspiratory</b> delay <b>time</b> (time from initiation of the breath to return of airway pressure to baseline) was longer than that for the ICU ventilator for all tested ventilators except one. The pressure drop during triggering (Ptrig) was comparable with that of the ICU ventilator for only two ventilators. Expiratory Settling Time (time for pressure to return to baseline) had the greatest variability among ventilators. Conclusions: Triggering differences among these mid-level ICU ventilators and with the ICU ventilator were identified. Some of these ventilators had a much poorer triggering response with high inspiratory effort than the ICU ventilator. These ventilators do not perform as well as ICU ventilators in patients with high ventilatory demand...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{whether there are}} any changes in the tidal breathing flow volume loop (TBFVL) in calm, non-dyspnoeic dogs with intratracheal masses. Methods We compared 4 dogs with intratracheal masses (group 1) with 10 healthy dogs (group 2). Routine clinical and laboratory examinations of the dogs were unremarkable, except for episodic upper respiratory obstructive signs in the dogs in group 1. Lateral radiography of the neck and thorax showed that group 1 dogs had masses that appeared to protrude into the tracheal lumen. Tracheoscopy and surgery or necropsy was performed to confirm {{the presence of the}} mass. Arterial blood gas and TBFVL analysis was carried out in all dogs to assess respiratory status.

In the absence of abnormalities detected by routine diagnostic evaluations and arterial blood gas analysis in dogs with intratracheal masses, the TBFVL contributes to the definition of the physiologic status of the airways at the time of testing, and results suggests that these dogs breathe quite normally when they are calm and non-dyspnoeic...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} The influence of ventilatory settings on static and functional haemodynamic parameters during mechanical ventilation {{is not completely}} known. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure, tidal volume and <b>inspiratory</b> to expiratory <b>time</b> ratio variations on haemodynamic parameters during haemorrhage and after transfusion of shed blood. Methods Ten anaesthetized pigs were instrumented and mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 8 ml kg(- 1), a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH(2) O and an inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1 : 2. Then, they were submitted in a random order to different ventilatory settings (tidal volume 16 ml kg(- 1), positive end-expiratory pressure 15 cmH(2) O or <b>inspiratory</b> to expiratory <b>time</b> ratio 2 : 1). Functional and static haemodynamic parameters (central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, right ventricular end-diastolic volume and pulse pressure variation) were evaluated at baseline, during hypovolaemia (withdrawal of 20 % of estimated blood volume) and after an infusion of withdrawn blood (posttransfusion). Results During baseline, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 15 cmH(2) O significantly increased pulmonary artery occlusion pressure from 14. 6 +/- 1. 6 mmHg to 17. 4 +/- 1. 7 mmHg (P< 0. 001) and pulse pressure variation from 15. 8 +/- 8. 5 % to 25. 3 +/- 9. 5 % (P< 0. 001). High tidal volume increased pulse pressure variation from 15. 8 8. 5 % to 31. 6 +/- 10. 4 % (P< 0. 001), and an <b>inspiratory</b> to expiratory <b>time</b> ratio of 2 : 1 significantly increased only central venous pressure. During hypovolaemia, high positive end-expiratory pressure influenced all studied variables, and high tidal volume strongly increased pulse pressure variation (40. 5 +/- 12. 4 % pre vs. 84. 2 +/- 19. 1 % post, P< 0. 001). The inversion of the <b>inspiratory</b> to expiratory <b>time</b> ratio only slightly increased filling pressures during hypovolaemia, without without affecting pulse pressure variation or right ventricle end-diastolic volume. Conclusion We concluded that pulse pressure variation measurement is influenced by cyclic variations in intrathoracic pressure, such as those caused by augmentations in tidal volume. The increase in mean airway pressure caused by positive end-expiratory pressure affects cardiac filling pressures and also pulse pressure variation, although to a lesser extent. Inversion of the <b>inspiratory</b> to expiratory <b>time</b> ratio does not induce significant changes in static and functional haemodynamic parameters.

5000|$|Inverse ratio {{ventilation}} (IRV) is {{not necessarily}} a mode of mechanical ventilation though it may be referred to as such. IRV is a strategy (method or style) of ventilating the lungs {{in such a way that}} the amount of time the lungs are in inhalation is greater than the amount of time they are in exhalation, allowing for a constant inflation of the lungs, ensuring they remain [...] "recruited" [...] (meaning they participate in gas exchange and are not allowed to deflate to get stuck together or tighten up). The primary goal for IRV is improved oxygenation by forcing <b>inspiratory</b> <b>time</b> to be greater than expiratory time (example: inhale is 3 seconds and exhalation is 1 second, a 3:1 I:E ratio) increasing the mean airway pressure and potentially improving oxygenation. Normal I:E ratio is 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, so forcing the I:E to be 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, (or even as high as 20:1) is the source of the term for the strategy.|$|E
50|$|The pressure-cycled {{ventilation}} includes {{pressure control}} ventilation and pressure support ventilation. Both methods offer a set inspiratory pressure. The tidal volume {{varies depending on}} the resistance and elastance of the respiratory system. Pressure-cycled ventilation can help alleviate symptoms in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome by limiting the distending pressure of the lungs. The pressure control ventilation is specifically a pressure-cycled form of assist-control ventilators. Assist-control ventilators describe a mode of ventilation that maintains a minimum respiratory rate {{regardless of whether or}} not the patient initiates a spontaneous breath. Each inspiratory effort that is beyond the sensitivity threshold delivers full pressures support for a fixed <b>inspiratory</b> <b>time.</b> There is maintenance of a minimum respiratory rate. In the pressure support ventilation, the minimum rate is not set. Instead, all breaths are triggered by the patient. The way that the pressure support ventilation works is by assisting the patient with a constant pressure until the patient’s inspiratory flow fallows below a threshold. The longer, deeper inspiratory flows by the patient will result in a larger tidal volume. This method of mechanical ventilation will help patients assume more work of breathing.|$|E
