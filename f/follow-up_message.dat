30|$|Assisted Contact Tracing {{provides}} a second example. Contact tracing is the epidemiological practice of identifying {{the individuals who}} have {{come into contact with}} infected individuals, in order to map the spread of a disease (Huerta and Tsimring 2002). In 2014, a private company named Odisi developed a platform for “Assisted Contact Tracing” (ACT), which digitized this process through the use of Integrated Voice Recognition Software. Individuals in Ebola-affected communities were able to report their contacts using mobile phones and then received <b>follow-up</b> <b>messages</b> regarding care and updates on the Ebola response. This digitized approach increased the efficiency of data collection by eliminating the need for human interviewers, and also allowed the integration of other types of data (paper and mobile data), which increased the platform’s diagnostic capacity dramatically. Though the platform was designed and implemented as a diagnostic tool, the affordances offered by digital media quickly presented other opportunities. The automated registry of exposed individuals was quickly adapted for risk communication purposes via SMS <b>follow-up</b> <b>messages,</b> and the digitization of rapid analysis of data promptly positioned the ACT platform to play a coordinating role among parallel diagnostic initiatives. Here, we see a clear digital convergence of diagnostic and risk communication activities on a mobile phone platform, at the discretion of a private company.|$|R

40|$|Mobile phone text {{messaging}} is a potentially {{powerful tool for}} behavior change because it is widely available, inexpensive, and instant. This systematic review {{provides an overview of}} behavior change interventions for disease management and prevention delivered through {{text messaging}}. Evidence on behavior change and clinical outcomes was compiled from randomized or quasi-experimental controlled trials of text message interventions published in peer-reviewed journals by June 2009. Only those interventions using text message as the primary mode of communication were included. Study quality was assessed by using a standardized measure. Seventeen articles representing 12 studies (5 disease prevention and 7 disease management) were included. Intervention length ranged from 3 months to 12 months, none had long-term <b>follow-up,</b> and <b>message</b> frequency varied. Of 9 sufficiently powered studies, 8 found evidence to support text messaging as a tool for behavior change. Effects exist across age, minority status, and nationality.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{presentation}} to discuss my work developing and evaluating the efficacy of brief interventions designed to reduce at-risk gambling and related negative consequences among young adults. Research has established that young adults, especially college students, {{are more likely to}} meet classification for “disordered” gambling than the general adult population (Blinn et al., 2007). Brief interventions that incorporate personalized feedback {{have been shown to be}} efficacious at motivating behavior change among young adults (Cronce 2 ̆ 6 Larimer, 2011). The {{purpose of this}} presentation will be to discuss my efforts at extending this work to the area of at-risk gambling. Over the past 3 years our laboratory has conducted two clinical trials examining the efficacy of personalized feedback-based interventions among college students who exceeded a threshold for at-risk gambling. In the first trial we found that participants in a personalized-feedback condition delivered via computer reported fewer dollars wagered and fewer gambling-related problems than those in the control conditions (Martens et al., 2015). Follow-up analyses examining mediators and moderators of intervention effects will also be discussed.

40|$|Objectives: The Teeth Tales trial {{aimed to}} {{establish}} a model for child oral health promotion for culturally diverse communities in Australia. Design: An exploratory trial implementing a community-based child oral health promotion intervention for Australian families from migrant backgrounds. Mixed method, longitudinal evaluation. Setting: The intervention was based in Moreland, a culturally diverse locality in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: Families with 1 – 4 -year-old children, self-identified as being from Iraqi, Lebanese or Pakistani backgrounds residing in Melbourne. Participants residing close to the intervention site were allocated to intervention. Intervention: The intervention was conducted over 5  months and comprised community oral health education sessions led by peer educators and <b>follow-up</b> health <b>messages.</b> Outcome measures: This paper reports on the intervention impacts, process evaluation and descriptive analysis of health, knowledge and behavioural changes 18  months after baseline data collection. Results: Significant differences in the Debris Index (OR= 0. 44 (0. 22 to 0. 88)) and the Modified Gingival Index (OR= 0. 34 (0. 19 to 0. 61)) indicated increased tooth brushing and/or improved toothbrushing technique in the intervention group. An increased proportion of intervention parents, compared {{to those in the}} comparison group reported that they had been shown how to brush their child's teeth (OR= 2. 65 (1. 49 to 4. 69)). Process evaluation results highlighted the problems with recruitment and retention of the study sample (275 complete case families). The child dental screening encouraged involvement in the study, as did linking attendance with other community/cultural activities. Conclusions: The Teeth Tales intervention was promising in terms of improving oral hygiene and parent knowledge of tooth brushing technique. Adaptations to delivery of the intervention are required to increase uptake and likely impact.

There was {{a significant difference between the}} training group (P < 0. 001) and SMS follow-up group (P < 0. 001) in terms of mean weight changes before the training and two weeks after training. There was no significant difference between weight change before the training and after 6 weeks of training (P = 0. 972) in the training group. However, in the SMS follow-up (P < 0. 001) this difference was statistically significant. Training along with follow-up via SMS is effective in weight management in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Given the cost effectiveness of this method, it is recommended for following up dialysis patients. KEYWORDS: Weight Control, Text Messaging, Hemodialysi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Accumulation of {{lifestyle}} physical activity is a current aim of health promotion, with increased stair climbing one public health target. While the workplace {{provides an opportunity}} for regular stair climbing, evidence for effectiveness of point-of-choice interventions is equivocal. This paper reports a new approach to worksite interventions, aimed at changing attitudes and, hence, behaviour. Methods Pre-testing of calorific expenditure messages used structured interviews with members of the public (n[*]=[*] 300). Effects of multi-component campaigns on stair climbing were tested with quasi-experimental, interrupted time-series designs. In one worksite, a main campaign poster outlining the amount of calorific expenditure obtainable from stair climbing and a conventional point-of-choice prompt were used (Poster alone site). In a second worksite, additional messages in the stairwell about calorific expenditure reinforced the main campaign (Poster[*]+[*]Stairwell messages site). The outcome variables were automated observations of stair and lift ascent (28, 854) and descent (29, 352) at baseline and for three weeks after the intervention was installed. Post-intervention questionnaires for employees at the worksites assessed responses to the campaign (n[*]=[*] 253). Analyses employed Analysis of Variance with <b>follow-up</b> Bonferroni t-tests (<b>message</b> pre-testing), logistic regression of stair ascent and descent (campaign testing), and Bonferroni t-tests and multiple regression (follow-up questionnaire). Results Pre-testing of messages based on calorific expenditure suggested they could motivate stair climbing if believed. The new campaign increased stair climbing, with greater effects at the Poster[*]+[*]Stairwell messages site (OR[*]=[*] 1. 52, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 40 - 1. 66) than Posters alone (OR[*]=[*] 1. 24, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 15 - 1. 34). Follow-up revealed higher agreement with two statements about calorific outcomes of stair climbing in the site where they were installed in the stairwell, suggesting more positive attitudes resulted from the intervention. Future intentions for stair use were predicted by motivation by the campaign and beliefs that stair climbing would help weight control. Conclusions Multi-component campaigns that target attitudes and intentions may substantially increase stair climbing at work. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The modern Brazilian Bahá'í community has members and activities and external interests in issues affecting the religion. And the community continues programs of outreach. In 1986 the Brazilian Society of Physicians for Peace was formed on the initiative of a number of Bahá'í physicians (some 120 medical professionals attend the convocation.) In 2002 the National Spiritual Assembly prepared a list of some 44 names of national religious leaders, theologians, and religious academics, and then sent the letter Letter to the World's Religious Leaders out by mail or personal delivery. As a second step, some 330 copies of the letter were sent to the local Spiritual Assemblies in Brazil, for distribution to local religious leaders. [...] "In Brazilian society, religious divisions are a problem," [...] said Roberto Eghrari, secretary of external affairs for the Brazilian National Spiritual Assembly. [...] "There are tensions between evangelical groups and other Christian denominations, and between Christians and Afro-based religious groups. So we believe the distribution of this message is very timely, that {{it has the potential to}} bring new understandings." [...] Mr. Eghrari said religious leaders have acted with much appreciation. Several groups had indicated a desire for some kind of collaboration or <b>follow-up</b> on the <b>message</b> with the Brazilian Baha'i community. [...] "It is not just a matter of people reading the message. They want to put it into action." ...|$|R
