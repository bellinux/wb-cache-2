5|$|After his two Brier seasons, Martin {{did not win}} {{the provincial}} title again until 1995. In the meantime, he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> line-up changes in his team, and by the 1995 Labatt Brier, he had settled on James Pahl as his second, {{retaining}} Park and Bartlett as his third and lead, respectively. At the 1995 Brier, he placed in third after the round robin with a 7–4 win-loss record, tied with Ontario and Prince Edward Island. Martin knocked off Ontario's Ed Werenich in the page playoffs 3 vs. 4 match, but lost to Kerry Burtnyk's Manitoba rink in the semifinal with a score of 9–3.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Germans {{had made}} the halt decision, the Soviet Kalinin, Western and Southwestern Fronts {{launched}} a massive counteroffensive, aimed at driving Army Group Centre back from Moscow. The attacks were especially strong against Third Panzer Group, which <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> of the closest penetrations to the city. In three weeks of confused, savage fighting, Reinhardt extricated his troops from potential encirclement and fell back to the Lama River line. Placed in charge of covering the retreat, Model's harsh, almost brutal, style of leadership now paid dividends as panic threatened to infect the German columns. On several occasions, he restored order at a congested crossroads with a drawn pistol, but the retreat never became a rout.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 the Reds {{became one}} of eight ARL teams to join the rival Super League during the dispute known as the Super League war. They changed their name to the Perth City Reds for the 1997 Super League season, and adopted a jersey of red, white and black. Although the club <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> {{promising}} signings, such as Rodney Howe and Robbie Kearns, the crushing $10 million debt that hung over the club (from having to pay the airfares for all visiting teams) {{at the end of}} the season led to Super League axing the Perth Reds on 1 October 1997.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General {{conducted}} a performance audit on the district. Several findings {{were reported to}} the school board and administration. The auditors noted that the district did not take appropriate corrective action regarding erroneous reports and that the transportation department <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> possible Conflict of Interest transactions. The Superintendent and School Board took no action pending a state investigation. In 2011, the transportation director plead guilty to conspiracy to obtain by fraud school district funds. In 2010, the state Ethics Commission fined the transportation director $49,529.20. The order from the commission alleged he steered almost $450,000 in van contracts to his live-in girlfriend.|$|E

25|$|In {{two cases}} Filbinger saved {{opponents of the}} regime from execution: He {{interfered}} in the confirmation process of the case of military chaplain Möbius, who had been sentenced to death for a political statement. The case was reopened in spring 1945 and Möbius subsequently acquitted. As prosecutor in the case against Lieutenant Forstmeier, who <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> remarks about the July 20 Plot, he influenced the witnesses to testimonies, that could be interpreted in the defendant's favour, prolonged the proceedings and obtained a verdict of demotion and imprisonment on parole. Forstmeier {{was supposed to be}} sent to frontline combat, but {{the end of the war}} prevented this.|$|E
25|$|In the {{meantime}} 4th Division also <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> progress. After {{the capture of}} Grosshau, the division was aided by the armored forces of the CCR. The division now headed for Gey, which was reached on 30 November, but heavily defended. Two days later the Germans mounted a counterattack out from Gey, which caused heavy casualties. The attack was only stopped by intense artillery fire. Since {{the beginning of the}} offensive, 4th Division had already lost about 6,000 men and was now unable to conduct further offensive operations. Subsequently, Collins decided to halt its offensive operations and pulled the division out to replace it with the 83rd Infantry Division on 3 December.|$|E
25|$|Although the new Constitution of 1924 <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> {{changes to}} the {{position}} of women such as raising the age of marriage for girls to sixteen, the question of women's political rights was ignored as was the right to divorce and abolition of polygamy. In 1935 Hoda Shaarawi lectured at the American University of Cairo on the status of women and called for the abolition of polygamy. Her speech was met with protest from two Sheiks from the Al-Azhar University. However, according to Kumari Jayawordena the audience sided with Shaarawi which was symbolic of the changing educated opinion. Her speech was in fact met with such enthusiasm that it was printed in a leading newspaper and thus widely circulated through the Arabic speaking world.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} the Heungseon Daewongun‘s {{decision}} {{to crack down on}} the Catholics. Perhaps the most obvious was the lesson provided by China, that it had apparently reaped nothing but hardship and humiliation from its dealing with the western powers - seen most recently in its disastrous defeat during the Second Opium War. No doubt also fresh in the Heungseon Daewongun‘s mind was the example of the Taiping Rebellion in China, which had been infused with Christian doctrines. 1865 had seen poor harvests in Korea as well as social unrest, which may have contributed to a heightened sensitivity to the foreign creed. The crackdown may also have been related to attempts to combat factional cliques at court, where Christianity <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> inroads.|$|E
25|$|When Bi, the Southern Chanyu, decided {{submit to}} the Han in 50 AD, he sent a princely son as hostage to the Han court and prostrated to the Han envoy as he {{received}} the imperial edict from them. During the Eastern Han period, the tributary system <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> significant changes, which placed the Southern Xiongnu more tightly under regulation and supervision of the Han. The Chanyu was required to send tribute and a princely hostage annually, while an imperial messenger would be dispatched to escort the previous princely hostage back. The Southern Xiongnu were resettled inside the empire at the northern commanderies and were overseen by a Han prefect, who acted as an arbiter in their legal cases and monitored their movements. Attempts by Punu, the Northern Chanyu, to establish peaceful relations with the Han empire always failed, because the Northern Xiongnu were unwilling to come under Han's tributary system and the Han court had no interest to treat them {{along the same lines}} as the Southern Xiongnu instead of dividing them.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} E. annectens predates both Edmontosaurus and annectens. The first good specimen, the former holotype (specimen {{on which a}} taxonomic name is based) of Anatosaurus copei (Anatotitan), was a {{complete}} skull and most of a skeleton collected in 1882 by Dr. J. L. Wortman and R. S. Hill for American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. This specimen, found in Hell Creek Formation rocks, came from northeast of the Black Hills of South Dakota and originally had extensive skin impressions. It was missing most of the pelvis {{and part of the}} torso due to a stream cutting through it. The bill had impressions of a horny sheath with a tooth-like series of interlocking points on the upper and lower jaws. When describing this specimen AMNH5730, Cope assigned it to the species Diclonius mirabilis. This species name was created by combining Diclonius, a hadrosaurid genus Cope had named earlier from teeth, with Trachodon mirabilis, an older name based on teeth and published by Joseph Leidy. Cope believed that Leidy had failed to properly characterize the genus Trachodon and later abandoned its use, so he assigned the old species to his newer genus. Leidy had come to recognize that his Trachodon was based on the remains of multiple kinds of dinosaurs, and though he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> attempts to revise the genus, he had not yet made any formal declaration of his intentions.|$|E

Initially fearing that he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> mistake and that they were going to kill his character off, Johnson learned that Whitney would be enlisting into the Marines. The actor has expressed his pleasure in the way the writers handled Whitney's departure, by giving the character the exit of a hero.|$|E
500|$|Man-made sea {{defenses}} {{include a}} sea wall at Burnham-on-Sea and a [...] section south from Brean Down. There are also sand dune belts which are managed for their protective function {{and as a}} wildlife habitat. There are some concerns that the proposed Severn Barrage could leave some sites high and dry, and others permanently under water. The Steart Peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. The most severe recent floods occurred in 1981. By 1997, a combination of coastal erosion, sea level rise and wave action <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> of the defences distinctly fragile and at risk from failure. As a result, in 2002 The Environment Agency produced the Stolford to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study to examine options for the future.|$|E
