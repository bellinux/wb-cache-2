2500|$|In chapter 20 verses 6 through 12 of The Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament, the {{accidental}} autodefenestration {{of a young}} man of Troas named Eutychus is recorded. [...] The Apostle Paul was travelling to Jerusalem and had stopped for 7 days in Troas. [...] While preaching in a third-story room late on a Sunday night to the local assembly of Christian believers, the young man Eutychus <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep and fell out of the window in which he was sitting. [...] Interestingly, this incident is likely also the only recorded case of raising from death after fatal defenestration, as though Eutychus was taken up dead from the ground below, the Apostle Paul fell upon the body, embraced it, and then presented him alive to those present, whom the Bible indicates [...] "were not a little comforted." [...] (KJV) [...] (Acts 20:6-12) ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{took the}} three {{children}} {{to the home of}} William Starck, a neighbor, for immediate care. Starck's daughter, Anna Starck Benjamin, who was 4½ years old at the time, remembered [...] "the sound of Hazel's outstretched arms as they brushed against the furniture as they brought her into the house, and took her into my parents' bedroom. The crackling sound as that of frozen laundry brought in off the clothes line in winter. Then I remember the crying, so much crying." [...] They worked over Hazel for hours, trying to revive her, but without success. Hazel's mother, Blanche, was brought to the Starck house after the searchers found the children and sat in a chair, rocking back and forth, while they tended to {{the three children}}. Throughout the night when the children were missing, she had been kept company by neighbors. At one point, she <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep, and said later that her daughter had come to her in a dream. In the dream, Hazel said, [...] "I was cold, Mama, but I'm not anymore." ...|$|E

25|$|Familiar {{examples}} of normal myoclonus include hiccups and hypnic jerks {{that some people}} experience while <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep. Severe cases of pathologic myoclonus can distort movement and severely limit a person's ability to sleep, eat, talk, and walk. Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in individuals with epilepsy.|$|R
6000|$|The {{talk now}} <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Indians, {{politics}} and religion, edged round to the war, when the grave Judge began telling Ridings and Robie just how [...] "Kilpatrick charged along the Granny White Turnpike," [...] and, {{on a sheet}} of wrapping-paper, was showing where Major John Dilrigg fell. [...] "I was on his left, about thirty yards, when I saw him throw up his hand"---- ...|$|E
60|$|When all {{the rest}} had <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> their day's work, I sat for near half an hour with the young {{mistress}} of the house, who talked pleasantly over her seam of the chestnut harvest, and the beauties of the Tarn, and old family affections, broken up when young folk go from home, yet still subsisting. Hers, I am sure, was a sweet nature, with a country plainness and much delicacy underneath; and he who takes her to his heart will doubtless be a fortunate young man.|$|E
6000|$|The talk <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{the history}} of a shepherd's child, who had strayed into the bush, and after much searching, in which the Bishop and Fulbert had been half starved, had finally been found and carried home by Angela's [...] "crack gin," [...] as she told it to Bernard; and as Marilda thought the poor child was in a trap, it had to be {{translated}} into [...] "favourite pupil," [...] though Bernard carried on the joke by asking Marilda if she thought the natives cannibals given to the snaring of mankind.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{something}} friendly and adventurous in her manner; she conveyed she liked me, and when presently Willersley <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> write letters our talk sank {{at once to}} easy confidential undertones. I felt enterprising, and indeed {{it is easy to}} be daring with people one has never seen before and may never see again. I said I loved beautiful scenery and all beautiful things, and the pointing note in my voice made her laugh. She told me I had bold eyes, and so far as I can remember I said she made them bold. [...] "Blue they are," [...] she remarked, smiling archly. [...] "I like blue eyes." [...] Then I think we compared ages, and she said she was the Woman of Thirty, [...] "George Moore's Woman of Thirty." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a {{sight that}} Bacchus and his bacchanals would have gloated over. Each {{puncheon}} {{was of a}} deep-green color, so covered with minute barnacles and shell-fish, and streaming with sea-weed, that it needed long searching to find out their bung-holes; they looked like venerable old loggerhead-turtles. How long they had been tossing about, and making voyages {{for the benefit of}} the flavour of their contents, no one could tell. In trying to raft them ashore, or on board of some merchant-ship, they must have <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sea. This we inferred from the ropes that length-wise united them, and which, from one point of view, made them resemble a long sea-serpent. They were struck into the gun-deck, where, the eager crowd being kept off by sentries, the cooper was called with his tools.|$|E
60|$|He had {{to search}} for a new job that evening. Only--he was so tired; it was so {{pleasant}} to lie there with his sore feet cooling against the wall, picturing a hunt in Africa, with native servants bringing him things to eat: juicy steaks and French-fried potatoes and gallons of ale (a repast which he may have been ignorant in assigning to the African jungles, but which seemed peculiarly well chosen, after a lunch-room dinner of watery corned-beef hash, burnt German-fried potatoes, and indigestible hot mince-pie). His thoughts <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Plato. But Carl had a certain resoluteness even in these loose days. He considered the manoeuvers for a new job. He desired one which would permit him to go to theaters with the girl in white furs whom he had seen that noon--the unknown fairy of his discontent.|$|E

Maxwell agreed and he <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep where he later died.|$|E
5000|$|Angel is an American {{heavy metal}} band from New York City, formed in 1989. The band was founded and guided by Criss Angel during the {{explosion}} of hair metal in the late '80s. The name of the present band was taken as [...] "Angel" [...] when the glam-rock band formed by Punky Meadows and Mickie Jones gradually dissolved after 1981 (with a brief resurgence in 1987), as its founding members <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> other projects. The present band disbanded when founder Criss Angel decided {{to go into the}} direction of industrial rock, and formed Angeldust (after which he pursued a career in magic and illusion).|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bennett {{danced with}} silent irritation, and, {{striking}} a bare toe against {{the leg of}} a chair, seized his left foot and staggered {{into the arms of}} Webster, who had been preparing <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the servants' hall. Linked together, the two proceeded across the carpet in a movement which suggested in equal parts the careless vigour of the cake-walk and the grace of the old-fashioned mazurka.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{advocate}} enhancing creativity {{by taking}} advantage of hypnagogia, the transition from wakefulness to sleep, using techniques such as lucid dreaming. One technique used by Salvador Dalí was <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep in an armchair with a set of keys in his hand; when he fell completely asleep, the keys would fall and wake him up, allowing him to recall his mind's subconscious imaginings. [...] Thomas Edison used the same technique, with ball bearings.|$|R
5000|$|Later in {{the house}} they get some sleep, putting {{mattresses}} {{in front of the}} fire. [...] "The last thing I remember was Mona's hand on the floor, between our two mattresses, and that hand, as I <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep, acquired an incredible meaning." [...] Snowploughs clear the roads, and police, following up Donald's call, come to question him about Ray. When Donald later goes back to the barn he finds the cigarette butts on the ground are missing: Isabel must have cleared them away, so that the police, checking Donald's story, would not find them. [...] "She knew. Yet there was no accusation in her blue eyes, no sharpened attitude. Only a slight astonishment and curiosity." [...] Later, Ray's body is found.|$|E
50|$|The old {{village of}} Wolfhampcote is located {{west of the}} A45 road near Braunston in Northamptonshire, and {{can be reached by}} a track from the main A45 road, or by a lane from Flecknoe. The village was {{abandoned}} sometime in the late 14th century and is classified as a deserted medieval village. Local legend suggests that the village was wiped out by the Black Death brought in by refugees from London, but {{there is no evidence to}} support this. It is much more likely that a few cottages still remained after the great plague and after struggling to maintain their land the villagers <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> more prosperous places leaving the Lord of the Manor to clear the land for sheep grazing as best he could. The village is shown as Wulfencote on the Christopher Saxton map of 1637.|$|E

50|$|Audiobooks are {{considered}} a valuable tool because of their format. Unlike traditional books or a video program, one can listen to an audiobook while doing other tasks. Such tasks include doing the laundry, exercising, weeding and similar tasks. The most popular general use of audiobooks by adults is when commuting with an automobile or while traveling with public transport, {{as an alternative to}} radio. Many people listen as well just to relax or as they <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|R

5000|$|Back in New Zealand in 1925, {{recurring}} {{bouts of}} malaria and ongoing work commitments curtailed Parker's playing career, and he retired {{after a few}} club matches that season. However, he continued in a coaching role and was credited {{at the end of}} the 1939 season for much of the improvement shown by the Victoria College Football Club in Wellington. Parker was a member of the executive committee of the New Zealand Rugby Union from 1939 to 1956, and was the All Blacks' manager on their controversial tour of South Africa in 1949. New Zealand acquiesced to the apartheid policies of South Africa and sent a European-only team. Parker would have been aware that his former team mate, George Nepia, had already experienced South Africa’s racism and had <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> play rugby league. As a silent protest, the All Blacks did not perform the tradition pre-game haka. Parker stated that, [...] "the war cry is a creation of the Maoris and as we have no Maoris with us we are not giving the war cry." ...|$|E

Evans was {{operating}} with the Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy in company with [...] {{which was in}} the process of going to flying stations and all ships in the formation were running without lights. Melbourne radioed Evans, then to port of the carrier, to take up the rescue destroyer position. The logical movement would be to turn to port and make a circle taking up station on the carrier's port quarter. However, since the conning officer on Evans misunderstood the formation's base course and believed they were starboard of Melbourne, they turned to starboard, cutting across the carrier's bow twice in the process. Frank E. Evans was struck at a point around 92 feet from her bow on her port side and was cut in two. Her bow <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the port side of Melbourne and sank in less than five minutes taking 73 of her crew with it. One body was recovered from the water, making a total of 74 dead. The stern scraped along the starboard side of Melbourne and lines were able to be attached by the crew of Melbourne. Around 60-100 men were also rescued from the water.|$|E

Hubbard leaves Cory in his room and proceeds to get visibly drunk among the rest of the conventioneers. Cory <b>drifts</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep in Hubbard’s bed.|$|R
