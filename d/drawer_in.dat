Augustus also sees them, but mistaking them for toys, grabs them from Henry and locks them in the desk <b>drawer</b> <b>in</b> his study. Here, Dinky and Grandpa discover that Augustus forged the documents {{in order to become}} Henry's legal guardian, as well as to steal and redevelop the Biggs' property.|$|E

25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a {{professor}} of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which <b>drawer</b> <b>in</b> a chest of drawers to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E

500|$|Charles II, who {{promoted}} {{a number of}} Roman Catholics at court, granted Wright a measure of royal art patronage. In 1661, soon after the coronation, he painted a formalised portrait of the monarch, seated {{in front of a}} tapestry representing the Judgement of Solomon, wearing St. Edward's Crown, the robes of the Garter, and carrying the orb and sceptre. Wright was also commissioned to paint an allegorical ceiling for the King's bedchamber at Whitehall Palace, and he was further appointed in 1673 to the office of [...] "picture <b>drawer</b> <b>in</b> ordinary", allowing him to exercise his right to sign his pictures [...] "Pictor Regis". However, to his disappointment, he did not receive the coveted office of King's Painter, which was held in the 1660s by Sir Peter Lely alone. In contrast to Wright's sympathetic realism, and carefully observed landscape backgrounds, Lely had a more glamorous style, favoured by the court, and based on Van Dyck's pre-Civil War style. This prompted the diarist Samuel Pepys to remark, after an enjoyable visit to Lely's studio, [...] "thence to Wright's the painters: but Lord, the difference that is between their two works".|$|E
2500|$|Cash drawers {{that are}} {{integral}} to a stand-alone register {{often have a}} manual release catch underneath to open the <b>drawer</b> <b>in</b> {{the event of a}} power failure. More advanced cash drawers have eliminated the manual release in favor of a cylinder lock, requiring a key to manually open the drawer. The cylinder lock usually has several positions: locked, unlocked, online (will open if an impulse is given), and release. The release position is an intermittent position with a spring to push the cylinder back to the unlocked position. In the [...] "locked" [...] position, the drawer will remain latched even when an electric impulse is sent to the solenoid.|$|E

2500|$|An {{additional}} recording showed Siminovsky in the judge's robing room on March 10, 2003. He handed Garson {{an envelope}} containing a $1,000 cash [...] "referral fee".

He then tried to return it, suggesting that Siminovsky contribute it to Garson's wife's judicial campaign instead. But Siminovsky threw the money back on the judge's desk, saying he would make a campaign contribution as well, but telling the judge to keep the cash. Garson picked up the money, and tried to hand it to Siminovsky once again, saying [...] "I appreciate it. No, no, no... No." [...] But then, sighing, he put the money in his desk drawer. Siminovsky was instructed by the DA to duck Garson's repeated calls that day and the next, anticipating Garson's attempts to return the money. When Garson was arrested a few days later on his way to work, the envelope containing the sting money was in his pocket. The box of cigars, purchased by the DA's office {{as part of the}} [...] sting operation, had been placed in Garson's desk <b>drawer</b> <b>in</b> his robing room by Siminovsky, where they remained unopened and untouched until months later when the DA asked Garson's attorney to retrieve them.

[...] Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has {{decided to take a}} break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. [...] He glumly turns to his Gollum figurine and asks it, [...] "Well, Gollum, you're an expert on rings, what do I do with this one?", while simultaneously taking his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom, out of this desk <b>drawer.</b> <b>In</b> the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In [...] "The Earworm Reverberation", Sheldon can't get a song out his head but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that Amy changed his life for the better and then goes to her apartment to profess his love, at which time Amy reciprocates. [...] Amy's date that night was Dave, who has great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect; after seeing how much they love each other, Dave urges Sheldon to kiss Amy. [...] In the following episode, [...] "The Opening Night Excitation" [...] Leonard, Wolowitz and Raj go to see [...] without Sheldon as he has somewhat reluctantly opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. [...] As Amy made Sheldon's birthday party enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate. [...] He tells them that he has narrowed things down to 3 options, the first being a chance to play the harp with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the second being an all-expense paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's ornithophobia is nothing compares to his Ovinophobia, the fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in coitus, at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. In the tenth season, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility. Afterwards, they decide to move in together permanently. In the final episode of the season, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki; the eleventh season premiere was basically a continuation of this, and Amy accepts his proposal.|$|E
