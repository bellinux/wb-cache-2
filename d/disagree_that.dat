The main body cavity, {{under the crown of}} tentacles, is called the metacoelom, and the tentacles and their base share the mesocoelom. Above the mouth is the epistome, a hollow lid which can close the mouth. The cavity in the epistome is sometimes called the protocoelom, although other authors <b>disagree</b> <b>that</b> it is a coelom and Ruppert, Fox and Barnes think it is built by a different process.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not <b>disagree</b> <b>that</b> writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E

Many scholars, however, view the Bhagavata as a remarkably early literary work that questions and discusses social and gender norms in the 5th to 10th-century India.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{promises}} made to Londoners when {{they won the}} right to host the 2012 Olympic Games was that the Olympic Park would be a “blueprint for sustainable living.” However, residents of the allotments of Manor Road were relocated, due to the building of the Olympic stadium, and would later <b>disagree</b> <b>that</b> the Olympics had had any positive effect on their lives. Allotments, originally, were intended to provide low-income residents with a plot of land on which to grow their own food, thus receiving the dual health benefits of a supply of fresh food and outdoor work. Many of these sites were lost {{as a result of the}} Olympic venue construction, most notably the Manor Road site. Residents were promised that the allotments would be returned, and they eventually were. However, the soil quality would never be the same. Crops tended by allotment residents were the result of years of careful cultivation, and thus, those years of care and attention were destroyed by a bulldozer. Further, allotment residents were exposed to radioactive waste for five months prior to moving, during the excavation of the site for the Games. Other local residents, construction workers, and onsite archeologists faced similar exposures and risks.|$|E

He stated his reason through his extended review; [...] "Kingdom Hearts has several 'theme songs' but the orchestrated version of 'Hikari' takes the cake with all {{the makings of a}} grand adventure. It resonates with the many themes of the games: friendship, teamwork, and adventure. 'Hikari' undoubtedly brings back wealth of memories for any fan of the franchise." [...] GameFAQs's editor Pierce Sparrow listed both [...] "Simple & Clean" [...] and [...] "Sanctuary" [...] at number two on their [...] "Top Ten Lyrical Songs for a Video Game".

500|$|The Chandogya Upanishad, {{estimated}} to have been composed sometime between the 8th and 6th centuriesBCE, has been another source of speculation regarding Krishna in ancient India. Verse 3.17.6 mentions Krishna Devakiputra (Sanskrit: कृष्णाय देवकीपुत्रा) as {{a student of the}} sage Ghora Angirasa. This phrase, which means [...] "Krishna the son of Devaki", has been mentioned by scholars such as Max Müller as a potential source of fables and Vedic lore about Krishna in the Mahabharata and other ancient literature only potential because this verse could have been interpolated into the text, or the Krishna Devikaputra could be different from the deity Krishna. These doubts are supported {{by the fact that the}} much later age Sandilya Bhakti Sutras, a treatise on Krishna, cites later age compilations such as the Narayana Upanishad but never cites this verse of the Chandogya Upanishad. Other scholars <b>disagree</b> <b>that</b> the Krishna mentioned along with Devika in the ancient Upanishad is unrelated to the later Hindu god of the Bhagavad Gita fame. For example, Archer states that the coincidence of the two names appearing together in the same Upanishad verse cannot be dismissed easily.|$|E

2500|$|Creationist biology {{centers on}} an idea derived from Genesis that states {{that life was}} created by God, in {{a finite number of}} [...] "created kinds," [...] rather than through {{biological}} evolution from a common ancestor.

2500|$|Fetal hormones {{may be seen}} {{as either}} the primary {{influence}} upon adult sexual orientation or as a co-factor interacting with genes and/or environmental and social conditions. However, Garcia-Falgueras and Dick Swaab <b>disagree</b> <b>that</b> social conditions influence sexual orientation to a large degree. As seen in young children as well as in vervet and rhesus monkeys, sexually differentiated behavior in toy preference is differing in males versus females, where females prefer dolls and males prefer toy balls and cars; these preferences can be seen as early as 3–8 months in humans. [...] It is impossible to completely rule out the social environment or the child's cognitive understanding of gender when discussing sex typed play in androgen-exposed girls. [...] Conversely, children tend towards objects which have been labelled for their own sex, or toys that they have seen members of their sex playing with previously.|$|E
