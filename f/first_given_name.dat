25|$|The Mercantile Marine War Medal is a disk, {{struck in}} bronze and 36 millimetres in diameter. The {{straight}} clasp non-swivelling suspender {{is attached to}} the medal with a single-toe claw mount and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. The recipient's name is impressed on the rim in sans-serif capital letters and the <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>name</b> is often in full.|$|E
25|$|For practicality, {{usually only}} the last surname (excluding prepositions) is used in formal {{greetings}} or in scientific papers indexing. But, in a list of people, the <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>name,</b> not the surname, is used for alphabetical sorting. A married woman may add her partner's last surname(s) {{to the end of}} her own name, but this is not mandatory and increasingly less common. The same may happen with men, though this is extremely rare.|$|E
25|$|Family {{names in}} German-speaking {{countries}} are usually positioned last, after all given names. There are exceptions, however: {{in parts of}} Austria and Bavaria and the Alemannic-speaking areas, the family name is regularly {{put in front of}} the <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>name.</b> Also in many – especially rural – parts of Germany, to emphasize family affiliation there is often an inversion in colloquial use, in which the family name becomes a possessive: Rüters Erich, for example, would be Erich of the Rüter family.|$|E
50|$|Ukrainian <b>names</b> are <b>given</b> <b>names</b> that {{originated}} in Ukraine. In {{addition to the}} <b>first</b> (<b>given)</b> <b>names,</b> Ukrainians also have patronymic and family names.|$|R
50|$|The Queenstown {{suburb of}} Frankton {{was named after}} his wife Frances. Cecil Peak and Walter Peak were <b>named</b> after the <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>names</b> of his son.|$|R
50|$|Both Cecil Peak and {{the nearby}} {{mountain}} of Walter Peak were named after William Rees' eldest sons' <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>names</b> by the surveyor James McKerrow in 1862.|$|R
25|$|Rosalind Ivy Fuller was {{the third}} of four daughters born to a Portsmouth draper, whose eldest child was a son, Walter (born 1881). Behind the draper’s shop was a hall in which Mr Fuller {{organized}} free public entertainment on Sunday afternoons, having his daughters recite, sing and play various instruments – the eldest girl learned the harp, for instance. Rosalind, who was called Ivy by her family until she was 21, when she opted for her <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>name,</b> always disliked having to perform on stage because she suffered agonies of self-consciousness.|$|E
25|$|In many families, {{single or}} {{multiple}} middle names are simply alternative names, names honoring an ancestor or relative, or, for married women, sometimes their maiden names. In some traditions, however, {{the roles of}} the first and middle given names are reversed, with the <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>name</b> being used to honor a family member and the middle name being used as the usual method to address someone informally. Many Catholic families choose a saint's name as their child's middle name or this can be left until the child's confirmation when they choose a saint's name for themselves. Cultures that use patronymics or matronymics will often give middle names to distinguish between two similarly named people: e.g., Einar Karl Stefánsson and Einar Guðmundur Stefánsson. This is especially done in Iceland (as shown in example) where people are known and referred to almost exclusively by their given name/s.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{traditional}} given {{names are}} gender-specific. However, a few given names, such as Dominique (see above: completely gender-neutral), Claude (traditionally masculine), and Camille (traditionally masculine, now mostly feminine), {{are given to}} both males and females; for others, the pronunciation is the same but the spelling is different: Frédéric (m) / Frédérique (f). In medieval times, a woman was often named Philippe (Philippa), now an exclusively masculine name (Philip), or a male Anne (Ann), now almost exclusively feminine (except as second or third given name, mostly in Brittany). From the middle 19th-century into the early 20th-century, Marie was a popular first name for both men or women, however, before and after this period it has been almost exclusively given to women as a <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>name,</b> even if the practice still exists {{to give it to}} males as second or third given name, especially in devout Catholic families.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond this {{seemingly}} [...] "compound" [...] surname {{system in the}} Hispanic world, there are also true compound surnames in the Spanish-speaking countries. These true compound surnames are passed on and inherited as compounds. For instance, former Chairman of the Supreme Military Junta of Ecuador, General Luis Telmo Paz y Miño Estrella, has Luis as his <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>name,</b> Telmo as his middle name, the true compound surname Paz y Miño as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Estrella as his second (i.e. maternal) surname.|$|E
2500|$|Names with {{originally}} Finnish etymology were revived in the 19th century. In {{the absence}} of reliable information about ancient names, parents chose names of mythical characters from folklore (Aino, Tapio), and many new names were created from Finnish words (Seppo [...] "smith" [...] or [...] "skilled person", Ritva [...] "birch twig"). Some clergymen initially refused to christen babies with such [...] "pagan" [...] names. The <b>first</b> <b>given</b> <b>name</b> of Finnish origin, Aino, was accepted in the almanac in 1890, followed by numerous others in 1908. About 30% of Finns born in 1910–1939 received a name with Finnish etymology.|$|E
