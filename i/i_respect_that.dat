But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> <b>that,</b> and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
500|$|Following her announcement, Rice's {{critique}} of Christianity was commented upon by numerous journalists and pundits. In {{an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times, Rice elaborated on her view regarding being a member of a Christian church: [...] "I feel much more morally comfortable walking away from organized religion. <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> {{there are all kinds of}} denominations and all kinds of churches, but it's the entire controversy, the entire conversation that I need to walk away from right now." [...] In response to the question, [...] "how do you follow Christ without a church?" [...] Rice replied: [...] "I think the basic ritual is simply prayer. It's talking to God, putting things in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings." [...] In 2011, Rice participated in the [...] "I Am Second" [...] project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey. On April 14, 2013, Rice stated in a Facebook post that she was a secular humanist. [...] On July 28, 2014, Rice stated in a Facebook post that Christ is still central to her life, but not in the way he is presented by organized religion.|$|E

Wayne Clough {{later in}} {{interview}} states {{that although he}} stands by his decision, it [...] "might have been made too quickly" [...] and he describes that making the decision was [...] "painful." [...] Clough mentions that because of heated controversy surrounding the footage {{and the possibility that}} it might [...] "spiral out of control", the Smithsonian might be in the end forced to shut-down the entire [...] "Hide/Seek" [...] exhibition, and it's [...] "something he didn't want to happen." [...] The [...] "Hide/Seek" [...] exhibition [...] "examines representations of homosexuality in American portraiture", and Clough states [...] "The funders and people who were upset by the decision, and <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> <b>that,</b> still have an appreciation that this exhibition is up.

[...] Chen felt that the decision to produce an Android phone was to help BlackBerry's device business sustain itself, saying that [...] "we have some really committed diehards. <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> there's a lot of heritage here, a lot of pride. If the math doesn't add up, the math doesn't add up. We could keep the pride and die hungry or we can eat well and not so proud, maybe. So I chose to eat well. It’s good for the company to continue to have a shot at building handsets."

2500|$|Sophia Bush portrays Brooke Davis. [...] "What I do {{like about}} her– {{the things that}} I have had to portray her going through– you always learn a lesson from Brooke", stated Bush. [...] "She always manages to pick herself up when she falls on her face. And <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> <b>that.</b> She is not all high and mighty and she doesn't act like she is always right. She {{has a lot of}} {{convictions}} and she is [...] really loyal friend. I appreciate how loyal she is. She doesn't take betrayal lightly and she doesn't think it is OK to lie to someone." [...] Brooke is the beautiful captain of the high school cheerleading squad, and the best friend of Peyton, and close friend of Haley. She has twice been a girlfriend to Lucas. Though her life appears perfect at the beginning, she is seen to suffer from having to deal with her distant parents, her friends' inability to take her seriously, and the betrayal of Lucas and Peyton when they date behind her back leaving her hurt. She eventually overcomes the betrayal and is determined to live a full, happy life.|$|E

He's one against two hundred, and he insists upon his rights. Those men standing round and wiping their eyes, and stifled with grief because a fox had been poisoned, as though some great patriot had died among them {{in the service of}} his country, formed {{one of the most remarkable}} phenomena, sir, that ever I beheld in any country.

60|$|But {{it will be}} asked: Will such {{improvements}} pay? <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> question. I do not sneer at it, and regard it, as {{some are}} too apt to do, {{as a sign of}} the mercenary and money-loving spirit of the present age. I look on it as a healthy sign of the English mind; a sign that we believe, as the old Jews did, that political and social righteousness is inseparably connected with wealth and prosperity. The old Psalms and prophets have taught us that lesson; and God forbid that we should forget it. The world is right well made; and the laws of trade and of social economy, just as much as the laws of nature, are divine facts, and only by obeying them can we thrive. And I had far sooner hear a people asking of every scheme of good, Will it pay? than throwing themselves headlong into that merely sentimental charity to which superstitious nations have always been prone--charity which effects no permanent good, which, whether in Hindostan or in Italy, debases, instead of raising, the suffering classes, because it breaks the laws of social economy.|$|E

There were twelve stunts on the bill, not counting the kalatechnoscope, and I got in before the first was over, so that I had the immediate advantage of seeing a gifted fellow-creature lightly swinging himself between two chairs which had their outer legs balanced on the tops of caraffes full of water, and making no more of the feat than if it were a walk in the Park or down Fifth Avenue. How <b>I</b> <b>respected</b> <b>that</b> man! What study had gone to the perfection of that act, and the others that he equally made nothing of! He was simply billed as 'Equilibrist,' when his name ought to have been blazoned in letters a foot high if they were in any wise to match his merit.
