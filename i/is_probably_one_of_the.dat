5|$|Jocelin {{was one of}} {{the bishops}} that crowned John's son Henry III, and {{throughout}} the rest of Jocelin's life was involved in royal administration. He was also active in his diocese, ordering construction on the cathedral at Wells, and issuing rules for his diocesan clergy. During his time as bishop, he settled a dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey that had started during the bishopric of his predecessor. The memorial brass on his tomb in Wells Cathedral <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest in England.|$|E
5|$|As {{was often}} the case with Celtic churches from this period, the church was {{associated}} with a well. It was built by the monks of Penmon and was believed to have healing powers by some people visiting it. It <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest buildings in Penmon. It has been said that the lower stone walls near the well were part of Seiriol's church in the 6th century; if so, this would make it the oldest remaining Christian building in Wales. A small chamber surrounds the well. In modern times, water from the well {{has been used as a}} symbol of Anglesey by the island's representatives at the launch ceremony of the 10th International Island Games (held in Guernsey in June 2003) and the 11th Island Games (held in the Shetland Islands in July 2005).|$|E

25|$|The use of {{de-icing}} salts on roadways, used {{to lower the}} freezing point of water, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary causes of premature failure of reinforced or prestressed concrete bridge decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of epoxy-coated reinforcing bars {{and the application of}} cathodic protection has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) rebars are known to be less susceptible to chlorides. Properly designed concrete mixtures that have been allowed to cure properly are effectively impervious to the effects of de-icers.|$|E
25|$|The park derives {{its name}} from Phong Nha Cave, {{containing}} many fascinating rock formations, and Kẻ Bàng forest. The plateau on which the park is situated <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finest and most distinctive examples of a complex karst landform in Southeast Asia. This national park was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites in 2003 for its geological values as defined in its criteria viii. In April 2009, the world's largest cave, was re-discovered {{by a team of}} British cave explorers of the British Caving Association led by a local farmer named Ho Khanh.|$|E
25|$|Parque Vidal <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most typical {{places in}} Cuba. During the afternoons, people (especially singles) visit {{the park to}} meet others. Although not widely practiced in recent times, the custom was to walk the park around and around. The women walk the inner part of the park, while the men walk the outer side. Another lost custom was for the locals {{to set up a}} {{platform}} and offer improvisations with their guitars on late Sunday afternoons. For that day they dressed with their Guayaberas and highly polished shoes.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most beautiful {{parks in the}} city with tree lined walkways and gardens. The park {{in the heart of}} Papanui is probably the best location to see over-wintering monarch butterflies. On a warm sunny late autumn or early winter's day head to the children's play ground and look into the largely leafless old trees. There you will see monarchs clustering together often holding on to the remaining leaves for support. It ís a great spot for a picnic beneath the trees with monarchs fluttering in the air above.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{there are}} several construction grammarians who operate within the general framework of construction grammar without affiliating themselves with any specific construction grammar program. There is a growing interest in the diachronic aspect of grammatical constructions and thus in the importation of methods and ideas from grammaticalization studies. Another area of growing interest is the pragmatics of pragmatic constructions. This <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons why the usage-based model is gaining popularity among construction grammarians. Another area of increasing interest among construction grammarians is that of language acquisition which is mainly due to Michael Tomasello's work. Mats Andrén coined the term multimodal constructions to account for constructions that incorporate both (conventionalized) gesture and speech.|$|E
25|$|The small Oratorio di Santa Maria in Valle in Cividale del Friuli <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest {{preserved}} {{examples of}} Lombard architecture, as Cividale {{was the first}} Lombard city in Italy. Parts of Lombard constructions have been preserved in Pavia (San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, crypts of Sant'Eusebio and San Giovanni Domnarum) and Monza (cathedral). The Basilic autariana in Fara Gera d'Adda near Bergamo and the church of San Salvatore in Brescia also have Lombard elements. All these buildings are in northern Italy (Langobardia major), but by far the best-preserved Lombard structure is in southern Italy (Langobardia minor). The Church of Santa Sofia in Benevento was erected in 760 by Duke Arechis II, and it preserves Lombard frescoes {{on the walls and}} even Lombard capitals on the columns.|$|E

25|$|Exekias (545-520 BC) is {{generally}} considered to be the absolute master of the black-figure style, which reaches its apex with him. His significance is not only due to his masterful vase painting, but also to his high quality and innovative pottery. He signed 12 of his surviving vessels as potter, two as both painter and potter. Exekias probably had a large {{role in the development of}} Little-master cups and the Type A belly amphora mentioned above, and he possibly invented the calyx krater, at least the oldest existing piece is from his workshop. In contrast to many other comparable craftsmen, as a painter he attached great importance to the careful elaboration of ornaments. The details of his images—horses’ manes, weapons, clothing—are also outstandingly well executed. His scenes are usually monumental and the figures emanate a dignity previously unknown in painting. In many cases he broke with Attic conventions. For his most famous vessel, the Dionysus cup, he was the first to use a coral-red interior coating instead of the customary red color. This innovation, as well as his placing of two pairs of eyes on the exterior, connects Exekias with the classic eye cups. Probably even more innovative was his use of the entire inside of the cup for his picture of Dionysus, reclining on a ship from which grapevines sprout. At this time it was in fact customary to decorate the inside surface merely with a gorgon face. The cup <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiments undertaken in the pottery district to break new ground before the red-figure style was introduced. He was the first to paint a ship sailing along the rim of a dinos. He only seldom adhered to traditional patterns of depicting customary mythological subjects. His depiction of the suicide of Ajax is also significant. Exekias does not show the act itself, which was in the tradition, but rather Ajax’ preparations. About as famous as the Dionysus cup is an amphora with his visualization of Ajax and Achilles engaged in a board game. Not only is the portrayal detailed, Exekias even conveys the outcome of the game. Almost in the style of a speech balloon he has both players announce the numbers they cast with their dice—Ajax a three and Achilles a four. This is the oldest known depiction of this scene, of which there is no mention in classical literature. No fewer than 180 other surviving vases, dating from the Exekias version up to about 480 BC, show this scene.|$|E

500|$|Mn-SOD is {{the type}} of SOD present in {{eukaryotic}} mitochondria, and also in most bacteria (this fact is in keeping with the bacterial-origin theory of mitochondria). The Mn-SOD enzyme <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide (...) , formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. The exceptions, which are all bacteria, include Lactobacillus plantarum and related lactobacilli, which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese (Mn2+) ions complexed with polyphosphate, suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life.|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{maintains}} that {{the core of the}} strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. [...] "I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," [...] she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, [...] "you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak about something that had just entered your mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most powerful spiritual forces." [...] Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.|$|E
500|$|The substantiative issue {{involved}} {{is the nature}} of Eusebius' source; where [...] "gerüchte" [...] suggests hearsay (Frend explains that Eusebius' [...] κατέχει λόγος' [...] "usually means mere suggestion"), [...] "it is recorded" [...] suggests documentation. Given that Eusebius' major sources for 3rd-century history were written records, Shahîd contends that the typical translation misrepresents the original text. His source here <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two letters from Origen to Philip and Marcia Otacilia Severa, Philip's wife, mentioned at 6.36.3. Shahîd argues that an oral source is unlikely given that Eusebius composed his Historia in Caesarea and not Antioch; but others, like Stein and theologian Arthur Cushman McGiffert, editor and translator of the Historia for the Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, contend nonetheless that the story has an oral source.|$|E

[...] 1UP editor Kat Bailey {{expressed}} concern about which Pokémon could follow the player in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, stating [...] "allowing popular favorites like Charizard would go over quite well". The Daily Cardinal editor Kyle Sparks called Charizard [...] "the most dominant Pokémon in the whole universe, a force of sheer strength".

500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic {{self-absorption}} that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E
