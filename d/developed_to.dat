While withdrawal symptoms can occur, {{there is no}} evidence that tolerance <b>develops</b> <b>to</b> the drug's antipsychotic effects. A patient can be maintained for years on a therapeutically effective dose without any decrease in effectiveness being reported. Tolerance appears <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> the sedating effects of chlorpromazine when it is first administered. Tolerance also appears <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> the extrapyramidal, parkinsonian and other neuroleptic effects, although this is debatable.|$|R

5|$|Mathematically, {{these models}} can be {{represented}} in several ways. Petri nets, which were introduced in Carl Adam Petri's 1962 doctoral thesis, were an early attempt to codify the rules of consistency models. Dataflow theory later built upon these, and Dataflow architectures were created to physically implement the ideas of dataflow theory. Beginning in the late 1970s, process calculi such as Calculus of Communicating Systems and Communicating Sequential Processes were <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> permit algebraic reasoning about systems composed of interacting components. More recent additions to the process calculus family, such as the π-calculus, have added the capability for reasoning about dynamic topologies. Logics such as Lamport's TLA+, and mathematical models such as traces and Actor event diagrams, have also been <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> describe the behavior of concurrent systems.|$|E
