5|$|Although English is {{the common}} {{language}} of Westeros, the producers charged linguist David J. Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few words in the novels; Dothraki and Valyrian <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> often subtitled in English. It {{has been reported that}} during the series these fictional languages have been heard by more people than the Welsh, Irish, and Scots Gaelic languages combined.|$|E
5|$|Kyle is {{animated}} by computer {{in a way}} to emulate the show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film , as well as South Park-related media and merchandise. While Parker and Stone portray Kyle as having common childlike tendencies, his <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> often intended to reflect stances and views on more adult-oriented issues, and has been cited in numerous publications by experts in the fields of politics, religion, popular culture, and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Late in rehearsals for the {{original}} production, Jessie Bond {{assumed the role of}} Hebe, replacing Mrs Howard Paul. Bond, who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer and had little experience as an actress, did not feel capable of performing dialogue, and these passages were revised to cut Hebe's dialogue. Hebe's cut <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> occasionally restored in modern performances.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the protagonists}} are people of few words; thus the <b>dialogues</b> <b>are</b> few and concise. Additionally, since {{much of the}} {{interaction}} is with Mexican people, many parts of <b>dialogues</b> <b>are</b> written in untranslated Spanish.|$|R
25|$|Since {{both the}} European and Japanese {{versions}} opened before Orlando's version was created, the voicecast and <b>dialogue</b> <b>are</b> completely different.

5|$|Maitreyi {{appears in}} ancient Indian texts, {{such as in}} a {{dialogue}} where she explores the Hindu concept of Atman (soul or self) in a dialogue with Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. According to this dialogue, love is driven by a person's soul, and Maitreyi discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity, the core of Advaita philosophy. This Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> the topic of Sureshvara's varttika, a commentary.|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} in a {{neighborhood}} inhabited by hand puppets with human qualities, and is shown from the perspective of Oobi. The puppets frequently communicate with the audience and encourage participatory viewing. The characters' <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> made up of basic vocabulary and they speak in simple sentences. The show is intended to help preschool-aged viewers build skills such as mathematics, early literacy, and logical thinking.|$|E
5|$|An iOS {{version of}} the game, 999: The Novel, was {{developed}} by Spike Chunsoft as the second entry in their Smart Sound Novel series. It was released in Japan on May 29, 2013, and worldwide in English on March 17, 2014. This version lacks the Escape sections of the Nintendo DS version, and features high resolution graphics and an added flowchart that helps players keep track of which narrative paths they have experienced; additionally, <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> presented through speech bubbles, and an extra ending is included.|$|E

50|$|Nazmy {{was born}} in Cairo and {{graduated}} from Cairo University's Faculty of Arts.

This <b>dialogue</b> <b>was</b> published in Al Qahira newspaper.|$|R
5|$|Arkham Asylum {{has also}} been praised for Gaspar Saladino's {{distinctive}} lettering work and giving characters their own fonts. The practice of giving characters customized lettering treatments has since become widespread, especially in DC's Vertigo line and many Marvel comics. Different speech bubbles were used for many characters: Batman's is black with white lettering, Maxie gets blue with a Greek font, while Joker's speech is without a bubble at all; the red, ink-spattered script used for his <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> as ungovernable as the character himself.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have differing {{views on}} whether this <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> {{evidence}} that in ancient Vedic tradition women were accepted as {{active participants in}} spiritual discussions and as scholars of Brahman. Wendy Doniger, an American Indologist {{and a professor of}} History of Religions, states that in this dialogue Maitreyi is not portrayed as an author, but is part of an Upanishadic story of a Brahmin with two wives who are distinguished by their intellect. Karen Pechelis, another American Indologist and a professor of Comparative Religion, in contrast, states that Maitreyi is portrayed as theologically minded, as she challenges Yajnavalkya in this dialogue and asks the right questions.|$|E
5|$|Some enemies move in {{predictable}} {{patterns and}} others hunt the player. They range in resemblance from larva and vultures to spiders. While ascending the mountain, the player passes through themed biomes, such as forest, desert, and snow, and each {{section of the}} mountain introduces new enemies that force the player to modify their strategy. TumbleSeed is depicted in a simple, colorful art style. Its characters are one-eyed, seed-shaped creatures who occasionally have hats. Their <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> visualized with speech bubbles, in text and emoji. Additionally, TumbleSeed includes other features including quests, leaderboards, and daily challenges.|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, two {{empirical}} {{pilot studies}} {{on the role of}} politeness in <b>dialogue</b> summarization <b>are</b> described. In these studies, a collection of four <b>dialogues</b> <b>was</b> used. Each <b>dialogue</b> <b>was</b> automatically generated by the NECA system and the politeness of the <b>dialogue</b> participants <b>was</b> systematically manipulated. Subjects were divided into groups who had to summarize the dialogues from a particular dialogue participant’s point of view or {{the point of view of}} an impartial observer. In the first study, there were no other constraints. In the second study, the summarizers were restricted to summaries whose length did not exceed 10...|$|R
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only {{at the very end}} of the film.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} voice acting in the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E
5|$|While {{incorporating}} gameplay {{elements from}} the original game and generally following the same plot, Sword of Mana has new gameplay mechanics and a much more involved story. It removes elements of the Final Fantasy series present in the original game as a marketing ploy, while adding in gameplay elements and artistic styles from later games in the series. The plot is modified to allow the player to follow the parallel stories of either the hero or the heroine, and the backstory and <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> expanded {{from the original}}. Sword of Mana was produced by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and largely developed by employees of Brownie Brown who had previously worked on the series for Square.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
5|$|Geneforges <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> {{delivered}} through on-screen text. Encounters with intelligent creations or humans {{result in}} the player being given a series of pre-determined questions or responses. Conversation options and the outcome of those conversations change according to the player's previous interactions. as well as which quests have been completed; which items the player has; which group the player belongs to and the player's leadership skill. The player can collect items from defeated enemies and the game environments to improve their own equipment. Non-player characters can trade with the player, buying most items regardless of type. The shopkeeper has a fixed amount of gold {{at the start of}} the game which does not replenish itself. It is possible for the player to drain all shopkeepers of their gold reserves, making it impossible to sell further items.|$|E
5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Man With No Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E
40|$|The {{distinction}} between action persuasion dialogues and deliberation <b>dialogues</b> <b>is</b> not always obvious at first sight. In this paper, we provide a characterisation of {{both types of}} dialogues that draws out the distinctive features of each. It is important to recognise the distinctions since participants in both types of dialogues will have different aims, which in turn affects whether a successful outcome can <b>be</b> reached. Such <b>dialogues</b> <b>are</b> typically conducted by exchanging arguments for and against certain options. The moves of the <b>dialogue</b> <b>are</b> designed to facilitate such exchanges. In particular, we show how the pre- and post-conditions {{for the use of}} particular moves in the <b>dialogues</b> <b>are</b> very different depending upon whether they are used as part of a persuasion over action or a deliberation dialogue. We draw out the distinctions with reference to a running example that we also present as a logic program in order to give a clear characterisation of the two types of <b>dialogues,</b> which <b>is</b> intended to enable them to be used more effectively within systems requiring automated communication...|$|R

5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by clicking on them. Clicking {{on the ground}} causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set to pause automatically at certain times. <b>Dialogue</b> <b>is</b> started by NPCs at certain scripted times, or by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose what to say {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.|$|E
5|$|The version by Aiken {{is perhaps}} the best known stage adaptation, {{released}} {{just a few months}} after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece. Most of Aiken's <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> lifted verbatim from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard. Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film. By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.|$|E
5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once you reach the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is still the same, only the interaction <b>dialogue</b> <b>is</b> affected by your choices.|$|E
