40|$|Excerpt} Organizations {{are often}} {{challenged}} {{to identify and}} resolve workplace problems. The Critical Incident technique gives them a starting point and a process for advancing organizational development through learning experiences. It helps them study “what people do” in various situations. One might think there are no answers to the following questions: How fast can you think on your feet? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>react</b> {{in the face of}} the unexpected? How can you prepare if you cannot predict? And yet, there are. Evidently, some behaviors contribute to the successor failure of individuals—and organizations—in specific situations. And so, responses to the unforeseen lie in identifying before the fact events or circumstances, or series of them, that are outside the range of ordinary human experiences. The questions posed earlier are as old as mankind; but our ability to address them owes largely to the relatively recent work of John Flanagan. These days critical incidents can be harvested to provide a rich, personal perspective of life that facilitates understanding of the issues and obstacles people face every now and then and illuminates avenues for improvement (or replication if outcomes are effective) —avenues that may not be apparent through purely quantitative methods of data collection. This should matter to high-performance organizations...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The project Fear in Public Spaces investigates and {{highlights}} emotions of possible crime in urban context. In cities nowadays {{there are many}} public spaces with anonymous people around you. The word public might be equated with risky. Also, I have a personal experience with crime in public spaces when a man was watching me over a toilet cubicle wall a few years ago. In my individual view, I feel insecure in many public spaces after that experience. My research {{is based on the}} analysis of sequences and details of spaces where I feel anxious. I identified three such places, a toilet cubicle, in front of a subway station ticket machine and the space under a bridge. The goal is to make people aware about possible crimes in a joyful way. As I bring out my fear in a humoristic way, my fear can affect someone like me, but also the humoristic part can give positive affect to people who enjoy public spaces. As an Interior Architect, I explore how public spaces affect us derived from emotions and human behavior. I create spaces by describing crime to the public.

5000|$|Songwriter David John Matthews, {{working in}} Charlottesville, Virginia, as a {{bartender}} at Miller's bar in November 1990, became {{a friend of}} a lawyer named Ross Hoffman. Hoffman convinced the usually reserved Matthews to record a demo of the few songs he had written. Hoffman hoped Matthews could shop the songs in order to find other musicians to perform on some studio work with him. Hoffman encouraged Matthews to approach Carter Beauford, a local drummer on the Charlottesville music scene. Beauford had been in several bands and was then playing on a jazz show on BET. After hearing Matthews' demo, Carter agreed to spend some time playing the drums, {{both inside and outside the}} studio. Matthews also approached LeRoi Moore, another local jazz musician who often performed with the John D'earth Quintet, to join them. Moore skeptically listened to the demo, but liked what he heard and decided that he too would give Matthews a chance. The trio began working on Matthews' songs in 1991. Matthews recollects that, [...] "...the reason I went to Carter was not because I needed a drummer, but because I thought he was the baddest thing I'd ever seen and LeRoi, it wasn't because I desperately wanted a saxophone, it was because this guy just blew my mind. At this jazz place I used to bartend at Miller's, I would just sit back and watch him. I would be serving the musicians fat whiskeys and they'd be getting more and more hosed, but no matter how much, he used to still blow my mind. And it was the sense that everyone played from their heart. And when we got together and they asked, 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want the music to sound like?'

40|$|Individual {{decision}} making {{has been largely}} viewed from an outcome maximizing perspective. Building on previous theoretical works, this paper suggests that individuals consider not only their preferences for different alternatives, but also behavioral rules as guiding principals for their choices. It is further proposed that these rules can be invoked by the situation at hand, and therefore may lead individuals to choose alternatives that fit their rules but not their preferences, and thus to not maximize their happiness. A series of experiments demonstrates that individuals follow such rules; that the rules they follow can be disassociated from their preferences, consequently leading to loss of utility; that monetary exchanges can act as invoking cues for such rules; {{that the use of}} the rules does not arise because of cognitive limitations; that once the rules are invoked they are used; and that rules are used as a first response to the decision problem and can be overridden These findings may explain some of the systematic inconsistencies in the ways consumers behave. 1 Suppose you immensely enjoy smelling the fresh air in the park on the way to work, and even mention this daily to a close friend.

40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of neoclassical economics, individual decision making has been viewed largely from an outcome-maximizing perspective. Building on previous work, the authors suggest that when people make payment decisions, they consider not only their preferences for different alternatives but also guiding principles and behavioral rules. The authors describe and test two characteristics pertaining to one specific rule that dictates that consumers should not pay for delays, {{even if they are}} beneficial: rule invocation and rule override. The results show that money can function as the invoking cue for this rule, that the reliance on this rule can undermine utility maximization, and that this rule may be used as a first response to the decision problem but can be overridden. The article concludes with a discussion of more general applications of such rules, which may explain some of the seemingly systematic inconsistencies in the ways consumers behave. Decisions by Rules: The Case of Unwillingness to Pay for Beneficial Delays Imagine the following scenario: You enjoy smelling the fresh air in the park that you pass on your way to work and mention this enjoyment to a friend. Suppose further that a young entrepreneur overhears your conversation and convinces city hall to charge $. 01 for passage by the park when the flowers are in bloom. How would <b>you</b> <b>react</b> <b>to</b> this new policy? In such a case and despite the high utility of the experience (i. e., breath of fresh air less the cost), many people would refuse to pay merely because they do not believe that anyone should pay for such experiences.
