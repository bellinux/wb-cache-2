50|$|Following the election, {{a series}} of poor export conditions, busted land booms and failed {{financial}} institutions plunged much of eastern Australia into recession. Dooley obtained work as a prospector, miner, farm <b>hand,</b> <b>shearer</b> and carpenter in outback areas of Australia and in New Zealand before moving to Perth, Western Australia in 1897, where he became a coachbuilder for the Railways Department. In 1898, he became a foundation {{member of the state}} branch of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Employees, and took a leading role in obtaining official recognition for the body. Among his achievements were having a Railways Department regulation overturned which forbade political or municipal activity by employees, negotiating a complete classification for all waged staff in the railways. He also helped to negotiate an increase from 7s. to 8s. per day for fettlers, although this measure partly involved a strike which hampered railway traffic for over a week. He was a delegate for the Railway Society to the Trades and Labor Council in 1901-1902.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinching}} process, {{also known}} as “press joining”, is a mechanical joining technique for sheet metal. Its basic principle is to clamp together several metal sheets by an impact extrusion between a punch and a die. The joint is formed by a localized cold plastic deformation.

40|$|The {{influence}} of two variables (moderate shear and calcium chloride concentration) on {{the properties of}} beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) aggregate suspensions obtained by dynamic heat treatment (85 degrees C for 60 s) was studied. Variations in calcium chloride concentration from 5. 1 to 7. 1 mM were imposed, and led to {{major changes in the}} aggregate properties. The characterization of the aggregate size was performed using three distinct methods: laser granulometer, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and focus beam reflectance measurement (FBRM). Viscosity and residual native fraction were also determined. Statistical analysis of experimental data underlines the important combined effect of the two variables and paves the way for new ways of controlling the aggregate functionalities. The calcium chloride concentration has an effect on the entire aggregation process, from native beta-lg to large aggregates.

40|$|Blends of PP and NR were {{prepared}} in a twin screw extruder. Compression molded samples were tested for tensile and impact toughness, and fractoraphic analysis using SEM {{was used to}} define the mechanisms of toughness and ductility. The rubber particles assumed a spherical geometry whose diameters assumed near normal distribution. The averaged particle diameter was 0. 9 μm, 1. 23 μm and 1. 34 μm for the 10 % NR, 20 % NR and 30 % NR, respectively. DSC measurements indicated {{the evolution of a}} low melting crystallographic species whose appearance was associated with the thermal history experienced during processing rather than to the limiting nucleating effects of the NR domains. The blends exhibited up to a five-fold increase in the impact toughness and more than a ten-fold increase in tensile ductility. Fractographic evidence suggested that the observed improvements in the impact toughness were likely associated with a crazing mechanism analogous to that introduced by other elastomers.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, shear design methods for {{concrete}} belt walls reinforced with pre-stressing steel bars (PS belt walls) were developed.

In addition, since the concrete strut rather than PS bars carries significant shear, attention should be paid on the detailing of the nodal zone. On the other hand, vertically and horizontally reinforced PS belt walls failed due to the yielding of PS bars before concrete crushing.

40|$|The band {{structures}} of strained graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are examined by a tight binding Hamiltonian that {{is directly related}} to the type and strength of strains. Compared to the two-dimensional graphene whose band gap remains close to zero even if a large strain is applied, the band gap of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is sensitive to both uniaxial and shears strains. The effect of strain on the electronic structure of a GNR strongly depends on its edge shape and structural indices. For an armchair GNR, uniaxial weak strain changes the band gap in a linear fashion, and for a large strain, it results in periodic oscillation of the band gap. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>shear</b> strain always tend to reduce the band gap. For a zigzag GNR, the effect of strain is to change the spin polarization at the edges of GNR, thereby modulate the band gap. A simple analytical model is proposed to interpret the band gap responds to strain in armchair GNR, which agrees with the numerical results. Comment: 30 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{bone cell}} {{ingrowth}} into synthetic, porous three-dimensional (3 D) implants showed difficulties arising from impaired cellular proliferation and differentiation {{in the core}} region of these scaffolds with increasing scaffold volume in vitro.

For each flow rate the cell viability was measured and compared with results from computer simulations that predict the local oxygen supply and shear stress inside the scaffold based on the finite element method. We found that the local cell viability correlates with the local oxygen concentration and the local shear stress. On the one hand the oxygen supply of the cells in the core becomes optimal with a higher perfusion flow.
