30|$|What {{about the}} middle period? What impact did the post 9 / 11 changes to border {{procedures}} have on day trips prior to the early 2008 changes in document requirements? In this case, our procedure of adjusting the AR(1) projection downwards to adjust for the influence of homicides is almost exactly the same, we subtract (0.0489  +  0.0192)*geomortrate from the AR(1) projection that begins in September of 2001.22 Figure  3 shows the AR(1) projection as a solid line {{and there is a}} dashed line with its <b>downwards</b> <b>adjustment.</b> We can see that there is very little <b>downwards</b> <b>adjustment</b> prior to 2008. That is simply because the homicide rate is very low until 2008. In this case the unadjusted gap between the (log of the) projected values and the (log of the) actual number of day trips is 0.21 (21  %) and the adjusted is 0.17 (17  %). These are averages over the middle period but by December 2007 it had risen to 0.26 (26  %).|$|E
30|$|To {{visualize}} {{the size of}} the problem at hand we have graphed a very simple adjustment to the second projection. This is the short dashed line that begins in the same place as the second projection but lies below it. We have subtracted from the second projection the perverse positive effect of homicides and we have also appealed to the AR(1) regression for the whole span of data (regression one) to tell us how much we should further lower the projection to account for the negative effect of homicides in the late period. 21 So the dashed line is simply the projection less (0.0531  +  0.0192)*geomortalityrate: the first term removes the perversely positive influence of homicides and the second accounts for the negative influence of homicides using the parameter from the full period AR(1). Visually this <b>downwards</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the late period projection is quite significant. It seems to roughly halve the yawning gap between the projection and the number of actual trips.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the G 0 V detached eclipsing binary EW Ori, based on new photometric and spectroscopic observations. Masses and radii that are precise to 0. 9 % and 0. 5 %, respectively, have been established for both components. The 1. 12 Msun secondary component reveals weak Ca II H and K emission and is probably mildly active; no signs of activity are seen for the 1. 17 Msun primary. We derive an [Fe/H] abundance of + 0. 05 +/- 0. 09 and similar abundances for Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, and Ni. Yonsai-Yale and Granada solar-scaled evolutionary models for the observed metal abundance reproduce the components fairly well at an age of approx. 2 Gyr. Perfect agreement is, however, obtained at an age of 2. 3 Gyr for a combination of a) a slight <b>downwards</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the envelope mixing length parameter for the secondary, as seen for other active solar-type stars, and b) a slightly lower helium content than prescribed by the Y-Z relations adopted for the standard model grids. The orbit is eccentric (e = 0. 0758 +/- 0. 0020), and apsidal motion with a 62 % relativistic contribution has been detected. The apsidal motion period is U = 16300 +/- 3900 yr, and the inferred mean central density concentration coefficient, log(k_ 2) = - 1. 66 +/- 0. 30, agrees marginally with model predictions. The measured rotational velocities, 9. 0 +/- 0. 7 (primary) and 8. 8 +/- 0. 6 (secondary) km/s, are in agreement with both the synchronous velocities and the theoretically predicted pseudo-synchronous velocities. Finally, the distance (175 +/- 7 pc), age, and center-of mass velocity (6 km/s) exclude suggested membership of the open cluster Collinder 70. EW Ori now belongs to {{the small group of}} solar-type eclipsing binaries with well-established astrophysical properties. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I analyze how {{the pricing}} {{behavior}} of firms systematically differs across domestic and export markets {{in terms of}} frequency, timing and size of price changes. First, I contrast domestic and export pricing decisions for the same products showing that (i) domestic producer prices change approximately twice as often as export producer prices, (ii) the probability of synchronized price adjustment across markets is 21 % for upwards adjustments and 14 % for <b>downwards</b> <b>adjustments,</b> (iii) the size of export price changes is substantially larger than the size of domestic price changes and (iv) there are strong seasonality effects in the data including a year-end synchronization effect. Second, I show that economic fundamentals such as inflation, productivity, demand, exchange rates and market structure can only partially explain adjustment decisions and cross-market synchronization. Third, I present a dynamic menu cost model of price-setting, and attribute the remaining unexplained part in adjustment decisions to differences in menu costs across countries. I calculate the implied export and domestic market menu costs from the data and estimate that export menu costs are 1. 5 % of period steady state revenues and three times as large as domestic market menu costs...|$|R

40|$|Using the {{asymmetric}} threshold cointegration test {{proposed by}} Enders and Siklos [Enders, W., Siklos, P., 2001. Cointegration and threshold adjustment. Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 19, 166 - 176] and the EC-EGARCH (1, 1) -M model, {{this study examines}} the interest rate pass-through mechanism between the money market rate and the retail interest rate. In addition, we also investigate {{the impact of the}} interest rate volatility on the interest rates of the U. S. and nine Asian countries. We find that the complete pass-through only exists in the U. S. deposit rate. The threshold cointegration test results show that the asymmetric cointegration relation exists in the deposit interest rate in five countries and in the lending rate in three countries. The symmetric cointegration relation exists in two countries. Besides, an estimation of the conditional means using the EC-EGARCH (1, 1) -M model shows that the effect of interest rate volatility on the retail interest rate differs from country to country. Among the eight countries that exhibit asymmetric adjustments in the short run, five of them are found to have upwards rigid adjustments in the deposit interest rate and three <b>downwards</b> rigid <b>adjustments</b> in the lending rate. The empirical results of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines support the hypothesis of collusive pricing arrangements. As to the estimation of the conditional variance, among the seven countries that exhibit asymmetric volatility, the leverage effect in the lending rate exists in two of them.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} urban Colombia’s socio-economic {{development from}} 1978 to 1999, including analysis of income inequality and welfare, {{and the evolution}} of poverty and its determinants. The evidence shows mixed results. First, social progress appears contradictory. Although most of the indicators pertaining to education, health, and infrastructure show substantial long-term improvements during the last two decades, the simultaneous escalation of violence –mostly associated with the illegal drug trade originating in the seventies- has become a substantial social and economic burden deteriorating living conditions in urban Colombia. In addition, extensive economic welfare improvements during the eighties and early nineties were partially reversed in the late nineties when the economy entered into a recession rooted on fiscal imbalances. We find that, from 1978 to 1995, extreme poverty fell by nearly two thirds- and income per capita almost doubled. But the impact of the recent recessive period, with its adverse effects on both the level and distribution of income, pushed economic welfare measures back to late eighties levels. In studying the poverty profile, we find that the typical faces of the poor –e. g., children of all ages, young lower-to-middle-skilled household heads, recent migrants and non-omeowners- have not changed much in the last two decades, but have become more ostensible. Causes and determinants of poverty such as low education endowments and high dependency ratios are becoming more powerful in predicting poverty. We next study how the dynamics of poverty in urban Colombia are linked to economic growth, inequality {{and the evolution of}} basic income per-capita generating factors. We conclude that income per capita growth, rather than changes in the income distribution, explains most of urban poverty dynamics. For the representative household, the key sources of income growth have been the rise in education endowments and the reduction in the dependency ratios. Simultaneously, changes in employment ratios or wages made a positive contribution up to 1995, but had a symmetric and detrimental effect during the recession that followed. However, lowskilled-headed households not only reap the most benefits from lower fertility and more education, but some from higher wages as well. During the economic recession, most of the poverty rise was generated by losses of wage-earning jobs, and the remainder by lower earnings for the selfemployed. Some additional <b>downwards</b> <b>adjustment</b> in average wages was obtained via increasing labor market participation of low-skilled women and a reduction in the wage gender gap. social development...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{critically}} {{examine the}} data {{used to produce}} estimates of the proportion of infants with low birth weight in developing countries and to describe biases in these data. To assess the effect of adjustment procedures on the estimates and propose a modified estimation procedure for international reporting purposes. METHODS: Mothers' reports about their recent births in 62 nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 1990 and 2000 were analysed. The proportion of infants weighed at birth, characteristics of those weighed, extent of misreporting, and mothers' subjective assessments of their children's size at birth were examined. FINDINGS: In many developing countries the majority of infants were not weighed at birth. Those who were weighed {{were more likely to}} have mothers who live in urban areas and are educated, and to be born in a medical facility with assistance from medically trained personnel. Birth weights reported by mothers are "heaped" on multiples of 500 grams. CONCLUSION: Current survey-based estimates of the prevalence of low birth weight are biased substantially <b>downwards.</b> Two <b>adjustments</b> to reported data are recommended: a weighting procedure that combines reported birth weights with mothers' assessment of the child's size at birth, and categorization of one-quarter of the infants reported to have a birth weight of exactly 2500 grams as having low birth weight. Averaged over all surveys, these procedures increased the proportion classified as having low birth weight by 25 %. We also recommend that the proportion of infants not weighed at birth be routinely reported. Efforts are needed to increase the weighing of newborns and the recording of their weights...|$|R
30|$|To {{assess the}} {{magnitude}} of the adjustment costs associated with the average wage, the model’s parameters are estimated. The estimates reveal that labor quality, inferred indirectly from the data on employment, wage bill, and revenue, is an important input of production. Furthermore, there are statistically and economically significant asymmetric adjustment costs. When only the continuing plants are considered, the mean annual cost of average-wage adjustment in any direction constitutes up to 1.6 % of a plant’s revenue at the median of the adjustment cost distribution. For plants adjusting their average wage <b>downwards,</b> the annual <b>adjustment</b> cost claims, on average, up to 3.6 % of revenue. For plants adjusting their average wage upwards, the annual adjustment cost makes up as much as 0.8 % of revenue on average. These shares are much higher when only the exiting plants are considered. A version of the model with both the average-wage and employment adjustment costs is also estimated. A plant {{may not be able to}} adjust its average wage holding employment constant. Similarly, changes in employment can induce changes in the average wage due to changes in the composition of a plant’s labor force. Allowing for both channels of adjustment addresses potential biases due to using only one.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} radiological expertise on screen result decisions in a CT lung cancer screening trial. METHODS: In the NELSON lung cancer screening trial, the baseline CT result {{was based on the}} largest lung nodule's volume. The protocol allowed radiologists to manually adjust screen results in cases of high suspicion of benign or malignant nodule nature. Participants whose baseline CT result was based on a solid or part-solid nodule were included in this study. Adjustments by radiologists at baseline were evaluated. Histology was the reference for diagnosis or to confirm benignity and stability on subsequent CT examinations. RESULTS: A total of 3, 318 participants (2, 796 male, median age 58. 0 years) were included. In 195 participants (5. 9 %) the initial baseline screen result was adjusted by the radiologist. <b>Adjustment</b> was <b>downwards</b> from positive or indeterminate to negative in two and 119 participants, respectively, and from positive to indeterminate in 65 participants. None of these nodules turned out to be malignant. In 9 / 195 participants (4. 6 %) the screen result was adjusted upwards from negative to indeterminate or indeterminate to positive; two nodules were malignant. CONCLUSION: In one in 20 cases of baseline lung cancer screening, nodules were reclassified by the radiologist, leading to a reduction of false-positive screen results. KEY POINTS: • The NELSON study allowed radiologists to manually adjust the screen result • At baseline, radiologists adjusted the result in about one in 20 cases (95. 4 % <b>downwards)</b> • Radiologists' <b>adjustments</b> led to a 22 % reduction of false-positive screen results • Radiologists' expertise can improve nodule classification in addition to a nodule protocol...|$|R
