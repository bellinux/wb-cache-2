40|$|Every year, {{hundreds}} of thousands of patients are affected by treatment failure or adverse drug reactions, many of which could be revented by pharmacogenomic testing. To address these deficiencies in care, clinics require automated clinical decision support through computer based systems, which provide clinicians with patient-specific ecommendations. The primary knowledge needed for clinical pharmacogneomics is currently being developed through textual and unstructured guidelines. In this thesis, it is evaluated whether a web service can annotate clinically relevant genetic variants with <b>guideline</b> <b>information</b> using web services and identify areas of challenge. The proposed tool displays a formal representation of pharmacogenomic <b>guideline</b> <b>information</b> through a web service and existing resources. It enables the annotation of variant call format (VCF) files with clinical <b>guideline</b> <b>information</b> from the Pharmacogenomic Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) and Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). The applicability of the web service to nnotate clinically relevant variants with pharmacogenomics <b>guideline</b> <b>information</b> is evaluated by translating five guidelines to a web service workflow and executing the process to annotate publically available genomes. The workflow finds genetic variants covered in CPIC guidelines and influenced drugs. The results show that the web service could be used to annotate in real time clinically relevant variants with up-to-date pharmacogenomics <b>guideline</b> <b>information,</b> although several challenges such as translating variants into star allele nomenclature and the absence of a unique haplotype nomenclature remain before the clinical implementation of this approach and the use on other drugs...|$|E

40|$|A survey {{conducted}} to determine the information needs of physicians revealed that medical guidelines are regarded as a vital instrument of quality management. Since many physicians lack adequate guideline knowledge, we advocate a process-oriented approach towards the implementation of medical guidelines. We argue that a successful implementation requires the embedding of guideline content into medical and clinical information systems. Thereby, physicians would more likely consider <b>guideline</b> <b>information</b> since they were readily available {{as part of their}} familiar information systems. Furthermore, relevant data stored in information systems can be used to tailor the presentation of guideline content to the physicians actual needs. Additionally, the proposed integration of guidelines within information systems facilitates a guideline-compliant medical documentation.

40|$|Objectives: An {{efficient}} clinical process guideline (CPG) modeling {{service was}} designed that uses an enhanced intelligent search protocol. The {{need for a}} search system arises from the requirement for CPG models {{to be able to}} adapt to dynamic patient contexts, allowing them to be updated based on new evidence that arises from medical guidelines and papers. Methods: A sentence category classifier combined with the AdaBoost. M 1 algorithm was used to evaluate the contribution of the CPG {{to the quality of the}} search mechanism. Three annotators each tagged 340 sentences hand-chosen from the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) clinical guideline. The three annotators then carried out cross-validations of the tagged corpus. A transformation function is also used that extracts a predefined set of structural feature vectors determined by analyzing the sentential instance in terms of the underlying syntactic structures and phrase-level co-occurrences that lie beneath the surface of the lexical generation event. Results: The additional sub-filtering using a combination of multi-classifiers was found to be more effective than a single conventional Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) -based search system in pinpointing the page containing or adjacent to the <b>guideline</b> <b>information.</b> Conclusions: We found that transformation has the advantage of exploiting the structural and underlying features which go unseen by the bag-of-words (BOW) model.

40|$|Psoriasis is a chronic, {{inflammatory}} {{skin disorder}} and approximately 1 % to 3 % of the world’s populations {{are suffering from}} it. As numerous {{studies have shown that}} psoriasis is highly correlated with psychological distresses, one of the critical issues in the psoriasis patient care is the psychological problem. However, in the existing care for psoriasis, no guideline has been developed for patients’ psychological issue. Therefore, the aim of this translational research is to develop an evidence-based psychological care guideline with an implementation and evaluation plan for psoriasis patients in a dermatology setting. In this dissertation, 11 studies were selected after assessing the relevance of the obtained full texts. Data of these studies were extracted, and the quality of data was assessed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Evidences obtained from the literature review were aggregated and also critically reviewed. After these processes, an Evidence Based Protocol was developed. In the <b>guideline,</b> <b>information</b> related to the psychological assessment and interventions for psoriasis are included. Then the implementation potential of the guideline produced was examined in terms of the transferability, feasibility and the cost-benefit ratio. A pilot test was also conducted to identify any problems of the actual implementation of the mentioned guideline. Both process and outcome evaluation would be as used to assess the feasibility and the effectiveness of the guideline. In the end, this guideline isexpected to manage psychological aspects of psoriasis patients so as to improve their quality of life. published_or_final_versionNursing StudiesMasterMaster of Nursin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between knowledge of the current UK physical activity (PA) guidelines and amount of daily PA using a sample population of 11 – 16 year olds in Northern Ireland. Methods Cross-sectional survey data from the 2010 and 2013 Young Persons’ Behaviour and Attitudes Survey of 10, 790 young people provided information on PA, knowledge of guidelines and socio-demographic characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate the associations between knowledge and amount of daily PA. Results Results from 2013 showed 67. 0 % of respondents were aware of PA guidelines with 15. 4 % reporting meeting them. Males were more likely to meet PA guidelines than females (OR 3. 36, 95 % CI 2. 47, 4. 59). Males who were active for 60  min or more, 7  days per week were less likely to be aware of guidelines (OR[*]=[*] 1. 51, 95 % CI 1. 02, 2. 24). For females, knowledge of PA guidelines had no significant association with amount of daily PA (OR[*]=[*] 1. 74, 95 % CI 0. 99, 3. 07). Those who did not enjoy being active were less likely to meet the guidelines (OR[*]=[*] 0. 05, 95 % CI 0. 02, 0. 12). Conclusions Knowledge did not appear to be an important predictor of PA in young people. Consequently, threshold based messaging containing recommended minimum PA <b>guideline</b> <b>information</b> may not be appropriate for this age group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is concern}} about the {{apparent}} lack of uptake of management and referral <b>guideline</b> <b>information</b> by general practitioners (GPs) in their day-to-day consultations with patients. Little is understood about the barriers to the uptake of guidelines as perceived by GPs. AIMS: To explore how GPs gain access to and use guidelines, including computer-based guidelines, in day-to-day consultations with their patients; and to identify the perceived problems and barriers {{to the use of}} guidelines in such situations. METHOD: Postal questionnaires enquiring about the practices and attitudes towards the use of guidelines in general practice were completed by 391 of 600 randomly selected GPs in the South and West NHS region. RESULTS: GPs found guidelines a useful method of accessing expert information. Key factors in their uptake were brevity, an authoritative and unbiased source of evidence, and resonance with the GP's usual practices; they also needed to be flexible enough to incorporate individual viewpoints. Guidelines were perceived as being valuable to enable safe delegation of care to other health professionals and for sharing decision-making with patients. Dissemination of guidelines through the medium of computers was acceptable to the majority of GPs. Virtually all (93 %) responders reported adapting guidelines to the needs of individual patients. Older GPs from non-fundholding practices were least likely to show a positive attitude towards guidelines. CONCLUSION: In principle, there is a very positive attitude towards the use of guidelines in general practice. However, those developing guidelines for use by GPs in the consulting room {{need to be aware of}} the factors that facilitate their use in practice. Educational strategies aimed at increasing the use of guidelines need to take into account the significant proportion who show negative attitudes towards guidelines, whose characteristics have been identified in this study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} half a decade, new forms of {{knowledge}} sharing, collaboration and online participation have emerged. As a result, {{a new generation of}} IT tools are being used for the creation and exchange knowledge. This dissertation uses a knowledge management framework known as the 7 C model and applies a multi-method approach to deepen the understanding on how new knowledge emerges with these tools. As the benefits of knowledge are realized when it is applied, this dissertation places special emphasis also on the usability of the knowledge. The results indicate that the knowledge creation sub-processes of comprehension and conceptualization need more scientific attention. In addition, the results suggest that comprehension can be supported by helping users to reflect and by utilizing <b>guideline</b> <b>information.</b> Supporting deeper interaction and improved linking with the existing content, allowing users to stay in a state of flow, and using decision aids can help in comprehension. Conceptualization can be supported through knowledge rationale, metaphors and analogues, decision aids, and by helping users to reach common ground and shared understanding. In order for the knowledge to be really usable, the knowledge creation should aim at producing knowledge in explicit and actionable form. Producing knowledge in the form of guidelines was found to be beneficial for the utilization of knowledge. Guidelines support learning-by-doing and reflection-in-action, which are crucial for the emergence of new tacit knowledge. Evidence-based information and decision aid tools can help in choosing the knowledge that is to be applied. Finally, the results suggest that in the era of Web 2. 0, many low-cost experiences inducing constant exposure to knowledge might work better than a few high-cost experiences requiring very deep thinking. The {{reason for this is that}} contemporary users seem to be so accustomed to the ease-of-use of Web services that they simply will not use more useful but less usable solutions...|$|E
