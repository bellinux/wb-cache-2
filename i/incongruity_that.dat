The existence of slavery in Enlightened society was an <b>incongruity</b> <b>that</b> had been left unaddressed by European scholars.

2500|$|In Paris, {{his musical}} {{vocabulary}} established, Villa-Lobos {{solved the problem}} of his works' form. It was perceived as an <b>incongruity</b> <b>that</b> his Brazilian impressionism should be expressed {{in the form of}} quartets and sonatas. He developed new forms to free his imagination from the constraints of conventional musical development such as that required in sonata form. The multi-sectional poema form may be seen in the Suite for Voice and Violin, which is somewhat like a triptych, and the Poema da criança e sua mamã for voice, flute, clarinet, and cello (1923). [...] The extended Rudepoêma for piano, written for Rubinstein, is a multi-layered work, often requiring notation on several staves, and is both experimental and demanding. [...] Wright calls it [...] "the most impressive result" [...] of this formal development. The Ciranda, or Cirandinha is a stylised treatment of simple Brazilian folk melodies {{in a wide variety of}} moods. [...] A ciranda is a child's singing game, but Villa-Lobos's treatment in the works he gave this title are sophisticated. [...] Another form was the Chôros. Villa-Lobos composed more than a dozen works with this title for various instruments, mostly in the years 19241929. He described them as [...] "a new form of musical composition", a transformation of the Brazilian music and sounds [...] "by the personality of the composer".|$|E

She did not dislike her brother-in-law, though she admired him scantily, and she pitied him; but she marvelled at the waste involved in some human institutions (the English country gentry for instance) when she perceived that it had taken so much to produce so little. The sweet old wainscoted parlour, the view of the garden that reminded her of scenes in Shakespeare's comedies, all that was exquisite in the home of his forefathers--what visible reference was there to these fine things in poor Lionel's stable-stamped composition? When she came in this evening and saw his small sons making competitive noises in their mugs (Miss Steet checked this impropriety on her entrance) she asked herself what they would have to show twenty years later for the frame that made them just then a picture. Would they be wonderfully ripe and noble, the perfection of human culture? The contrast was before her again, the sense of the same curious duplicity (in the literal meaning of the word) that she had felt at Plash--the way the genius of such an old house was all peace and decorum and the spirit that prevailed there, outside of the schoolroom, was contentious and impure. She had often been struck with it before--with that perfection of machinery which can still at certain times make English life go on of itself with a stately rhythm long after there is corruption within it.|$|E

6000|$|If Deerslayer {{was startled}} by this {{unexpected}} arrival, well knowing that the quick witted girl could claim none of that exemption from the penalties of captivity that was so cheerfully accorded to her feebler minded sister, he was equally astonished at the guise in which she came. All her ordinary forest attire, neat and becoming as this usually was, had been laid aside for the brocade that has been already mentioned, and which had once before wrought so great and magical an effect in her appearance. Nor was this all. Accustomed to see the ladies of the garrison in the formal, gala attire of the day, and familiar with the more critical niceties of these matters, the girl had managed to complete her dress {{in a way to}} leave nothing strikingly defective in its details, or even to betray an <b>incongruity</b> <b>that</b> would have been detected by one practised in the mysteries of the toilet. Head, feet, arms, hands, bust, and drapery, were all in harmony, as female attire was then deemed attractive and harmonious, and the end she aimed at, that of imposing on the uninstructed senses of the savages, by causing them to believe their guest was a woman of rank and importance, might well have succeeded with those whose habits had taught them to discriminate between persons. Judith, in addition to her rare native beauty, had a singular grace of person, and her mother had imparted enough of her own deportment to prevent any striking or offensive vulgarity of manner; so that, sooth to say, the gorgeous dress might have been worse bestowed in nearly every particular. Had it been displayed in a capital, a thousand might have worn it, before one could have been found to do more credit to its gay colours, glossy satins, and rich laces, than the beautiful creature whose person it now aided to adorn. The effect of such an apparition had not been miscalculated. The instant Judith found herself within the circle, she was, in a degree, compensated for the fearful personal risk she ran, by the unequivocal sensation of surprise and admiration produced by her appearance. The grim old warriors uttered their favorite exclamation [...] "hugh!" [...] The younger men were still more sensibly overcome, and even the women were not backward in letting open manifestations of pleasure escape them. It was seldom that these untutored children of the forest had ever seen any white female above the commonest sort, and, as to dress, never before had so much splendor shone before their eyes. The gayest uniforms of both French and English seemed dull compared with the lustre of the brocade, and while the rare personal beauty of the wearer added to the effect produced by its hues, the attire did not fail to adorn that beauty in a way which surpassed even the hopes of its wearer. Deerslayer himself was astounded, and this quite as much by the brilliant picture the girl presented, as at the indifference to consequences with which she had braved the danger of the step she had taken. Under such circumstances, all waited for the visitor to explain her object, which to most of the spectators seemed as inexplicable as her appearance.|$|E

40|$|One Acupuncture”, like “One Medicine”, has the {{potential}} to improve research quality and clinical outcomes. However, while human acupuncture point locations have remained largely consistent over time, the veterinary versions remain imprecise and variable. Establishing anatomical criteria for veterinary acupuncture atlases in keeping with the human template will create congruence across species, benefiting both research and practice. Anatomic criteria for points based on objectively verifiable structures will facilitate translational research. Functionally comparative innervation, in particular, should be similar between species, as the nerves initiate and mediate physiologic changes that result from point stimulation. If researchers choose points that activate different nerves in one species than in another, unpredictable outcomes may occur. Variability in point placement will impede progress and hamper the ability of researchers and clinicians to make meaningful comparisons across species. This paper reveals <b>incongruities</b> <b>that</b> remain between human and veterinary acupuncture points, illustrating the need to analyze anatomical characteristics of each point to assure accuracy in selecting transpositional acupuncture locations...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{an examination of}} the main international, regional and national legal regimes regulating marine renewable energy in England and Wales.

Against a backdrop of climate change mitigation, the key findings show that despite the presence of political will for offshore renewable energies, MRE development faces a number of legal obstacles, all of which seek to protect other important public and private interests.

40|$|People {{continuously}} {{experience the}} world and the objects in it through all their senses. Product designers can influence the way people experience products by paying attention to the multiple sensory aspects of product design. Designing sensory experiences can be aimed at communicating a consistent message to all sensory channels, making this message a stronger one. The opposite approach, designing a product in a way that incongruent information is provided to different senses, {{can be used as a}} means to create surprising products. Perceiving one sensory aspect of a product first can create an expectation on what will be perceived through other sense modalities. The information perceived at a later stage may disconfirm the expectation formed upon the initial perception, resulting in a surprise reaction. In this thesis, three types of sensory incongruities were studied: visual-tactual, visual-auditory and visual-olfactory. Our studies suggest that out of the three types of <b>incongruities</b> <b>that</b> were studied, visual-tactual incongruities in products are most effective in evoking surprise reactions. Furthermore, the surprise reaction seems to have a long-term effect on 3 other emotions: interest, fascination and confusion.

Nevertheless, the sound of a product can in some cases influence the overall perceived expression of that product. Designers should always carefully consider whether to design a sensory incongruity or a product that communicates a consistent message to all sensory channels. Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
