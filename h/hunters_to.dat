5|$|Singapore was an {{enthusiastic}} operator of the Hunter, first ordering the aircraft in 1968 during a massive {{expansion of the}} city-state's armed forces; deliveries began in 1971 and were completed by 1973. At the time, considerable international controversy was generated as Britain (and, as was later revealed, the U.S.) had refused to sell <b>Hunters</b> <b>to</b> neighbouring Malaysia, sparking fears of a regional arms race and accusations of favouritism. The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) eventually received 46 refurbished <b>Hunters</b> <b>to</b> equip two squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Non-military use of {{camouflage}} includes making cell telephone towers less obtrusive {{and helping}} <b>hunters</b> <b>to</b> approach wary game animals. Patterns derived from military camouflage are frequently used in fashion clothing, exploiting their strong designs and sometimes their symbolism. Camouflage themes recur in modern art, and both figuratively and literally in science fiction and works of literature.|$|E
5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known. This has led vampire <b>hunters</b> <b>to</b> mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} {{estimating}} the pressure (in lieu of direct measurements) {{is the fact}} that most of these storms did not threaten land. As Kenna and Patricia were threatening land, their pressures were measured by Hurricane Hunters using dropsondes. While Hurricane Ava never threatened land, it too was flown into by Hurricane <b>Hunters</b> <b>to</b> test equipment and conduct research.|$|E
5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many <b>hunters</b> <b>to</b> catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the Swiss Air Force {{performed}} an extensive evaluation of several aircraft for a prospective purchase; competitors included the North American F-86 Sabre, the Folland Gnat, and the Hawker Hunter; {{a pair of}} Hunters were loaned to the Swiss for further trials and testing. In January 1958, the government of Switzerland chose to terminate their independent fighter aircraft project, the in-development FFA P-16, instead choosing to order 100 <b>Hunters</b> <b>to</b> replace their existing fleet of de Havilland Vampire fighters. Further development of the indigenous P-16 was discontinued. This initial order for 100 single-seat Hunters consisted of 12 refurbished RAF F.6s, and 88 new-built F.58s.|$|E

5|$|In August 2007, the Lebanese Armed Forces {{planned to}} put its Hunters back into service {{following}} the 2007 Lebanon conflict, to deal with Fatah al-Islam militants in the Nahr el-Bared camp north of Tripoli. The programme was delayed by lack of spare parts for the aircraft, such as cartridges for the Martin-Baker ejection seats. On 12 November 2008, 50 years after its original introduction, the Lebanese Air Force returned four of its eight <b>Hunters</b> <b>to</b> service with 2nd Squadron, based at Rayak AB: one two-seater and three single-seaters. Military exercises were conducted with Hunters, {{such as those that}} took place on 12 July 2010. The Hunters were retired from service during 2014.|$|E
5|$|Several {{thousand}} animal {{bones were}} discovered in Mummy Cave. While {{the large majority of}} the bones could not be identified, researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) were able to determine the biological origins of over two thousand bones. As at many other archeological sites in the region, significant numbers of Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and deer from the genus Odocoileus were identified. Of particular interest to biologists was the much larger number of sheep than deer: eighty-eight sheep and fifteen deer were identified. Such a prevalence of sheep over deer is highly unusual for archeological sites in the region, because deer are equally or more plentiful in areas such as the one in which Mummy Cave is located. This anomaly has led researchers at UTEP to propose that the site was used as a home base for <b>hunters</b> <b>to</b> operate at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved {{the relationship between}} the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The 1996 Treasure Act is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake {{in the value of the}} discovery. The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure <b>hunters</b> <b>to</b> report finds, and considers the needs of museums and scholars.|$|E

5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty <b>hunters</b> <b>to</b> come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behaviour. It {{is believed to have}} been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing <b>hunters</b> <b>to</b> pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It {{is believed to have been}} rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.|$|E
5|$|Between 1964 and 1975, both Britain and France {{delivered}} significant {{quantities of}} arms, including <b>Hunters,</b> <b>to</b> Iraq. The Hunters {{were far more}} effective in fighting guerrilla activity than the Russian MiG-17s then operated by Iraq. In 1967, Hunters of the Iraqi Air Force saw action after the Six-Day War between Israel and several neighbouring Arab nations. During the War of Attrition Iraqi Hunters usually operated from bases in Egypt and Syria. While flying a Hunter from Iraqi Airbase H3, Flight Lieutenant Saiful Azam, on exchange from the Pakistan Air Force, shot down three Israeli jets including a Sud Aviation Vautour and a Mirage IIICJ. Some missions were also flown by the Royal Jordanian Air Force, {{but most of the}} Jordanian Hunters were destroyed on the ground {{on the first day of}} the Six-Day War. Replacement Hunters for Jordanian service were acquired from both Britain and Saudi Arabia in the war's aftermath. These were used with considerable success in ground attacks against Syrian Army tanks during the Black September Crisis.|$|E

5|$|During the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, {{some of the}} Hunters {{were used}} by {{military}} officers {{as part of the}} effort to successfully overthrow the socialist president of Chile, Salvador Allende, on 11 September 1973. On 10 September 1973, coup leaders ordered the <b>Hunters</b> <b>to</b> relocate to Talcahuano in preparation. The following morning, the aircraft were used to conduct bombing missions against the presidential palace, Allende's house in Santiago, and several radio stations loyal to the government. The UK had signed contracts prior to the Chilean coup d'état for delivery of a further seven Hunters, as well as performing engine overhauls and the delivery of other equipment. The government under Prime Minister James Callaghan delayed the delivery of the aircraft, along with vessels and submarines also on order; the trade unions took action to block delivery of refurbished Hunter engines at the East Kilbride plant until October 1978. The action was led by Rolls Royce workers, Bob Fulton, Robert Sommerville and John Keenan, who hid the engines in the factory. The Government of Chile bestowed on 16 April 2015, its highest civilian medal the Order Bernardo O'Higgins Medal on the three workers for their action of solidarity. In 1982, after the Falklands War, a number of Hunters were air freighted to Chile as part of the arrangements for providing support for UK operations in the South Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits hunting, but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing <b>hunters</b> <b>to</b> attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, the Siberian tiger was on {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia. As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the Soviet Union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of Russia collapsed. The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male). Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and NGO's in concert with international organisations, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince <b>hunters</b> <b>to</b> tolerate the big cats. Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers. In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity. However, in a decade later, the Siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.|$|E
