40|$|When {{building}} a performance analysis tool, one usually needs to select an <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engine</b> {{for a specific}} programming language. <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>engines</b> commonly traverse an internal, mostly non-portable program representation in order to insert probes that collect performance information during execution of an instrumented program. Performance analysis tools are built on non-standardized <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engines,</b> which forces performance tools to develop separate interfaces to <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engines</b> and adjust to different intermediate program representations, one for every different <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engine.</b> In {{the context of the}} Apart working group, we designed a unique intermediate program representation named SIR as an XML-language, which we propose as a standard to be used by a large variety of performance analysis tools. The basic idea of SIR is to provide a standardized intermediate program representation that must be supported by a large variety of <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engines</b> covering the most important programming languages. SIR has been defined thus far for Fortran, C, C++, and Java thus we demonstrated that SIR comprises both procedural and object-oriented programming languages. Through a SIR, performance analysis tools no longer have to adjust to different program representations for every different <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engine.</b> Moreover, in combination with a standardized instrumentation request language, a comprehensive interface between performance analysis tools and <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engines</b> is described. ...|$|R

50|$|The cockpit {{containing}} the flying officers {{were provided with}} numerous controls and features; {{to the left of}} the first pilot were the controls for the auto-pilot and a P.4 compass, who was also provided with a beam approach indicator (to aid nighttime landings) and DF visual loop indicator in addition to the standard flight controls. Switches for the flaps and position indicators were located on a central panel set between the two pilots, while the master fuel cocks were set above these on the roof; throttle and mixture controls were also normally positioned between the pilots. Only limited <b>engine</b> <b>instrumentation</b> was provisioned for, such as engine speed indicators and boost gauges.|$|E
50|$|The flight {{instrumentation}} system {{is composed of}} a primary instrumentation package and an auxiliary package. The primary package instrumentation measures those parameters critical to all engine static firings and subsequent vehicle launches. These include some 70 parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds, and valve positions for the engine components, with the capability of transmitting signals to a ground recording system or a telemetry system, or both. The {{instrumentation system}} is designed for use throughout {{the life of the}} engine, from the first static acceptance firing to its ultimate vehicle flight. The auxiliary package is designed for use during early vehicle flights. It may be deleted from the basic <b>engine</b> <b>instrumentation</b> system after the propulsion system has established its reliability during research and development vehicle flights. It contains sufficient flexibility to provide for deletion, substitution, or addition of parameters deemed necessary as a result of additional testing. Eventual deletion of the auxiliary package will not interfere with the measurement capability of the primary package.|$|E

40|$|An {{internal}} combustion engine was instrumented in view of developing automatic diagnosis methods based on the analysis of PV diagrams. The pressure signal is unstable over successive cycles. Consequently, pressure must be averaged over several consecutive cycles to produce valid data. Due to instrumentation problems the data obtained was insufficient to allow the development of diagnostics. The investigation reported in this work is thus limited {{to the development of}} a microprocessor-based system for the acquisition of pressure-volume data on high speed, spark ignition {{internal combustion}} <b>engines.</b> Several <b>instrumentation</b> problems were identified and solutions applied or proposed.

The aircraft also had split flaps, which doubled as speed brakes.|$|R
40|$|Software code caches are {{increasingly}} being used to amortize the runtime overhead of tools such as dynamic optimizers, simulators, and <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engines.</b> The additional memory consumed by these caches, along with the data structures used to manage them, limits the scalability of dynamic tool deployment. Inter-process sharing of code caches significantly improves the ability to effi-ciently apply code caching tools to many processes simultaneously. In this paper, we present a method of code cache sharing among processes for dynamic tools operating on native applica-tions. Our design also supports code cache persistence for im-proved cold code execution in short-lived processes or long initial-ization sequences. Sharing raises security concerns, and we show how to achieve sharing without risk of privilege escalation and with read-only code caches and associated data structures. We evalu-ate process-shared and persisted code caches implemented in the DynamoRIO industrial-strength dynamic <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engine,</b> where we achieve a two-thirds reduction in both memory usage and startup time...|$|R
40|$|Optical fiber {{systems are}} {{becoming}} more prevalent in both commercial and military aircraft, finding applications in niche area where the properties of optical fibers are essential. However, the application of optical fibers to all aircraft systems, in particular fly-by-light, is of significant interest.

40|$|A {{demonstration}} of the ability of an existing optical fiber cable to survive the harsh environment of a rocket engine was performed at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The intent of this demonstration was to prove the feasibility of applying fiber optic technology to rocket <b>engine</b> <b>instrumentation</b> systems. Extreme thermal transient tests were achieved by wrapping a high temperature optical fiber, which was cablized for mechanical robustness, around the combustion chamber outside wall of a 1500 lb Hydrogen-Oxygen rocket engine. Additionally, the fiber was wrapped around coolant inlet pipes which were subject to near liquid hydrogen temperatures. Light from an LED was sent through the multimode fiber, and output power was monitored {{as a function of}} time while the engine was fired. The fiber showed no mechanical damage after 419 firings during which it was subject to transients from 30 K to 350 K, and total exposure time to near liquid hydrogen temperatures in excess of 990 seconds. These extreme temperatures did cause attenuation greater than 3 dB, but the signal was fully recovered at room temperature. This experiment demonstrates that commercially available optical fiber cables can survive the environment seen by a typical rocket <b>engine</b> <b>instrumentation</b> system, and disclose a temperature-dependent attenuation observed during exposure to near liquid hydrogen temperatures...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{calibration}} {{of a model}} representing a real small turbojet engine is presented. The development of the model {{was based on a}} modular general approach using adaptive modeling principles. Calibration of the model was implemented by exploiting its adaptive features and using part of the extended measurement set provided for the <b>engine</b> <b>instrumentation.</b> Certain problems regarding data acquisition were pointed out and the source for their existence was discussed. Validation of the model was performed through comparison of predicted and experimental data. Although initial results of the simulation may be considered promising it became evident the need for further model refinements. The instrumented engine as well as the simulation model developed will be valuable educational tools for the students in our department. Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} fuzzy {{modelling}} approach oriented {{to the design}} of a fuzzy controller for regulating the fresh airflow of a real diesel engine. This strategy has been suggested for enhancing the regulator design that could represent an alternative to the standard embedded BOSCH controller, already implemented in the Engine Control Unit (ECU), without any change to the <b>engine</b> <b>instrumentation.</b> The air system controller project requires the knowledge of a dynamic model of the diesel engine, which is achieved by means of the suggested fuzzy modelling and identification scheme. On the other hand, the proposed fuzzy PI controller structure is straightforward and easy to implement with respect to different strategies proposed in literature. The results obtained with the designed fuzzy controller are compared to those of the traditional embedded BOSCH controller. © 2009 S. Simani and M. Bonfè...|$|E
