5|$|The Senedd was {{constructed}} in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was {{handed over to the}} National Assembly in February 2006. Between phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the project's management structure, but retained Rogers as the scheme architect. The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late, compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks, and because the National Assembly did not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> cost appraisal of the project until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6% over budget, and that phase was six months late.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent,</b> {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E

25|$|Pitch accent (tone accent) is {{a feature}} of certain {{languages}} whose variations in pitch (linguistic tones) {{can be used to}} differentiate words, but the potentially distinctive tones are restricted to one or two syllables within a word. This contrasts with fully-tonal languages like Standard Chinese in which each syllable can <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> tone. In a pitch accent language, the syllable with phonemic tone is typically acoustically prominent (stressed). Also, many words may not be marked for tone at all.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Quarter {{is in the}} {{northwest}} (south of Victoria Station and northeast of Piccadilly Gardens) and {{is known as a}} hub for alternate and bohemian culture in Manchester. Previously the area was the retail heart of the city centre but {{with the opening of the}} Manchester Arndale in the 1970s patronage gradually dwindled and vacant buildings were commonplace. In the late 1980s the area was renamed as the Northern Quarter in the hope that the area would be reincarnated from the ground up. Following the boom of the late 90s and early 2000s the area has become a popular destination for shops, bars, restaurants and nightclub – many of which <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> ethos.|$|E

25|$|The Australian Flying Corps were {{involved}} in the First World War as part of the Army. Following the establishment of the Royal Air Force in 1918, Australia's Minister for Defence, Senator George Foster Pearce, appointed the Swinburne Committee to report on the needs of military aviation. Australia's involvement in the Imperial defence strategy inevitably placed its senior military commanders in a position subordinate to their British counterparts, and as its starting point the Committee accepted the strategy's basis that Australia's security would continue to be based on sea power. The committee found that while they supported the establishment of an air service, they rejected any suggestion that it should <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> role. Any Australian air force would exist solely to support the sea and land forces.|$|E
25|$|According to verse 4:32 of Islam's sacred text, {{both men}} and women <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> {{economic}} position: 'For men is a portion of what they earn, and for women is a portion of what they earn. Ask God for His grace. God has knowledge of all things.' Women therefore are at liberty to buy, sell, mortgage, lease, borrow or lend, and sign contracts and legal documents. Additionally, women can donate money, act as trustees and set up a business or company. These rights cannot be altered, irrespective of marital status. When a woman is married, she legally has total control over the dowerthe mahr or bridal gift, usually financial in nature, while the groom pays to the bride upon marriageand retains this control in the event of divorce.|$|E
25|$|Between 1035 and 1814, the Faroes {{were part}} of the Hereditary Kingdom of Norway. In 1814, the Treaty of Kiel granted Denmark control over the islands, along with two other Norwegian island possessions: Greenland and Iceland. The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing country within the Kingdom of Denmark since 1948. The Faroese have control of most {{domestic}} matters. Areas that remain the responsibility of Denmark include military defence, the police department, the justice department, currency and foreign affairs. However, as they {{are not part of the}} same customs area as Denmark, the Faroe Islands <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> trade policy and can establish trade agreements with other states.
