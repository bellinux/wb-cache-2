5|$|Ahead of the preseason, then interim-head coach Ben Olsen assumed head {{coaching}} duties, under {{a three-year contract}} for an undisclosed price. Olsen became the first head coach in franchise history to both play for and coach the squad. Upon retiring as a player on 24 November 2009 Olsen became an assistant coach under head coach Curt Onalfo. On 7 August 2010 Olsen was named interim head coach after Onalfo was fired. Olsen finished the 2010 season with a 3–8–1 record. Several major offseason acquisitions were made, in both the offense and defense. Notable signings included Charlie Davies on loan, Perry Kitchen, Dax McCarty and Josh Wolff. In the summer, a major trade was made when United traded McCarty to their Atlantic Cup rivals, New York Red Bulls, for Dwayne De Rosario. During the MLS regular season, United regularly <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the league's overall table, frequently swapping positions barely in or outside of a berth in the MLS Cup Playoffs. Ultimately, their playoff run ended in the 33rd week of the campaign, culminating a six-match winless streak, that included five consecutive losses.|$|E

25|$|The Chiefs {{hosted the}} 5–8 Chargers on December 14, hoping {{to end their}} slim playoff chances.

The Chiefs {{dominated}} the game early, leading 14–3 at halftime. Chiefs quarterback Tyler Thigpen threw for one touchdown and ran for another for the Chiefs and was 19-for-28 for 171yards.|$|E

25|$|At 18:00 two RAAF UH-1B Iroquois piloted by Flight Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Frank Riley arrived over D Company's {{location}} {{with the}} ammunition resupply, and guided by red smoke thrown by the infantry, they <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heavy rain {{just above the}} rubber trees near a small clearing. Because {{they were to be}} dropped from some height, the wooden outer crates—which were still banded with metal straps—were wrapped in blankets for the wounded. Aboard the helicopters the 6 RAR Regimental Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer Class One George Chinn, and the officer commanding Administration Company, Major Owen O'Brien, pushed the crates out to the soldiers waiting below, many of whom were now very low on ammunition. The boxes landed in the centre of the position and the RAAF pilots were later praised for their skill and daring. Riley was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, while Dohle was mentioned in despatches (MiD). Yet, without tools to cut the straps, the infantry had to smash the crates open using machetes or the butts of their rifles to get to the inner metal boxes. Under heavy fire Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, the Company Sergeant Major, and Sergeant Neill Rankin, the 12 Platoon sergeant, began to distribute the ammunition. However, while the machine-gun rounds were pre-loaded in belts, the rifle rounds were still in bandoliers, complicating Kirby's job and forcing the soldiers to reload their own magazines as they struggled to keep the ammunition clean in the mud and rain. The resupply retrieved the situation for D Company. Prior to its arrival they had been down to their last 100 rounds, but with it complete the Australians resumed firing, forcing the Viet Cong back for a third time.|$|E

Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-thirties; the average for his entire second term was 37percent, according to Gallup.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Diefenbaker called an {{election}} for June 18, 1962, {{the party had}} been damaged by loss of support in Quebec and in urban areas as voters grew disillusioned with Diefenbaker and the Tories.

Bennigsen ordered his army to retreat on the evening of 7 June. The Russian commander repulsed Napoleon at the Battle of Heilsberg on 10 June. But at Friedland the French emperor won the decisive battle of the war on 14 June 1807, which led to the Peace of Tilsit.|$|E

2500|$|The Toda {{people are}} a small {{pastoral}} tribal community {{who live on the}} isolated Nilgiri plateau in hill country of Southern India. Before the 18th century and British colonisation, the Toda coexisted locally with other ethnic communities, including the Kota, Badaga and Kuruba, in a loose caste-like society, in which the Toda were the top ranking. During the 20th century, the Toda population has <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range 700 to 900. Although an insignificant fraction of the large population of India, since the early 19th century the Toda have attracted [...] "a most disproportionate amount of attention because of their ethnological aberrancy" [...] and [...] "their unlikeness to their neighbours in appearance, manners, and customs." [...] The study of their culture by anthropologists and linguists proved significant in developing the fields of social anthropology and ethnomusicology.|$|E

2500|$|At 11:30p.m. on April 5, 1934, before {{reaching}} Penang, Sato was found missing by his compatriot Jiro Yamagishi. The {{last time he}} was seen was at 8:30p.m. when he had dinner in his cabin. [...] He left two suicide notes, one to his Japanese tennis teammates expressing doubts that {{he would be able to}} help the team in the upcoming contest. He begged them to forgive him and do their best to prevail in the match. He promised he would be with his colleagues in spirit. [...] The other note was addressed to the ship's captain, apologizing for the inconveniences that his actions might cause. A search for him continued for seven more hours and the vessel <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strait. Wireless messages were sent to nearby ships. Later further evidence was found which confirmed the suicide theory. Two iron davit-winding handles and a training skip-rope were missing, which Sato probably used to tie weights on himself to make sure he would drown. After discovery of the new evidence, the ship sent out a radio message stating that [...] "Japan's finest tennis player and national hero was believed to have committed suicide by throwing himself overboard". On April 6, a prayer was ministered by his friends who assembled on the deck of the ship. An altar was built on board with photographs and racquets of Sato around it. [...] Also a traditional Japanese [...] "cake offering" [...] ceremony was held. [...] It was speculated that the pressure on him came from the growing prestige of the Japanese Empire and from the Japanese Lawn Tennis Association who refused to allow the exhausted Sato to have a break from tennis and skip the 1934 season. He became depressed and concerned about his abilities.|$|E
