40|$|Abstract—Backscattering of <b>electrons</b> in {{depressed}} <b>collectors</b> has {{a significant}} effect on the collector efficiency and other performance parameters. We have studied these phenomena using our code BSCAT. It allows for tracking of multiple generations of backscatter by a representative set of trajectories without going to an excessively large number of them. By examining the trajectories and the impact angles of incoming rays, it is possible to modify the geometry of the electrodes, such that the effects of backscatter are minimized. In particular, we have studied the effects of using an undulating surface of the collector, and analyzed its effects taking into account the effect on angles of incidence of impacting rays. Using as a test vehicle a two-stage depressed collector for a 1. 5 -MW 110 -GHz gyrotron, we have thus been able to increase the estimated collector efficiency from 62 % to 65 %. We present these results along with data on other performance parameters such as the heat-dissipation profile. We discuss the potential for application of the approach to other devices operating at different frequencies and power levels.

40|$|Abstract. Successful {{operation}} of the BNL EBIS with electron current up to 10 A provides optimism that EBIS operation with even higher electron current should be possible. We are now considering key aspects of the design for an EBIS operating with electron current 20 A. Several technical problems need to be resolved, including generation of a 20 A electron beam and dissipation of this electron beam power on the <b>electron</b> <b>collector.</b> Since {{we already have a}} tested concept of electron beam generation with the gun immersed in a magnetic field and subsequent purely magnetic compression of the electron beam, it makes sense to develop the new electron gun with immersed cathode but with higher perveance. To distribute the electron beam power {{on the surface of the}} <b>electron</b> <b>collector</b> more evenly, the emission current density from the cathode can be made bell-shaped with minimum close to zero on the periphery of the electron beam. With the already high requirements to the emission current density, and since such shaping of the electron beam makes these requirements even higher, perhaps the only available cathode material that can satisfy these requirements is IrCe. The problems of power dissipation on the <b>electron</b> <b>collector</b> (EC) include heat removal with cooling water and fatigue of the EC material. The first step in the EC design was electron beam transmission simulation with the goal to reduce “spikes ” of power density on EC surface as much as possible. With the geometry of EC thus defined, the conditions of heat exchange for several modes of EBIS operation have been analyzed and cooling parameters, which provide adequate heat removal were found. The last step was stress analysis of several EC materials with ANSYS to find the material suitable for this application. Details of the 20 A electron gun and collector are presented...|$|E
