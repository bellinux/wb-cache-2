25|$|On flight day 8, the Cupola was {{successfully}} moved from its launch location to its permanent {{location on the}} earth facing side of Tranquility. Cupola was moved by the space station robot arm (SSRMS), which was operated by Kay Hire and Terry Virts. ISS commander Jeff Williams assisted them by releasing the bolts and hooks that held the Cupola in place and then securing it to its new home. The process was slightly delayed due to some bolts that were torqued tighter than expected on the ground, but flight controllers were able to increase the torque to release the bolts. Once the move of the Cupola was complete, outfitting continued to get the cupola ready. The crew {{will be able to}} ingress <b>it</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> but the window covers will not be opened until after the third and final spacewalk. While the Cupola relocation was going on, some of the crew members participated in transferring items between the shuttle and station. Also during this time Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick prepared the tools that they will use during the final spacewalk scheduled for flight day 10. During this time the pair re-sized another spacesuit on station for use by Behnken. This was done because the suit Behnken had been using had some problems with its communications equipment.|$|E
500|$|Räikkönen was demoted to from fifth to eighth {{place for}} causing the final lap {{collision}} with Bottas and scored only four points rather than ten, and this secured the constructors championship for Mercedes. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso {{was given a}} five-second penalty for exceeding track limits, promoting Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen to tenth. When asked about the collision with Bottas {{at the press conference}} for the following United States Grand Prix, Kimi Räikkönen remained unregenerate, saying: [...] " [...] hasn't changed. There were some discussions. I would still do <b>it</b> <b>tomorrow</b> again, that doesn't change the story." [...] Bottas took a different viewpoint, saying: [...] "I don't think it was a racing incident. I didn't see anyone there and I was in front, and then suddenly someone hits me. I should be on the podium, but I'm here with zero points instead. That's just disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|Forty-five {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three could {{qualify for the}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Kahne clinched the 20th pole position of his career, {{with a time of}} 30.525 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Edwards. McMurray qualified third, Bill Elliott took fourth, and A. J. Allmendinger started fifth. Johnson, David Reutimann, Mark Martin, David Ragan and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten. Hamlin only managed 37th, having getting close to the wall. The two drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Patrick Carpentier, and Michael McDowell. Once the qualifying session completed, Kahne commented, [...] "That was the best qualifying run by far since I joined Red Bull. I look forward to Sunday’s race. It’s going to be exciting being up front now, being in the mix with Denny , Kevin [...] and Jimmie [...] They’re all going to be fast throughout the race. I’m just glad we are so far. Hopefully we can stick with <b>it</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> have a good practice and be competitive in the mix on Sunday." ...|$|E

Khorkina said, [...] "I thought she could win the gold. I'm glad I could give her that opportunity." [...] She then won the uneven bars final with a score of 9.862. Commenting on the {{all-around}} final, Khorkina said, [...] "If I didn't get over the disappointment, I wouldn't be Khorkina. I wouldn't be standing here with the gold medal. It still hurts a lot. It was cruel to all the participants, to vault on a nonstandard height. It's quite possible to get killed. The five centimeters could decide {{the future of a}} sports person. But I was fortunate to have many people to help me get through <b>it.</b> <b>Tomorrow,</b> I will dance for Russia. I will leave what happened on the vault far behind me, like the North Pole."
