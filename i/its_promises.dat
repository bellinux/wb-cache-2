5|$|On 30 March, Nasser proclaimed a {{manifesto}} stipulating {{the restoration of}} civil liberties, greater parliamentary independence from the executive, major structural changes to the ASU, and a campaign to rid the government of corrupt elements. A public referendum approved the proposed measures in May, and held subsequent elections for the Supreme Executive Committee, the ASU's highest decision-making body. Observers noted that the declaration signaled an important shift from political repression to liberalization, although <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> would largely go unfulfilled.|$|E
25|$|In a statement, Rovers accused Sainsbury's of {{breaking}} <b>its</b> <b>promises.</b> It described {{the decision as}} a 'kick in the teeth' {{for the people of}} Bristol. The club claimed that it was abundantly clear throughout the case that Sainsbury's reneged on <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> to the local community to invest in the region and showed a flagrant disregard for the terms of the contract.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, 1940, the Soviets {{offered a}} better {{anchorage}} point for Basis Nord at nearby Iokanga Bay. However, the German capture of Norway decreased {{the need for}} operations at Basis Nord, and it became more important {{as a symbol of}} cooperation than a base for significant operation. In April 1940, the Soviet Union withdrew <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> given with regard to Basis Nord.|$|E
25|$|For {{a leader}} who was popularly swept into power in 2002 on an anti-corruption platform, Kibaki's tenure saw graft scandals where {{hundreds}} of millions of shillings were siphoned from public coffers. Kibaki's National Rainbow Coalition — which took power from the authoritarian rule of Daniel arap Moi—was welcomed for <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> of change and economic growth, but soon showed that it was better suited to treading established paths.|$|E
25|$|In {{a repeat}} of Japanese wartime {{monetary}} policy, the government defaulted on <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> to redeem its banknotes in silver or gold coin while promising to maintain the two-to-one peso to dollar parity. This decision, compounded with the deliberate overprinting of fiat banknotes, resulted in the peso dropping in value by almost 67% against the US dollar within the first three hours of opening day. The government effort to maintain the peg devastated the gold, silver and dollar reserves of the country.|$|E

25|$|This was {{observed}} when Communist and socialist leaders in Italy defended the Czech coup {{as a victory}} for democracy, rationalizing that the violation of civil rights was a necessary and just response to a reactionary threat posed by Western imperialist (i.e., American) interests; such discourse probably damaged the Front's credibility and undercut <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> of moderation. Kennan cabled to suggest the PCI should be outlawed and the U.S. should intervene militarily in the likely event of a civil war, but he quickly softened his line.|$|E

In 2006 TPF {{announced that they}} would be reproducing two popular 90's era Williams machines, Medieval Madness and Cactus Canyon.

25|$|Article 49(1) of the Constitution, {{which is}} the {{provision}} governing by-elections in Singapore today, does not stipulate a time limit within which a vacant parliamentary seat must be filled. During the 2008 parliamentary debate, the Prime Minister asserted that he had discretion to decide when a by-election should be called, if at all. He described the legal framework as his Government understood it as facilitating the efficient execution of the Government's policies, because political parties rather than individual candidates exist as the fundamental elements of the government. The {{focus is on the}} party delivering <b>its</b> <b>promises,</b> and because a vacancy in Parliament does not affect a party's mandate to rule, the vacancy need not be filled before the next general election. In 2013, the Court of Appeal held in Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v. Attorney-General (2013) that this was an incorrect interpretation of Article 49(1).|$|E

25|$|The {{agreement}} {{would only be}} meaningful if it was put into action, regardless of Thich Tinh Khiet's announcement to his disciples that it heralded a new era. This required the monks {{to return to their}} normal lives and government and its officials to implement <b>its</b> <b>promises.</b> Many protesters arrested in the past remained in jail contrary to the communiqué's promises. After the deadly riot occurred only a day after the signing of the communique, the crisis steepened as more Buddhists began calling for a change of government and younger monks such as Thích Trí Quang began to come to the forefront, blaming Diệm for discontent that was hindering the effort against the Vietcong. Due to the failure of the agreement to produce the desired results, the older and more senior monks, who were more moderate, saw their prestige diminished, and the younger, more assertive monks began to take a more prominent role in Buddhist politics.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{appeared}} {{first in}} Tampa, Florida {{where he became}} a reporter, likely for the Florida Reporter. In 1911 he moved to St. Augustine, Florida where he was manager of the Magnolia Remedy Company which distributed curative salves and potions to tourists and others from the North who migrated to Florida {{during the winter months}} for health reasons. While in St. Augustine, he wrote two political tracts, “Removing the Mask” and “Backward Steps” which were popular themes from his earlier writing when he was claiming that the Republican Party was hypocritical and was retreating from <b>its</b> <b>promises.</b> In 1912, Taylor was the editor of the Daily Promoter of Jacksonville and in 1917 became the editor of the “Black Star” edition of the Florida Times-Union, the state’s largest newspaper. He also was active in Jacksonville’s Young Men’s Christian Association, {{was a member of the}} Board of Commissioners for Jacksonville’s Masonic lodges, and maintained an office in Walker National Business College, one of the nation’s largest Black technical colleges.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the American Revolution, First Nations {{assisted}} King George III's North American forces, who ultimately lost the conflict. As a result of the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1783 between King George and the American Congress of the Confederation, British North America was divided into the sovereign United States (US) and the still British Canadas, creating a new international border through some of those lands that had been set apart by the Crown for First Nations and completely immersing others within the new republic. As a result, some Aboriginal tribes felt betrayed by the King and their service to the monarch was detailed in oratories that called on the Crown to keep <b>its</b> <b>promises,</b> especially after nations that had allied themselves with the British sovereign were driven from their lands by Americans. New treaties were drafted and those indigenous nations that had lost their territories in the United States, or simply wished to not live under the US government, were granted new land in Canada by the King.|$|E

25|$|Naseemuddin Siddiqui, Munquad Ali (Rajya Sabha MP) and Ram Achal Rajbhar were {{appointed}} {{to form a}} strategy to consolidate the Dalits, Most Backward Castes (MBCs) and Muslim votes. On 9 September, Mayawati questioned the announcement of Dearness Allowance (DA) by the central government just before the election and again accused the RSS and its affiliated Sangh Parivar organisations of using the 2011 national census for fear mongering against Muslim population growth for sectarian purposes, {{as well as to}} divert attention from such issues as the alleged failure of the central government to deliver on <b>its</b> <b>promises.</b> She added that the census also showed positive signs such as the sex ratio among Muslims is 951 females to 1,000 males, which is higher than the national average and indicated a slowing of the Muslim population growth rate. On 10 September, she called for the deployment of central forces in large numbers on electoral duty to assure a free and fair election and further asked the ECI to keep a watch on possible sectarian ploys by the BJP.|$|E
25|$|In Slattery (Meritor Savings) v. U.S., {{after losing}} before {{a three-judge panel}} of the Federal Circuit, the {{government}} petitioned for a rehearing en banc. The court has agreed to review whether the trial court had the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the breach of contract dispute. The government is further arguing that the FDIC is Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI), an agency created by the executive branch that receives no funding, and will not receive any funding, from the government. The FDIC receives funding by charging banks fees to member banks. If the en banc court agrees and finds that appropriated funds {{may not be used}} to pay judgments against NAFI's, then any judgment in the Meritor Savings case will be produced by the banks regulated by the FDIC and not by Treasury dollars. In other words, the FDIC could be found to be in breach, but it would be entitled to recover the judgment by member banks. In order to find the FDIC a NAFI, the government is arguing that Congress has no obligation to honor <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> to back deposits with the full faith and credit of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Relations between Brazil and the United States were {{strained}} {{over the}} recruiting of United States seamen for Brazilian warships through fraud and coercion. United States citizens were enticed onto Brazilian ships {{and after the}} end of their voluntary enlistment period were forced to stay. Raguet became exhausted with how the Brazilian government never followed up <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> to investigate the complaints. The issue only got worse as United States merchant ships were seized by Brazil for attempting or intending to bypass the blockade. The crews of the ships were often manipulated into Brazilian service or imprisoned. Tensions over the issue continued to rise particularly after a US Navy commander, backed by force, procured the release of two detained Americans. Eventually the Brazilian Navy ordered all ships to immediately surrender all improperly detained United States citizens. Despite the order, Raguet was increasingly frustrated with what he felt was Brazil's purposeful delay in processing detained United States ships and citizens. After receiving approval from Secretary of State Henry Clay on his efforts, Raguet was emboldened and his notes to the Brazilian government became more forceful and undiplomatic.|$|E
