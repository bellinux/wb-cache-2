50|$|<b>Dacetuzumab</b> (also {{known as}} SGN-40 or huS2C6) is a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody being {{developed for the}} treatment of CD40-positive cancers like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and hematological malignancies.|$|E
40|$|This first-in-human, phase I study {{evaluated}} the safety, maximum-tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of <b>dacetuzumab</b> in 44 patients with advanced multiple myeloma. Patients received intravenous <b>dacetuzumab,</b> either in 4 uniform weekly doses (first 4 cohorts) or using a 5 -week intrapatient dose escalation schedule (7 subsequent cohorts; the last 3 cohorts received steroid pre-medication). An initial dose of 4 mg/kg <b>dacetuzumab</b> exceeded the maximum-tolerated dose for uniform weekly dosing. Intrapatient dose escalation with steroid pre-medication appeared {{effective in reducing}} symptoms of cytokine release syndrome and the maximum-tolerated dose with this dosing schema was 12 mg/kg/week. Adverse events potentially related to <b>dacetuzumab</b> included cytokine release syndrome symptoms, non-infectious ocular inflammation, and elevated hepatic enzymes. Peak <b>dacetuzumab</b> blood levels increased with dose. Nine patients (20 %) had a best clinical response of stable disease. The observed safety profile suggested that <b>dacetuzumab</b> may be combined with other multiple myeloma therapies. Two combination trials are ongoing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Developing {{the right}} drugs {{for the right}} {{patients}} has become a mantra of drug development. In practice, {{it is very difficult}} to identify subsets of patients who will respond to a drug under evaluation. Most of the time, no single diagnostic will be available, and more complex decision rules will be required to define a sensitive population, using, for instance, mRNA expression, protein expression or DNA copy number. Moreover, diagnostic development will often begin with in-vitro cell-line data and a high-dimensional exploratory platform, only later to be transferred to a diagnostic assay for use with patient samples. In this manuscript, we present a novel approach to developing robust genomic predictors that are not only capable of generalizing from in-vitro to patient, but are also amenable to clinically validated assays such as qRT-PCR. Methods Using our approach, we constructed a predictor of sensitivity to <b>dacetuzumab,</b> an investigational drug for CD 40 -expressing malignancies such as lymphoma using genomic measurements of cell lines treated with <b>dacetuzumab.</b> Additionally, we evaluated several state-of-the-art prediction methods by independently pairing the feature selection and classification components of the predictor. In this way, we constructed several predictors that we validated on an independent DLBCL patient dataset. Similar analyses were performed on genomic measurements of breast cancer cell lines and patients to construct a predictor of estrogen receptor (ER) status. Results The best <b>dacetuzumab</b> sensitivity predictors involved ten or fewer genes and accurately classified lymphoma patients by their survival and known prognostic subtypes. The best ER status classifiers involved one or two genes and led to accurate ER status predictions more than 85 % of the time. The novel method we proposed performed as well or better than other methods evaluated. Conclusions We demonstrated the feasibility of combining feature selection techniques with classification methods to develop assays using cell line genomic measurements that performed well in patient data. In both case studies, we constructed parsimonious models that generalized well from cell lines to patients. </p...|$|E
