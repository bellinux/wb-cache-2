McAfee and McMillan show that the extent of collusion is tied to availability of transfers. Monetary transfers allow cartels to extract full surplus.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EconomicsPhilip G. GayleThis {{dissertation}} constitutes two {{essays in}} the field of industrial organization. Specifically, the research focuses on empirically assessing the market effects of airline alliances. The first essay examines how codesharing, a form of strategic alliances, by airlines affects market entry decisions of potential competitors. Researchers have written extensively on the impact that strategic alliances between airlines have on airfare, but little is known of the market entry deterrent impact of strategic alliances. Using a structural econometric model, this essay examines the market entry deterrent impact of codesharing between incumbent carriers in U. S. domestic air travel markets. We find that a specific type of codesharing between market incumbents has a market entry deterrent effect to Southwest Airlines, but not other potential entrants. Furthermore, we quantify the extent to which market incumbents’ codesharing influences market entry cost of potential entrants. The second essay examines the effects of granting Antitrust Immunity (ATI) to a group of airlines. Airline alliance partners often want to extend cooperation to revenue sharing, which effectively implies joint pricing of their products (<b>explicit</b> price <b>collusion).</b> To explicitly collude on price, airlines must apply to the relevant government authorities for ATI (U. S. Department of Justice and Department of Transportation in the case of air travel markets that have a U. S. airport as an endpoint), which effectively means an exemption from prosecution under the relevant antitrust laws. Whether consumers, on net, benefit from a grant of ATI to partner airlines has caused much public debate. This essay specifically investigates the impact of granting ATI to oneworld alliance members on their price, markup, and various measures of cost. The evidence suggests that the grant of ATI facilitated a decrease in partner carriers’ marginal cost, and increased (decreased) their markup in markets where their service do (do not) overlap. Furthermore, member carriers’ price did not change (decreased) in markets where their services do (do not) overlap, implying that consumers, on net, benefit in terms of price changes...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the theoretical literature on cartel formation, organizational structure, and destabilization in Cournot competitive markets. Cartel formation in Cournot competitive markets may take place as a sequential process even if the merger paradox applies. This conclusion was reached after giving up the assumption of symmetric information in cartel formation processes: {{it is assumed that}} outside firms are not informed about new cartel agreements and face a time lag by adjusting to changing behavior of some of the market participants. Furthermore, an extension to the standard cartel stability models is presented to capture the influence of communication and organizational structure in a cartel by modeling cartels as social networks. Despite the fact that communication in cartels is costly because contacts between members might be detected by antitrust authorities, it is shown that intensive contacts are possibly stabilizing within a cartel. Both aspects, {{the costs and benefits of}} communication in cartels, contribute to the players' valuation of collusion and therefore change cartel stability conditions. Additionally, this model accounts for the influence of leniency programs and fines. A theoretical explanation is given for differences between <b>explicit</b> and tacit <b>collusion</b> on the basis of this network model. Additionally, this dissertation examines whether collusive behavior might be deterred in vertical structures if dominant firms are allowed to apply specific discount schemes. It is shown that the profit maximizing behavior of a monopolistic upstream firm might lead to the deterrence of collusive behavior of downstream firms if the upstream firm is allowed to implement all-units discount schemes. All-units discounts, despite the fact that they are sometimes considered anticompetitive, possess welfare improving effects that are not generally shared by other pricing schemes.

Moreover, they tend to communicate more often as they become less patient, a cartel grows in size, or demand uncertainty rises...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{manufacturers}} of vitamins admitted to participating in international market-share-agreement cartels {{for several years}} during the 1990 s.

These differences are consistent with our model of price announcements where we account for the importance to the cartel of buyer acceptance of, or resistance to, a price increase. Acceptance avoids costly market-share reallocations among members of an explicit cartel.

The dynamics undergoes a transition at a specific value of the strategy update rate, above which an emergent cartel organization is observed, where sellers have similar values of below optimal value for money. This cartel organization is not due to an <b>explicit</b> <b>collusion</b> among agents; instead it arises spontaneously from the maximization of the individual payoffs. This dynamics is marked by large fluctuations and a high degree of unpredictability for most of the parameter space, and serves as a plausible qualitative explanation for observed elevated levels and fluctuations of certain commodity prices. ...|$|E

In this private monitoring setting, tacit collusion involves price wars on the equilibrium path if a firm cannot infer from its low sales whether the realisation of market demand was unluckily low or whether at least one rival has undercut the collusive price. In contrast, <b>explicit</b> <b>collusion</b> involves firms secretly forming an illegal cartel to share their private information to avoid such price wars, but this {{runs the risk of}} sanctions.

40|$|Tacit {{collusion}} or tacit coordination, {{as opposed}} to <b>explicit</b> <b>collusion,</b> means that firms in a market collude without communicating directly, and thus {{without being able to}} make an explicit agreement to do so. Tacit collusion is difficult to prove since there will be no written agreement to use as evidence, which casts some doubt on whether it actually exists. Since the welfare consequences of collusion are important irrespective of whether collusion is tacit or explicit, finding out more about whether and when tacit cartels can be expected to occur should be important for policy. A successful tacit cartel, like any cartel, must solve two problems: (i) The members must agree on a cartel price and on an allocation mechanism which determines how much each member produces. (ii) The members must have a method of discovering a member who is cheating by selling more than their share. It seems likely that it is more difficult to agree on price and output without communicating directly. Discovering cheating depends on receivin...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{measures}} of market structure used by economists, {{such as the}} Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI), give a misleading picture of the competitiveness of electric power markets, since these metrics do not consider the special properties of electricity as a commodity. The notion of a “pivotal supplier ” is better-suited to the electric power industry; one or more players are pivotal {{if they have the}} ability to blackout an area by withholding generating capacity. Our analysis of pivotal oligopolies in California, PJM, and New York finds that all three of these markets are far less competitive than their HHIs would suggest. Even without <b>explicit</b> <b>collusion,</b> groups of suppliers are able to influence prices through strategic bidding behavior. We also evaluate five candidate market-power mitigation systems within the context of these three power systems. The cost of capacity expansion, either through new generation or transmission, will increase costs past the point of efficiency savings from restructuring. Additional transmission will also be ineffective without competitively-priced imports. Price caps and forced divestiture will likely decrease system operating efficiency. Long-term contracts will not mitigate market power unless the contract terms are sufficiently long and can be structured to efficiently distribute risk. We also find that different mitigation schemes have very different cost and effectiveness implications for different power systems; no one solution should be applied to every operating area...|$|E
