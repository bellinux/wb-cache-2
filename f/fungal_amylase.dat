40|$|This work {{established}} a procedure for commercial <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase</b> usage as indicator of enzyme inhibitors presence in cereals, intending to screening antifungal resistance properties in cereals. Firstly, the inhibitive effects of oat, wheat and rice protein extracts were assessed against different amylase sources.

The best conditions for inhibitor-extract-enzyme interaction were established (pH, temperature, starch concentration). Inhibition kinetic allowed their classification as mixed inhibitors. A high quocient (1. 7) was observed between enzyme inhibition and Fusarium graminearum multiplication reduction. Fungamyl ® amylase demonstrated its potential to detect the protein inhibitor presence in different cereals and might be employed in screening natural resistance to fungal contamination.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} pelleting temperatures on {{the activity of}} cellulase, bacterial amylase, <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase,</b> and pentosanase were tested. Samples of a commercial barley-wheat-soybean diet containing different enzyme preparations were pelleted at 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 C (pellet temperature measured at the die outlet) through a die containing holes 2. 5 mm in diameter. Enzymatic analyses were conducted on either soluble substrates or by measuring {{the ability of the}} tested enzymes to decrease the viscosity of the diet. Measurements made on soluble substrates suggest that cellulase, <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase,</b> and pentosanase maintained activity when being pelleted at temperatures up to 80 C and bacterial amylase maintained activity at temperatures up to 90 C. Pentosanase and amylases showed little or no effect on the viscosity of the diet. Cellulase addition decreased the viscosity at all temperature levels, even after being pelleted at 90 and 100 C (P < 0. 05). No cellulolytic activity was detected on the soluble substrate after these pelleting temperatures. Measurements on a soluble substrate might therefore not always reflect the true stability of a preparation because the ability of a carbohydrase to decrease the viscosity of the digesta is important to its effect in the gastrointestinal tract. Measurements on soluble substrates suggest that cellulase, <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase,</b> and pentosanase can be pelleted at temperatures up to at least 80 C and bacterial amylase up to 90 C without a considerable loss in analyzed activit...|$|E
40|$|This {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between exposure to wheat flour, soya flour and <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase</b> and the development of work-related symptoms and sensitization in bread and cake bakery employees who have regular exposure to these substances. The study populations consisted of 394 bread bakery workers and 77 cake bakery workers whose normal jobs involved the sieving, weighing and mixing of ingredients. The groups were interviewed with the aim of identifying the prevalence, nature and pattern of any work-related respiratory symptoms. They were also skin-prick tested against the common bakery sensitizing agents, i. e., wheat flour, soya flour, rice flour and <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase.</b> The results of personal sampling for sieving, weighing and mixing operations at the bakeries from which the study groups were taken were collated in order to determine typical exposures to total inhalable dust from the ingredients, expressed as 8 hour time-weighted average exposures.

40|$|Background Occupational {{allergen}} {{exposure assessment}} usually requires airborne dust sampling at the worksite followed by dust extraction and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) analysis at the laboratory. Use of semiquantitative lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) may allow a more rapid detection procedure with direct on-site demonstration of a bioallergen exposure hazard. Objective In a field study, we evaluated a recently developed LFIA for fungal alpha-amylase, an important bakery allergen. Methods Airborne and surface dust (wipe) samples and samples from flours and baking additives {{used at the}} workplace were collected in 5 industrial bakeries and tested in the LFIA for <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase.</b> For comparison, amylase was measured in sample eluates with the reference EIA method. Results Sensitivity of the LFIA was 1 to 10 ng/mL, and of EIA, 25 pg/mL. In LFIA, most flour samples, 84 % of wipe samples, 26 % of personal airborne dust, {{and none of the}} 26 ambient air dust samples produced a visible reaction. Wipe samples from dough-making areas and flour samples gave the strongest reactions. All extracts with > 5 ng allergen per milliliter showed a positive LFIA reaction. Conclusion The LFIA for <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase</b> is an easy and rapid method to demonstrate the allergen directly at the worksite in less than 10 to 20 minutes. Similar LFIA methods may be used for other occupational allergens in other work environments. Clinical implications Lateral flow immunoassays for occupational allergens may be of great value in occupational hygiene surveys to demonstrate directly to workers and supervisors the hazards of work-related bioallergen exposure...|$|E
40|$|This study {{involved}} {{the application of}} response surface methodology to recover amylase-inhibiting protein fractions from oats, rice and wheat, {{in order to promote}} strategic procedures {{to reduce the risk of}} fungal contamination.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and their relationship to sensitization to wheat flour allergens and <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase,</b> in a group of workers from the UK flour milling industry. A cross-sectional study was used to evaluate symptoms, using a structured interview technique, and sensitization, using skin prick test findings, from 679 employees in flour milling and packing operations at 18 flour mills. A total of 147 workers (147 / 679, 22 %) described upper respiratory tract symptoms of some kind. In the majority (139 / 147, 95 %) these symptoms were of an occasional or transitory nature and were related to short-term exposures to high levels of dust. Three individuals (3 / 679, 0. 4 %) were identified whose symptoms were thought to be the result of allergy to wheat flour. The prevalence of positive skin prick tests to wheat flour allergens and to <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase</b> was 1. 2 % (8 / 678) and 0. 9 % (6 / 678), respectively. Measurements of total inhalable dust exposure for personnel exposed to flour dust were taken at 10 of the sites (116 samples). For production personnel the levels were typically between 1 and 10 mg/m 3 (8 -h time weighted average), with a median of 6. 2 mg/m 3. Hygiene operatives had appreciably higher exposure than production personnel, with a median of 18. 7 mg/m 3. Overall, 43 % (50 / 116) of all samples exceeded 10 mg/m 3 (8 -h time weighted average). The findings suggest that the risk of sensitization to wheat flour allergens from current dust exposures in flour mills is very low. Wheat allergy was responsible in only a small proportion of the total who had respiratory symptoms. The principal causation of symptoms experienced by the workforce was considered to be a non-specific irritant effect related to short-term exposures to high levels of total inhalable dust...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{the levels of}} exposure to fungal alpha-amylase in British bakeries and flour mills, and to {{describe the}} relation between exposure to alpha-amylase and sensitisation to <b>fungal</b> alpha- <b>amylase.</b> METHODS: 495 personal flour dust samples were taken in seven British bakeries and flour mills and analysed for alpha-amylase with an immunoassay. Workers at the sites were asked to fill out questionnaires on work related symptoms, smoking history, and work history, and they were skin prick tested with common allergens and fungal alpha-amylase to assess sensitisation. RESULTS: Exposure to high concentrations of alpha-amylase occur in a few areas of British bakeries and flour mills, and there can be considerable differences in exposures to alpha-amylase between sites and between exposure groups, and even within similar exposure groups from different sites. Exposure to the highest concentrations of alpha-amylase {{was found in the}} dispensing and mixing areas of the bakeries (geometric mean (GM) 39. 7 ng/m 3). Exposure to alpha-amylase showed only a moderate correlation with concentrations of dust (r = 0. 42) and flour aeroallergen (r = 0. 46). The results also showed a relation between exposure to alpha-amylase and sensitisation to fungal alpha-amylase (prevalence ratio (PR) for medium exposure 3. 9, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 8 to 20. 2, PR for high exposure 9. 9, 95 % CI 2. 8 to 34. 6) compared with the low exposure category). Atopic subjects had an increased risk of sensitisation, but this was not significant. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that exposure to alpha- amylase is a considerable health risk in British bakeries and flour mills. A small proportion of workers are exposed to alpha-amylase at concentrations that result in high rates of sensitisation. A reduction in exposure to alpha-amylase is likely to reduce this risk...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{demonstrating the}} development, validation, and {{application}} of prediction models for occupational lung diseases. Prediction models are developed to estimate an individual’s probability of the presence or future likelihood of occurrence of an outcome (i. e. disease of interest or its related condition). These models are used to assist clinical decision making for individuals, or to stratify individuals into risk groups with a different likelihood for developing disease or with disease severity. In this thesis {{the development of a}} diagnostic model is described to detect sensitization to wheat allergens among bakery workers. This model made use of questionnaire items only. Secondly a more generic model was developed for sensitization to high molecular weight allergens in bakery workers (exposed to wheat and or <b>fungal</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> allergens) and laboratory animal workers (exposed to rat and or mouse urinary allergens). The third diagnostic model included questionnaire items and lung function test results to predict the probability of having chest X-ray changes indicative for pneumoconiosis in Dutch construction workers exposed to silica dust. All diagnostic models were transformed into easy-to-use scoring systems to facilitate their application in practice. These diagnostic models enable objective and standardized quantification of the probability of having or developing disease without performing (invasive) advanced and costly reference test. We also developed prognostic models for occurrence of occupational sensitization and respiratory symptoms in apprentices in animal health technology. The prognostic value of questionnaire items, skin-prick tests, and bronchial challenge to methacholine, as a single test or in combination with others, was assessed. Another element in the thesis was to assess the generalizability of a prediction model. Different statistical approaches were used to externally validate a questionnaire model for sensitization to LA allergens -developed in Dutch workers- in Canadian animal health technology apprentices. A new model was eventually developed in Canadian apprentices and compared to the original Dutch model. Model revision was done to evaluate if inclusion of new predictors from the Canadian setting could improve the performance of the original model. Finally the application of a diagnostic model for occupational sensitization is described in a surveillance program for respiratory diseases in baking and flour-producing industries in the Netherlands. The diagnostic model was applied in 5, 325 Dutch bakery and flour and enzyme exposed workers. This chapter illustrates how a diagnostic model may improve the efficiency of surveillance programs. After assuring that a model is valid and produces accurate predictions, it is important to determine probability cut-off points to stratify individuals into risk categories. The choice for a cut-off point must be based on the balance between the proportion of missed cases and reduction of unnecessary diagnostic tests. This thesis shows that predicting lung diseases in the context of occupational health care and practice is possible. The use of the prediction tools assists the decision making process and would hopefully reduce expenses. Application of prediction models has not been fully explored but efforts to increase the use of predictive models deserve strong support...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of natural antifungal substances {{is motivated by}} the need for alternatives to existing methods that are not always applicable, efficient, or that do not pose risk to consumers or the environment. Furthermore, studies on the behaviour of toxigenic species {{in the presence of}} natural fungicides have enabled their safe application in the food chain.

30|$|The enzyme 1, 4 -α-D-glucan glucohydrolase (GGH, EC 3.2. 1.3) is an exo-amylase which cleaves both α- 1, 4 and α- 1, 6 glycosidic bonds, {{yielding}} β-D-glucose {{from the}} non-reducing end of starch polymer chain. GGH degrades starch to glucose in theoretically 100 % yields. The reaction rate decreases with the decreasing chain {{length of the}} dextrin substrate. The enzyme is also capable of catalysing a reverse of the normal hydrolysis reaction to produce mainly maltose and isomaltose (Rangabhashiyam et al. 2011). It has wide range of applications in industries {{for the production of}} dextrose, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and ethanol (Rubinder et al. 2002). With the advent of new frontiers in biotechnology, the spectrum of enzyme applications has widened in many other fields, such as clinical, medicinal and analytical chemistries, and in textile, food, detergent, paper, backing, wine, brewing, distilling and fine chemical industries. Earlier, it was considered that plant and animal materials were the best sources of enzymes. Nowadays, however, microbial enzymes are becoming increasingly important for their technical and economic advantages (Kelly and Fogarty 1976; Kumar and Satyanarayana 2009). A diverse group of microorganisms has been reported to produce the enzyme. However, commercial enzyme has traditionally been produced by employing filamentous fungi, since they secrete large quantities of extracellular enzyme. The production of an active enzyme depends on the selection of a suitable mould for the purpose. Fungal GGH contains both starch binding and catalytic binding domains, the former being responsible for activity on raw starch (Karaoglu and Ulker 2006). The soil is known to be a repository of <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase</b> producers; Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma, Fusarium and Rhizopus spp. have been isolated and characterized. However, not even a single comprehensive report has appeared in the available literature dealing with the growth kinetics, mycelial morphology and parametric significance analysis through statistical factorial design. Furthermore, it is also imperative to screen useful fungi for manufacturing of desired product (Oshoma et al. 2010).|$|E

Two {{different}} wheat flours were prepared into tortillas using laboratory-scale, commercial equipment with fixed processing parameters. Dough and tortilla properties were evaluated using subjective and objective methods. Tortillas were stored in plastic bags at 22 ????C for evaluation. The effects of nine enzymes (amyloglucosidase 1, amyloglucosidase 2, bacterial 1, bacterial 2, fungal, maltogenic 1, maltogenic 2, malted barley and xylanase) on quality of wheat flour tortillas were evaluated. Dough absorption was adjusted to attain uniform dough for tortillas. Enzyme addition to tortilla flour did not significantly affect tortilla weight, moisture and pH. Bacterial 2 amylase extended shelf stability while maltogenic 1 and xylanase exhibited smaller improvements in shelf stability and other tortilla properties. Addition of 0. 05 activity unit bacterial 2 amylase improved tortilla diameter and improved tortilla shelf life from 12 to 28 days. Maltogenic 1 at 280 ppm improved tortilla diameter, opacity and shelf life. Addition of 100 ppm of xylanase effectively improved tortilla diameter and shelf life. Bacterial 1 amylase at 60 ppm improved tortilla diameter but did not improve shelf stability. Amyloglucosidase 2, maltogenic 2 and malted barley amylase did not improve tortilla quality at any of the evaluated levels. Amyloglucosidase 1 and <b>fungal</b> <b>amylase</b> reduced overall tortilla quality at all the evaluated levels. Bread-making quality of wheat flour is correlated with the damaged starch present in the flour.
