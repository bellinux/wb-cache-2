40|$|In {{this paper}} thermal and {{hydraulic}} optimization {{of water to}} water chevron type plate heat exchanger is presented. The optimization is performed using the multi objective genetic algorithm in MATLAB optimization environment. Constrain matrix {{is a set of}} different geometrical parameters of plate heat exchanger within the logical bounds. The two objective functions are pressure drop of hot side and heat transfer. Due to conflicting nature of these objective functions, no single solution can satisfy both of the objective function simultaneously. The increase in heat transfer will results in increase in pressure drop, therefore, optimization results are presented as Pareto Front. Multi objective genetic algorithm tool was employed to find a set of optimum solution which was trade-off between pressure drop and heat transfer. At the end, sensitivity analysis was performed to analyse the effect of geometrical parameters of heat exchanger on thermal and hydraulic performance. The sensitivity results show that the heat transfer and pressure drop are greatly affected by the vertical port centre <b>distance,</b> <b>plate</b> spacing and number of thermal plates...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} highly anisotropic nanostructured thin film ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC) media with porosity and architecture engineered using the glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) process. Our anisotropic structures resemble nanoblades, producing channel-like features that partially decouple analyte migration from development direction, offering new separation behaviours. Here we study GLAD-UTLC plate performance in terms of migration <b>distance,</b> <b>plate</b> number, retention factor and a figure of merit specific to GLAD-UTLC, track deviation angle. Migration distances increase with porosity {{by a factor of}} two for all feature orientations (up to a maximum of 22. mm) over the range of porosities considered in this study. Plate numbers approaching 1100 are observed for GLAD-UTLC plates when the nanoblade features are aligned with the development direction. We present a theoretical model describing mobile phase flow in anisotropic GLAD-UTLC media, and find good agreement with experimental results. Our plates provide channel features that reduce transverse spot broadening while providing the wide pores required for rapid migration and high separation performance. These improvements may enable a greater number of parallel separations on miniaturized GLAD-UTLC plate formats. Their small sizes should also make them compatible with the Office Chromatography concept in which office peripherals (inkjet printers and flatbed scanners) replace conventional TLC instruments. Equipped with {{a better understanding of the}} unique GLAD-UTLC elution behaviours, we expect to further improve performance in the future. 9 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Purpose: In {{the article}} {{a state of}} the {{question}} concerning stresses in brazing joints of different physical and mechanical properties was appraised as well as possibility of their decrease due to use of different techniques from technological experiments to numerical methods. Evaluation of microstructure and mechanical properties of large dimensional vacuum brazed joints of WC – Co and Ferro Titanit Nicro 128 sinters and precipitation hardened stainless steel of 14 – 5 PH (X 5 CrNiMoCuNb 14 - 5) using copper and silver – copper as the brazing filler metal. Design/methodology/approach: Microscopic examinations with the use of scanning electron microscope (SEM) were performed to establish microstructure and diffusion influences on creation of intermetallic phases in the joint. Shear strength Rt and tensile strength Rm of the joints have been defined. It have been state, that the basic factors decreasing quality of the joint, which can occur during vacuum brazing of the WC - Co ISO K 05 sinter – Cu or Ag - Cu brazing filler metal – 14 - 5 PH steel joints are diffusive processes leading to exchange of the cermets and brazing filler metal elements and creation of intermetallic in the joint. It can have an unfavourable influence on ductility and quality of the joint. Findings: Results of numerical calculations of two-dimensional models of brazed joints for different sizes of surfaces brazed at a constant width of solder gap are presented. Particular attention was paid to stresses occurring in joints of large brazing surfaces. Results of the investigate proved that joints microstructure and mechanical properties depend on filler and parent materials, diffusion process during brazing, leading to exchange of the cermets components and filler metal as well as joint geometry (mainly gap thickness). Practical implications: The results have been applied in surfaces are used in large dimension spinning nozzles of a die for polyethylene granulation, in that considerable strength, ductility and friction resistance of them are required. Originality/value: The effect of joint geometry (soldering clearance size, inter-plate <b>distance,</b> <b>plate</b> geometric parameters) on its microstructure and the status of stresses and deformations {{as well as on the}} process of plate cracking has been determined...|$|E
