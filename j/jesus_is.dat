5|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{called a}} τέκτων (tektōn) in , {{traditionally}} understood as carpenter but could cover makers {{of objects in}} various materials, including builders. The gospels indicate that Jesus could read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, {{but this does not}} necessarily mean that he received formal scribal training.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{placed in}} his cosmic setting as the Logos made flesh who reveals God and gives {{salvation}} to believers; John the Baptist, Andrew, and Nathanael {{bear witness to}} him as the Lamb of God, the Son of God, and the Christ.|$|E
5|$|As the Word, Jesus was {{eternally}} {{present with}} God, active in all creation, {{and the source}} of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E
50|$|According to the Ascended Master Teachings, {{each of the}} Magi {{who came}} to visit the baby <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> an {{incarnation}} {{of one of the}} ascended masters: Caspar, who gave the gift of gold to <b>Jesus,</b> <b>was</b> an incarnation of Djwal Khul; Balthasar, who gave the gift of frankincense to <b>Jesus,</b> <b>was</b> an incarnation of Kuthumi; and Melchior, who gave the gift of myrrh to <b>Jesus,</b> <b>was</b> an incarnation of Morya.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are some}} events in scripture where {{brothers}} or sisters of <b>Jesus</b> <b>are</b> not shown, e.g. when <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> {{lost in the}} Temple and during his crucifixion. This is argued to {{support the view that}} [...] "brothers" [...] of <b>Jesus</b> <b>are</b> not blood brothers or siblings, although some reject this.|$|R
5000|$|Lawrence Reed, in Rendering Unto Caesar, {{writes that}} <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> not a socialist {{in that he}} {{promoted}} voluntary giving and charity rather than the mandatory taking by government (taxes). Bill Flax, writing in Forbes, says <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> neither a capitalist nor socialist. Johnnie Moore (Professor of Religion at Liberty University) writing on the homepage of Fox News Radio's Todd Starnes, says <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a capitalist. Bryan Fischer, of the American Family Association, says <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a capitalist who advocated [...] "voluntary redistribution of wealth".|$|R
5|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{the first person}} to receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit descended on Jesus during his baptism and anointed him with power. Afterward, Jesus began his ministry and displayed his power by casting out demons, healing the sick, and teaching with authority.|$|E
5|$|While <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{portrayed as}} an impassioned person for {{his love for}} all (even for shopping), Buddha tends to be calm and thrifty, and also likes manga. The comedy often {{involves}} visual gags and puns, as well as jokes in reference to elements of Christianity and Buddhism; for example, Jesus creates wine from water in a public bath and Buddha shines when excited.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
50|$|Islam {{teaches that}} <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the}} most {{important}} prophets of Allah. Muslims do not believe that he was the Son of God, nor that he is divine or part of a triune God. In Islam, <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a human prophet who, like all the other prophets, tried to bring the children of Israel to the worship of One God. Muslims believe the creation of <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> similar to the creation of Adam (Adem). Muslims believe that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> condemned to crucifixion and then miraculously saved from execution.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{marriage}} in Cana of Galilee; {{and the mother}} of <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> there. And both <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> called, and His disciples, to the marriage.--JOHN ii. 1, 2.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> baptised by John the Baptist in the River Jordan <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> almost {{certainly}} naked {{when he was}} baptised. The early Christian liturgy of baptism required those being baptised to be completely naked.|$|R
5|$|The Church of the Nativity {{is one of}} Bethlehem's major {{tourist attractions}} and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands {{in the center of}} the city — a part of the Manger Square — over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{believed}} to have been born. Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where St. Jerome spent thirty years creating the Vulgate, the dominant Latin version of the Bible until the Reformation.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Christ in pictorial form was highly controversial {{in the early}} church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted {{as a barrier to}} developments in the East, but by the ninth century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.|$|E
25|$|The Gospel of Luke {{states that}} <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> first brought before Pontius Pilate for trial, since Pilate was the {{governor}} of Roman Judea, which encompassed Jerusalem where <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> arrested. Pilate initially handed him over to Antipas, in whose territory <b>Jesus</b> had <b>been</b> most active, but Antipas sent him back to Pilate's court.|$|R
50|$|The early {{centuries of}} Christian history also had {{groups at the}} other end of the spectrum, arguing that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> an {{ordinary}} mortal. The Adoptionists taught that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born fully human, and was adopted as Gods Son when John the Baptist baptised him because of the life he lived. Another group, known as the Ebionites, taught that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> not God, but the human Moshiach (messiah, anointed) prophet promised in the Hebrew Bible.|$|R
5000|$|Other critics {{preserved}} {{the unity of}} God by saying that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a man, but differentiated in being indwelt by the Spirit of God to an absolute and unique degree. They thus denied that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> God or a god. They became known as [...] "adoptionists", because they suggested that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> adopted by the Father to be his Son. This view was associated with Theodotus of Byzantium (the Shoemaker) and Artemon.|$|R
5|$|The {{indigenous}} Iglesia ni Cristo {{has several}} locales (akin to parishes) in the city, including its very first chapel (now a museum) in Punta, Sta. Ana. Evangelical, Pentecostal and Seventh-day Adventist denominations also thrive within the city. The {{headquarters of the}} Philippine Bible Society is in Manila. Also, the main campus of the Cathedral of Praise is located along Taft Avenue. <b>Jesus</b> <b>Is</b> Lord Church also has several branches and campuses in Manila, and celebrates its anniversary yearly at the Burnham Green and Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park.|$|E
5|$|To aid in his {{ministry}} to the Jewish people, Jesus {{was given the}} ability to perform miracles, by permission of God rather than by his own power. Through {{his ministry}}, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> seen as a precursor to Muhammad. According to the Quran, Jesus was not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by Allah, who physically raised Jesus into the heavens. To Muslims, it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event {{in the life of}} Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus will return to earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (ad-Dajjal) by killing him in Lud.|$|E
5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> considered a Muslim.|$|E
50|$|Tertullian (c.160 - 225AD), the Christian law expert from Carthage in North Africa, {{wrote that}} <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born while Gaius Sentius Saturninus was Legate of Roman Syria. In {{combination}} with other sources, this suggests <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born in 8BC or 7BC.|$|R
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of <b>Jesus</b> <b>are</b> based not on {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|R

5|$|After {{the second}} chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and {{a stick of}} red {{lipstick}} bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing their feet and cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of artist Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and Jesus marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but he places his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls {{on the ground with}} a silent, anguished cry. The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's stoned to death by the crowd.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E
5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a political national messiah, {{but the evidence}} for this portrait is negligible.

5|$|The Gallery {{was located}} in the Palais Leuchtenberg, {{the house of the}} Leuchtenberg family in Munich, built by Leo von Klenze between 1817 and 1821. It was opened to the public from at least 1837 on. The {{collection}} was catalogued in French and German from 1825 on, with a new version in German from 1841 on, and in an illustrated catalogue in English in 1852. After the death of Duke Maximilian in 1852, the Gallery was closed, the collection divided between his children, and the Palace sold to Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. Part of the collection was transferred to Saint Petersburg in 1854, where it was displayed in the Mariinsky Palace, and from 1870 on was lent to the Imperial Academy of Arts. The remainder moved together with Eugen Maximilianovich, Duke of Leuchtenberg, from Munich to Saint Petersburg in 1863. While the collection was still growing in the 1860s with purchases by Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, {{by the end of the}} century, some works were being sold off. The majority of the collection remained together until the Russian Revolution in 1917, when it was dispersed and a number of paintings sold in Sweden. Many works were acquired by the Hermitage and the Pushkin Museum, with others ending up in museums all over the world. For example, Parmigianino's Circumcision of <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> now housed at the Detroit Institute of Arts. The remaining works are either lost or in private collections.|$|E
5|$|The murals {{are one of}} {{the best}} {{representations}} of Byzantine art outside the traditional borders of Byzantium. The majority of the murals bear scriptures in Greek. The murals were painted under the patronage of atabek Ivane Zakarian between 1205 and 1216. Parallels have been drawn between the murals and the 11th century Armenian miniature paintings of the Mugni Gospels. The coloring of the murals is characteristic of typical Byzantine art while the thematic solutions are more Armenian. New and Old Testaments scenes as well as various saints including Saint Gregory the Illuminator are depicted on the murals. A large image of the Holy Virgin is depicted in the dome holding Jesus. The mural has been badly damaged and only parts of it survived. Below the Holy Virgin, the Communion is shown where <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> depicted twice, turning on the right and left sharing bread with the Apostles. The images of the Apostles Peter, John the Evangelist, Paul and Matthew have survived. The common Christians saints are depicted below the Communion scene, including Pope Sylvester, Saint James the son of Alpheus, Saint John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory the Illuminator, Jacob of Mtsbin, Clement of Rome, Gregory the Thaumaturgist, Cyril of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea. The murals on the western wall depict the Kingdom of Heaven. The northern wall depicts the trial of Jesus by the high priest of Caiaphas and by the Roman Procurator Pontius Pilate. Some of the murals were renovated in 1979. The arches, niches and columns are also covered by murals.|$|E

5000|$|The crucifixion's {{proximity}} to the Sabbath day has also factored into the theory. Mark 15:42 indicates that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> crucified on [...] "Preparation Day (that is, the day before Sabbath)." [...] Since weekly Sabbath occurs on Saturday, it <b>was</b> presumed that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> crucified on Good Friday, even though this would mean <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> dead for less than three days. The Wednesday Crucifixion theory accounts for this discrepancy. In the traditional Jewish calendar there were weekly Sabbaths on Saturday, as well as seven High Sabbaths, also called [...] "High Days", some of which can fall on {{any day of the}} week. John 19:31 says that that particular Sabbath day before which <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> crucified was, in the Greek translation, a [...] "great day" [...] or [...] "high day" [...] (μεγάλη ἡ ἡμέρα).|$|R
5000|$|The first Christians (the disciples or {{students}} of <b>Jesus)</b> <b>were</b> essentially all ethnically Jewish or Jewish proselytes. In other words, <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> Jewish, preached to the Jewish people and called from them his first disciples. However, the Great Commission, issued after the Resurrection, is specifically directed at [...] "all nations." [...] Jewish Christians, as faithful religious Jews, regarded [...] "Christianity" [...] as {{an affirmation of}} every aspect of contemporary Judaism, {{with the addition of}} one extra belief—that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> the Messiah.|$|R
