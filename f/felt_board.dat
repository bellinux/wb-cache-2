One example of metaphor application involves the use of ropes and <b>felt</b> <b>board</b> to identify and explore relationships in families. In this case, the mother of a son who was socially isolated is treated by a marriage and family therapy intern, using ropes and <b>felt</b> <b>board</b> as media to exemplify the tugs of relationships, demands, and expecta-tions. Responding to the metaphors, the mother changed relationships with her son, other children, and her former and current husbands.

40|$|Young children's {{production}} and recall of information presented at {{varying levels of}} action and verbal labels was compared on a computer versus a <b>felt</b> <b>board.</b> Forty children, equally distributed by Grades Preschool and Kindergarten, {{were randomly assigned to}} a computer or <b>felt</b> <b>board</b> condition. Within each condition, the same 24 objects (6 sets of 4 objects) were presented with or without action and verbal abels. Both action and labels increased children's recall of verbal information, regardless of the medium in which that information was presented. The results uggest hat action facilitates, rather than disrupts, children's learning of verbal information. Children's recall of information depends, in part, on the link between how information is presented and the ways children have to think about, encode, and retrieve that information. More specifically, effective recall requires a match between the demands of an information-processing situation and children's cog-nitive skills. Although young children have often been characterized asenactive and ico-nic, visual information processors (Bruner, Olver, & Greenfield, 1966), recent debates have centered on the extent o which such tendencies interfere with their ability to process verbal linguistic content (Calvert, Huston, & Wright, 1987...|$|E

5000|$|In {{response}} to technological change, predominantly since the 1980s, cartography has increasingly been democratised. The wide availability of high-quality location information has enabled mass-market cartography based on Global Positioning System receivers, home computers, and the Internet. The fact that civilians are using technologies which were once elitist led Brosius et al. {{to assert that}} counter-mapping involves [...] "stealing the master's tools". Nevertheless, numerous early counter-mapping projects successfully utilised manual techniques, and many still use them. For instance, in recent years, the use of simple sketch mapping approaches has been revitalised, whereby maps are made on the ground, using natural materials. Similarly, the use of scale model constructions and <b>felt</b> <b>boards,</b> as means of representing cartographic claims of different groups, have become increasingly popular. Consequently, Wood et al. assert that counter-mappers can [...] "make gateau out of technological crumbs".|$|R

Children and adults used different strategies to solve the pattern completion problems. Children often used strategies that focused on only one dimension (shape), while adults used strategies that focused on both shape and size. Children also encoded the problems less adequately than adults, as shown in their problem recon structions. Children's encoding focused on the shape dimension; they made more errors in reconstructing size. Adults, however, made more errors reconstructing shape.

40|$|Preschool {{period is}} of {{fundamental}} importance in an individual’s {{life and in}} the {{society as a whole}} as this is the time when children develop very quickly in all areas. The thesis researches the NTC program adapted to be used with preschool children. The program focuses on brain development and is mainly aimed at children from the age of 7 onwards. However, the author adapted the program for children aged between 3 and 6 years as well. The aim of my research was to determine whether the program can be also used with the youngest children. The theoretical part presents early childhood education, the Kindergarten Curriculum, which is the basis for the work in the kindergarten, and a stimulating learning environment along with spontaneous or experiential learning. I also highlighted the NTC program, its characteristics and its use, but also the role of the preschool teacher in implementing these activities. The aim of the empirical part is to determine whether the program may be adjusted {{to be able to work}} with the youngest children and to what extent. NTC enriches the Kindergarten Curriculum with specific examples of activities and recommendations for parents and preschool teachers. I developed and tested five blocks of activities (<b>felt</b> <b>board</b> with toys, interactive wardrobe, rice, moving balls and obstacle course) from different areas and recorded the findings. The purpose of the <b>felt</b> <b>board</b> with toys was to encourage the child’s thinking regarding the position and the movement of the object and develop fine motor control as well as visual accommodation. The interactive wardrobe allowed children to gain experience regarding different textures of objects and different or similar senses, and to develop associations. Children also developed fine motor skills and visual accommodation and experienced sensory stimuli by playing with rice. The game with balls had a positive impact on their balance and rotation in particular. The obstacle course in the gym allowed children to develop their motor skills and challenge themselves. These activities have shown that the implementation of the NTC program with adjusted activities can be used with the youngest children. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} working relationships between full-time chief negotiators in selected school districts throughout the United States and the superintendents of schools, members of the negotiating team, and school boards during the period of collective negotiations. Secondary purposes of the study were to: (1) identify the composition of board negotiation teams and to discover the special responsibilities borne by various members of the negotiation team; (2) investigate the process of internal communications carried on between the full-time chief negotiator, the superintendent, and the board during negotiations; and (3) secure opinions of the full-time chief negotiator, superintendent, and board president relative to the positive or negative effect of the negotiation process on the school district. The population of the study was comprised of eighteen responding urban school corporations throughout the United States which have an established position of full-time chief negotiator as a function of the superintendency. Data secured from the negotiators, superintendents, and school board presidents of participating school corporations were used as the basis for the study. The major findings from the study were: 1. Full-time chief negotiators have, with few exceptions, reported directly to the superintendent of schools. 2. School board negotiation teams have usually included, in addition to the full-time chief negotiator, at least one member with major responsibility for instructional and/or personnel matters within the school system. The negotiating team members representative of business management and/or finance areas were reported for fewer than half of the school systems included in the study. 3. The full-time chief negotiator, with few exceptions, has been chairman of the board negotiating team and has been charged with responsibilities for setting strategy and directing the progress of negotiations. 4. The full-time chief negotiator has ordinarily served as the only spokesman for the administration and school board during negotiation sessions. On some occasions other team members may serve as a spokesman depending upon matters being discussed and expertise of the team member. The fulltime chief negotiator has served as spokesman during all crucial periods. 5. The superintendent of schools has not been an active participant in actual negotiations proceedings. 6. Although the superintendent of schools has not been an active participant in negotiating sessions he has been closely involved behind the scenes. All reports indicate that the superintendent has not been "by passed" in any way. 7. The superintendent and full-time chief negotiator as a general rule were reported as attending all school board executive sessions dealing with negotiations matters. 8. The person or persons making negotiation recommendations to the board was, as a general rule, the superintendent and the chief negotiator, but there was some conflict here in the responses of the chief negotiator, superintendent, and president of the board. There was noticeable conflict in the situations where the chief negotiator reported to someone other than the superintendent. 9. Board presidents felt that board involvement on noneconomic matters was the same as economic. Most chief negotiators <b>felt</b> <b>board</b> involvement on non-economic matters was substantially less than on economic matters. The superintendents were more inclined to agree with the board opinion. 10. The overall effect of negotiations as reported by all three groups surveyed were predominately positive. The responses of the full-time chief negotiator were almost all positive, with a lesser number of superintendents responding in the positive and even a lesser number of presidents of the school board. 11. Most superintendents felt the establishment of the position of full-time chief negotiator to have been beneficial and essential to the functioning of their school system after the advent of negotiations with employee groups. Major conclusions included: 1. More and more school systems will move to employ a full-time chief negotiator in the future. 2. The establishment of the position of chief negotiator, reporting to the superintendent of schools has not resulted in any relinquishment of authority, status or influence of the superintendent. 3. The person performing the task of chairman of the school board negotiation team should be an employee of the school system with knowledge in all areas of the school system he represents. 4. The full-time chief negotiator should be close to the superintendent and identified with him in order to have maximum effectiveness in the negotiation process. 5. The full-time chief negotiator must have intimate contact with the school board in regular and executive sessions in order to know the attitudes and desires of the board that he represents. 6. The establishment of the position of chief negotiator as a function of the superintendency is generally considered to be desirable and essential. 7. The establishment of the position of chief negotiator does not change or depreciate the relationship of the superintendent with the school board in the negotiation process so long as the chief negotiator reports directly to the superintendent of schools. If the chief negotiator reports to someone other than the superintendent, there is likely to be confusion, conflict and impairment of effective relationships. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
