50|$|Rautenbach’s {{greatest}} achievement to {{date has}} been in mobilizing investment towards bio-ethanol leading {{to the construction of}} the <b>Green</b> <b>Fuel</b> Chisumbanje ethanol plant modeled along the lines of Brazil’s biofuel cane industry. The ambitious project is a build, operate and transfer partnership between government represented by the Agricultural Rural Development Authority (Arda), <b>Green</b> <b>Fuel</b> Investments (headed by Billy Rautenbach) and two other investment partners - Rating Investments and Macdom Investments. The 20-year pact was signed in February 2009. The project is the biggest so far in Africa. Some sections of the media claim that the project was a land grab because of the huge tracts of land bought by the investors, however, repeated monitoring visits by officials from the Zimbabwean government, the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization qualified the industrial development as necessary for the poverty stricken district (see below - creation of jobs). The ethanol project has subsequently set records for Zimbabwe as being the first African country with flexi-fuel vehicle technology using blends of up to 85% ethanol and reducing the country's fuel import bill, creating over 4,500 jobs and leading Zimbabwe to a greener economy. By contributing to the production of ethanol based fuel, <b>Green</b> <b>fuel</b> has helped the country to save at least $2 million every month in fuel imports. However, the mandatory fuel blending imposed by the government on behalf of <b>Green</b> <b>Fuel</b> has been met with disdain and viewed as a symbol of Rautenbach's far reaching influence on the ZANU-PF led government.|$|E

It is foreseen that the venture will continue to create employment for more than 8000 people. Already, the venture is sponsoring nearly $2,000,000 every month in salaries alone for 120 full-time employees and hundreds of contract workers from villages dotted around the ARDA estates transforming the lives of people in Chisumbanje, including others at growth points such as Checheche and in towns as far afield as Chipinge and Chiredzi. Zimbabwe does not have personnel experienced in ethanol plant construction work and through job training programmes, <b>Green</b> <b>Fuel</b> has created a set of skilled ethanol plant artisans marketable worldwide thereby empowering the local people through technological transfer. Moreover, the planned construction of the Kondo Dam for increased water volumes needed along the Save River will create more jobs for the rural populace. Further to this, a steel fabricating unit has been established in Harare with a staff of over 100 artisans involved in the manufacture of parts required for the ethanol project. 13 Local commuter bus companies in Chipinge have been contracted to ferry labor from the villages to the project site on a daily basis. More importantly, 30% of the artisans employed in the distillery and boiler sections of the ethanol plant are Zimbabweans previously based outside the country in South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique. Community leaders in Chisumbanje said they are fully behind the project as it will uplift their livelihoods, [...] "We really support the project as we are the first beneficiary in the sense that development will be realised in our once marginalized area.
