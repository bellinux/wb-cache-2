5|$|Bohemian {{waxwings}} are not brood parasitised by {{the common}} cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds {{placed in a}} Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3million years ago, the ancestral waxwing was a <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brood parasitic species, and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then.|$|E
5|$|McEwan {{wanted to}} write a novel dealing with the social turmoil of the 1970s, and Sweet Tooth is to a large extent based on his own life. The story explores the {{relationship}} between artistic integrity and government propaganda, and addresses competing approaches to literature; the boundary between reality and fiction is tested throughout. The novel is dedicated to McEwan's late friend Christopher Hitchens. He is not referred to directly in the book, but he did play a part as the <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> real-life literary event fictionalised in the book, involving McEwan and Martin Amis, who does appear in the story. Critical reception was mixed; some reviewers found the novel moving and poignant, while others saw it as weaker than much of McEwan's previous work.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry systems {{involving}} {{only two}} species {{are known as}} bipolar. Only one bipolar arrangement is possible here: that's where the dupe is itself the model. There are two such variants on this arrangement of mimic imitating its target, in the first case, termed Batesian-Wallacian mimicry after Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, the model is the prey species. In the second case, the model is the <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brood parasite.|$|E

5|$|Tina (McShera) {{arrives at}} a Victorian villa for a séance. Hives (Shearsmith) settles Tina before {{retrieving}} Talbot (Steadman), who arrives shrouded in black and carrying a doll. Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, speaks in a high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the séance begins, objects fly around the room, Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth. Hives encourages Tina not to break the circle, but she does so when a blue-faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry, the <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam.|$|E
