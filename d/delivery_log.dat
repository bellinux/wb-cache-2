40|$|Prevention of mother-to-child {{transmission}} (PMTCT) {{is a major}} intervention world-wide {{in the fight against}} the HIV pandemic, and has resulted in markedly reduced rates of {{mother-to-child transmission}} rates in well-resourced countries. However, it seems that barriers to implementation of the programme exist at all levels of health care at all facilities providing maternal care. Aim: To conduct a clinical audit of the PMTCT programme at a regional hospital in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods: Data was collected from an analysis of antenatal and medical records of women who attended antenatal care and delivered at the regional hospital between January and December 2007. Only pregnant women who attended antenatal care at this regional hospital and delivered in its facilities were selected for the study.

40|$|An intensity-modulated {{proton therapy}} (IMPT) patient-specific quality {{assurance}} (PSQA) program based on measurement alone {{can be very}} time consuming due to the highly modulated dose distributions of IMPT fields. Incorporating independent dose calculation and treatment log file analysis could reduce the time required for measurements. In this article, we summarize our effort to develop an efficient and effective PSQA program that consists of three components: measurements, independent dose calculation, and analysis of patient-specific treatment <b>delivery</b> <b>log</b> files. Measurements included two-dimensional (2 D) measurements using an ionization chamber array detector for each field delivered at the planned gantry angles with the electronic medical record (EMR) system in the QA mode and the accelerator control system (ACS) in the treatment mode, and additional measurements at depths for each field with the ACS in physics mode and without the EMR system. Dose distributions for each field in a water phantom were calculated independently using a recently developed in-house pencil beam algorithm and compared with those obtained using the treatment planning system (TPS). The treatment log file for each field was analyzed in terms of deviations in delivered spot positions from their planned positions using various statistical methods. Using this improved PSQA program, {{we were able to}} verify the integrity of the data transfer from the TPS to the EMR to the ACS, the dose calculation of the TPS, and the treatment delivery, including the dose delivered and spot positions. On the basis of this experience, we estimate that the in-room measurement time required for each complex IMPT case (e. g., a patient receiving bilateral IMPT for head and neck cancer) is less than 1 h using the improved PSQA program. Our experience demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} develop an efficient and effective PSQA program for IMPT with the equipment and resources available in the clinic...|$|E

Qualitative findings revealed that those who amended the lessons did so to differentiate for student ability, update them for use with new technologies and to enhance teacher and student engagement. Teachers endorsed the aims of the intervention, but some were frustrated with having to adapt the lesson materials. Teachers also a reported tendency to delegate the physical activity lessons to other staff not trained in the intervention. Fidelity of intervention implementation was good but teachers' enthusiasm for the AFLY 5 programme was mixed despite them believing that the messages behind the lessons were important. This may have meant that the intervention messages were not delivered as anticipated and explain why the intervention was found not to be effective. ISRCTN 50133740.

40|$|Unsolicited bulk email (spam) {{is used by}} cybercriminals to lure users into scams and {{to spread}} malware infections. Most of these {{unwanted}} messages are sent by spam botnets, which are networks of compromised machines {{under the control of}} a single (malicious) entity. Often, these botnets are rented out to particular groups to carry out spam campaigns, in which similar mail messages are sent to a large group of Internet users in a short amount of time. Tracking the bot-infected hosts that participate in spam campaigns, and attributing these hosts to spam botnets that are active on the Internet, are challenging but important tasks. In particular, this information can improve blacklist-based spam defenses and guide botnet mitigation efforts. In this paper, we present a novel technique to support the identification and tracking of bots that send spam. Our technique takes as input an initial set of IP addresses that are known to be associated with spam bots, and learns their spamming behavior. This initial set is then “magnified ” by analyzing large-scale mail <b>delivery</b> <b>logs</b> to identify other hosts on the Internet whose behavior is similar to the behavior previously modeled. We implemented our technique in a tool, called BOTMAGNIFIER, and applied it to several data streams related to the delivery of email traffic.

We also perform attribution of the identified spam hosts and track the evolution and activity of well-known spamming botnets over time.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the perinatal outcome of twin pregnancies delivered in a tertiary teaching hospital according to chorionicity. METHODS: A retrospective study involving 289 twin pregnancies delivered from January 2003 to December 2006 was carried out. Maternal and perinatal data were obtained from hospital charts and <b>delivery</b> <b>logs.</b> Chorionicity was determined by ultrasonography or histopathological study. RESULTS: Incidence of twin gestations was 3. 4 % and 96. 4 % were spontaneously conceived. 60. 5 % were dichorionic (DC), 30. 8 % of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA), 6. 6 % monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) and for 2. 1 % chorionicity was unknown. The mean gestation age at delivery was respectively 35. 4, 33. 6, 32. 9 for DC, MCDA and MCMA. The mean birth weight was 2. 171, 1. 832 and 1. 760 g respectively for DC, MC and MCMA. The proportion of fetuses delivered with less than 34 weeks in DC was of 21. 7 %, while in MCDA it was of 39. 3 % and in MCMA of 42. 1 %. Birth weight below the 10 th centile occurred in 15. 7 % for DC, 22. 5 % for MCDA and 26. 3 % in MCMA. Congenital anomalies were observed in 21. 3 % in monochorionic and in 7. 4 % in the dichorionic. Lenght of hospital stay was shorter for DC when compared to MCDA and MCMA twins (13. 1, 17. 3 and 23. 3 days, respectively). The proportion of twin pregnancies with both babies discharged alive were 85. 7 % in DC and 61. 1 % in MC. CONCLUSION: The rate of preterm deliveries and low birth weight is higher in monochorionic pregnancies when compared to dichorionic twins. However, when adjusted for complications such as fetal abnormalities and twin-twin transfusion syndrome, double survival rates were similar in the two groups...|$|R

We also attempt to study the characteristics of the spamming botnet in the long-term to see how quickly bot masters react and what type of action they take. Our primary target in this paper is one of the world’s previously worst known spamming botnets, Srizbi, whose C&C servers were shutdown by its upstream ISPs on November 11, 2008. We conduct an extensive measurement study spanning a large volume of e-mail <b>delivery</b> <b>logs</b> and packet traces collected at five vantage points. The measurement period spans three years and includes of {{the rise and fall of}} the botnet. We leverage passive TCP fingerprinting on the collected packet traces to identify bot-infected hosts and spam messages sent from them. We first extract variants of the known TCP signatures that are associated with the spamming botnet by correlating the data sets in the time and space domains. Next, by using the signatures, we quantify the volume of spam sent from the botnet and the effectiveness of the C&C server shutdown from an Internet edge siteperspective. We attempt to study the characteristics of the spamming botnet in both the time and space domains. We reveal several findings that are useful in understanding the spread of spamming botnets; specifically, we note the steady growth of the botnet’s size and the rapid version transition after the shutdown of C&C servers. We also estimate the entire size of Srizbi botnet. We then study how the botnet membership is distributed around the globe and how its size changed over time. 1...|$|R

Increased fuel loads following fire suppression and the occurrence of several large and severe fires {{have led to the}} perception that in many areas there is a greatly increased risk of high-severity fire compared with presettlement forests. To reconstruct the variability of the fire regime in the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon, we analyzed a 10 -m, 2, 000 -y sediment core for charcoal, pollen, and sedimentological data. The record reveals a highly episodic pattern of fire in which 77 % of the 68 charcoal peaks before Euro-American settlement cluster within nine distinct periods marked by a 15 -y mean interval. The 11 largest charcoal peaks are significantly related to decadal-scale drought periods and are followed by pulses of minerogenic sediment suggestive of rapid sediment <b>delivery.</b> After <b>logging</b> in the 1950 s, sediment load was increased fourfold compared with that from the most severe presettlement fire. Less severe fires, marked by smaller charcoal peaks and no sediment pulses, are not correlated significantly with drought periods. Pollen indicators of closed forests are consistent with fire-free periods of sufficient length to maintain dense forest and indicate a fire-triggered switch to more open conditions during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly. Our results indicate that over millennia fire was more episodic than revealed by nearby shorter tree-ring records and that recent severe fires have precedents during earlier drought episodes but also that sediment loads resulting from logging and road building have no precedent in earlier fire events...|$|R

The data bank developed using these logging techniques was used to create a Yard cycle, a Freeway cycle and a City-Suburban cycle by the concatenation of microtrips. The City-Suburban driving cycle was converted to a driving route, in which the truck under test would perform at maximum acceleration during certain portions of the test schedule. This new route was used to characterize the emissions of a 1982 Ford tractor with a Cummins 14 liter, 350 hp engine and a 1998 International tractor with a Cummins 14 liter, 435 hp engine. Emissions levels were found to be repeatable with one driver and the drier-to-driver variation of NO{sub x} was under 4 %, although the driver-to driver variations of CO and PM were higher. Emissions levels of NO{sub x} for the Ford tractor at a test weight of 46, 400 lb. u sing the CSHVR were comparable with values obtained using the WVU 5 mile route and the EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule for Heavy Duty Vehicles (''Test D''). The PM missions were slightly higher for the CSHVR than the 5 mile route and Test D. The effect of test weight on emissions, in units of mass/distance, was assessed using the International tractor with the CSHVR at 26, 000, 36, 000 and 46, 400 lb. test weights. Variation of all regulated exhaust emissions was small between test weights, although the CO{sub 2 } level reflected the additional energy used at higher weights. The small variation in regulated emissions may be attributed to the fact that in all three cases, the route called for full power operation of the vehicle, and that PM puff associated with gear shifting would be similar.

Such a session can be effectively represented by the browse graph over the nodes visited by the user in the session. Thus as the user transitions between pages in the browse graph, the effectiveness of ads (clickto-conversion ratio) he sees on these pages could change. On the other hand, the advertisers valuation for a user also depends upon past events in the browse session (a. k. a. an externality), e. g. a shoe company may value a user differently in a browse session if {{he has not been}} shown any other shoe ads. In another instance, his valuation may be concave in the number of times the ad is shown to the user in the same session. We note that the advertiser’s valuation is derived from the conversion that a click might lead to. Often, this is not correlated with the click for which the advertiser typically pays. The first contribution of our study is to show that the click to conversion ratio (CtoC) of a user depends on the past events in the session. To this end, we analyze logs of user activity over a period of one month from Microsoft AdCenter Delivery Engine to identify the source, nature and the extent of externality present in the CtoC ratio as a function of past events. Specifically, we address externalities from past exposure of the user to self and competing advertisers. We then propose a new bidding language that allows the advertiser to specify his valuation of a user’s click as a function of these externalities. We show the hardness of computing an optimal ad allocation in this setting and give efficient algorithms under some practical assumptions. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis on real data to measure effectiveness of our proposed allocation schemes using the Bing AdCenter <b>delivery</b> engine <b>logs.</b> Work done while the author was an intern at Microsof...|$|R
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} {{study was conducted}} to understand the influences of the mothers 2 ̆ 7 sleep patterns on their infants 2 ̆ 7 sleep patterns. The nocturnal sleep parameters were examined using the sleep logs of the mothers and their infants. The mothers were instructed to record sleep logs for their infants and themselves every ten minutes from the date of the delivery to the fourteenth postpartum week. Twelve healthy primipara and multipara aged 26 to 32 years old and their babies weighing (3, 028. 7 ± 197. 0 g) and (2, 989. 4 ± 216. 4 g) respectively, were selected for the study. Each mother had normal pregnancy and <b>delivery.</b> The sleep <b>logs</b> data of six primipara and multipara mothers and their babies were collected and analyzed. The valid sleep log data from all mothers and infants totaled 1, 176 days. During this study, a close observation was conducted, giving advice about child-bearing at home and visiting them once a month. The changes in the sleep/wake onset of the mothers and their infants at night over a period from birth until the fourteenth postpartum week were similar. However, the sleep onset and wake onset times of primaparae mother-baby pairs were later than those of the multiparae mother-baby pairs. The percentage of time the infants slept during the mothers 2 ̆ 7 nocturnal sleep increased with the age of the infants. However, the percentages were higher in the infants of multiparae mothers {{in the first half of}} the fourteen postpartum weeks and lower in the latter half of the fourteen postpartum weeks. These results may indicate that the parity of the mothers have a modification effect on the development of infants 2 ̆ 7 sleep rhythm...|$|R
