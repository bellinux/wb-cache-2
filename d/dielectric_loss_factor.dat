In its development, the basic composition of DGEBA epoxy resin with MPDA as hardener is hydrophilic. Silane is added to improve the surface properties of materials to be more hydrophobic.

40|$|Measurement {{errors of}} a {{capacitive}} voltage transformer (CVT) are relevant to its equivalent parameters for which its capacitive divider contributes the most. In daily operation, dielectric aging, moisture, dielectric breakdown, etc., it will exert mixing effects on a capacitive divider’s insulation characteristics, leading to fluctuation in equivalent parameters which result in the measurement error. This paper proposes an equivalent circuit model to represent a CVT which incorporates insulation characteristics of a capacitive divider. After software simulation and laboratory experiments, the relationship between measurement errors and insulation parameters is obtained. It indicates that variation of insulation parameters in a CVT will cause a reasonable measurement error. From field tests and calculation, equivalent capacitance mainly affects magnitude error, while dielectric loss mainly affects phase error. As capacitance changes 0. 2 %, magnitude error can reach − 0. 2 %. As <b>dielectric</b> <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> changes 0. 2 %, phase error can reach 5 ′.
