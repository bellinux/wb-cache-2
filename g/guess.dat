40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is psychometric and {{psychological}} analysis of <b>guessing</b> on entrance examinations, and especially evaluation of classical procedure for reducing <b>guessing</b> which has been used at Department of psychology in Novi Sad, which consisted of instruction against <b>guessing</b> and correction with Abbott formula. As first, we have tried to estimate <b>guessing</b> in several ways, according to classical test theory and item response theory. Besides of analysis of association between different indicators of <b>guessing,</b> we have performed a special form of criterion analysis, by correlating possible indicators of <b>guessing</b> with several personality traits. Basic conclusion of this paper is that <b>guessing</b> is not consistent behavior and because of this it is very hard to measure and eliminate it. The next conclusion is that the applied classical procedure has not been able to eliminate <b>guessing,</b> and that it probably disfavored several candidates...|$|R

This provides a general framework to reason about <b>guessing</b> attacks in a symbolic setting, in-dependent of specific intruder models. We show how the framework can be used to analyze both passive and active <b>guessing</b> attacks...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a {{new method}} of {{studying}} problems in network information flow is introduced. This is established by developing on the relatively new concept of <b>guessing</b> numbers, which {{is related to}} network coding, and combining it with another technique known as fractional routing. The resultant <b>guessing</b> game, called a fractional <b>guessing</b> game, is a modification of the existing <b>guessing</b> game that incorporates the notion of fractional routing for multiple-unicast networks. It is essentially an intersection of two major areas of mathematics which allows further study into network flow problems, {{and the relationship between}} <b>guessing</b> numbers and the solvability of network flow problems. To illustrate this relationship, we construct a graph (the pentagon or 5 -cycle) that has a non- integer <b>guessing</b> number, by using a <b>guessing</b> strategy which ensures a <b>guessing</b> number in the half-open interval (2, 2. 5]. This is an application of the link between <b>guessing</b> numbers on graphs and the solvability of their related networks. It is shown that the fractional <b>guessing</b> number of an example graph is higher than the <b>guessing</b> number computed using the existing linear approach. This <b>guessing</b> number is also dependent {{on the size of the}} alphabet from which the messages are constructed, answering an open question from the literature relating to the possibility of such a dependency. Finally, the extension of the method to include techniques of both routing capacity and network coding is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Various factors {{could conceivably}} promote the {{accuracy}} of <b>guesses</b> during a recognition test. Two that we identified in previous studies are forced-choice testing format and high perceptual similarity between the repeat target and novel foil. In restricted circumstances, the relative perceptual fluency of the target can be {{compared with that of}} the foil and used as a reliable cue to guide accurate responses that occur without explicit retrieval—a phenomenon we referred to as “implicit recognition. ” In this issue, Jeneson and colleagues report a failure to replicate accurate <b>guesses</b> and also a tendency on the part of subjects to hazard <b>guesses</b> infrequently, even though testing circumstances were very similar to those that we used. To resolve this discrepancy, we developed a simple manipulation to encourage either <b>guessing</b> or confident responding.

When <b>guessing</b> was encouraged, <b>guesses</b> were highly accurate (as in our previous demonstrations of implicit recognition), whereas when confident responding was encouraged, <b>guesses</b> were at chance levels (as in Jeneson and colleagues' data). In light of a substantial literature showing high accuracy despite low confidence in certain circumstances, we infer that both the prevalence and accuracy of <b>guessing</b> can be influenced by whether subjects adopt guessing-friendly strategies.
