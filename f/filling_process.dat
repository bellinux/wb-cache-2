25|$|The {{fracture}} filling of diamond {{is often}} the last {{step in the process}} of diamond enhancement, following laser drilling and acid-etching of inclusions, though if the fractures are surface-reaching, no drilling may be required. This process, which involves the use of specially-formulated solutions with a refractive index approximating that of diamond, was pioneered by Zvi Yehuda of Ramat Gan, Israel. Yehuda is now used as a brand name applied to diamonds treated in this manner. Koss & Schechter, another Israel-based firm, attempted to modify Yehuda's process in the 1990s by using halogen-based glasses, but this was unsuccessful. The details behind the Yehuda process have been kept secret, but the filler used is reported to be lead oxychloride glass, which has a fairly low melting point. The New York-based Dialase also treats diamonds via a Yehuda-based process, which is believed to use lead-bismuth oxychloride glass, but research into creating better, more durable, less traceable solutions is still being done, creating more silicone based solutions for the fracture <b>filling</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

40|$|The microvia <b>fill</b> <b>process</b> is an {{electrochemical}} {{copper deposition}} process {{applied in the}} manufacturing of multilayered printed circuit boards (PCBs). It is the process where the metallic interconnections between adjacent signal layers of the multilayered PCB are made. The process chemistry is complex, including the interactions of several additive chemicals {{in addition to the}} underlying basic electrochemical processes of copper electrodeposition. To this day, the microvia <b>fill</b> <b>process</b> equipment set-ups utilized in the industry have none or very little automatic online control of the process variables. This is mostly because direct online measuring of the microvia <b>fill</b> <b>process</b> is practically impossible due to the vast number of microscopic features on a PCB, {{as well as to the}} small size of the features. The electronics industry is continuously striving to produce cheaper, smaller and more complex devices for an immeasurable number of applications. In the core of every electronics-appliance there is a PCB, which forms the chassis for the electronic components of the device as well as the signal paths between the components. Considering the enormous size of the electronics industry, as well as the ubiquitous nature of electronics, it is clear why PCB manufacturers consider that improving the microvia <b>fill</b> <b>process</b> technology is a relevant object for development. This doctoral thesis presents novel means for improving the microvia <b>fill</b> <b>process</b> through process simulation and model-based process design. The main results of the thesis are distributed parameter models, which together form the main components necessary for modeling a practical microvia fill electrolysis apparatus and designing a model-based control system for the process. Though the models are primarily based on physical and chemical first principles, the development work of all models presented in this thesis relies on experimental data that is gathered to parameterize and to validate the models. The thesis consists of a summary and nine publications, which address the modeling of the microvia <b>fill</b> <b>process,</b> the computational methods necessary for these models and the modeling of copper electrolysis systems in general...|$|R

In SAC OX free scheme, the exposed AA Si corners that were damaged during the HDP process did not get consumed and repaired while they would have gotten in the scheme with SAC OX and hence degraded GOI.

It is shown that for contacts with an aspect ratio smaller than one, the effect of surface curvature is substantial and actually improves step coverage. Therefore, surface curvature for features with aspect ratios smaller than one, should be accounted for in computer simulations of the <b>fill</b> <b>process.</b> For contacts with aspect ratios larger than one the effect of surface curvature is negligible. It is shown that the size of the void (which will be fo rmed in cases of step coverage less than 100 %) is a better way to describe the quality of the deposition and the repercussions of the void on subsequent process steps such as tungsten etch back. In addition, the size of the void depends for a given set of deposition conditions solely on the depth of the contact rather than the contact diameter (for aspect ratios larger than 1. 0). Blanket chemical vapor deposition of tungsten (CVD-W) deposited under optimum conditions is known to be capa-ble of voidless filling of high aspect ratio contact and via windows in sub-micron (very large scale integrated/ultra large scale integrated) (VLSI/ULSI) circuits.

40|$|The United States' {{plans to}} {{establish}} a permanent manned presence in space and to explore the Solar System created the need to efficiently handle large quantities of subcritical cryogenic fluids, particularly propellants such as liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, in low- to zero-gravity environments.

O suco do processo hot fill teve maior aceitação global, enquanto o do processo asséptico manteve, ao final dos 350 dias, a aceitação inicial. As amostras do processo asséptico apresentaram inicialmente melhor sabor em comparação com as do processo hot fill, no entanto, as do processo hot fill mantiveram o sabor estável, enquanto o sabor do suco do processo asséptico teve menor aceitação ao longo do armazenamento.

40|$|The no-vent fill {{method is}} a {{promising}} approach {{to handle the}} problems of low-g venting during propellant transfer. A receiver tank is first cooled to remove thermal energy from the tank wall and the resultant vapor vented overboard. Then nozzles mix the incoming liquid and residual vapor in the tank maintaining a thermodynamic state which allows the tank to fill with liquid without venting. Ground based testing at NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) has demonstrated the no-vent <b>fill</b> <b>process</b> and attempted to bound its low-gravity performance. But, low-gravity testing is required to validate the method. As an alternative to using a dedicated spacecraft for validation the authors have formulated several small scale experiments to study no-vent fill in low-g.

40|$|In common aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>processes,</b> {{hydrogen}} peroxide vapour is a predominantly applied antimicrobial for the inactivation of microorganisms in packages. During this process, the germicidal effectivity of the antimicrobial treatment depends {{especially on the}} H 2 O 2 concentration of the gas mixture. For the detection of H 2 O 2 in aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>processes,</b> a novel thin-film calorimetric gas sensor based on a differential set-up of a catalytically activated and a passivated temperature sensing element has been realised in the present work. The sensor device contains two meander-shaped platinum resistances as temperature sensing elements: both have been passivated with spin-coated perfluoralkoxy. As catalytically active materials for the calorimetric gas sensor, palladium, platinum black and manganese oxide particles have been studied in the developed experimental set-up, wherein MnO 2 has shown the highest sensitivity of 0. 57 degrees C/% (v/v) towards H 2 O 2. Afterwards, the characteristic of the sensor device with MnO 2 particles as catalyst has been examined at various H 2 O 2 concentrations and additionally, the influence of gas temperature and gas flow rate on the sensor signal has been validated in the experimental set-up.

A total of 12 tests were conducted. Models of the test facility fill and vent systems, as well as the tank, were constructed. The objective of achieving tank fill in 5 minutes was met during the test series. However, liquid began to accumulate in the tank before it was chilled.
