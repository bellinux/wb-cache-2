5000|$|Crenshaw's eponymous {{first album}} {{included}} the U.S. hit, Someday, Someway.

So sure it is a metal record and like always it will <b>have</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thrash vibe to it with some melody in it. It's always best to try to make it better or at least think in your mind that it is going to be better. That becomes the challenge. I think that is what keeps the band rolling. A lot of bands are known for what they have done, but I feel being known for where you are and what you are doing is where true value lies. I feel we accomplished that on the last few albums." ...|$|E

It sort of didn’t make much sense in The Walkmen anyhow." [...] Regarding the album's lyrical content, Leithauser noted that he often tried not to rewrite or overthink his words: [...] "We tried to keep a lot of original takes {{and a lot of}} original moments, so it did feel like naturally it did <b>have</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> narrative, and it was almost like there was a character in it that went {{all the way through the}} record. ... It did seem like there was a consistent voice that went through the whole thing, that’s inspired by the music." [...] Batmanglij likened his lyrical contributions to the album to that of an editor: [...] "I would contribute lyrics, but I think a lot of what I brought was sort of focusing a narrative and trying to make sure that there was always a picture being painted." ...|$|E

[The {{blasting}} of rocks] {{affected the}} spawning grounds of fish, {{not only by}} the blasting but also because of when the blasting was done, they had to clean out all the broken bottom soil and then deposit it somewhere.
