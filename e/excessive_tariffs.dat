He spoke for a [...] "market economy with system compliant social policy“ wherein the state's task is to ensure equal starting conditions and provide help to the weak, but where is little regulatory intervention in to the market economy.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{attempts}} to liberalize India's import trade regime, {{the structure of}} import licensing is still restrictive and complex and for most products, trade restrictions are probably redundant as protection. Reforming export policies alone - without reforming India's import and tax systems - will produce only marginal improvements. Problems in the export administration can be resolved only by making changes in four areas. (1) The import licensing system must be rationalizedto eliminate import restrictions on inputs and components. The import regime inflicts heavy administrative costs on the Indian economy. Imports of raw materials and other inputs essential for production are delayed, leaving downstream producers idle when domestic supplies are interrupted (which happens often). The export regime is still not rationalized for smaller producers, indirect exporters, and firms that rely on domestic suppliers. (2) Tariffs and excise taxes must be consolidated around two to three slabs and the quantitative restrictions in intermediate and capital goods must be eliminated so firms can be compensated accurately for their tax burdens. The system that exists is far two complex. (3) The absolute level of tariffs on inputs must be reduced to administer the duty-free import schemes efficiently. High tariffs encourage leakage of duty-free imports into the domestic market and abuse of high drawback rates (incentives). (4) Tariffs and taxes on capital goods must be reduced to reduce the costs of investment. Tariffs in India - especially on key intermediate products (metals and chemicals) and capital goods - are high and getting higher fast. The high cost of basic inputs increases the cost of production, leads to uneconomic import-substitution which causes pressure for more protection, and requires an elaborate, cumbersome system to compensate exporters. High tariffs and excise taxes on capital goods damage Indian competitiveness, adding 10 to 15 percent {{to the cost of}} production and severely handicapping exporters. The <b>excessive</b> <b>tariffs</b> do not fulfill their primary purpose of providing protection and incentives; they are aimed at mainly generating revenues. Public revenues should be generated through more efficient instruments especially taxes.

40|$|The {{investment}} return, tariff {{regime and}} concession period {{are the most}} important items that influence the success of a concession-based Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project. From the public partner’s perspective, whether a scheme is value-for-money or not dominates the decision making process. However, a seemingly favorable deal {{may turn out to be}} the least value-for-money option should it cause unnecessary social upheaval, such as <b>excessive</b> <b>tariff</b> increases or complaints. A scheme which is truly value-for-money is one which balances the interests of the public partner, investor and end-users. In this paper, a simulation model is proposed to assist a public partner to identify the concession period based on the expected investment and tariff regime. The needs for establishing different scenarios to represent the risks and uncertainties involved are presented, and a fuzzy multi-objective decision model i...|$|R
40|$|We use firm-level {{data for}} the Ethiopian {{manufacturing}} sector matched with commodity- level data on tariffs to {{examine the effect of}} trade liberalization on firm performance during the 1997 - 2005 period. We find relatively large positive effects of tariff reductions on total factor productivity, a result that is robust to treating tariffs as endogenous, and to various generalizations of the baseline model. This affects is primarily driven by mechanisms operating at high tariff level, suggesting that <b>excessive</b> <b>tariff</b> levels may be particularly distortionary. We find some evidence that the reduction of tariffs has resulted in smaller and more capital-intensive domestic firms. We note that these effects are consistent with the hypothesis that the trade liberalization has increased competition in the domestic market. We find no significant effect of the trade liberalization on entry or exit rates. ...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} factor in this industrial boom (as {{in the development of}} the fisheries) was, remarkably, the regulating role of the Dutch government: guaranteeing product quality gave Dutch products a reputation in foreign markets, that justified slightly higher prices, if need be. Other forms of market regulation, like the monopolies given to the VOC and WIC, but also the semi-official industry bodies that regulated the trade on Russia and the Levant, and the herring industry, helped stabilize market fluctuations. Patent protection helped stimulate industrial innovation. The sophisticated Dutch capital market was stabilized by regulated institutions like the Amsterdam Bank and Exchange, and the regulator of the insurance market. And maybe most importantly, the close connection of the Dutch regents to commercial interests in this period helped shield Dutch industry and commerce from <b>excessive</b> taxation or <b>tariffs.</b> Also, the Dutch government did not hesitate to put its not inconsiderable diplomatic and military might behind Dutch commercial interests, if the need arose to protect them against foreign protectionist measures.|$|R
