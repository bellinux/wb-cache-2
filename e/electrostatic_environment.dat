In this article, we use the recently developed method constant pH molecular dynamics (CPHMD) to explore the calculation of highly perturbed p K a values in variants of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase). Simulations were performed using the replica exchange (REX) protocol for improved conformational sampling with eight temperature windows, and yielded converged proton populations in a total sampling time of 4 ns. Our REX‐CPHMD simulations resulted in calculated p K a values with an average unsigned error (AUE) of 0. 75 pK units for the acidic residues in Δ + PHS, a hyperstable variant of SNase. For highly p K a ‐perturbed SNase mutants with known crystal structures, our calculations yielded an AUE of 1. 5 pK units and for those mutants based on modeled structures an AUE of 1. 4 pK units was found.

A total of six systems were simulated representing all combinations of these polarizable and nonpolarizable protein and water force fields. We find that all six systems behave in a similar manner in regions of the protein that are weakly electrostatic (either hydrophobic or weakly hydrophilic).
