5|$|As no {{complete}} dodo specimens exist, its <b>external</b> <b>appearance,</b> such as plumage and colouration, {{is hard to}} determine. Illustrations {{and written}} accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598–1662) are the primary evidence for its <b>external</b> <b>appearance.</b> According to most representations, the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage, with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. The head was grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws. A study {{of the few remaining}} feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather than plumaceous (downy) and most similar to those of other pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Pluteus aurantiorugosus is {{very similar}} to P.nevadensis in <b>external</b> <b>appearance,</b> and the two can only be {{reliably}} distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the former has oblong spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender. P.aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.|$|E

5|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar <b>external</b> <b>appearance.</b> C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, it was {{announced}} that the Willmott Dixon Group had been appointed as contractor on the scheme. The Council's planning committee in August 2012 deferred the approval decision, pending alterations to the <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> of the building. These were approved in October 2012, with demolition commencing in the same month. The regenerated Civic Centre area came back into use in late 2014 and early 2015.|$|E
50|$|The white-throated canary {{is a small}} bird about 15 cm {{long with}} {{generally}} dull-coloured plumage and a yellow or yellow-green rump. It has a heavy horn-coloured beak and brown irises. Its legs are brown. The male and female have similar <b>external</b> <b>appearances,</b> and juveniles resemble adults.|$|R

5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> apart from general size. The {{position}} of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|Based on <b>external</b> <b>appearance,</b> Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar}} to Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species may be {{difficult}} to distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E
5|$|From about 1493 until 1525 the {{architect}} {{appears to have}} been Seth Derwall, succeeded by George Derwall until 1537. Seth Derwall completed the south transept to a Perpendicular Gothic design, as seen in the transomed windows of the clerestory. He also built the central tower, southwest porch and cloisters. Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508, but it had not risen above the roofline {{at the time of the}} dissolution of the monasteries, and has never been completed. The central tower, rising to , is a “lantern tower” with large windows letting light into the crossing. Its <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> has been altered by the addition of four battlemented turrets by George Gilbert Scott in the 19thcentury.|$|E
50|$|After the Protestant Reformation, ridge turrets were raised, which {{changed the}} <b>external</b> <b>appearances.</b> In 1706 and in 1712, some repair work repairs {{were made on}} the church. The altar-piece was carved by a local artist in 1780. Major repair {{was carried out in}} 1924, under the {{leadership}} of architect Arnstein Arneberg, who later conducted extensive renovation of the Hamar Cathedral.|$|R
50|$|In {{the subtle}} {{currents}} of shogunate politics, {{he is said}} to have {{gone to great lengths to}} develop a sense of impartiality in judgement. When approached with a case to judge, he would place a lantern between himself and the speaker, and busy himself with making tea, so that he would not let <b>external</b> <b>appearances</b> interfere with his sense of justice.|$|R
50|$|The {{halls and}} palaces in the Forbidden City, for example, have rather low {{ceilings}} {{when compared to}} equivalent stately buildings in the West, but their <b>external</b> <b>appearances</b> suggest the all-embracing nature of imperial China. These ideas have {{found their way into}} modern Western architecture, for example through the work of Jørn Utzon. This of course does not apply to pagodas, which are limited to religious building complexes.|$|R
5|$|In the Despotate of Epirus, the Church of the Parigoritissa (1282–9) is {{the most}} complex example, with a domed octagon core and domed ambulatory. Built {{in the capital of}} Arta, its <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> resembles a cubic palace. The upper level narthex and {{galleries}} have five domes, with the middle dome of the narthex an open lantern. This Greek-cross octagon design, similar to the earlier example at Daphni, is one of several among the various Byzantine principalities. Another is found in the Hagia Theodoroi at Mistra (1290–6).|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that a church was present on the site in the Saxon era, although the earliest fabric in the church is Norman. The present ground plan {{was established in the}} 13th and 14thcenturies, from which time the church's <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> dates, apart from a major rebuilding in the later part of the 15thcentury, when the range of high windows or clerestory was added. All styles of English Gothic architecture, are represented in the church: Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular. During the civil war, a group of Roundheads stabled their horses in the church. In the 19thcentury the interior of the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott; some wall paintings were revealed, and stained glass was added.|$|E
5|$|The {{microscopic}} {{characteristics and}} cytogenetics of C.micaceus are well known, {{and it has}} been used frequently as a model organism to study cell division and meiosis in Basidiomycetes. Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus Coprinus. Based on <b>external</b> <b>appearance,</b> C.micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C.truncorum, {{and it has been}} suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.|$|E
60|$|But as {{the night}} still deepened, this one space of light faded, contracted, vanished, and with it {{disappeared}} the sentinel and the line of rampart on which he was posted.

5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600m². This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in <b>external</b> <b>appearance,</b> but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow {{at the nape of}} the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in <b>external</b> <b>appearance,</b> as with other macaws.|$|E
40|$|Insides and {{essences}} {{are both}} critical concepts for appreciating {{the importance of}} non-obvious entities: neither are observable, both contrast with <b>external</b> <b>appearances,</b> and both can {{be more important than}} <b>external</b> <b>appearances.</b> The present research examined understandings of insides and essences in 3 - to 5 - year-old children. In Study 1, children were asked questions requiring them to think about both the insides and the outer appearances of a series of objects. In Study 2, children were tested on their understanding that insides are typically more important than outer surfaces for an object's identity and functioning. In Studies 3, 4, and 5, children were tested on their understanding of innate potential, a concept that reflects understanding of an inborn essence. Contrary to the traditional view of children as externalists (cf. Piaget, 1951), these studies demonstrate that by age 4 children have a firm grasp of the importance of both insides and essences. Even by age 3 children reason clearly about the inside- outside distinction. These results suggest that preschool children attend to non- obvious features and realize their privileged status. They may also indicate a more basic predisposition toward psychological essentialism in young children...|$|R
50|$|Contrary to <b>external</b> <b>appearances</b> however, Black Jack {{possesses}} a complex personal code. He will cure a patient for free if they move {{him with the}} story of their suffering; however, he always establishes a patient's willingness to pay beforehand. If Black Jack cannot discover a redeeming story behind a patient, his fee stands. He also makes exceptions in exigent circumstances, and may change his mind if proven incorrect in his assumptions. He also always ensures that his patients recover completely.|$|R
5000|$|As for the {{differences}} between husband and wife, Aristotle says that these [...] "always" [...] consisted in <b>external</b> <b>appearances,</b> in speeches, and in honors. Aristotle advocated that, should a husband lose money and his reputation, a wife was to refrain from complaint and to attribute this to sickness, ignorance or accidental errors. He thought that, sometimes but not always, males were leaders, or, both the male and the female have the deliberative capacity of the soul, but he thought that in the female it lacked authority.|$|R
5|$|The present {{structure}} has many traces of great antiquity, being large and {{built in the}} form of a cross, with a door of early Gothic architecture. The building was probably erected some time after the Norman Conquest, as the plain pointed arch prevails throughout; exactly when we cannot be sure, though possibly after 1246. The earliest visible stonework is thirteenth century, in the tower and the arches supporting it. The <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> of the church is large and ancient, being erected of rubble stone, with ashlar quoins and windows. The severe appearance and thick walls of the nave suggest Norman architecture, however the presence of pointed lancet windows indicate that it is early Gothic, perhaps from early thirteenth century. Internally the church is {{in the form of}} an aisleless cruciform church with substantial transepts. It was rebuilt (or built afresh) in the thirteenth century after a fire, and the chancel extended in the fifteenth century, after which the structure was largely complete as it is seen today.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea mink}} was first {{described}} in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior {{similar to the}} American mink, in that it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, or just to nearby islands. Largest of the minks, the sea mink was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|This puffin has a black {{crown and}} back, pale grey cheek patches and white underparts. Its broad, boldly marked {{red and black}} beak and orange legs {{contrast}} with its plumage. It moults while at sea {{in the winter and}} some of the bright-coloured facial characteristics are lost. The <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> of the adult male and female are identical except that the male is usually slightly larger. The juvenile has similar plumage but its cheek patches are dark grey. The juvenile does not have brightly coloured head ornamentation, its bill is less broad and is dark-grey with a yellowish-brown tip, and its legs and feet are also dark. Puffins from northern populations are typically larger than their counterparts in southern parts of the range. It is generally considered that these populations are different subspecies.|$|E

50|$|A phylum is {{the highest}} level in the Linnaean system for {{classifying}} organisms. Phyla {{can be thought of}} as groupings of animals based on general body plan. Despite the seemingly different <b>external</b> <b>appearances</b> of organisms, they are classified into phyla based on their internal and developmental organizations. For example, despite their obvious differences, spiders and barnacles both belong to the phylum Arthropoda, but earthworms and tapeworms, although similar in shape, belong to different phyla. As chemical and genetic testing becomes more accurate, previously hypothesised phyla are often entirely reworked.|$|R
60|$|The king {{dissolved}} {{his last}} Parliament in 1629. He had now been endeavoring {{for four or}} five years to govern alone. He succeeded tolerably well, so far as <b>external</b> <b>appearances</b> indicated, up to this time. There was, however, beneath the surface, a deep-seated discontent, which was constantly widening and extending, and, soon after the return of the king from Scotland, real difficulties gradually arose, by which he was, in the end, compelled to call a Parliament again. What these difficulties were will be explained in the subsequent chapters.|$|R
