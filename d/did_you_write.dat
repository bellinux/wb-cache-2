40|$|How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> keep {{yourself}} on the writing path? Writing requires persistence and determination. Writing is a lonely task. Who are you accountable to when <b>you</b> are <b>writing?</b> First, <b>you</b> are accountable to yourself. Only {{you know what your}} <b>writing</b> goals are. <b>You</b> set the goals; you monitor the accomplishment of the goals. How clear are you about establishing your <b>writing</b> goals? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> everyday? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> on Tuesdays and Thursdays? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> in two-hour blocks or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have the luxury of taking a whole day or more for <b>writing?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> make a list of your writing goals and publish them prominently? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> review the goal list daily? Second, you may be accountable to a publisher or an editor. Deadlines are a great asset to goal achievement. Working to meet a deadline is a powerful inducement to productivity. Third, have <b>you</b> shared your <b>writing</b> goals with others? If you announce your goals to others, they will remind you of your commitments. Fourth, are you a member of a <b>writing</b> group? If <b>you</b> meet regularly with others who are committed to writing, the focus on <b>writing</b> may help <b>you</b> meet your <b>writing</b> goals. A writing group provides an opportunity to share your goals and report on your progress in meeting the goals. Goal specificity and a steady focus on the goals are essential to your writing success...|$|R
