5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, {{but it may also}} be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> it will cause weight gain.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, {{three years}} after the first performance, Rossini discreetly orchestrated the Petite messe solennelle, partly <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> others would do it anyway after his death. As he disliked the sound of cathedral boys' choirs, he {{requested}} permission from the pope to perform the work with female voices at a church. When his request was rejected, he demanded that the orchestral version would only be performed after his death. The composer preferred the chamber music version anyway.|$|E

50|$|On 30 January 2008 {{there was}} an {{explosion}} and fire at Sutton Courtenay Tyres and petrol station, which led to about 100 nearby houses being evacuated <b>for</b> <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> acetylene cylinders might explode.|$|R
5|$|In July of that year, McAleer {{presided over}} the Blues' upset 6–1 loss to the Detroit Tigers. Although the Tigers' manager, Tommy Burns, agreed to forfeit the game <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the umpire, Joe Cantillon, would be injured by an angry crowd, McAleer agreed to play the Tigers using a reserve umpire. The Blues {{eventually}} closed {{the season with a}} 54–82 record, placing seventh in the eight-team American League.|$|E
5|$|On {{the fourth}} orbit, {{drifting}} in an inverted spacecraft with the Earth 'above' him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the Echo 1 satellite while passing over East Africa. As he approached California, he spoke briefly to John Glenn in a two-minute conversation broadcast live across the United States {{on radio and}} television. Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the visor to clean it <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the suit temperature would misbehave again.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E

60|$|Answ. Fear, as I have showed you, may {{be taken}} several ways. 1. It {{may be taken}} <b>for</b> the <b>fear</b> of devils. 2. It may be taken <b>for</b> the <b>fear</b> of reprobates. 3. It may be taken <b>for</b> the <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> is wrought in the godly by the Spirit as a spirit of bondage; or, 4. It may be taken <b>for</b> the <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> I have been but now discoursing of.|$|R

5|$|The McClintock {{family moved}} to Brooklyn in 1908 and McClintock {{completed}} her secondary education there at Erasmus Hall High School; she graduated early in 1919. She discovered her love of science and reaffirmed her solitary personality during high school. She wanted to continue her studies at Cornell University's College of Agriculture. Her mother resisted sending McClintock to college, <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> she would be unmarriageable. McClintock was almost prevented from starting college, but her father intervened just before registration began, and she matriculated at Cornell in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.87 million {{following}} its broadcast on BBC One, however, despite the measures used to provide the balanced view, it was met with considerable controversy from Muslims, among them the Muslim Council of Britain, <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the episode would incite Islamophobia. Nearly a thousand complaints were made, although cast and crew members argued that the Muslims who opposed the episode {{did not understand the}} context.|$|E
5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The {{technician}} {{who did the}} research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E
50|$|Though author/illustrator Makoto Yukimura {{does not}} have a {{background}} in the sciences, the idea of Planetes came to him while reading a book called A Garbage Problem in Space: Space Debris, and found the Japanese phonetics for the word debris (deburi (デブリ)) amusing. Yukimura intentionally did not research space technology <b>for</b> <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> it would compromise his artistic freedom.|$|R

5|$|After his {{election}} to parliament in 1934, Davies was a consistent {{advocate for the}} interests of Merthyr Tydfil and the Welsh mining community. Largely indifferent to party discipline, he defied official Labour policy by championing such causes as disarmament and Welsh nationalism. His persistence in doing so brought him several suspensions from the party, and he was never offered ministerial office. An immensely popular figure locally, he was regularly returned at general elections with large majorities. In 1966, after an unstable colliery spoil tip collapsed on the village of Aberfan {{with the loss of}} 144 lives, Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe. He had not reported his suspicions, <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> an inquiry would cause the closures of local pits. Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph, Davies died early in 1972 aged at least 85 and possibly 90 or more.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Clark Kent first {{appears in}} the pilot episode of Smallville as a teen with superhuman {{abilities}} that he uses to help others. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole) as an infant, when he crash lands on Earth {{on the day of}} the Smallville meteor shower in 1989. Twelve years later, trying to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father, Clark saves the life of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), the son of billionaire Lionel Luthor (John Glover), and the pair become quick friends. During season one, Clark struggles with the burden of keeping his powers a secret from those close to him. In particular, he is afraid to open up to Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> she would not accept him if she learned of his supernatural abilities.|$|E

25|$|The Chasseurs Britanniques were {{originally}} formed from French Royalist emigres in 1801, and served throughout the wars. The unit served chiefly in the Mediterranean until 1811, when it {{participated in the}} later stages of the Peninsular War. It had a good record in battle but later became notorious for desertion, and was not even allowed to perform outpost duty, <b>for</b> <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> the pickets would abscond.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the plans}} for Tracy and Jenna, Jack tells Liz—the head writer for TGS—to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image. Liz {{recruits}} TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to help in her search, planning trips to comedy clubs to find new talent. Both agree {{to try to keep}} the process secret from the cast and crew <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> they would be angered over the idea of a new actor joining the cast. Liz and Pete give awkward answers trying to explain why they are going places together and ultimately tell the TGS writing staff. They also inadvertently tell Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) who, angered by the news, quits the show.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> unscrewing the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU) and the UN {{sought to}} replace the Vance plan, which brought in the UNPROFOR. They {{formulated}} the Z-4 Plan giving Serb-majority areas in Croatia substantial autonomy. After numerous and frequently uncoordinated changes to the proposed plan, including leaking of its draft elements to the press in October, the Z-4 Plan was presented on 30 January 1995. Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan. Croatia was concerned that the RSK might accept it, but Tuđman realised that Milošević, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK, would not accept the plan <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> it would set a precedent for a political settlement in Kosovoallowing Croatia to accept the plan with little possibility {{for it to be}} implemented. The RSK refused to receive, let alone accept, the plan.|$|E

5|$|In April 1951, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted {{orders for}} MacArthur authorizing nuclear attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese {{launched}} airstrikes originating from there against his forces. The next day Truman {{met with the}} chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, and arranged for the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control. Dean was apprehensive about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|October 3, 2001: At {{approximately}} 4:15a.m. local time, a passenger, Damir Igric, assaulted {{the driver}} of his bus, attempting to slit his throat, and causing the bus to crash near Manchester, Tennessee, killing Igric himself and five other passengers and injuring 32 others. Since the incident occurred {{three weeks after the}} September 11 terrorist attacks, Greyhound temporarily suspended all schedules as soon as the company learned of the incident <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> it may have been part of a larger co-ordinated attack. After investigation by the company and the FBI, it was confirmed that Igric had acted alone and service resumed later that afternoon. After the incident, Greyhound bus stations increased security, though not nearly to the same level as airports or train stations.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead {{ruled out}} an internet-only {{distribution}} <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> some fans {{would not have}} internet access.

Elsewhere, the album was released on 31 December 2007 by independent record label XL Recordings. The CD release came in a cardboard package containing the CD, lyric booklet, and several stickers that could {{be placed on the}} blank jewel case to create cover art. In Rainbows was the first Radiohead album available for download in several digital music stores, such as the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3. On 10 June 2016, it was added to the free streaming service Spotify.|$|E
