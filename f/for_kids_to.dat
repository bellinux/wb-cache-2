500|$|Many years later, authors Timothy Burke and Kevin Burke {{wrote in}} Saturday Morning Fever: Growing Up with Cartoon Culture called the show a [...] "special treat" [...] and {{appreciated}} it {{for being able}} to parody [...] "pop culture stables" [...] cleverly. They enjoyed that Waldo was selected as the main character because there was [...] "no more perfect a character <b>for</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> empathize with than a shy dreamer who lives out a thousand adventures in his or her head". They also speculated that Wishbone (1995–1997) contained the same premise as The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty, but with a dog as the main character instead of a cat. Producer Scheimer was hugely disappointed by the entire series, calling it [...] "a mistake on many levels".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{the park}} {{replaced}} Pharaoh's Secret with Happy Jack's Toy Factory and G.A. Boeckling's Eerie Estate opened. Dr. D. Mented's Asylum for the Criminally Insane was added in 2010.

Dr. D Mented's Asylum for the Crimally Insane was renamed Eternity Infirmary and The Edge of Madness show became The Edge of Madness -- Six Feet Under. Screamworks replaced Fright Zone and Blood on the Bayou was added along the lagoons under Iron Dragon. When Disaster Transport closed in 2012, so did Happy Jack's [...] Toy Factory. Terror Island was relocated under Maverick because the Dinosaurs Alive! attraction {{was using the}} path for Terror Island. Its name was changed to Cut Throat Cove.

[...] He added, [...] "if there's any justice in this world, McMahon will pay dearly for what his organization has done to further pain the Harts". Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, [...] "It was disgusting.... <b>For</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> see that, {{for this to be}} so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry on as if nothing had happened, is just sad." [...] Martha Hart, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} her husband's death. She said that McMahon [...] "absolutely should be there" [...] at the funeral. She also stated, [...] "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, but there will be a day of reckoning". Commenting on the WWF's decision {{to continue the}} show after her husband's death, Martha stated, [...] "After he lost his fight for life they just scooped him up and ordered the next match out. Where's the humanity? Would he have wanted the show to go on? Absolutely not." ...|$|E

[...] In early infancy, a middle name—Julius—was added, and for the rest of his life those who knew him well called him Julie. His father, a clothes presser and part-time cantor, struggled to make a living and to provide even marginal comfort for his small family. When Garfield was five, his brother Max was born. Their mother never fully recovered from what was described as a [...] "difficult" [...] pregnancy. She died two years later, and the young boys were sent to live with various relatives, all poor, scattered across the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and The Bronx. Several of these relatives lived in tenements in a section of East Brooklyn called Brownsville, and there, Garfield lived in one house and slept in another. At school, he was judged a poor reader and speller, deficits that were aggravated by irregular attendance.

[...] In his 2011 book, Barça: The Making of the Greatest Team in the World, Hunter writes, [...] "If the 175,000 FC Barcelona members (or socios) queued up in an orderly line, night after night, to massage his tired feet, cook his dinner and tuck him into bed; if they carried his golf clubs round Montanyá's hilly 18 holes; if they devoted 50 per cent of their annual salary to him... it still wouldn’t be near enough to repay the debt those who love this club owe Johan Cruyff," [...] adding, [...] "If he had not installed a culture, a philosophy at the Nou Camp, then Lionel Messi would have been rejected and sent home as an underdeveloped 13-year-old kid.

So that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it's just...it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe...it was a really easy symbol <b>for</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning.
