50|$|For example, an S-Video matrix routing {{switcher}} {{with the}} same capability (8×8) as a 16-point S-Video patch panel (8 patch cables connects 8 inputs and 8 outputs) may cost ten times more, though it would probably have more capabilities, including audio-follow-video and built-in <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Made up of 80 bits per frame, {{where there}} may be 24, 25 or 30 frames per second, LTC {{timecode}} varies from 960 Hz (binary zeros at 24 frames/s) to 2400 Hz (binary ones at 30 frames/s), and thus is comfortably in the audio frequency range. LTC can exist as either a balanced or unbalanced signal, and can be treated as an audio signal in regards to distribution. Like audio, LTC can be distributed by standard audio wiring, connectors, <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> and patchbays, and can be ground-isolated with audio transformers. It can also be distributed via 75 ohm video cable and video <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> although the voltage attenuation caused by using a 75 ohm system may cause the signal to drop to a level {{that can not be}} read by some equipment.|$|R
50|$|An Audio <b>Distribution</b> <b>Amplifier</b> {{also known}} as: a press feed; a pool feed; a media feed; press box; or an ADA, takes a single audio feed, usually a line input, {{but it may}} be a {{microphone}} input, and outputs multiple line or microphone outputs. This can be done using a passive feed, where the signal is split among the outputs, or as an active feed where the outputs are amplified. The primary use of the Audio <b>Distribution</b> <b>Amplifier</b> is to share a single audio feed with multiple members of the press pool. Thus the names press feed, pool feed and media feed.|$|E
50|$|The plant {{consists}} of trunk lines that run from one <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier</b> to the next. Feed lines run from a bridge amplifier inside the <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier</b> to taps that {{are placed in}} front of a section of close together homes. From the taps a drop, consisting of a buried or aerial coax, runs to each home that wishes to obtain service. Unused ports on a tap are normally terminated with anti-theft terminators. To extend the feed lines even further line extenders are used which are small amplifiers. Small systems have been built without trunk lines using only line extenders every few thousand feet.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{additional}} output puts additional [...] {{load on the}} source, {{which can}} cause signal degradation. Active splitters with buffer amplifiers (also known as a <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier)</b> are the only solution to provide an unlimited number of splits, but are costly.|$|E
50|$|In the United States {{and some}} other countries, cable {{television}} distribution systems use extensive networks of outdoor coaxial cable, often with in-line <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Leakage of signals {{into and out of}} cable TV systems can cause interference to cable subscribers and to over-the-air radio services using the same frequencies as those of the cable system.|$|R
40|$|The upgrade of a super trunk {{amplifier}} in {{the frequency}} range 47 - 862 MHz is described. It is shown that the technology is now available to push the output level over 120 dBµV. The triple beat and second order distortions are typically 80 dB down at the output level. This ultralinear feedforward amplifier is thus an immediate substitute for two <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers</b> of conventional design...|$|R
50|$|In analog systems (including {{systems that}} use digital {{recording}} but make the copy over an analog connection), generation loss is mostly due to noise and bandwidth issues in cables, amplifiers, mixers, recording equipment {{and anything else}} between the source and the destination. Poorly adjusted <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and mismatched impedances can make these problems even worse. Repeated conversion between analog and digital can also cause loss.|$|R

In September 2011, the Department of Science and Technology proposed to synchronise time nationwide in an effort to discourage tardiness. PAGASA installed a rubidium atomic clock, a GPS receiver, a time interval counter, <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier</b> and a computer to help calculate the time difference with every satellite within its antenna’s field of view.|$|E
50|$|Grass Valley Group {{was founded}} as a tiny {{research}} and development company in 1959 by Dr. Donald Hare {{in the small town}} of Grass Valley, California, in the foothills of California's Sierra Nevada range. Hare chose Grass Valley after learning about it from his friend, Charles Litton, Sr.. In 1964, Grass Valley demonstrated its first video product, a Video <b>Distribution</b> <b>Amplifier</b> in a hotel room at the National Association of Broadcasters convention. By 1968, the Grass Valley Group had introduced its first vision mixer/production switcher, the flagship product that helped build the company's reputation.|$|E
50|$|A Video <b>Distribution</b> <b>Amplifier</b> (also {{known as}} a {{distribution}} amp or VDA) takes a video signal as an input, amplifies it, and outputs the amplified video signal to two or more outputs. It is primarily used to supply a single video signal to multiple pieces of video equipment. It adjusts the amplitude of a video signal to compensate for loss of signal in a video distribution system. Extending {{the distance of the}} video signal is the main purpose of the VDA. There are VDAs built for all video formats, NTSC, ATSC, QAM16, QAM32, QAM64, Composite Video and Component Video.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the trunk}} cables, smaller {{distribution}} cables {{are connected to}} a port of the trunk amplifier to carry the RF signal and the AC power down individual streets. If needed, line extenders, which are smaller <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> boost the signals to keep {{the power of the}} television signal at a level that the TV can accept. The distribution line is then [...] "tapped" [...] into and used to connect the individual drops to customer homes.|$|R
50|$|Leitch technology's history {{begins in}} 1971 when Robert A. Lehtonen, Chairman and CEO, and James Leitch, {{combined}} their {{experience in the}} broadcast industry to form Leitch Video Inc. They created the world's first zero SCH sync pulse generator. The introduction of this equipment, which simplified the video editing process, represented {{one of the first}} digital products introduced into the broadcast market and {{led to the development of}} other products --- <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> processing amplifiers, clock systems and test signal generators.|$|R
5000|$|Link Electronics Ltd. {{was a major}} UK {{industrial}} and broadcast television equipment manufacturer and systems integrator in the 1970s and 1980s.

50|$|Around this time, {{the band}} {{addressed}} the constant {{demand for a}} Live Record. Mr. Blotto had been, from its inception, an improvisational band and had always allowed people to record the shows. A taper path was built that included an analog to digital converter, a <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and an open invitation for all to enjoy the high quality of a constant gain board patch in either digital or analog. As a result, clean Mr. Blotto boots began to cross the country, often {{in advance of the}} band—this is especially true outside of the Midwest, where they rarely tour.|$|E

50|$|After {{the sale}} to Avnet, the Channel Master name {{was used to}} import and {{distribute}} various electronic products, including home and car stereo equipment, turntables, cassette decks, 8-track players, quadraphonic audio, television receivers and scanner radios. In the 1980s, Channel Master was the only second source for General Instrument's Videocipher II module, a building block for satellite television receivers, under a licensing agreement for which Avnet paid GI a million dollars. The Channel Master 4251, a high-performance parabolic UHF television antenna, stood about seven feet in diameter. Channel Master also built <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers</b> for cable television, satellite dishes and satellite antenna accessories.|$|R
50|$|Trunk coaxial cables are {{connected}} to the optical node and form a coaxial backbone to which smaller distribution cables connect. Trunk cables also carry AC power which is added to the cable line at usually either 60 or 90 V by a power supply (with a lead acid backup battery inside) and a power inserter. The power is added to the cable line so that optical nodes, trunk and <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers</b> do not need an individual, external power source. The power supply might have a power meter next to it depending on local power company regulations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Whether distributing a house standard, {{adding a}} {{distribution}} module {{in a larger}} circuit design, or just working with a measurement system on the bench, one {{must be aware of}} how a number of <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier</b> parameters can make or break an entire system’s performance. This paper looks at a high performance quartz oscillator, a hydrogen maser, and a rubidium fountain’s performance both in the short-term and long-term to develop a model of the signals that one may want to measure or distribute. Two different classes of distribution amplifiers are then reviewed to see how they compare to the sources presented earlier. The front-to-back isolation and phase noise of a <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier</b> are not the only important parameters that need to be considered. Other important terms such as the return loss, stability over temperature, port-to-port isolation, differential delay over temperature, construction techniques, and design practices must be taken into account. Most of these parameters can be rigorously related in an equation to deliver an expected level of performance from the system. Typical manufacturing and design practices that are necessary to ensure a reliable device are presented. The goal of the paper being to better equip the reader with the skills to evaluate distribution amplifiers to find the one that best fits the needs and expectations in both reliability and overall system performance...|$|E
50|$|Ironically for {{a company}} whose legacy is a product that aims to stop people copying videos, Dwight Cavendish Developments’ main product range {{for nearly two decades}} was a series of {{equipment}} for professional video duplication houses. Before the advent of DVD, pre-recorded VHS tapes were usually manufactured by recording the signal onto each tape individually, using large banks of professional (or sometimes domestic) VCRs. Dwight Cavendish Developments sold equipment to run such systems, including <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> and systems to control large banks of VCRs. The company also promoted a quality control system, to automatically check for faults on the pre-recorded tapes, though it is not clear if this system was ever used widely.|$|R

40|$|Several {{documents}} describe {{aspects of}} the continuing development of a multichannel, dual-mixer system for simultaneous characterization of the instabilities of multiple precise, low-noise oscillators. One of the oscillators would be deemed to be a reference oscillator, its frequency would be offset by an amount (100 Hz) {{much greater than the}} desired data rate, and each of the other oscillators would be compared with the frequency-offset signal by operation of a combination of hardware and software. A high-rate time-tag counter would collect zero-crossing times of the approximately equal 100 -Hz beat notes. The system would effect a combination of interpolation and averaging to process the time tags into low-rate phase residuals at the desired grid times. Circuitry that has been developed since the cited prior article includes an eight-channel timer board to replace an obsolete commercial time-tag counter, plus a custom offset generator, cleanup loop, <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier,</b> zero-crossing detector, and frequency divider...|$|E
40|$|The Jefferson Lab Infrared Free Electron Laser (IRFEL) {{has used}} the 200 MHq 16 x 16 {{buffered}} crosspoint switch, AD 81 16 to implement video and analog distribution. These switches are configured as 64 inputs x 16 outputs packaged into a rack mount chassis, which is used for both the video and analog systems. These systems are controlled through EPICS.

40|$|An {{optoelectronic}} system distributes {{a reference}} signal of low noise and highly stabilized phase and frequency (100 MHz) from an atomic frequency standard {{to a remote}} facility at a distance up to tens of kilometers. The reference signal is transmitted to the remote station as amplitude modulation of an optical carrier signal propagating in an optical fiber. The stabilization scheme implemented in this system is intended particularly to suppress phase and frequency fluctuations caused by vibrations and by expansion and contraction of the optical fiber and other components in diurnal and seasonal heating and cooling cycles. The system (see figure) comprises several subsystems, the main one being (1) a hydrogen-maser or linear-ion-trap frequency standard in an environmentally controlled room in a signal-processing center (SPC), (2) a stabilized fiber-optic distribution assembly (SFODA), (3) a compensated sapphire oscillator (CSO) in an environmentally controlled room in the remote facility, (4) thermally stabilized <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and cabling from the environmentally controlled room to end users, and (5) performance- measuring equipment...|$|R
50|$|SWR {{is used as}} {{a measure}} of {{impedance}} matching of a load to the characteristic impedance of a transmission line carrying radio frequency (RF) signals. This especially applies to transmission lines connecting radio transmitters and receivers with their antennas, as well as similar uses of RF cables such as cable television connections to TV receivers and <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Impedance matching is achieved when the source impedance is the complex conjugate of the load impedance. The easiest way of achieving this, and the way that minimizes losses along the transmission line, is for both the source and load to be real, that is, pure resistances, equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. When there is a mismatch between the load impedance and the transmission line, part of the forward wave sent toward the load is reflected back along the transmission line towards the source. The source then sees a different impedance than it expects which can lead to lesser (or in some cases, more) power being supplied by it, the result being very sensitive to the electrical length of the transmission line.|$|R
