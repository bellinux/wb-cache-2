500|$|Tarwater {{entered the}} June 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials {{with a new}} perspective: [...] "I want to swim as fast as I can, be the best man I can be, and let the chips fall where they may", he said. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> team ... that would be unbelievable. If I don’t make this team, I plan to still be a champion." [...] He entered the {{competition}} ranked fourth in the 100-meter butterfly, fifth in the 200-meter butterfly, and also qualified in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle. He chose to scratch the 100-meter freestyle {{to concentrate on the}} 200-meter butterfly and freestyle. [...] Tarwater made the 200-meter freestyle finals; the top six finishers qualified for the Olympic 4×200 relay team, but Tarwater finished seventh. [...] He missed making the Olympic team by fourteen one-hundredths (0.14) of a second.|$|E
500|$|Lord of Scoundrels is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} Regency romance novel, though its story {{is set in the}} post-Regency era of 1828. It features a strong female heroine, a characteristic that Chase has become known for including in her romances. The author explains that [...] "for most of history, and in too many cases today, women are considered (and too often consider themselves) lesser beings who do not matter. In my books, the women are not lesser, and they do matter. In other words, <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> world the way I think it should be". Romantic fiction scholars have identified Jessica Trent as a [...] "feminist heroine" [...] with whom the [...] "alpha male hero" [...] has met his match. Chase inverts many qualities typical of the archetypical romantic hero and heroine. Near the end of the story, Jessica is the one who initiates consummation of their marriage, by seducing Dain. Afterwards, Jessica promptly falls asleep, causing her husband to seethe [...] "that was what he was supposed to do".|$|E
500|$|There are {{contradictory}} claims {{as to who}} was {{the leader}} of the coup and had managed its execution, coming from Simović, Mirković, and Major Živan Knežević. Mirković claimed sole credit immediately after the coup and stated on its tenth anniversary that: [...] "Only after I had informed General [...] about my idea and he had accepted it did <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> decision to undertake the planned revolt. I made the decision myself, and I also carried out the whole organization. I made the decision as to when the revolt would take place." [...] It is likely that he had been a planning a coup since 1937 when an Italo-Yugoslav pact was signed. King Peter later credited simply the [...] "younger and middle ranks [...] of the Yugoslav army" [...] for the coup in a speech on 17 December 1941. Simović's response was published posthumously, he claimed that he [...] "stood {{in the center of the}} whole undertaking" [...] and [...] "personally engaged his assistant Brigadier General Bora Mirković for the action". Tomasevich considers Mirković's account to be the more credible of the two, and points out it is corroborated from several sources, both Allied and Axis. The matter would play a role in the factionalism that would divide the soon-to-be Yugoslav government-in-exile during the war.|$|E

2500|$|Later that night, at the post-fight press conference, Érik further {{explained}} his reasoning for brawling with the Filipino slugger; [...] "It {{was a great}} pleasure to fight this way. I think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I need to put a little flavor into the ring. My promoter always says that <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{her status}} as the most famous black model of her time, Campbell never earned the same volume of {{advertising}} assignments as her white colleagues, {{and she was not}} signed by a cosmetics company until as late as 1999. In 1991, she revealed, [...] "I may be considered one of the top models in the world, but in no way do <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> same money as any of them." [...] Throughout her career, Campbell has been outspoken against the racial bias that exists in the fashion industry. In 1997, she stated, [...] "There is prejudice. It is a problem and I can't go along any more with brushing it under the carpet. This business is about selling, and blonde and blue-eyed girls are what sells." ...|$|E
