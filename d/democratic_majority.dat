5|$|At {{the start}} of the show, Underwood is a <b>Democratic</b> <b>Majority</b> Whip in the House of Representatives, where he has {{represented}} South Carolina's 5th congressional district since 1990.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican in {{a heavily}} Democratic state, Bradley found little success {{early in his}} {{political}} career. He was defeated for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of Ulysses S. Grant at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he was nominated for governor in 1887. Although he lost the contest to Simon Bolivar Buckner, he reduced the usual <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> substantially. He was again nominated for governor in 1895. Capitalizing on divisions in the Democratic Party over the issue of free silver, he defeated Parker Watkins Hardin in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate for blacks and did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Congresswoman Kilroy {{introduced}} legislation including {{a bill to}} start a three-year pilot program to lend $20 million per year to small businesses (HR5322) and introduced an amendment to assign liability to credit reporting agencies which passed. She voted with the <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> for the federal stimulus package, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, the cap and trade carbon emissions legislation, and the federal health insurance reform legislation.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time since 1913, <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> were elected to both Houses of the Legislature. It {{remained}} the only time until 1965.|$|R
50|$|At the New York state election, 1964, on November 3, <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> {{were elected}} {{to both the}} State Senate and the State Assembly for the session of 1965.|$|R
30|$|By “liberal democracy” Galston means {{a form of}} {{political}} organization in which individual and associational rights limit the scope of legitimate governmental authority and the powers of <b>democratic</b> <b>majorities.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, {{largely as a result}} of the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a deadlock in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of Republican president William McKinley in 1896 deepened the Democrats' resolve {{to oppose the}} Republican governor and his allies. Moreover, when the legislature convened in 1898, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in both houses was overwhelming. Bradley's message to the General Assembly in 1898 called for numerous reforms including spending cuts to reduce government waste, putting the state's charitable institutions under control of a non-partisan board, and reforms to public education and legal system.|$|E
5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the split}} of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> in both Houses into {{followers}} of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, neither House could be organized, {{and a month}} of deadlock ensued.|$|R
5000|$|According to the 1955 book, Zeb's Black Baby, by Samuel Thomas Peace, Sr., {{this was}} a {{political}} decision to concentrate blacks and Republicans in one county and keep <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> in the other counties, an example of gerrymandering: ...|$|R
50|$|Ramstad {{considered}} ending {{discrimination against}} those suffering from {{mental health and}} addiction problems {{a major part of}} his legacy, and worked under both Republican and <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> to pass a Mental Health Parity Bill. Mental Health Parity was eventually passed and signed into law in December, 2008.|$|R
5|$|An incensed <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in the Kentucky General Assembly {{created a}} {{committee}} to investigate the charges of voter fraud, even as armed citizens from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky poured into the state capital under auspices of keeping Democrats from stealing the election. Before the investigative committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering the state capitol on January 30, 1900. As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds, the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly invalidate enough votes to give the election to Goebel. The report was accepted, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died three days later on February 2.|$|E
5|$|By January 1859, friends knew Breckinridge desired the U.S. Senate seat of John J. Crittenden, whose term expired on March 3, 1861. The General Assembly would elect Crittenden's {{successor}} in December 1859, so Breckinridge's election {{would not}} affect any presidential aspirations he might harbor. Democrats chose Breckinridge's friend Beriah Magoffin over Linn Boyd as their gubernatorial nominee, bolstering Breckinridge's chances for the senatorship, the presidency, or both. Boyd {{was expected to}} be Breckinridge's chief opponent for the Senate, but he withdrew on November 28, citing ill health, and died three weeks later. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in the General Assembly elected Breckinridge to succeed Crittenden by a vote of 81 to 53 over Joshua Fry Bell, who Magoffin had defeated for the governorship in August.|$|E
5|$|The 1874 House {{elections}} {{produced a}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> for the 44th Congress, and Blaine’s time as Speaker {{was at an}} end. This gave Blaine more time to concentrate on his presidential ambitions, and to develop new policy ideas. One result was a foray into education policy. In late 1875, President Grant made several speeches {{on the importance of}} {{the separation of church and}} state and the duty of the states to provide free public education. Blaine saw in this an issue that would distract from the Grant administration scandals and let the Republican party regain the high moral ground. In December 1875, he proposed a joint resolution that became known as the Blaine Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{district}} {{had been}} altered after the 1990 census to preserve large <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> {{in the neighboring}} [...] of Bill Clay and [...] of Dick Gephardt. Horn had appealed for a new map, even asking for a share of St. Louis, but was rebuffed by Clay and Gephardt.|$|R
50|$|Leslie Cagan, {{who heads}} the anti-war group United for Peace and Justice, has {{endorsed}} the planned demonstrations in Denver. Code Pink stated it would participate in the rallies, hoping to pressure <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> in the U. S. Congress {{to do more to}} end the then ongoing war in Iraq.|$|R

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, Smith accepted in principle that white minority rule {{could not be}} prolonged indefinitely. He oversaw the 1979 general election which resulted in Abel Muzorewa, a politically moderate black bishop, being elected Prime Minister. Both ZANU and ZAPU had boycotted the election, which did not receive international recognition. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979, held in Lusaka, the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher surprised delegates by announcing that the UK would officially recognise Rhodesia's independence if it transitioned to <b>democratic</b> <b>majority</b> rule.|$|E
5|$|Underwood is from Gaffney, South Carolina. He {{graduated}} from The Sentinel (a fictionalized version of The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina) in 1981 and, subsequently, Harvard Law School in 1984. Some of Underwood's dialogue throughout {{the series is}} presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique that breaks the fourth wall. The character speaks with a Southern accent. During season 1, he is the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Majority</b> Whip in the United States House of Representatives. In season 2, he is the newly appointed Vice President of the United States, before becoming President of the United States in the season finale.|$|E
5|$|When United States Senator Morton died in 1878, the Republicans {{nominated}} Harrison {{to run for}} the seat, but {{the party}} failed to gain a majority in the state legislature, which at that time elected senators; the <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> elected Daniel W. Voorhees instead. In 1879, President Hayes appointed Harrison to the Mississippi River Commission, which worked to develop internal improvements on the river. As a delegate to the 1880 Republican National Convention the following year, he was instrumental in breaking a deadlock on candidates, and James A. Garfield won the nomination.|$|E
50|$|He {{was briefly}} {{chairman}} of the U.S. Senate Committee on the District of Columbia for the 81st Congress (to which the 1948 election had returned <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities).</b> In the Senate, McGrath opposed reducing wartime economic controls and taxes, wishing to spend the latter instead on Social Security, national health insurance, and education.|$|R

50|$|As a Republican {{mayor in}} an {{overwhelmingly}} Democratic city, and facing large <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> {{on the city}} council throughout her tenure, Sheldon took a moderate and conciliatory approach to governance. Like many Michigan Republicans from Ann Arbor, she was a fiscal conservative and a social liberal, with a practical rather than ideological approach to the city's problems.|$|R
5|$|Clements {{never again}} sought an elected office after his defeat by Morton, though he {{remained}} active in state politics {{and continued to}} lead the anti-Chandler faction of his party. From 1957 to 1959, {{at the insistence of}} Lyndon Johnson, he served {{as executive director of the}} United States Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and helped ensure the election of a fourteen-seat <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in the Senate. He considered running for governor again in 1959, but ultimately decided against it. Without Clements in the race, the anti-Chandler faction was unable to unite behind either former candidate Bert T. Combs or former Louisville mayor Wilson Wyatt. Clements united the faction behind Combs, making Wilson Wyatt their candidate for lieutenant governor and promising him support for later races. Combs defeated the Chandler candidate, Harry Lee Waterfield in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election.|$|E
5|$|Descended from a {{prominent}} political family, Beckham {{was chosen as}} Democrat William Goebel's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 {{despite the fact that}} he turned 30, the minimum age for governor, during the campaign. Goebel lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor, but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results. During the political wrangling that followed, an unknown assassin shot Goebel. A day later the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give the election to Goebel, who was sworn into office on his deathbed. Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and Beckham over the governorship. Beckham ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state. Beckham later won a special election to fill the remainder of Goebel's term (since less than half the term had expired) and election in his own right in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> passed them over their opposition.|$|E
5000|$|... {{has been}} {{dominated}} by Republicans for most of its existence, with only four years of <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> in the State House of Representatives since 1915 and only Republican majorities in the same period. Since 1967, however, five of the last nine governors have been Democrats, although one of these Democrats only held office for two years.|$|R
50|$|Elections to the U.S. Congress {{during this}} period saw almost {{exclusively}} Democratic senators and either totally or almost-totally Democratic House rule. From 1872 to 2002, Georgia voters consistently elected Democrats as governor and <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> to the state legislature. Like many other Southern states, the Democratic-controlled legislature established run-off elections for primaries in which no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote.|$|R
50|$|At {{this time}} there were two major {{political}} parties: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, the Socialist Labor Party, and the Socialist Workers Party also nominated tickets. At the New York state election, 1964, on November 3, <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities</b> were elected to both the State Senate and the State Assembly for the session of 1965.|$|R
5|$|Having {{served in}} both houses of the state legislature, Johnson saw {{election}} to Congress as the next step in his political career. He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated Jonesborough lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892. In Washington, he joined a new <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in the House of Representatives. Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti-abolitionist stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs. With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the Library of Congress. Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, James K. Polk, was elected president in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the two men had difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority</b> in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{departed}} in November 1833 for Washington, D.C., {{where the}} Twenty-third United States Congress convened its regular session on December 2. Jackson's second term was under way, and the House {{had a strong}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority,</b> whose primary focus was to prevent the Second Bank of the United States from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund internal improvements with federal money. He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements {{the responsibility of the}} states. Pierce's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835. When not in Washington, he attended to his law practice, and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the Twenty-fourth Congress.|$|E
5000|$|Cecile Fabre {{argues that}} [...] "it is {{legitimate}} to constrain <b>democratic</b> <b>majorities,</b> {{by way of}} the constitution, to respect and promote those fundamental rights of ours that protect the secure exercise of our autonomy and enable us to achieve well-being. Insofar as, by virtue of Ch. 1, social rights are such fundamental rights, it follows that they should be constitutionalized." ...|$|R
2500|$|After 16 days of {{hearings}} the Committee recommended Mr. Strauss' confirmation {{to the full}} Senate {{by a vote of}} 9-8. In preparation for the floor debate on the nomination, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>majority's</b> main argument against the nomination was that Mr. Strauss' statements before the Committee were [...] "sprinkled with half truths and even lies...and that under rough and hostile questioning, [...] can be evasive and quibblesome." ...|$|R
50|$|Both {{houses of}} the state {{legislature}} had large <b>Democratic</b> <b>majorities.</b> William H. Murray, who had served {{as the president of}} the state constitutional convention, was elected by his colleagues as the first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Henry S. Johnston, who had served as the presiding officer of the state constitutional convention, was elected to serve as the first President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate.|$|R
