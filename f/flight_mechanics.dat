25|$|Aerodynamics is {{important}} {{in a number of}} applications other than aerospace engineering. It is a significant factor in any type of vehicle design, including automobiles. It {{is important}} in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads. Structural engineers also use aerodynamics, and particularly aeroelasticity, to calculate wind loads in the design of large buildings and bridges. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways atmospheric circulation and <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages {{is important in}} heating/ventilation, gas piping, and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.|$|E

25|$|The Aviation Systems Division conducts {{research}} and development in two primary areas: air traffic management, and high-fidelity flight simulation. For air traffic management, researchers are creating and testing concepts to allow {{for up to three}} times today's level of aircraft in the national airspace. Automation and its attendant safety consequences are key foundations of the concept development. Historically, the division has developed products that have been implemented for the flying public, such as the Traffic Management Advisor, which is being deployed nationwide. For high-fidelity flight simulation, the division operates the world's largest flight simulator (the Vertical Motion Simulator), a Level-D 747-400 simulator, and a panoramic air traffic control tower simulator. These simulators have been used for a variety of purposes including continued training for space shuttle pilots, development of future spacecraft handling qualities, helicopter control system testing, Joint Strike Fighter evaluations, and accident investigations. Personnel in the division have a variety of technical backgrounds, including guidance and control, <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics,</b> flight simulation, and computer science. Customers outside NASA have included the FAA, DOD, DHS, DOT, NTSB, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} and <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> {{were the most}} praised aspects of the game. Tom Guise from Computer and Video Games heralded the game's flight system and freedom as captivating, while stating that Nights into Dreams is the [...] "perfect evolution" [...] of a Sonic game. GamePro said flying using the analogue joystick [...] "is a breeze" [...] and that the gameplay is fun, enjoyable, and impressive. Entertainment Weekly said its [...] "graceful acrobatic stunts" [...] offer [...] "a more compelling sensation of soaring than most flight simulators". Edge praised the game's analogue controller and called the levels [...] "well-designed and graphically unrivalled", but the reviewer expressed disappointment in the limited level count compared to Super Mario 64, and suggested that Nights seemed to prioritise technical achievements and Saturn selling points over gameplay with as clear a focus as Sonic. Martin Robinson from Eurogamer opined that the <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> were a [...] "giddy thrill", in contrast to Sonic games. Colin Ferris from Game Revolution praised the {{graphics and}} speed of the game as breathtaking and awe-inspiring, concluding that it offered the best qualities of the fifth-generation machines. GameFan praised the combination of [...] "lush graphics, amazing music, and totally unique gameplay". Next Generation criticised the fast tempo of the game, saying that the only disappointing aspect was the way [...] "it all rushes by so fast". However, the magazine praised the two-player mode and the innovative method of grading the player once they completed a level. Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers were impressed with both the technical aspects and style of the graphics, and said the levels are great fun to explore, though they expressed disappointment that the game was not genuinely 3D and said it did not manage to surpass Super Mario 64.|$|E
500|$|The team wanted Journey of Dreams {{to revolve}} around a {{dramatic}} storyline {{in the hope}} that the player would find it more engaging and intuitive, as Iizuka thought the original Nights into Dreams was not user-friendly. Originally, the game had a full free-roaming 3D flight system, but Iizuka thought it was too complex and [...] "not as fun" [...] as the core flight element featured in the original game. Iizuka thought the most difficult challenge of the development process was keeping the game's <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> fun while building upon elements of the original game. To recreate the experience, the team tested a variety of controller schemes which included the Wii remote and Nunchuk, the GameCube controller, and the Classic Controller—the latter two left for players who preferred using a traditional controller configuration. Initially, the game used the Wii remote by having the player point it at the screen, but the team discovered that its motion sensors would not pick up small movements, so Iizuka created an alternative hybrid motion-pointer system, which he believed would retain the game's fun-to-fly experience. In a retrospective interview, Iizuka said that the entire game was created from scratch and used a new engine specifically designed for the Wii.|$|E

500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{was well}} {{received}} by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release {{review of the}} Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L. Kent found that the <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> and vast areas featured in Pilotwings 64 make {{it one of the}} most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, [...] "The graphics, sound, control, and all around excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride." [...] Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, [...] "You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, [...] "challenge without competition" [...] aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that [...] "The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, but the bottom line is that PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo." [...] A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: [...] "It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Michael Collins {{reported}} nine {{sightings of}} Ivory-billed Woodpeckers in the Pearl River in Louisiana in 2006 and 2008, including an encounter in which kent calls came from two directions {{at the same}} time, and an additional sighting (of two birds) in the Choctawhatchee River in 2007. Three of these sightings are supported by video evidence. Additional analysis of these videos was published in an earlier paper, along with comments by independent experts. Bret Tobalske, an ornithologist who specializes in the <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> of woodpeckers, performed an analysis of wing motion {{and concluded that the}} bird in the 2008 video is a large woodpecker. Only two large woodpeckers occur north of Mexico, but the flap rate is about ten standard deviations greater than the mean flap rate of the pileated woodpecker. The flight speed, narrow wings, and prominent white patches on the dorsal surfaces of the wings are also consistent with ivory-billed but not pileated woodpecker. Avian artist Julie Zickefoose analyzed the 2006 video and commented on the [...] "rared-back pose, long but fluffy and squared-off crest, and extremely long, erect head and neck" [...] and an unusual short flight that {{does not seem to be}} consistent with a pileated woodpecker. A size comparison was carried out using part of the tree in which the bird in the 2006 video was perched. Two forks made it possible to scale frames from the video relative to a photo of a pileated woodpecker specimen that was mounted on the tree. On the basis of the comparison, it is clear that the bird in the video is a large woodpecker, and the size appears to be consistent with an ivory-billed woodpecker. The 2007 video shows events involving a woodpecker delivering a blow that is accompanied by an audible double knock, unusual swooping flights that are consistent with historical accounts of the ivory-billed woodpecker, and a takeoff with deep and rapid flaps that are similar to the flaps of the closely related imperial woodpecker (Campephilus imperialis) taking off.|$|E
