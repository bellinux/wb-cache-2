50|$|Gate valves {{may have}} <b>flanged</b> <b>ends</b> which are drilled {{according}} to pipeline compatible flange dimensional standards. Gate valves are typically constructed from cast iron, ductile iron, cast carbon steel, gun metal, stainless steel, alloy steels, and forged steels.|$|E
50|$|Craftsmen often pierced and {{decorated}} the <b>flanged</b> <b>ends</b> of the maces {{of this period}} beautifully. These flanges gradually became smaller, and by the 16th or early 17th century had developed into pretty projecting scroll-brackets and other ornaments, which remained in vogue until about 1640. The next development in the embellishment of the shaft was the reappearance of these small scroll-brackets on the top, immediately under {{the head of the}} mace. They disappear altogether from the foot in {{the last half of the}} 17th century, and remain only under the heads, or, in rarer instances, on a knob on the shaft. The silver mace-heads were mostly plain, with a cresting of leaves or flowers in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the reign of James I of England they began to be engraved {{and decorated}} with heraldic devices and similar ornamentation.|$|E
50|$|A butt plug is a sex toy that is {{designed}} to be inserted into the rectum for sexual pleasure. In some ways, they are similar to a dildo, but they tend to be shorter, and have a <b>flanged</b> <b>end</b> to prevent the device from being lost inside the rectum.|$|R
50|$|Early in the 15th {{century the}} <b>flanged</b> <b>end</b> of the mace (the {{head of the}} war mace) was carried uppermost, with the small button bearing the royal arms in the base. By the {{beginning}} of the Tudor period, however, the blade-like flanges, originally made for offence, degenerated into mere ornaments, while the increased importance of the end with the royal arms (afterwards enriched with a cresting) resulted in the reversal of the position. The custom of carrying the <b>flanged</b> <b>end</b> upward did not die out at once: a few maces, such as the Winchcombe silver maces, which date {{from the end of the}} 15th century, were made to be carried both ways. The Guildford mace provides one of the finest of the fifteen specimens of the 15th century.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a flanged neoprene bushing with a nut embedded in the non-flanged end. The bolt is passed {{through one of the}} pieces to be fastened and threaded onto the nut from the <b>flanged</b> <b>end.</b> The non-flanged end is then inserted through the other piece to be fastened. As the bolt is tightened, friction from the neoprene flange against the piece being fastened prevents the nut from turning. The bushing is compressed by the nut, forming a lip behind the piece being fastened, which compresses the fastened piece and seals the bolt hole. It can also be used in a solid workpiece. As the screw draws the embedded nut towards it, the walls of the well exert a force on the hole walls, anchoring it.|$|R
40|$|An energy {{absorbing}} device {{used as a}} load limiting member in a structure to control its response to applied loads is described. It functions by utilizing a spool assembly having <b>flanged</b> <b>ends</b> and an interior cavity of sufficiently large diameter to cause it to deform plastically at a prescribed load. In application, the spool is utilized as a pivot point for the legs of an airplane seat. When properly designed and integrated into the seat arrangement the spool will twist about its axis, deforming plastically when the impact load exceeds the spool yield value. Through this deformation, the spool absorbs the kinetic energy of {{the movement of the}} seat at a substantially constant rate, thereby controlling the level of loads transmitted to the seat occupant. By proper sizing and collection of materials, it is possible to control load response in a predictable manner...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Currently applied {{endoscopic}} palliative {{treatment of}} advanced rectosigmoidal carcinoma is {{hampered by the}} cost of the equipment, the need for repeated, often painful treatment sessions, and the occurrence of complications. Metallic expandable stents are effective in the palliation of malignant esophageal and biliary stenoses. We evaluated the use of a new type of self-expandable nitinol stent in the palliation of rectosigmoidal carcinoma. METHODS: In 10 patients with advanced obstructing rectosigmoidal carcinoma, initial Nd:YAG laser treatment was performed if necessary to allow passage of a gastroscope. Subsequently, a self-expanding nitinol stent with <b>flanged</b> <b>ends</b> was inserted under combined fluoroscopic and endoscopic control. Endoscopic and clinical follow-up was carried out at regular intervals. RESULTS: After 2 +/- 0. 4 sessions of initial laser therapy, minimal lumen diameter was 9 +/- 1 mm. Stent insertion was successful in 9 patients, increasing minimal lumen diameter to 14 +/- 1. 2 mm (p < 0. 005). In one patient, stent deployment was complicated by a sigmoid perforation, requiring surgery. After insertion, colorectal stents remained adequately positioned and free of obstruction for 103 +/- 31 days. Patient survival after stent placement was 204 +/- 43 days. Stent migration occurred in 3 patients, after 38 +/- 10 days. Obstruction of the stent because of tumor ingrowth was observed in only one patient, after 268 days. CONCLUSION: Insertion of self-expandable nitinol stents in patients with rectosigmoidal carcinoma is technically feasible. Metallic stents are effective in the palliation of malignant rectosigmoid obstruction; they provide an alternative to repeated palliative laser therapy or palliative surgery. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of the Doty-Wendt Paper laying machine, in Hawaii, [s. d. ]. A man {{stands behind}} two horses, which drag a device called a "paper laying machine" through the muddy soil, leaving paper mulch above {{the roots of}} crops. The {{background}} is neutral.; Back of photoprint reads: "Doty-Wendt Paper Laying Machine (From the Hawaiian Planters' Record issued October 1922 by the Experiment Station of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association) 'The results already obtained indicate {{that the use of}} paper as a mulch above the roots of pineapple plants is destined to become a common practice in the pineapple agriculture of the future. The adaptation of the paper mulch to pineapple culture has been a very simple matter, requiring only slight deviation from planting methods already in vogue. A suitable bed of earth is first prepared to receive a row of pineapples; the paper is then applied to this bed in long strips, its edges being held down by a covering of soil; and the pineapple plants are inserted through holes made in the paper at proper intervals. Up to the present time, the preparation of the bed and the laying of the paper has been done by hand and, consequently, at considerable expense. The machine illustrated herewith prepares the bed, lays the paper and covers its edges in one operation and at very moderate expense. It may be drawn by mules or by a light tractor. There are three essential parts to this machine, each part performing a definite function: (1) A plank drag-sled which pulverizes the soil and forms it into a bed of the desired shaped to receive the paper; (2) A flanged roller or spool which is attached {{to the rear of the}} sled and shapes the paper over the bed, tuning its edges down into the furrows made by the sled runners; and (3) Shovels or disks which are placed just back of the <b>flanged</b> <b>ends</b> of the roller and which serve to throw the soil against and over the edges of the paper. The sled may be modified to draw the soil into a bed of any shape desired. The spool should be shaped to conform to the crown of the bed, its barrel being cylindrical if the top of the bed is to be flat and concave if the top of the bed is to be curved"...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to fabricate subscale candle filters using a Ce-ZTA reticulated foam material. Specifically Selee fabricated 60 mm diameter cylinders with one closed <b>end</b> and one <b>flanged</b> <b>end.</b> Selee Corporation developed a small pore size (5 - 10 {micro}m) filtration membrane which {{was applied to the}} reticulated foam surface to provide a barrier filter surface. The specific tasks to be performed were as follows: (Task 1) Filter Element Development [...] To fabricate subscale filter elements from zirconia toughened alumina using the reticulated foam manufacturing process. The filter elements were required to meet dimensional tolerances specified by an appropriate filter system supplier. The subscale filter elements were fabricated with integral flanges and end caps, that is, with no glued joints. (Task 2) Membrane Development [...] To develop a small pore filtration membrane that is to be applied to the reticulated foam material. This membrane was to provide filtration characteristics that meet gas turbine requirements and pressure drop or permeability requirements specified by the filter system supplier. (Task 3) Subscale Filter Element Fabrication [...] To fabricate six subscale filter elements with integral flanges and closed ends, as well as fine pore size filtration membranes. Three filters were to have a central clean gas channel, while three would have no central channel. The filters were to be provided to FETC for testing in laboratory systems or pilot scale exposure systems as appropriate. The candles were to meet dimensional tolerances as provided by filter system suppliers...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{records were}} made from the {{interior}} of the right heart and attached vessels in 14 normal subjects. Technics differed somewhat from those previously reported in that simultaneously record-ing string galvanometers were used exclusively, and tracings were made whenever the catheter-electrode was moved within the heart. Previously unreported large positive QRS deflections were found in records from {{the lower part of the}} right atrium, from the pulmonary artery, and in two instances from within the right ventricle itself close to the base. The possible anatomical origin of these is discussed. SEVERAL papers 1 - 10 are available on the nature of the electrical records obtained from {{the interior of the}} human heart. The additional verbal reports being made with increasing frequency attest to the interest in the possible answers these records may supply to many questions in fundamental electro-cardiographic theory. Intracardiac leads in man were begun in this laboratory in 1946. This report is con-cerned with the findings in 14 subjects with normal hearts as determined clinically. Em-phasis will be placed on those aspects of our studies which differ from or supplement those previously reported. METHODS The catheters * used were 100 em. long and ranged in caliber from 6 F to 9 F. They consisted of a core of fine copper wire connected at the distal end to a silver electrode and at the proximal end to an ordinary electrical plug. All of the wire and the proximal, <b>flanged</b> <b>end</b> of the electrode were encased in specially impregnated radiopaque nylon or silk. The exposed tip of the electrode was 3 mm. in length. In early experiments this was coated wit...|$|R

500|$|... "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] is 2 minutes 51 seconds {{long and}} is in the key of B major. The track begins with an intro with a lead guitar melody, which plays twice, {{accompanied}} by drums, bass, distorted rhythm guitar and saxophone. The first verse begins on 14 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines [...] "Fe gawsom ni, ysbeidiau heulog, ysbeidiau heulog" [...] with a vocoder being used on the second [...] "ysbeidiau heulog". This entire phrase is then repeated, with Rhys accompanied by harmony backing vocals. Throughout this first part of the verse the only instrumentation is a distorted bass guitar and drums. The second half of the verse begins at 28 seconds with rhythm guitar, playing the chords B, B, A and E twice with little sustain, joining the drums and bass, which is no longer distorted. The track breaks down for the first chorus with Rhys singing [...] "ysbeidiau heulog" [...] four times backed by harmony vocals and occasional keyboard noises with the band rejoining on the last [...] "heulog", the rhythm guitar playing an A chord on each of the word's two syllables which are emphasised by cymbal crashes. After a drum fill an instrumental passage begins at 53 seconds. This follows the same arrangement as the intro although the lead guitar plays a melody line just once {{during the second half of}} the section, simply feedingback for the first half. The second verse starts at 1 minute 8 seconds leading into the second chorus which this time features drums fills and rhythm guitar alongside Rhys' vocals. A short bridge plays at the end of the chorus with Rhys singing [...] "Oedd ein cariad ni, heulog tan ddaeth glaw yn llif". Instrumentation is sparse with a guitar, featuring flanging, playing several licks alongside bass and drums, which are heavily affected by flanging. The bridge leads into the third and last chorus, which follows the arrangement of the second chorus although this time the drums feature <b>flanging.</b> The track <b>ends</b> with an instrumental outro similar to the intro. The outro begins at 2 minutes 16 seconds and features a second lead guitar with a wah-wah effect playing licks alongside the main lead guitar and saxophone. After the guitar melody has played twice the main lead guitar stops playing and the track begins to fade out.|$|R
