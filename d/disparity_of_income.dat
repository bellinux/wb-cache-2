Another criticism also includes that the system goes against the constitution's preaching of equality by having preference over people, not on merit, but for their skin colour and is considered the opposite of what many people fought for during the Apartheid era. Official affirmative action {{policies have}} seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. An increasing number of black candidates who are supposed to be beneficiaries of affirmative action are dissociating themselves from it, largely because of the perception that the appointments are not based on merit.

In its first section, we show that the middle class was formed through an egalitarian income distribution system after World War Ⅱ and that the consumption of the middle class made rapid economic growth possible. However, this pattern of economic growth gradually disappeared in the 1990 s, and the <b>disparity</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> distribution increased, which is the main reason of Japan's economic stagnation.
