5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as well, as they are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Sycorax – all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E

When he was 17, he won an essay contest with his local gym, and his prize was free wrestling training with Sweet Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchison in Toronto. He put his wrestling aspirations aside to help pay the bills. He held numerous jobs and then attended Humber College, where he graduated with a degree in radio broadcasting, then received training.|$|E
5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> {{a girl like}} Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E

He resumes his task of finding Mary, and chooses to search a local hotel where he and Mary spent their vacation. On the way, James finds Maria alive and unharmed in a locked room.

25|$|On June 14, 2007, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, {{reacted to}} the Hamas {{takeover}} by announcing {{the dissolution of the}} current unity government and declaring state of emergency.

25|$|Critical opinion has {{generally}} held Avellaneda's work in low regard, and Cervantes himself is {{highly critical of}} {{it in his own}} Part 2. However, it is possible that Cervantes would never have completed his own continuation {{were it not for the}} stimulus Avellaneda provided. Throughout Part 2 of Cervantes' book Don Quixote meets characters who know of him from their reading of his Part 1, but in Chapter 59 Don Quixote first learns of Avellaneda's Part 2, and is outraged since it portrays him as being no longer in love with Dulcinea del Toboso. As a result of this Don Quixote decides not to go to Zaragoza to take part in the jousts, as he had planned, because such an incident features in that book. From then on Avellaneda's work is ridiculed at frequent intervals; Don Quixote even meets one of its characters, Don Alvaro Tarfe, and gets him to swear an affidavit that he <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> the true Don Quixote before.|$|E
