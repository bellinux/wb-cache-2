5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata {{has been}} {{reported}} as susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, but in a 2008 study this pathogen {{was found to have}} no direct impact on the species. As a result of this finding, together with the low percentage of populations infested or facing imminent infestation, the species was classed as <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low extinction risk.|$|E

5|$|Boron is {{a special}} case, being the only nonmetal in group 13. The alkali metal borides tend to be boron-rich, {{involving}} appreciable boron–boron bonding involving deltahedral structures, and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high vapour pressure at elevated temperatures. This makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700°C, and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess. Furthermore, exceptionally in this group, reactivity with boron decreases down the group: lithium reacts completely at 700°C, but sodium at 900°C and potassium not until 1200°C, and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium. Rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised. Various phases are known, such as LiB10, NaB6, NaB15, and KB6. Under high pressure the boron–boron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following Wade's rules to forming Zintl anions {{like the rest of}} group 13.|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E

25|$|Much {{the most}} celebrated {{features}} of the site today are the three large temples in the Archaic version of the Greek Doric order, dating from about 550 to 450 BC.

Above the columns, only the second Temple of Hera retains most of its entablature, the other two having only the architrave in place.|$|E
25|$|Over 2,000 {{athletes from}} 201 nations competed in 47 events in total, with {{both men and}} women <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> similar {{schedule}} of events.

The women's schedule lacked the 50km race walk and included 100 m hurdles and heptathlon as opposed to the men's 110 m hurdles and decathlon. The youngest participant in the athletics competition was Andorran 15-year-old Cristina Llovera while the oldest was 46-year-old Ukrainian Oleksandr Dryhol. South African Oscar Pistorius became the first amputee sprinter to compete at the Olympics.|$|E

25|$|Stengel {{kept his}} word and named Paige to the 1953 All-Star team despite Paige not <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good year. He {{got in the}} game in the eighth inning. First, Paige got Gil Hodges to line out, then after Roy Campanella singled up the middle, Eddie Mathews popped out. He then walked Duke Snider, and Enos Slaughter lined a hit to center to score Campanella. National League pitcher Murry Dickson drove in Snider, but was thrown out at second base trying to stretch the hit into a double. Paige ended the year with a disappointing 3–9 record, but a respectable 3.53 ERA. Paige was {{released}} after the season when Veeck once again had to sell the team.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin Aislabie (14 January 1774 – 2 June 1842) was a cricketer {{who played}} {{first-class}} cricket between 1808 and 1841. A wine merchant by trade who had supplied Lord Nelson with wine, {{he was also}} the president of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1823 and secretary from 1822 until his death in 1842. Aislabie was notable for <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor first-class record wherein he scored only 224 runs at a meagre batting average of 3.15 from 56 first-class matches played over a period of 34 years. His lack of skill was further hampered by his girth, and towards {{the end of his career}} he was so obese that he had a permanent runner who also used to field for him.|$|E
25|$|Oroonoko is {{the first}} English novel to show Africans in a {{sympathetic}} manner. At the same time, this novel {{is as much about}} the nature of kingship as it is about the nature of race. Oroonoko is a prince, and he is of noble lineage whether of African or European descent, and the novel's regicide is devastating to the colony. The theatrical nature of the plot follows from Behn's previous experience as a dramatist. The language she uses in Oroonoko is far more straightforward than in her other novels, and she dispenses {{with a great deal of}} the emotional content of her earlier works. Further, the novel is unusual in Behn's fictions by <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> clear love story without complications of gender roles.|$|E
