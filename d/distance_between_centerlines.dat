30|$|Longitudinal spacing of anchors or anchor {{groups may}} have two effects {{depending}} on the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centerlines</b> of anchors. For anchors that have a large longitudinal spacing, the strains in the sheet behind the first row of anchors dropped significantly. The second row of anchors did not contribute to force development in the FRP sheet until the debonding front had passed beyond the first row of anchors. At this point, the force in the sheet {{was developed by the}} first row of anchors and a combination of anchor and bond in the region surrounding the second row of anchors. The effect of anchors spaced widely apart in the longitudinal direction was to increase the ductility of the system without affecting the strength of the system significantly.|$|E

A supervised feed forward back propagation neural network {{is used to}} predict the surface settlement during twin-tunnelling while surface buildings are considered in the models. The performance of the statistical neural network structure is tested on a dataset provided by numerical parametric studies conducted by ABAQUS software based on Shiraz line 1 metro data. Six input variables are fed to neural network model for predicting the surface settlement.

40|$|Purpose: To {{introduce}} a semiautomatic algorithm {{to perform the}} registration of free-hand B-Mode ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the carotid artery. Methods: The authors' approach combines geometrical features and intensity information. The only user interaction consists of placing three seed points in US and MRI. First, the lumen centerlines are used as landmarks for point based registration. Subsequently, in a joint optimization the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centerlines</b> and the dissimilarity of the image intensities is minimized. Evaluation is performed in left and right carotids from six healthy volunteers and five patients with atherosclerosis. For the validation, the authors measure the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the mean surface distance (MSD) between carotid lumen segmentations in US and MRI after registration. The effect of several design parameters on the registration accuracy is investigated by an exhaustive search on a training set of five volunteers and three patients. The optimum configuration is validated on the remaining images of one volunteer and two patients. Results: On the training set, the authors achieve an average DSC of 0. 74 and a MSD of 0. 66 mm on volunteer data. For the patient data, the authors obtain a DSC of 0. 77 and a MSD of 0. 69 mm. In the independent set composed of patient and volunteer data, the DSC is 0. 69 and the MSD is 0. 87 mm. The experiments with different design parameters show that nonrigid registration outperforms rigid registration, and {{that the combination of}} intensity and point information is superior to approaches that use intensity or points only. Conclusions: The proposed method achieves an accurate registration of US and MRI, and may thus enable multimodal analysis of the carotid plaque...|$|E

In this work we propose an innovative method for the extraction of carotid vessels centerline from three-dimensional Color Doppler ultrasound images. The method was tested on carotid Color Doppler images of eighteen healthy subjects and validated by calculating the Euclidean <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> the <b>centerlines</b> detected by the algorithm and those manually annotated by two experts in the corresponding original US volumes.

40|$|Abstract. Thermal contact {{resistance}} {{plays an important}} role in many domains, such as microelectronics and nuclear reactors. This paper proposes a more comprehensive model for the prediction of constriction resistance of rough contact between nominally flat surfaces in vacuum. Firstly, a 3 D geometrical asperity contact model is proposed based on the analysis of the profile of actual engineering surface. In this model, the contact is not simplified as a rough surface contacting with a perfectly smooth surface, but described as two rough surfaces. Oblique contact is considered and the effects of several parameters such as the shape of the asperity, the depth of interference, and the radial <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>centerlines</b> of the contacting asperities are investigated. Some mathematical derivations for constriction resistance are performed, and a series of numerical simulations are also carried out, covering a wide range of values of these parameters in practice applications. A comprehensive correlation for constriction resistance as a function of these parameters is finally obtained by nonlinear curve fitting, and it is validated through some comparisons and it can be used to predict more accurately the thermal {{contact resistance}} between rough surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging {{allow for the}} acquisition of contrast-enhanced volumetric images {{of the human heart}} region. High resolution CTA images are vital in obtaining precise information about the structure of the coronary arteries and help to make more accurate clinical diagnosis of coronary heart disease. This work is focused on an automated method for the reconstruction of individual coronary artery centerlines. An algorithm to automatically identify the centerlines of coronary arteries in a three-dimensional CTA image set based on local tubular matching was developed. The algorithm is seeded with manually speciﬁed starting points at the distal location of a coronary artery and then proceeds iteratively toward the junction with the aorta. The algorithm makes necessary corrections to account for motion artifacts and is able to perform on the images of moderately diseased arteries. Twelve cardiac CTA cases were used for algorithm validation. For each case, the four longest visually discernible branches of the major coronary arteries were evaluated. For 85 % of these branches, the algorithm was able to extract the entire centerline automatically from a single manual initialization. In addition, the geometric accuracy of the reconstruction was evaluated by measuring the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> automatically extracted and manually marked centerlines. For the five artery segments used in this study, the average <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>centerlines</b> did not exceed 0. 70 mm with the maximum distance of 2. 15 mm. These results indicate that the suggested method can be successfully used to approach the goal of automated coronary artery segmentation...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of a self-centering moment-resisting frame (SC-MRF) {{is characterized by a}} gap opening and closing at the beam-column interface under earthquake loading. Energy dissipation is provided by supplemental elements that deform under the gap opening behavior. The gap opening behavior also causes the SC-MRF to expand, where in the deformed position the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the column <b>centerlines</b> increases relative to the original distance. This behavior imposes new design requirements on the floor diaphragm design. The objective {{of this study is to}} analytically evaluate the effects of the floor diaphragm stiffness, strength, and configuration on the seismic response of a SC-MRF and to evaluate the different components of axial force that develop in the beam. The results show that these parameters significantly affect the seismic performance of a SC-MRF.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a motion planning method of redundant manipulator for painting uniform thick coating {{on the interior}} of irregular duct of some aircrafts. Discontinuous peripheral painting method is employed by analyzing the restrictions during painting the duct. For improving the longitudinal uniformity of thick coating, the interlacing painting method plans two sets of sweeping paths and an interlacing <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the starting paths of the two times of painting. The interlacing distance and overlapping distance are optimized by establishing and analyzing the model of longitudinal uniformity. To enhance the transverse uniformity, sweeping speeds for curved surfaces are calculated by the ratio of transfer efficiency after the basic sweeping speed for the plane is determined. The intertwining method, minimizing {{the sum of the}} weighed <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> the duct <b>centerline</b> and key points of the manipulator links, is employed for the joint trajectory planning without collision.

40|$|Purpose: Vessel lumen {{centerline}} extraction {{is important}} for intraoperative tracking of abdominal vessels and guidance of endovascular instruments. Three-dimensional ultrasound has gained increasing acceptance as a safe and convenient surgical image guidance modality. We aimed to optimize vascular centerline detection and tracking in 3 D ultrasound. Method: To overcome the intrinsic limitation of low ultrasound image quality, an active contour method (snake) was used to track changes in vessel geometry. We tested two variants of a classic snake using the image gradient and gradient vector field (GVF) as external forces. We validated these methods in liver ultrasound images of 10 healthy volunteers, acquired at three breath-holding instances during the exhalation phase. We calculated the <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> the vessel <b>centerlines</b> as detected by algorithms and a gold standard consisting of manual annotations performed by an expert. Results: Both methods (GVF and image gradient) can accurately estimate the actual centerlines with average Euclidean distances of 0. 77 and 1. 24 mm for GVF and gradient, respectively. Both methods can automatically follow vessel morphology and position changes. Conclusions: The proposed approach is feasible for liver vessel centerline extraction from 3 D ultrasound images. The algorithm can follow {{the movement of the}} vessels during respiration; further improvements of hardware components are needed for a real-time implementation. © 2013 CARS...|$|R
40|$|In the {{idealization}} {{of structural}} frames, certain questions require special comments. The {{most important of}} these are; the effective span lengths, effective moment of inertia, and conditions of supports. In an elastic frame analysis, a structure is usually represented by a simple line diagram, which is based on the <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> columns and between floor beams. Actually, the depths of beams and the widths of columns amount to sizable fractions of the respective lengths are considerably smaller than their <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> joints. It is evident that the usual assumption in a frame analysis that the members are prismatic, with constant moment of inertia <b>between</b> <b>centerlines,</b> is not strictly correct. A beam intersection with a column may be prismatic up to the column face, but from that point to the column centerline, it has a greatly increased depth, with a moment of inertia that could be considered infinite compared with that of the remainder of the span. In addition, some eccentricities occur on the column axis due to variation of column dimensions and erroneous production. In this study, the effects of the selection of column longitudinal axes at planar frame system structures were investigated...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a nested PID {{steering}} control in vision based autonomous vehicles is designed and experimentally tested to perform path {{following in the}} case of roads with an uncertain curvature. The control input is the steering wheel angle: it is designed {{on the basis of the}} yaw rate, measured by a gyroscope, and the lateral offset, measured by the vision system as the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the road <b>centerline</b> and a virtual point at a fixed distance from the vehicle. No lateral acceleration and no lateral speed measurements are required. A PI active front steering control based on the yaw rate tracking error is used to improve the vehicle steering dynamics. The yaw rate reference is computed by an external control loop which is designed using a PID control with a double integral action based on the lateral offset to reject the disturbances on the curvature which increase linearly with respect to time. The proposed control scheme leads to a nested architecture with two independent control loops that allows us to design standard PID controls in a multivariable context (two outputs, one input). The robustness of the controlled system is theoretically investigated with respect to speed variations and uncertain vehicle physical parameters. Several simulations are carried out on a standard big sedan CarSim vehicle model to explore the robustness with respect to unmodelled effects. The simulations show reduced lateral offset and new stable μ-split braking maneuvres in comparison with the model predictive steering controller implemented by CarSim. Finally the proposed control law is successfully tested by experiments using a Peugeot 307 prototype vehicle on the test track in Satory, 20 km west of Paris...|$|R

A PI active front {{steering control}} {{on the basis of the}} yaw rate tracking error is designed to compensate for constant disturbances while improving vehicle steering dynamics and reducing the influence of parameter variations. The yaw rate reference is viewed as the control input in an external control loop: it is designed using a PID control based on the lateral offset measurements to reject the disturbances on the curvature during autonomous control, i. e., when the driver is not exerting any torque on the steering wheel. A third control block is designed to allow the driver to control the vehicle (for example, lane change for passing purposes or obstacle avoidance) overriding the automatic lane-keeping action while maintaining the advantages of the yaw rate feedback.
