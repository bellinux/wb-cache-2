50|$|The nine {{teams of}} the Classification Round were {{allocated}} in another {{three groups of}} three teams, depending on {{their position in the}} previous round. Group J <b>determined</b> <b>positions</b> 9th to 11th, Group K <b>determined</b> <b>positions</b> 12th to 14th and Group L <b>determined</b> <b>positions</b> 15th to 17th (last).|$|R

50|$|A {{marker beacon}} is a {{particular}} type of VHF radio beacon used in aviation, usually in conjunction with an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> along an established route to a destination such as a runway.|$|E
50|$|One way to <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> is {{to match}} {{the data from the}} unknown {{location}} with a large set of known locations using an algorithm such as k-nearest neighbor. This technique requires a comprehensive on-site survey and will be inaccurate with any significant change in the environment (due to moving persons or moved objects).|$|E
5000|$|One {{alternative}} to GPS is WiFi triangulation which uses the MAC addresses of nearby wireless access points to <b>determine</b> <b>position.</b> Automatic geotagging relies on media acquisition devices that contain GPS, aGPS, or WiFi or other local positioning systems. Many camera phones are also equipped {{to use the}} methods of mobile phone tracking.|$|E
40|$|The {{arrangement}} has a first {{general lighting}} LED (L 1), a second general lighting LED (L 2) {{and a third}} general lighting LED (L 3) e. g. fluorescence LED, for transmitting three light signals (S 1 -S 3) that comprise three transmission time information (T 1 S-T 3 S) and three transmitter information in three wavelength ranges, respectively. The transmitter information of the third LED <b>determines</b> <b>position</b> (P 3) of the third LED, and the time information of the third LED is transmitted to the light signal of the third LED. The wavelength ranges partially overlap in an overlapping range. Independent claims are also included for the following: (1) a system for <b>determining</b> <b>position</b> of a moving object, comprising general lighting LED arrangement (2) a method for <b>determining</b> <b>position</b> of a moving object (3) a computer program comprising a program code for executing a method for <b>determining</b> <b>position</b> of a moving object...|$|R

50|$|Since VFR {{flights are}} not {{necessarily}} conducted on straight lines between ground-based radio navigation transmitters, the altitude restrictions for IFR flights are not applicable. Instead, a VFR flight can be conducted using pilotage, watching landmarks to <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> and desired direction. In this situation, the minimum reception altitude becomes moot, and the over-riding concern is for obstacle clearance.|$|E
5000|$|Once in flight, a {{principal}} {{task of the}} FMS {{is to determine the}} aircraft's position and the accuracy of that position. Simple FMS use a single sensor, generally GPS in order to <b>determine</b> <b>position.</b> But modern FMS use as many sensors as they can, such as VORs, in order to determine and validate their exact position. Some FMS use a Kalman filter to integrate the positions from the various sensors into a single position. Common sensors include: ...|$|E
50|$|Since angle {{measurements}} from {{at least}} two receiver stations are needed to <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> and to eliminate false alarms due to meteors or aircraft, the outputs must be collected at a central point and processed… One detection (encoded in digital form) requires a total of less than 100 bits. One telephone line from a receiving station to a central control could easily handle 70 or more detections per minute, a rate much higher than would be expected from any foreseeable space population.|$|E
40|$|Use of moire {{patterns}} to <b>determine</b> <b>positions</b> extended to three dimensions. Concept requires two moire templates or grids, separated from each other. Template on side closer to observer contains alternating black and transparent areas. Template farther from observer contains alternating {{black and white}} areas. Observer <b>determines</b> <b>position</b> of center of perspective, also receiving indication of depth even without stereoscopic view. Used in rangefinding applications in which precision not required. Also used to gauge location of mobile robot in environment hostile to humans...|$|R

50|$|The 1955-56 British Home Championship was a {{football}} tournament played during the 1955-56 season between the British Home Nations. It {{was the only}} occasion during the hundred-year run of the Home Championship in which all four teams finished level on points. As goal difference {{was not used to}} <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> until 1979, all four teams shared the trophy, holding it for three months each. Had goal difference been used to determine the winner, then England would have won with Scotland second.|$|E
50|$|A GPS {{receiver}} processes the GPS signals {{received on}} its antenna to <b>determine</b> <b>position,</b> velocity and/or timing. The signal at antenna is amplified, down converted to baseband or intermediate frequency, filtered (to remove frequencies outside the intended frequency range for the digital signal that would alias into it) and digitalized; these steps may be chained {{in a different}} order. Note that aliasing is sometimes intentional (specifically, when undersampling is used) but filtering is still required to discard frequencies {{not intended to be}} present in the digital representation.|$|E
50|$|Professional sextants use a click-stop degree {{measure and}} a worm {{adjustment}} that reads to a minute, 1/60 of a degree. Most sextants {{also include a}} vernier on the worm dial that reads to 0.1 minute. Since 1 minute of error is about a nautical mile, the best possible accuracy of celestial navigation is about 0.1 nmi m. At sea, results within several nautical miles, well within visual range, are acceptable. A highly skilled and experienced navigator can <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> to an accuracy of about 0.25 nmi m.|$|E

50|$|Water quality {{modeling}} {{involves the}} prediction of water pollution using mathematical simulation techniques. A typical water quality model consists {{of a collection of}} formulations representing physical mechanisms that <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> and momentum of pollutants in a water body. Models are available for individual components of the hydrological system such as surface runoff; there also exist basinwide models addressing hydrologic transport and for ocean and estuarine applications. Often finite difference methods are used to analyse these phenomena, and, almost always, large complex computer models are required.|$|E
5000|$|Idiothetic {{literally}} means [...] "self-proposition" [...] (Greek derivation), {{and is used}} in navigation models (e.g., of a rat in a maze) {{to describe}} the use of self-motion cues, rather than allothetic, or external, cues such as landmarks, to <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> and movement. The word is sometimes also spelled [...] "ideothetic" [...] (e.g.,Chen et al, 1994 [...] ). Idiothetic cues include vestibular, optic flow and proprioception. Idiothetic cues are important {{for the type of}} navigation known as path integration in which subjects navigate purely using such self-motion cues.|$|E
50|$|The International Cup {{consisted}} of one-day limited overs matches, {{with both sides}} allocated forty overs of eight balls each. Two points were awarded for a win, one for a no result or abandonment. If points were level, combined run rate would <b>determine</b> <b>position.</b> The two top two sides contested the first semi-final. The winner of that match progressed to the final, while the loser played the bottom side in the second semi-final for the other place in the final. The final was a one-off winner-takes-all match.|$|E

50|$|Retinoic acid is a {{metabolite}} {{of vitamin}} A (retinol) that mediates {{the functions of}} vitamin A required for growth and development. Retinoic acid is required in chordate animals, which includes all higher animals from fish to humans. During early embryonic development, retinoic acid generated in a specific region of the embryo helps <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> along the embryonic anterior/posterior axis by serving as an intercellular signaling molecule that guides development of the posterior portion of the embryo. It acts through Hox genes, which ultimately control anterior/posterior patterning in early developmental stages.|$|E
5000|$|Handbooks often {{contained}} {{a wealth of}} information beyond sailing directions. For instance, they frequently had detailed physical descriptions of shorelines, harbors, islands, channels, notes about tides, landmarks, reefs, shoals and difficult entries, instructions on how to use navigational instruments to <b>determine</b> <b>position</b> and plot routes, calendars, astronomical tables, mathematical tables and calculation rules (notably the rule of marteloio), lists of customs regulations at different ports, medical recipes, instructions on ship repair, etc. [...] As a result, the nautical chart never fully replaced the handbook, but remained supplementary to it.|$|E
