5|$|Betty Dean Sanders {{was born}} on May 28, 1934, to Ollie Mae Sanders and Shelman Sandlin. Sandlin was 21 years old and Ollie Mae Sanders was a teenager; the couple was unmarried. Throughout her life, Betty Sanders {{maintained}} {{that she had been}} born in Detroit, Michigan, but early records—such as her high-school and college transcripts—show Pinehurst, Georgia, as her place of birth. Authorities in Georgia and Michigan <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to locate her birth certificate.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{billions of}} small black cubes appear across the globe. The Doctor arrives and he, Amy, and Rory {{are taken to}} UNIT headquarters, where Commander Kate Stewart {{explains}} that they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to analyze the cubes' function. The Doctor waits with Amy and Rory for several days to monitor the situation, and gets to know Rory's father, Brian. The Doctor deems the cubes harmless and departs, though instructs Brian to keep watch.|$|E
5|$|Stamper {{was working}} as a pianist rather than as a {{songwriter}} at the time the song appeared but never learned how to read or write using traditional music notation thus he would <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> submit the song for copyright, or produce sheet music to prove his claim. Bayes and Norworth compelled Stamper at one point to wear stage make-up to appear Japanese, apparently to keep him from being interviewed by reporters.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> {{to recover}} enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and {{is an example of}} high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E
5|$|As night approaches, the {{brothers}} <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to find Gordon. Dean {{decides to go}} after Gordon while Sam stays hidden, but Sam refuses. He then confronts Dean about his reckless behavior since his deal with a Crossroads Demon, which left him only a year to live. Dean claims {{that he is not}} scared of his impending death, but Sam challenges this. Dean eventually relents, agreeing to behave more like his old self again. The two then prepare to wait out the night.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have had {{positive effects on}} some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited greatly from anthropogenic changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, {{they appear to have}} a more specialised diet and <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to incorporate exotic food into their diet. A notable exception is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.|$|E

5|$|Narcissi {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular garden plants in Islamic culture. Prior to the Arab conquest of Persia, the Persian ruler Khosrau I is said to <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to {{tolerate}} them at feasts because they reminded him of eyes, an association that persists to this day, as described by the poet Ghalib. The eye imagery is also found in a number of poems by Abu Nuwas. Another poet who refers to narcissi, is Rumi. Even the prophet Mohammed is said to have praised the narcissus.|$|E
5|$|With {{river traffic}} increasing, damage from barge {{collisions}} increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges {{than any other}} bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp bend in the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River fine-spotted {{cutthroat}} trout (or Snake River {{cutthroat trout}}) {{is the only}} native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies {{by the state of}} Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.|$|E
