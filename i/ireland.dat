5|$|A {{more recent}} theory, with broad support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and {{language}} arrived in <b>Ireland</b> {{as a result}} of cultural diffusion. This theory proposes that the Celticisation of <b>Ireland</b> may have been the culmination of a long process of social and economic interaction between <b>Ireland,</b> Britain and adjacent parts of Continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|After the World Cup, former West Indies cricketer Phil Simmons {{took over}} the role of coach from Birrell. India were {{scheduled}} to play South Africa in a series of One Day Internationals in <b>Ireland</b> in June 2007. <b>Ireland</b> also played one-off matches at Stormont against the two teams. Missing several players from their World Cup squad, <b>Ireland</b> lost both games. <b>Ireland</b> hosted a quadrangular tournament in Dublin and Belfast in July involving the West Indies, the Netherlands, and Scotland. <b>Ireland</b> and the West Indies both won their games against Scotland and the Netherlands with their direct encounter ending in no result due to rain. The West Indies won the tournament because of a bonus point won against the Netherlands. Trent Johnston stepped down as captain and was replaced by William Porterfield in March 2008.|$|E

5|$|An area {{in which}} the island {{operates}} as a single market is electricity. For much of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of <b>Ireland</b> and Northern <b>Ireland</b> were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern <b>Ireland</b> is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern <b>Ireland</b> Electricity (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of <b>Ireland,</b> the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid is building a HVDC transmission line between <b>Ireland</b> and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.|$|E
5|$|Bellinger is {{the only}} <b>Ireland</b> King of Arms known to have made any grants of arms.

5|$|By 1209 de Gray was in <b>Ireland</b> {{serving as}} the king's governor, an office {{sometimes}} referred to as justiciar for <b>Ireland.</b> One possible reason for his appointment was to save him from being accused of ignoring the interdict on England. As a bishop, it was de Gray's ecclesiastical duty to enforce the interdict, but by going to <b>Ireland,</b> which was not under interdict, he could continue to serve the king without provoking the papacy. De Gray's chief policy in <b>Ireland</b> was to extend English rule, to which end he was involved in battles on the River Shannon and in Fermanagh. He also replaced the Irish coinage with English, and attempted unsuccessfully to make English laws applicable in <b>Ireland.</b> De Gray's term of office in <b>Ireland</b> coincided with a time of change in Irish governmental practices.|$|E
5|$|By 1541, King Henry VIII of England {{had broken}} with the Church of Rome and {{declared}} himself Supreme Head of the Church of England. The pope's grant of <b>Ireland</b> to the English monarch became invalid, so Henry summoned {{a meeting of}} the Irish Parliament to change his title from Lord of <b>Ireland</b> to King of <b>Ireland.</b> However much of the island was beyond English control, resulting in the extended Tudor conquest of <b>Ireland</b> that only made the Kingdom of <b>Ireland</b> a reality in 1603, {{at the conclusion of the}} Nine Years' War (<b>Ireland).</b> Nevertheless, <b>Ireland</b> retained its own parliament, becoming an independent state in 1642-1649 (Confederate <b>Ireland),</b> and again in 1688-91. Only warfare such as the Williamite War in <b>Ireland</b> and subsequent occupation enabled the English crown from 1692, and successive British states from 1707, to retain the country.|$|E
5|$|City {{status in}} <b>Ireland</b> is decided by {{legislative}} or royal charter. Dublin, with over 1 million {{residents in the}} Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern <b>Ireland.</b> City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is {{the seat of the}} Church of <b>Ireland</b> and the Roman Catholic Primate of All <b>Ireland</b> and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of <b>Ireland,</b> Kilkenny, seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.|$|E

5|$|Cricket was {{introduced}} to <b>Ireland</b> in the 19th century, and the first match played by an <b>Ireland</b> team was in 1855. <b>Ireland</b> toured Canada and the United States in the late 19th century, and occasionally hosted matches against touring sides.

5|$|During the Iron Age, a Celtic {{language}} and culture emerged in <b>Ireland.</b> How and when the island of <b>Ireland</b> became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts {{being one of the}} more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies.

5|$|For the 2006 season, the C Trophy was reorganised {{to include}} a {{round-robin}} stage instead of being entirely knock-out. Whereas <b>Ireland</b> had only one match guaranteed in the tournament before, they now had more fixtures against English county sides. <b>Ireland</b> recorded one win in their nine matches. <b>Ireland</b> participated in the competition until it was restructured again in 2009. In that time they played 25 matches and won two. The latter of those victories was against Worcestershire; in that match <b>Ireland</b> bowled Worcestershire out for 58, which was their lowest ever one-day total. It {{was the first time}} that <b>Ireland</b> had bowled out a county for less than 100. <b>Ireland</b> were invited to participate in the reformatted competition from 2010 onwards, but chose not to do so, and instead focused their limited financial resources on international cricket.|$|E

5|$|In 1172, the new pope, Alexander III, further {{encouraged}} Henry {{to advance}} {{the integration of the}} Irish Church with Rome.

In turn, Henry accepted the title of Lord of <b>Ireland</b> which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185.
