Although she described herself as bilingual {{and the record}} has Latin influences, Lopez chose to sing in English. The Los Angeles Times described the album as not only Latin soul, but [...] "state-of-the-art dance pop". Lopez said, [...] "The whole vibe of the album is R&B and Latin music. It has both those influences...It still has a pop feel to it, but I definitely wanted to mix the two because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> very much who I am, {{growing up in the}} Bronx, being of Latin descent". The album incorporates different parts of Lopez's life and upbringing and marked the beginning of her musical exploration of love, a theme she continued in future albums.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2008, Stiller {{confirmed}} {{that he wanted}} to make a sequel to Zoolander, saying: [...] "I've been trying to get Zoolander 2 together and we've had a few scripts. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the sequel I really would like to do some day because I like the original and I would make sure it was something new and worthy of it first." [...] When interviewed on the May 15, 2009 episode of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Stiller said he was looking at a number of scripts. By February 2010, Justin Theroux, who also co-wrote Tropic Thunder with Stiller, was hired to write and direct the sequel. By the following month, Stiller confirmed he would be co-writing the script, stating, [...] "We're in the process of getting a script written, so it's in the early stages. But yeah, it's going to happen." [...] At some later, unspecified point, Stiller had taken over as director. On the December 17, 2010 episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Owen Wilson said a Zoolander sequel would likely be made, tentatively titled Twolander.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking of {{his writing}} for the album, Hutchison {{explained}} that, [...] "it’s usually the music first, and I hum and sing syllables to feel out the rhythm and melody, then I finally write the words. Most songs just arrive {{the way they do}} by accident, and its certainly not particularly contrived. It’s very important to move the listener and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> music's main goal: to make another human feel something." [...] When asked about his guitar work on the record, the frontman said that, [...] "I really love the challenge of 22 frets, 6 strings and seeing what I could do with that. As opposed to stepping on a pedal to change the music, you know, there's such a wide range of sounds that you can get from a guitar and it's fun to get different ones every time you pick it up." [...] Lyrically, Hutchison states that [...] "most of the lyrics are pretty direct" [...] and that the album [...] "almost spells out what’s happened." [...] Regarding the personal nature of the lyrics, Scott states that he couldn't [...] "really write about anything else, and I can still visualise the events in each song, which perhaps makes the delivery more genuine." [...] The artwork for the album was also done solely by Hutchison, having spent four years at Art School; [...] "I didn't particularly want to be an illustrator so I wanted to apply the rules that I learnt to everything I do, in terms of working in a bank or writing music." ...|$|E
