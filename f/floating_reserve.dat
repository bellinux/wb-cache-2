25|$|The main beaches on the Dieppe {{waterfront}} {{are almost}} a mile long. Following strafing of the defenses by aircraft, {{and a short}} bombardment by destroyers, aircraft laid a blanket of smoke on Dieppe Harbour. LCSs with heavy machine-guns and smoke mortars engaged targets ashore and provided a smoke-screen over the eastern headlands. The LCSs continued to engage targets all morning, but also suffered extensively from the defenders' fire. The first wave of LCAs touched down between 05:20 and 05:23. They carried The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry to Red Beach and The Essex Scottish Regiment to White Beach. Once the infantry left the armour-plated protection of the LCAs {{they were in a}} killing field. None of the preparatory fire had diminished the defense, and the new tank landing craft, designed to deliver tanks to accompany the assault infantry, were ten minutes late. As the smoke drifted off, the Canadians found themselves savagely pinned down. Their landing craft, LCAs and LCM(Mk. I)s, had orders to collect off the coast in the boat pool - an area covered in smoke. Adding to the tragedy, the <b>floating</b> <b>reserve,</b> Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, were sent to reinforce the Essex Scottish, who had been incorrectly reported as making good progress. The Fusiliers were transported in LCP(L) Eureka boats made of seven-plywood; they provided no protection from bullets or shrapnel. The Fusiliers received fire all the way in to the beach, and only 125 of them made it back to England. On White Beach, LCAs landed 369 men of A Commando Royal Marines in withering fire - none got more than a few yards ashore.|$|E

The 2/1st was assigned to support the 7th Division's landing on Balikpapan in July. Now largely {{being used as a}} divisional asset, {{the battalion}} provided a company to each of the division's component brigades– the 18th, 21st and 25th– while one company remained in reserve with the headquarters. Coming ashore aboard several landing craft, the two companies taking part in the initial assault– 'B' and 'D'– helped to secure the high ground overlooking the beachhead, while 'C' Company remained a <b>floating</b> <b>reserve</b> along with the 25th Brigade. The battalion's reserve company, 'A' Company, and headquarters element came ashore in a later wave to set up a secure base. During the subsequent advance inland, the battalion's main focus was progressing through what the Australians dubbed the [...] "Vasey Highway", which ran east–west along the island's southern shore, as the Australians fought to take the oil pipeline and the airfield at Manggar, and the [...] "Milford Highway", which ran north–south through the centre into the more mountainous hinterland. During the fighting on Borneo, the 2/1st lost 17 men killed or wounded.|$|E
500|$|In early February 1944, the {{battalion}} was withdrawn back to Australia, returning aboard the Kanimbla.

As a result, it was not until close {{to the end of the}} war that the 2/33rd went into action again. In June 1945, {{the battalion}} embarked for Morotai Island, from where they subsequently took part in the re-capture of Balikpapan the following month. During the landing, the 2/33rd formed part of the <b>floating</b> <b>reserve,</b> but after the early stages of the assault it came ashore on the second day along with the 25th Brigade's two other infantry battalions, and they assumed control of the central part of the Australian beachhead. The following day, the 25th Brigade began to advance inland up the main north-eastern axis, which the Australians dubbed the [...] "Milford Highway". The 2/33rd took up position on the right hand side of the brigade's front, coming up against stiff Japanese resistance as it advanced around Chilton Road, but this was overcome with machine gun and artillery support, after which the advance inland continued.|$|E

Moreover, we demonstrate that the floating hydrogels present high mobility with excellent self-assembling property on the surface of water.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} recent manifestations of sudden stops (SSs) in {{international}} capital flows have striking parallels {{in the early}} financial globalization era preceding World War I. All main capital-importing countries then faced episodic capital flow reversals averaging some 5 percent of GDP and with a median duration of four years. Most SSs also displayed striking crosscountry synchronization, being immediately preceded by rising world interest rates. Both fixed and floating exchange rate regimes were hit, with {{no significant differences between}} them. Yet, not all SSs resulted in currency drops: while some countries experienced currency collapses, others managed to preserve exchange rate stability. These different responses are related to domestic "frictions" that heightened the procyclicality of absorption and hindered precautionary reserve accumulation in some countries relative to others.

40|$|The authors examine Russia's {{macroeconomic}} {{crisis in}} 1992 and 1993, focusing on fiscal and monetary policies. They {{show how the}} large transfers from the government to the enterprise sector exacerbated the crisis. Money creation did not finance the narrow (cash) budget deficit of the government. Rather, money creation financed the huge directed credit programs aimed at specific sectors and enterprises, including assistance to other economies of the former Soviet Union to sustain Russian exports. During 1992 enterprises and households financed this effort with their large flow of savings, but while enterprises largely avoided the inflation tax, households did not. Enterprises benefited most from the loose fiscal and monetary policies of the Russian government in 1992 - 93. The enterprises were net recipients of transfers from the budget and the main beneficiaries of the inflation tax (which nearly offset their own inflation tax payments). The main losers from high inflation were households. As many have noted, inflation in Russia correlates well with past money growth. Real money and the real exchange rate are also closely correlated. Money demand in Russia is well above international comparisons, controlling for inflation and negative interest rates. But the trend of money demand is obviously down. Current levels of monetary financing cannot be maintained without an increase in inflation. Even if the government takes no actions that lower money demand, it will fall anyway as the financial system and households and enterprises adjust to inflation. Banks and enterprises are finding {{ways to reduce the}} <b>float</b> and excess <b>reserves</b> with the central bank. Stabilization of inflation will thus be a race between the authorities'willingness and ability to tighten monetary and fiscal policy and the adjustment of enterprises and households to exisiting inflation.

5000|$|The eastern barred {{bandicoot}} {{was once}} distributed across the Basalt Plains of south west Victoria, and in Tasmania. [...] Due to predation by introduced foxes and cats, along with land-clearing for farming practices, the Victorian subspecies is critically endangered. Since 1989, eight reintroduction sites {{have been established}} across the bandicoot's former range. The conservation of Eastern barred bandicoots in Victoria now depends upon the success of captive breeding and reintroduction programs. Keys to this conservation plan include maintaining an insurance population in captivity, conducting research to improve breeding and reintroduction success and increasing community awareness and support for this rare marsupial. A management plan, developed in 1987 and revised in 1989, recommended the first reintroduction of the eastern barred bandicoot in Victoria at Woodlands Historic Park, 20 km northwest of Melbourne. Animals were translocated from the last remaining free-ranging mainland population in Hamilton, Western Victoria to captive breeding facilities at Woodlands to establish a population in 1988. The captive-bred offspring {{formed the basis for}} reintroductions into the Nature Reserve, known as the Back Paddock, a 400-ha section of the park with a predator-resistant fence to keep out feral predators. Unfortunately, populations at four sites are now extinct (<b>Floating</b> Islands Nature <b>Reserve,</b> Lanark, Cobra Killuc Wildlife Reserve and Lake Goldsmith Nature Reserve), functionally extinct at Woodlands Historic park, declining at Mooramong and increasing at Hamilton Community Parklands and Mount Rothwell. The last remaining wild population which was once found along the Grange Burn (a creek) in Hamilton has also been declared extinct. The estimated population size for the Victorian Eastern Barred bandicoot is 150 individuals. The Tasmanian subspecies (P. g. gunni) is vulnerable to extinction. This species is more widespread than its mainland cousin because Tasmania provides large areas of suitable habitat and because the island lacks the bandicoot's main predator, the red fox.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century, aid flows to Africa have {{increased}} on average and become more volatile. As a result, policymakers, particularly in post-stabilization countries where inflation has only recently been brought under control, have been increasingly preoccupied with how best to deploy the available instruments of monetary policy without yielding on hard-won inflation gains. We use a stochastic simulation model, in which private sector currency substitution effects play a central role, to examine the properties of alternative monetary and fiscal policy strategies in the face of volatile aid flows. We show that simple monetary rules, specifically an (unsterilized) exchange rate crawl and a ''reserve buffer plus float''-under which the authorities set a time-varying reserve target corresponding to the unspent portion of aid financing and allow the exchange rate to float freely once this reserve target is satisfied-have attractive properties relative to a range of alternative strategies including those involving heavy reliance on bond sterilization or a commitment to a ''pure'' exchange rate float.

40|$|Most {{developing}} countries have imposed restrictions on {{domestic and international}} financial transactions {{at one time or}} another. Such restrictions have allowed governments to generate significant proportions of their revenues from financial repression while restraining inflation. The eventual fiscal importance of the revenues from seignorage and from implicit taxation of financial intermediation pose a challenge for financial reform and liberalization. This paper presents a model of the role of financial repression in fiscal policy and exchange rate management under capital controls. We show how a balance of payments crisis arises under an exchange rate peg without capital account convertibility in the model economy and how the instruments of financial repression may be used for exchange rate management. The model is compared to the experience of India, a country that exemplifies the fiscal importance of financial restrictions, in the last two decades. In particular, we discuss the dynamics leading up to devaluation in 1991 and the role of financial repression in exchange rate intervention afterwards.
