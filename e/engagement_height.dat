50|$|On {{the first}} night of {{sustained}} bombardment, the anti-aircraft crews around Croydon were jubilant - suddenly they were downing unprecedented numbers of German bombers; most of their targets burst into flames and fell when their engines cut out. There was great disappointment when the truth was announced. Anti-aircraft gunners soon found that such small fast-moving targets were, in fact, very difficult to hit. The cruising altitude of the V-1, between 600 to 900 m, was just above the effective range of light anti-aircraft guns, and just below the optimum <b>engagement</b> <b>height</b> of heavier guns.|$|E
50|$|Anti-aircraft gunners {{found that}} such small, {{fast-moving}} targets {{were difficult to}} hit. At first, it took, on average, 2,500 shells to bring down a V-1. The average altitude of the V-1, between 2,000 and 3,000 feet (610 and 915 m), was in a narrow band between the optimum <b>engagement</b> <b>heights</b> for light (such as the 40mm Bofors guns) and heavy anti-aircraft weapons. These low heights defeated the rate of traverse of the standard British QF 3.7 inch mobile gun, and static gun installations with faster traverses had to be built at great cost. The development of centimetric (roughly 30 GHz frequency) gun laying radars based on the cavity magnetron {{and the development of}} the proximity fuze helped to neutralise the advantages of speed and size which the V-1 possessed. In 1944 Bell Labs started delivery of an anti-aircraft predictor fire-control system based around an analogue computer (supplanting the previous electro-mechanical Kerrison Predictor) just in time for use in this campaign.|$|R
5|$|Following the <b>engagement</b> at Wisconsin <b>Heights,</b> {{the militia}} {{decided to wait}} until the {{following}} day to pursue Black Hawk. They heard, but did not understand, Neapope's speech during the night, and to their surprise, when morning arrived their enemy had disappeared. The battle, though militarily devastating for the British Band, had allowed much of the group to escape to temporary safety across the Wisconsin River. The reprieve was short-lived for many â€“ a group of Fox women and children who attempted to escape down the Wisconsin following the battle were captured by U.S.-allied tribes or shot by soldiers further downstream. During the night, while the non-combatants escaped in canoes, Black Hawk and the remaining warriors crossed the river near present-day Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. The band fled west over rugged terrain toward the banks of the Mississippi River, with a week's head start on the militia.|$|R
40|$|Using {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs), e-participation is a tool that promotes the inclusion of the public in participative and deliberative decision-making processes, thus contributing to a transformation of the interaction between government and citizens in environmental governance and sustainable development. In a number of Chinese cities, citizens increasingly draw on ICTs to promote environmental sustainability and to encourage community-based actions aimed to address various environmental concerns. The potential success of e-participation and the role of ICTs in China has, however, not been well explored. The objective {{of this study is to}} understand the role that ICTs can play in promoting public participation about environmental sustainability issues in urban China. Based on an online survey with 630 respondents, the study aims to: (1) analyze what public motivations, perception/attitudes and actions drive environmental e-participation; (2) identify barriers to e-participation, and (3) assess the different applications and functions of ICT for citizen participation in environmental sustainability. The analysis illustrates how ICTs have helped the public to obtain sensitive information about sustainability issues, to mobilize people and to gain media coverage for their actions. The central finding is that new technologies have taken citizen <b>engagement</b> to new <b>heights</b> online. More specifically, the age of ICTs has unleashed a stronger public voice on environmental governance and sustainability issues in urban China, which does not go unnoticed by the Chinese state authorities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Machining {{process with}} a single cutting tool is called {{multi-axis}} machining if more than 3 -axis {{are involved in the}} operation. On the other hand, parallel machining processes where more than one cutting tool simultaneously cut a workpiece is also called multi-axis machining. 5 -axis ball-end milling where a single cutting tool is employed, parallel turning and parallel milling processes with two cutting tools are in the scope of the thesis. Moreover, face-milling process with inserted tools is also modeled. 5 -axis ball-end milling operations are common in several industries such as aerospace, automotive and die/mold for machining of complex sculptured surfaces. Additional two degree of freedoms, namely, lead and tilt angles make it possible to machine complex parts by providing extra flexibility in cutting tool orientation. However, they also complicate the geometry of the process. In these operations, productivity, dimensional tolerance integrity and surface quality are of utmost importance. Part and tool deflections under high cutting forces may result in unacceptable part quality, whereas using conservative cutting parameters results in decreased material removal rate. Process models can be used to determine the proper or optimal milling parameters for required quality with higher productivity. The majority of the existing milling models are for 3 -axis operations, even the ones for ball-end mills. In the thesis, geometry, force and stability models are presented for 5 -axis ball-end milling operations. The effect of lead and tilt angles on the process geometry, cutter and workpiece <b>engagement</b> limits, scallop <b>height,</b> and milling forces are analyzed in detail. In addition, tool deflections/form errors and stability limits are also formulated for 5 -axis ball-end milling. The use of the model for selection of the process parameters such as lead and tilt angles which result in minimum cutting forces or maximum stability limits are demonstrated. The model predictions for cutting forces, form error and stability limits are compared and verified by experimental results. Parallel machining operations are advantageous in terms of productivity since there are more than one cutting tools in operation. Due to the increased number of cutting tools, they have the potential for considerable increase in productivity as a result of higher material removal rate (MRR). However, the dynamic interaction between these parallel tools may create additional stability problems and the advantage of parallel machining may not be utilized to full extent. For that reason, dynamics and stability of parallel machining processes need to be modeled. In the thesis, dynamics of parallel turning and parallel milling operations where two cutting tools cut a common workpiece are modeled. The predicted stability limits for parallel turning are also compared with experimental results where good agreement is demonstrated. Die manufacturing is a very critical part of the overall production chain in many industries. Depending on shape and size of a die, machining time can be very time consuming. Furthermore, since usually one die is manufactured, the chance for testing is very limited. Machining processes in die manufacturing can be limited by many factors. Process models can be used in order to select process conditions which will yield the required quality in the shortest possible time. In this study, force and chatter models are developed for face milling processes with inserted cutters. Using the developed models, process parameters are modified and their effects on productivity are demonstrated...|$|R
