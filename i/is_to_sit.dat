Then taking the womb veil into the right hand with the cavity looking upward and {{compressed}} from side to side, giving it thus {{the shape of an}} ellipse, she has to push it up the vagina as far as it will go. It will then spread out of its own accord and apply itself closely and firmly to the neck of the womb.|$|E

25|$|In series 10, {{the format}} to Bootcamp was changed: the judges find out their {{categories}} before Bootcamp starts, and each judge will {{make decisions on}} who is performing in the Six-Chair Challenge by eliminating the contestants, this is up to each individual judge. From Series 11 onwards, the judges do not know their categories before the Bootcamp, {{so they have to}} make the decisions together. After the Bootcamp round, the mentor challenges their contestants through the Six-Chair Challenge. Judges make decisions on who to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting a yes taking a chair in the final six chairs on stage. It is up to the mentor to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given a yes. This format was very poorly rated by many members of the British public. Bootcamp still took place, but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the Six-chair challenge. In series 12, all of Bootcamp aired on-screen. A more brutal twist to the Six-Chair Challenge was introduced in series 14, where the mentor <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> at a smaller table {{at the side of the}} arena while making the decisions, while the other judges remain at a larger table on the other side.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth {{was happy}} to play the part, but it is {{possible}} that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. She became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, who was Leicester's stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him. She repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. After Essex's desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies. In February 1601, the earl tried to raise a rebellion in London. He intended to seize the queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on 25 February. Elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events. An observer reported in 1602 that [...] "Her delight <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears to bewail Essex".|$|E

2500|$|Jack Williamson's novelette With Folded Hands (1947), later rewritten as {{the novel}} The Humanoids, deals with robot {{servants}} whose prime directive is [...] "To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men From Harm." [...] While Asimov's robotic laws {{are meant to}} protect humans from harm, the robots in Williamson's story have taken these instructions to the extreme; they protect humans from everything, including unhappiness, stress, unhealthy lifestyle and all actions that could be potentially dangerous. All that is left for humans to do <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> with folded hands.|$|E
2500|$|Method of fitting riders varies tremendously between designs. Length of {{the seat}} {{is the most common}} method by which saddles are fitted, though the length and {{placement}} of the flaps or fenders of the saddle also influence a person's leg position and thus the way an individual sits. [...] While a too long or too short seat will cause considerable discomfort, and even interfere with the security of the rider on the horse, width is also a factor. [...] Any well-fitting saddle should be wide enough to support the rider's seat bones, without being so wide as to cause discomfort. [...] While saddles are not usually marketed by seat width, designs do vary, and the only way a rider can determine the proper fit of a saddle <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on one.|$|E
2500|$|According to University of North Carolina Professor Zeynep Tufekci, {{this is part}} of {{a pattern}} of behaviour. After the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, Wikileaks {{announced}} that it would release e-mails belonging to Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party. When these e-mails were released, however, it [...] "was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks." [...] According to Tufekci, there are three steps to Wikileaks' [...] "disinformation campaigns": [...] "The first step is to dump many documents at once — rather than allowing journalists to scrutinise them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalise the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> back and watch as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{final year}} of medical school in Colombia is {{referred}} to as the internship year ("internado"). The internship year is usually divided into two semesters. The first semester is made up of obligatory rotations that every student does though in different orders, and the medical intern serves in 5-7 different specialties, typically including internal medicine, paediatrics, general surgery, anaesthesiology, orthopaedics, gynaecology and obstetrics, and emergency medicine. The extent of the responsibilities of the intern varies with the hospital, as does the level of supervision and teaching, but generally, medical interns in Colombia extensively take, write, and review clinical histories, answer and discuss referrals with their seniors, do daily progress notes for the patients under their charge, participate in the service rounds, present and discuss patients at rounds, serve shifts, assist in surgical procedures, and assist in general administrative tasks. Sometimes, they are charged with ordering diagnostic testing, but, under Colombian law they cannot prescribe medication as they are not graduate physicians. This, of course, are to be completed in addition to their academic responsibilities. The second semester is made up of elective rotations, which can be at home or abroad, in the form of clerkships or observerships. A final graduation requirement <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> a standardized exam, the [...] ("Examen de Estado de Calidad de la Educación Superior" [...] or ECAES, also known as SABER PRO) specific to medicine, which tests, for example, knowledge in public health and primary care.|$|E
