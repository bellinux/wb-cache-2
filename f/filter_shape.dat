Here, the <b>filter</b> <b>shapes</b> of adults (n[*]=[*] 14) who self-reported speech recognition problems in noise and performed poorly on a sentence-in-noise perception test despite having clinically normal audiograms were compared to those of controls (n[*]=[*] 10).

The filters of the impaired group were significantly wider than those of controls at all probe levels owing to an unusual broadening of the upper slope of the filter. In addition, absolute thresholds were statistically indistinguishable between the groups at the standard audiometric frequencies, but were elevated in the impaired listeners at higher frequencies. These results strengthen the idea that this population has a variety of hearing deficits that go undetected by standard audiometry...|$|R

50|$|The {{range of}} filter shapes and {{responses}} available from a CIC filter is somewhat limited. Larger amounts of stopband rejection {{can be achieved}} by increasing the number of poles. However, doing so requires an increase in bit width in the integrator and comb sections which increases filter complexity. The shape of the filter response provides even fewer degrees of design freedom. For this reason, many real-world filtering requirements cannot be met by a CIC filter alone. However, a CIC filter followed by a short to moderate length FIR or IIR proves highly applicable. Additionally, the FIR <b>filter</b> <b>shape</b> is normalized relative to the CIC's sampling rate at the FIR/CIC interface so one set of FIR coefficients can be used over a range of CIC interpolation and decimation rates.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePer-tone pulse shaping {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} time domain spectral shaping for DMT transmitters, e. g. VDSL modems. It shapes the spectrum of individual tones such that the stop band energy of each tone can be minimized. This in particular enables transmitter to use more tones without violating the PSD mask constraint for data transmission. In pertone pulse shaping based DMT transmitters a fixed length pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> is typically used for every tone. The tones {{in the middle of the}} pass band however, contribute less to the overall stop band energy, so that using a high order pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> for these tones does not result in a significant reduction of the stop band energy. As a result a significant number of pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> taps are wasted on the tones in the middle of the pass band and do not bring any performance gain. Using a variable length pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> which is designed such that the PSD mask constraint is not violated can then significantly reduce the total number of pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> taps without compromising performance. In this paper, a resource allocation technique is presented for variable length pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> design using a dual problem formulation. This optimally solves the problem of pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> tap distribution over tones for given PSD mask constraints, with a relatively low complexity...|$|R

A sensitivity analysis was then conducted for each <b>filter</b> <b>shape</b> by simulating flow through the filter for a range of hydraulic conductivities.

Increasing the variance (contrast) of amplitude modulations had less effect on <b>filter</b> <b>shape</b> but decreased the gain of firing in most cells. Both filter and gain changes occurred rapidly after a change in statistics, suggesting that they represent nonlinearities in processing.
