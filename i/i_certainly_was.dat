60|$|I hesitated. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not {{prepared}} to pay anyone for finding Theodore.|$|E
60|$|Frank, being {{younger and}} less hardy than I, became clean disheartened, and upon me fell the {{responsibility}} and {{burden of the}} campaign. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> to blame for our predicament.|$|E
6000|$|The man {{felt his}} {{forehead}} grow warm, but he laughed. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{not sure that}} quite expresses everything. Still, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> astonished. I wonder if one could ask what brought you here?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "O Dhu-l Kafayn, of your worshipers <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> not. Fire have I {{inserted}} into your heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that I have been either one or the other," [...] {{answered}} Lady Binks; [...] "one thing <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> not--I am not capable of understanding your ladyship's wit and learning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] she said, [...] "deem it {{advisable}} that my whereabouts {{should not}} <b>be</b> known. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> very anxious that my incognita should be preserved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is Miss Brady well?' said I; and indeed, {{could hardly}} utter it, for <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>WAS</b> {{thinking}} about her: for, though I had forgotten {{her in the}} gaieties of Dublin, I have always found adversity makes man very affectionate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Nasmyth reflectively, [...] "in one way at least, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was.</b> You see, I did {{not think}} Martial was, as our friend observed, that kind of man. In fact, I may admit that I feel {{reasonably}} sure of it still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They grew so {{fast that}} by the time the cold weather came, they were as big as their father and mother," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Quack. [...] "And they were smart, too. They had learned {{how to take care of}} themselves just as well as I could. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> proud of that family. But now I don't know where one of them is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am held here, {{by two of}} the savages, whose {{prisoner}} <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am.</b> Still, Mr. Marble, {{they encourage}} me to speak, but I fear some among them understand what we say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gee, but <b>I</b> <b>{{certainly}}</b> <b>am</b> {{sorry for}} him!" [...] whispered Andy to his twin. [...] "He isn't a fellow that I would cotton to, {{but he certainly}} has got himself into a pickle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{precisely}} either; but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> instructed. <b>I</b> {{see that}} our only {{plan is to}} be firm. I see that efficient preparation and a resolute attitude are the best means of averting bloodshed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{his face}} was swollen, and he was getting fat. His hair was grey, and his countenance had lost that spiritual {{expression}} which it once eminently possessed. His teeth were decaying; {{and he said that}} if ever he came to England it would be to consult Wayte about them. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> very much struck at his alteration for the worse. Besides, he was dressed in the most extraordinary manner." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Milray went on, [...] "That was why I was so {{provoked}} with you. I {{think that}} for a young girl {{to stand up and}} dance alone before a whole steamer full of strangers"--Clementina looked at her without speaking, and Mrs. Milray hastened to say, [...] "To be sure I advised you to do it, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> surprised that you should give an encore. But no matter, now. This letter--" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{explained}} {{that all my}} belongings had been stolen from me, and that the robber must have taken the token too; but they didn't believe me. As proof that I was one of Hooja's people, they pointed to my weapons, which they said were ornamented {{like those of the}} is-land clan. Further, they said that no good man went in company with a jalok--and that by this line of reason-ing <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a bad man.|$|E
6000|$|... "So that's what's the matter! Ha! ha! ha! Danny Meadow Mouse, I'm {{ashamed of}} you! <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> ashamed of you!" [...] said Mr. Toad. [...] "What good would a long tail do you? Tell me that." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY UTTERWORD. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> Addy; and <b>I</b> don't think I {{can be so}} {{changed that}} you would not have {{recognized}} me if you had any real affection for me. And Papa didn't think me even worth mentioning! ...|$|R
6000|$|As he {{drew near}} the camp a musical shout arose, and Reynolds spurred his horse {{out to meet}} him. [...] "It's Mose!" [...] he shouted. [...] "Boy, I'm glad to see ye, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am.</b> Shake hearty. Where ye from?" ...|$|R
60|$|In truth Eustace {{had been}} resorting {{all this time}} to the {{companionship}} of the Horsmans. Hunting, during the previous winter, had thrown him with them more than we knew, and when he found me far more of a champion for Harold's rights than he wished, and, I fear too, much less tolerant of his folly and petulance than when his cousin was present {{to make the best}} of them by his loyal love, he deserted home more and more for Therford Hall. Dora and I were hardly sorry, for he was very cross to her, and had almost forgotten his deference to me; but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not prepared for the announcement of his engagement to Hippolyta Horsman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Had I been {{thinking}} of {{the scene at the}} time I could have accounted for it somehow, upon the theory that in some way or other the juggler was conscious of my thought and reflected it upon the smoke--how, I don't at all mean to say; but undoubtedly there exists, to some extent, the power of thought reading. It is a mysterious subject, and one of which we know absolutely nothing at present, but maybe in upwards of a hundred years mankind will have discovered many secrets of nature in that direction. But <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not thinking of that scene when I spoke and said the 'past.' I had no doubt that he would show me something of the past, but certainly no particular incident passed through my mind before that picture appeared on the smoke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have met}} the person who calls himself Captain Wilson. I say 'calls himself' because I have reason now {{to believe that it}} is not his correct name. It would take me too long if I were to {{describe}} all the means by which he obtained an introduction to me and ingratiated himself into my friendship and the affection of my daughter. He brought letters from foreign colleagues which compelled me to show him some attention. And then, by his own attainments, which are considerable, he succeeded in making himself a very welcome visitor at my rooms. When I learned that my daughter's affections had been gained by him, I may have thought it premature, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not surprised, for he had a charm of manner and of conversation which would have made him conspicuous in any society.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must trade you outen that hoss. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> 'blieged to do so. I'm growin' old, boy. I don't {{take the}} pleasu' in a broncho that I once did. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> tired of hosses I can't {{touch with my}} hand. Fo' fo'ty yeahs I have handled these locoed hosses--they ah all locoed in my judgment--and I am plum tired of such. I shall send to Missouri aw Tennessee and get me a hoss I can trust. Meanwhile, you leave me yo' hoss an' take my bald-face pinto there; he is the fastest hoss on the range an' a plum devil, but that won't mattah to you, for you ah young an' frisky." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the good}} old times," [...] said Valentin, [...] "marquises and counts used to have their {{appointed}} fools and jesters, to crack jokes for them. Nowadays we see a great strapping democrat keeping a count about him to play the fool. It's a good situation, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> very degenerate." ...|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} Mose {{was in the midst}} of the turmoil. Everyone greeted Reynolds with affection, and he replied in the stately phrases which had made him famous, [...] "How do you do, gentlemen. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> glad to see you enjoyin' this fine fall day. Captain Charlesworth, allow me to present my young friend, Moses Harding." ...|$|R
60|$|General Jackson {{of course}} did not {{communicate}} his disappointment at not capturing me to a prisoner, a young drover; {{but from the}} talk among the soldiers the facts related were learned. A day or two later Mr. De Loche called on me in Memphis to apologize for his apparent incivility in not insisting on my staying for dinner. He said that his wife accused him of marked discourtesy, but that, after the call of his neighbor, he had felt restless until I got away. I never met General Jackson before the war, nor during it, but have met him since at his very comfortable summer home at Manitou Springs, Colorado. I {{reminded him of the}} above incident, and this drew from him the response that he was thankful now he had not captured me. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> very thankful too.|$|E
60|$|I {{retreated to}} the door, but It {{followed}} me with Its eyes. It had not had time to scream yet, and I glared at It to imply that I would stand no nonsense. But, difficult though this may be to believe, It didn't scream when It had the chance. It chuckled instead and made signs {{for me to come}} nearer. This was even more alarming than my worst fears. I shook my head and then my fist at It, but It only laughed the more. In the end I got so fearful that I went down on my hands and knees, to get out of Its sight. Then It began to scream. However, I did not get up. When they opened the door they say I was beneath the table, and no wonder. But <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> astonished to discover that I had only been alone with It for seven minutes.|$|E
6000|$|Next {{evening at}} sunset I went to [...] "Glenwood," [...] the Lindsay place. Doubtless, an eager lover {{might have gone}} earlier, but an eager lover <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not. Probably Marian was expecting me and had given orders {{concerning}} me, for the maid {{who came to the}} door conveyed me to a little room behind the stairs--a room which, as I felt as soon as I entered it, was a woman's pet domain. In its books and pictures and flowers it spoke eloquently of dainty femininity. Somehow, it suited the letters. I did not feel quite so much the stranger as I had felt. Nevertheless, when I heard a light footfall on the stairs my heart beat painfully. I stood up and turned to the door, but I could not look up. The footsteps came nearer; I knew that a white hand swept aside the portière at the entrance; I knew that she had entered the room and was standing before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well anyway, it's {{a kind of}} home; it's your winter home," [...] protested Peter, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> {{glad to see you}} back. The Old Orchard wouldn't {{be quite}} the same without you. Did you have a {{pleasant}} summer? And if you please, Yank-Yank, tell me where you built your home and what it was like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O yes, <b>I</b> will, <b>certainly.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid I showed {{too much}} feeling, {{the reverse of}} stoical, when the {{accident}} occurred. That was not very noble of me.' ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{disturbed}} at this outburst, but quietly and gravely repeated that <b>I</b> must <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> punished for my illness.|$|R
60|$|My dear Mr. Westwood,--I {{send you}} the {{manuscript}} you ask for, and also my certificate that, although <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> once a little girl, yet I {{never in my}} life had fair hair, or received lessons when you mention. I think a cousin of mine, now dead, may have done it. The 'Barrett Barrett' seems to specify my family. I have a little cousin with bright fair hair at this moment who is an Elizabeth Barrett (the subject of my 'Portrait'[108]), but then she is a 'Georgiana' besides, and your friend must refer to times past. My hair is very dark indeed, and always was, as long as I remember, and also I have a friend who makes serious affidavit that I have never changed (except by being rather taller) since I was a year old. Altogether, you cannot make a case of identity out, and I am forced to give up the glory of being so long remembered for my cleverness.|$|E
60|$|An old stupid <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> for {{the next}} fortnight. Old Mr. Shackleford, only too glad to have got hold of a willing victim in the carriage-sharing fraud, dragged me about the country to every {{available}} point of view or object of curiosity within ten miles of the Square Brougham. Ruby usually accompanied us; and as the two old people naturally occupied the seat of honour {{at the back of}} the carriage, why, of course Ruby and I had to sit together with our backs to the horses--a mode of progression which I had never before known to be so agreeable. Every evening, Ruby and I walked out on the terrace in the moonlight; and I need hardly say that the moon, in spite of her pretended coldness, is really the most romantic and sentimental satellite in the whole solar system. To cut a long story short, by the end of the fortnight I was very distinctly in love with Ruby; and if you won't think the avowal a conceited one, I venture to judge by the sequel that Ruby was almost equally in love with me.|$|E
6000|$|Oppressed, as <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was,</b> {{upon the}} {{occurrence}} of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient {{presence of mind to}} avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face {{to the door of the}} chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea--for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never said}} that they had," [...] replied the Rocket; [...] "I said that they might. If they had lost their only son {{there would be no}} use in saying {{anything}} more about the matter. I hate people who cry over spilt milk. But when I think that they might lose their only son, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>am</b> very much affected." ...|$|R
60|$|Bless me, thought Israel, {{all of a}} tremble, <b>I</b> shall <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> caught now; <b>I</b> {{have broken}} into some nobleman's park.|$|R
6000|$|Chum Frink had {{recently}} been on a lecture-tour among the small towns, and he chuckled, [...] "Awful good {{to get back to}} civilization! <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> seeing some hick towns! I mean--Course the folks there are the best on earth, but, gee whiz, those Main Street burgs are slow, and you fellows can't hardly appreciate {{what it means to be}} here with a bunch of live ones!" ...|$|R
