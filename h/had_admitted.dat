Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas authorized by both Columbia University and Barnard College.|$|E
5|$|As drive-through {{penalties}} are not admissible for appeal, McLaren's lawyer Mark Phillips QC {{attempted to}} convince the court that since the penalty was {{in the form of}} time added on, the case was valid. They presented the previous case of Vitantonio Liuzzi at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, specifically the FIA's claim that the presiding chief steward at the race, Tony Scott Andrews, <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> fault in awarding the penalty to Liuzzi. Andrews denied the FIA's allegation. McLaren went on to use the case as a precedent for the Spa incident. The Court stated that this analogy was invalid, since in Liuzzi's case the admissibility of his appeal was not contested.|$|E
5|$|In July 1863, {{during the}} New York Draft Riots, Irish rioters {{attacked}} and burned down the orphan asylum. The children were {{saved by the}} staff and Union troops in the city. During its nearly 30 years, the orphan asylum <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> 1310 children, and typically had about 200 in residence at a time. After the riots, Smith moved his family and business out of Manhattan, as did other prominent blacks. Numerous buildings were destroyed in their old neighborhoods, and estimates were that 100 blacks {{were killed in the}} rioting. No longer feeling safe in the lower Fourth Ward, the Smiths moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.|$|E

Mills's name and private mobile phone number were listed in Mulcaire's notes along with those of her friends and associates.

5|$|Following his injury, Johnson {{never really}} rediscovered his old form, scoring just 11 goals in 47 {{appearances}} from March 2004 to March 2005, when, after a falling-out with manager Gary Megson, {{he was sent}} on loan to Sheffield United, ironically the club against whom he had broken his leg in the first place. Following Nottingham Forest's relegation to League One {{at the end of}} the season, Megson placed Johnson on the transfer list as part of a dramatic overhaul of the club's playing staff. However, the summer of 2005 saw Johnson recalled to the Nottingham Forest first team, and by the start of the 2005–06 season, he <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> his desire to remain with the club and fight for a place in the team.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Spider-Man 3, Sony Pictures Entertainment had {{announced}} a May 5, 2011, release date for Sam Raimi's next film in the earlier series. By this time, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross had all written rejected versions of a script and Ziskin's husband Alvin Sargent, who wrote {{the second and third}} films, was working on yet another attempt. Raimi wanted John Malkovich to play his next villain. However, on January 11, 2010, Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that rather than continue the earlier saga, they were rebooting the series with a new cast and crew. Industry reports claimed that Raimi <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> that he could not meet the scheduled release date and retain creative integrity. Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Ziskin continued as producers.|$|E

5|$|In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio. While this news was met with excitement at first, scholars—after reading the work—began {{to argue that the}} manuscript was a fraud, with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the most vocal. However, Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death, even mentioning in two different orations his belief in the truthfulness of the text. The scholar Latino Latini, however, later claimed in a letter that Sigonio <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> to the forgery on his deathbed. By and large, the academic community concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not genuine, and the document later earned the name the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that allegations of assault were made against another teacher in the 1980s. On 12 February, Professor Malcolm Layfield, Head of Strings at the Royal Northern College of Music resigned from the RNCM Board after claims of his previous sexual misconduct were brought up during the Brewer hearing. Before his appointment at RNCM, Layfield <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> to having relationships with six Chetham's pupils aged between 16 and 18 whilst he taught there. Two RNCM teachers, including Head of Keyboard Studies Martin Roscoe, resigned in protest at his appointment in 2002. In October 2013 Layfield was arrested on suspicion of raping and indecently assaulting an 18-year-old woman between 1988 and 1999, but {{was found not guilty}} at a trial in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Milne <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> to {{problems}} with alcoholism and gambling addiction {{during and after}} his playing career. He was always an enthusiastic drinker throughout his career, but he lost his passion for football after picking up an injury in 1990 and began drinking {{in a way which}} began to severely damage his health. After retiring as a player he worked at a pub in Nailsea. He appeared in court in 2010 and 2013, but was never convicted, for allegedly attacking his partner Fiona Spence whilst highly intoxicated. Milne's manager at Dundee United, Jim McLean, has since stated that Milne would have had greater success in his career were it not for his problems with alcohol and discipline. Milne died on 6 September 2015, at the age of 54, due to complications from liver problems.|$|E

5|$|No further {{information}} on the bishop's activities has survived before he was granted resignation by Pope Innocent IV on 21 February 1245. According to the Pope, Thomas <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> committing several felonies, such as torturing a man to death, and forging a papal letter. Church representatives to oversee the resignation were the Archbishop of Uppsala and the Dominican prior of the Dacian province. Thomas donated his books to the newly established Dominican convent in Sigtuna {{and went on to}} live his last years in the Dominican convent in Visby, Gotland. He died there in 1248, shortly before the Second Swedish Crusade, which cemented Swedish rule in Finland for more than 550 years.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, <b>had</b> <b>admitted,</b> was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E
5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit <b>had</b> <b>admitted</b> to {{an affair with}} Levy during an {{interview}} with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation {{and was surprised to}} find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E
