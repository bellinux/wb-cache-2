Commercial DEP (trade name) and polyglycerol ester (PGE), and self-made PA (given name by our laboratory researchers), {{were used as}} cold flow improvers (CFIs) to improve the CFP of the biodiesel, {{and the effects of}} these CFIs on the CFP of PME were investigated. The results showed that the peak crystallization temperature of PME was very close to the cold <b>filter</b> <b>plug</b> point (CFPP). There was no unique linear relationship between the CFPP and the content of saturated fatty acid methyl esters. When used individually as CFIs, DEP, PGE and PA exerted only moderate pour point depression effects on the biodiesel, and effects to decrease the CFPP of PME were only observed when the CFI concentration was 1 % or higher. Compared with single-compound CFIs and CFIs formulated from two components, at a specified complex formulation ratio, CFIs formulated from three components exhibited the best performance. When the ratio of DEP:PGE:PA was 3 : 1 : 1 or 2 : 2 : 1, the CFPP of PME was decreased by 7 degrees C. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Ubiquitylation is an {{important}} posttranslational protein modification that is involved in many cellular events. Immunopurification of peptides containing a K-ε-diglycine (diGly) remnant as a mark of ubiquitylation combined with mass spectrometric detection has resulted in an explosion {{of the number of}} identified ubiquitylation sites. Here, we present several significant improvements to this workflow, including fast, offline and crude high pH reverse-phase fractionation of tryptic peptides into only three fractions with simultaneous desalting prior to immunopurification and better control of the peptide fragmentation settings in the Orbitrap HCD cell. In addition, more efficient sample cleanup using a <b>filter</b> <b>plug</b> to retain the antibody beads results in a higher specificity for diGly peptides and less non-specific binding. These relatively simple modifications of the protocol result in the routine detection of over 23, 000 diGly peptides from HeLa cells upon proteasome inhibition. The efficacy of this strategy is shown for lysates of both non-labeled and SILAC labeled cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this strategy is useful for the in-depth analysis of the endogenous, unstimulated ubiquitinome of in vivo samples such as mouse brain tissue. This study presents a valuable addition to the toolbox for ubiquitylation site analysis to uncover the deep ubiquitinome. A K-ε-diglycine (diGly) mark on peptides after tryptic digestion of proteins indicates a site of ubiquitylation, a posttranslational modification involved {{in a wide range of}} cellular processes. Here, we report several improvements to methods for the isolation and detection of diGly peptides from complex biological mixtures such as cell lysates and brain tissue. This adapted method is robust, reproducible and outperforms previously published methods in terms of number of modified peptide identifications from a single sample.

40|$|O presente trabalho foi realizado usando biodieseis preparados a partir de óleos de soja, canola, milho, girassol e, também, de gordura suína, através de reações transesterificação. Para todos esses biodieseis foram determinados o ponto de entupimento a frio, o ponto de fulgor e o perfil cromatográfico. Estes biodieseis foram misturados com diesel de petróleo para se produzir misturas contendo 5 % do biocombustível (B 5), 10 % (B 10) e 20 % (B 20), e os ensaios citados foram realizados nestas amostras. Visando a diminuição do ponto de entupimento a frio, alguns aditivos naturais foram testados e se mostraram eficientes. Por exemplo, o limoneno reduziu o ponto de entupimento do {{biodiesel}} de óleo soja em mais de 7 °C. No biodiesel de gordura suína a redução foi de 10 °C, o que significa o ponto de entupimento a frio em temperatura inferior a 13 °C. Os aditivos utilizados são solúveis nos biodieseis estudados e, também, nas misturas diesel-biodiesel, pelo menos nas concentrações testadas. Como importante exemplo de abaixamento do ponto de entupimento a frio das misturas diesel-biodiesel de gordura suína com 10 % de biodiesel (B 10), podese citar o caso da terebentina que provocou uma redução de aproximadamente 8 °C (de 12, 7 ºC para 5, 0 °C). Este mesmo aditivo caus ou uma redução de 13, 6 ºC (de 20, 3 ºC para 6, 7 ºC), na mistura diesel-biodiesel de gordura suína com 20 % de biodiesel (B 20). Este resultado é muito significativo por implicar na possibilidade de usar este tipo de combustível mesmo em regiões mais ao sul do país durante o inverno. The present {{studies were}} performed preparing biodiesel from soya, canola, corn, sunflower oils and the fat swine, through transesterification reaction. The biodiesel produced from these oils were studied for: cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point, flash point and for chromatographic analysis. The biodiesels were mixed with diesel to produce blends containing 5 % of the biofuel (B 5), 10 % (B 10) and 20 % (B 20), and these samples were also analyzed {{by the same}} techniques as discussed earlier. In order to decrease the cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point, some natural additives have been tested and were proved effectively. For example, limonene caused more than 7 °C reduction in the cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point of soybean biodiesel. In the biodiesel obtained from the swine fats, the reduction was found around 10 °C and less than 13 °C for the cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point.

Oxidized biodiesels produced between 14 % and 16 % lower CO and HC emissions and smoke number compared to unoxidized biodiesel. No statistically significant difference was found between the NOx emissions from oxidized biodiesel and unoxidized biodiesel. Oxidized biodiesel experienced a one degree shorter ignition delay than unoxidized biodiesel. The ignition delay was almost linearly correlated to CO and HC emissions. A common linear relationship was found between the start of combustion and the NOx emissions.

Pangium edule Reinw is a non-edible feedstock. Pangium is a tall tree native to the Micronesia, Melanesia and the mangrove swamps of South-East Asia. In this study, biodiesel production and characterization from P. edule oil was reported. The seeds were obtained from Bogor, Indonesia. The oil was found to have an acid value of 19. 62 mg KOH/g oil. Therefore, a two-step acid-base-catalysed transesterification was used to produce biodiesel. This was followed by evaluating the physical and chemical properties of biodiesel and its blends with diesel. It has been found that the determined properties of P. edule methyl ester indicate that the oil can be considered as a future biodiesel source. The most remarkable feature of P. edule is its cloud, pour and cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> points.

40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} composition of biodiesel was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point of biodiesel was measured according to GB/T 20828 - 2007. The cold flow properties of biodiesel were investigated {{on the basis}} of the crystallization theory, including {{chemical composition}} and molecular structure. Biodiesel might be considered a pseudobinary mixture, namely, high-melting-point saturated fatty acid methyl esters and low–melting-point unsaturated ones. Bilayer crystal structure of biodiesel was founded. Bilayer structure with headgroups aligned next to each other inside the crystal and away from nonpolar bulk liquid was large platelet lamellae. The results showed that biodiesel was mainly composed of saturated fatty acid methyl esters (C 14 : 0 ～C 24 : 0) and unsaturated ones(C 16 : 1 ～C 22 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3). The cold flow properties for biodiesel were determined mainly by the amount and molecular structure of saturated fatty acid methyl esters. The long-straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters tend to have relatively poor cold flow properties. The cold flow properties worsen with increasing the amount and carbon chain length of straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters.

In contrast, the biodiesel from the FFAs had favorable fuel properties such as a low cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point of − 6 °C; however, it exhibits poor oxidation stability with an induction period (IP) of 0. 2 h. The complementary blend of the SNME and the FFA-based biodiesel at various weight ratios was studied to improve the fuel properties. As a result, the biodiesel blend at a weight ratio of 70 : 30 can successfully meet all the biodiesel specifications, except the marginal oxidation stability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of N,N’-di-sec-butyl-p-phenylenediamine at the concentration between 100 and 500 ppm on the improvement in the oxidation stability of the biodiesel blend was examined. The relationship between the IP values associated with the consumption of antioxidants in the biodiesel blends was described by first-order reaction rate kinetics.

40|$|AbstractThe {{oleaginous}} {{composition and}} alcohol used in transesterification have substantial impact on biodiesel properties. This study involves palm oil and its crystallization fractions, olein and stearin oils, with methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and benzyl alcohols, as {{we seek to}} investigate {{the influence of the}} alcohol on the cold properties, thermal stability, density and viscosity of the resulting biofuel. The products were characterized by GC and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Biofuels produced from the olein oil fraction have superior cold properties compared to those synthesized from palm oil and the palm stearin oil fraction; these properties are attributable to the higher unsaturated contents, which cause the isopropyl biodiesel from palm to exhibit a higher cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point (0. 3 °C). The use of benzyl alcohol yields a biofuel with high thermal stability but also high viscosity and density values that do not adhere to any international specifications for biodiesel...|$|R
40|$|Biodegradation {{occurs at}} the {{interface}} between diesel and water. The microbial contamination can result in inhibitor/fuel degradation {{that leads to the}} unacceptable level of turbidity, <b>filter</b> <b>plugging,</b> corrosion of storage tanks, pipeline and souring of stored products. Hence, selection of biocides/inhibitors is an important aspect in petroleum product transporting pipeline. Three biocides (cationic and nonionic) were employed to study the biodegradation of diesel in diesel–water interface. The biocidal efficiency on biodegradation of diesel was examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Polyoxyethyleneglycol dodecyl ether [BRIJ- 35] and polyethylene glycol-p-isooctylphenyl ether [TRITON-X- 100] had higher bactericidal efficiency than Dodecyl ethyl dimethyl ammonium bromide [DDAB]. But the cationic biocide (DDAB) gave good biocidal efficiency at the interface. The data are explained in terms of a model that postulates the formation of “micelle” at the diesel–water interface...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{chemical}} compounds with a pro-knock behaviour in gasoline have a beneficial {{effect on the}} cetane number. Therefore, amines of various structures were assessed as potential diesel fuel extenders. Although the addition of small amounts of many primary amines in gasoline significantly increases the octane number of the fuel blend, the movement towards the corresponding tertiary amines has a strong negative effect on octane number. Measurements of cetane numbers and cold-flow properties (cloud point, pour point and cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point) of amines of different structure were made. It is concluded that the permethylated mono-, di- and polyamines investigated, enhance the ignition quality of the base fuel and also have good cold-flow performance. The tertiary methylated fatty amines offer the extra benefit {{that they can be}} produced from renewable starting materials (fatty acids), and, thus may act as extenders not only for mineral diesel but also for biodiesel...|$|R
40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 438 – 441 Tallow is a raw {{material}} for biodiesel production that, due to their highly centralized generation in slaughter/processing facilities and historically low prices, may have energy, environmental, and economic advantages that could be exploited. However beef tallow biodiesel have unfavorable properties due the presence of high concentration of saturated fatty esters. One way to overcome these inconveniences is using blending procedures. In this way, blends of beef tallow biodiesel with soybean biodiesel and with conventional mineral diesel fuel were prepared {{and the quality of}} the mixtures was monitored with the purpose to study ideal proportions of the fuels. By measurement of the viscosity, density, cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point, and flash point, it was demonstrated that tallow biodiesel can be blended with both mineral diesel and soybean biodiesel to improve the characteristics of the blend fuels, over that of the tallow...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of microalgal oil from Scenedesmus incrassatulus as a feedstock for biodiesel production was studied. Cell concentration of S. incrassatulus and lipid content obtained during mixotrophic growth were 1. 8 g/L and 19. 5 ? 1. 5 % dry cell weight, respectively. The major components of biodiesel obtained from S. incrassatulus oil were methyl palmitate (26 %) and methyl linoleate (49 %), which provided a strong indication {{of high quality}} biodiesel. Fuel properties were determined by empirical equations and found to be {{within the limits of}} biodiesel standard ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214. The quality properties of the biodiesel were high cetane number (62), low density (803 kg/m 3), low viscosity (3. 78 mm 2 /s), oxidation stability (9 h) and cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point (- 4 ?C). Hence, S. incrassatulus has potential as a feedstock for the production of excellent quality biodiesel...|$|R
50|$|Biodiesel {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} more common {{in a number of}} developed countries and the environmental effects of using biodiesel either as a blend such as B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% petrodiesel) or as a straight fuel stock may be different in various countries. This is because the allowable amounts of sulphur and other compounds vary from country to country. Additionally, the average temperature in a country will dictate the amount of biodiesel that can be blended into the fuel supply before the cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point (the temperature at which the fluid will block a 45 µm filter) renders the fuel unusable. The national annex of BS EN 14214 specifies a maximum CFPP for B100 biodiesel of -15 °C in the winter (16 November - 15 March inclusive) and -5 °C {{for the rest of the}} year. As such, the benefits and disadvantages of biodiesel will vary from those in the United Kingdom.|$|R
