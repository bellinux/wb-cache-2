He {{was a member of}} Giraud's {{government}} in North Africa in 1943, and enlisted in the French colonial army, serving in Tunisia and Morocco. He was discharged without pension and prohibited from teaching. Thereafter he took up journalism, collaborating on Aspects de la France, where his articles from a royalist viewpoint showed obvious antisemitism. He was a regular contributor to Bulletin de Paris, where using a pseudonym, he reviewed plays.|$|E
5000|$|Okamoto {{directed}} almost 40 {{films and}} wrote the scripts for at least 24, in a career that spanned almost six decades. He worked {{in a variety of}} genres, but most memorably in action genres such as the jidaigeki and war films. He was known for making films with a twist. Inspired to become a filmmaker after watching John Ford's Stagecoach, he would insert elements of the Western in war films like Desperado Outpost (1959) and Westward Desperado (1960), and eventually even filmed his own samurai Western in East Meets West (1995). A fan of musicals, he made over-the-top films such as Oh Bomb (1964), a gangster Noh musical, and Dixieland Daimyo (1986), about jazz musicians entering Bakumatsu Japan. Over all, he took on [...] "a very rhythmic approach to filming and <b>editing</b> <b>action</b> sequences. Carefully timed placement of sound effects and music combined with camera movement and movement within the frame to form a very rhythmic, almost musical whole." [...] His basically critical stance towards Japanese society led him to often pursue satire and black comedy, with his The Age of Assassins (1967) becoming so dark and absurd, Toho initially refused to release it.|$|E

40|$|Collaborative Question Answering (cQA) {{platforms}} are a {{very popular}} repository of crowd-generated knowledge. By formulating questions, users express needs that {{other members of the}} cQA community try to collaboratively satisfy. Poorly formulated questions are less likely to receive useful responses, thus hindering the overall knowledge generation process. Users are often asked to reformulate their needs, adding specific details, providing examples, or simply clarifying the context of their requests. Formulating a good question is a task that might require several interactions between the asker and other community members, thus delaying the actual answering and, possibly, decreasing the interest of the community in the issue. This paper contributes new insights to the study of cQA platforms by investigating the editing behaviour of users. We identify a number of <b>editing</b> <b>actions,</b> and provide a two-step approach for the automatic suggestion of the most likely <b>editing</b> <b>actions</b> to be performed for a newly created question. We evaluated our approach {{in the context of the}} Stack Overflow cQA system, demonstrating how, for given types of <b>editing</b> <b>actions,</b> it is possible to provide accurate reformulation suggestions.

The enrichment and editing is necessary to externalize any additional or missing information from the user’s domain knowledge. Preserving the integrity throughout this <b>editing</b> <b>action</b> allows the intelligence to serve as piece of evidence. In our approach, security experts are able to externalize their domain knowledge either through changing the attributes of existing SDOs and SROs or through adding new nodes and links. This functionality covers the Externalization process as users are able to transfer their domain knowledge to the CTI Vault, where it is preserved as explicit knowledge.|$|E
40|$|RED 1 is a {{double-stranded}} RNA-specific editase characterized in the rat and is {{implicated in}} the editing of glutamate receptor subunit pre-mRNAs, particularly in the brain. Starting from human ESTs homologous to the rat RED 1 sequence, we have characterized two forms of human RED 1 cDNAs, one form coding for a putative peptide of 701 amino acids (similar to the shorter of two rat mRNAs) and a long form coding for a putative protein of 741 amino acids, the extra 120 bp of which are homologous to an AluJ sequence. Both forms were observed at approximately equal levels in cDNA clones and in seven different human tissues tested by RT-PCR. The human and rat short isoforms have 95 and 85 % sequence identity at the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively. The human sequence (designated ADARB 1 by the HGMW Nomenclature Committee) contains two double-stranded RNA-binding domains and a deaminase domain implicated in its <b>editing</b> <b>action.</b> Northern blot analysis detected two transcripts of 8. 8 and 4. 2 kb strongly expressed in brain and in many human adult and fetal tissues. ADARB 1 maps to human chromosome 21 q 22. 3, a region to which several genetic disorders map, including one form of bipolar affective disorder. Recently it was shown that heterozygous mice harboring an editing-incompetent glutamate receptor B allele have early onset fatal epilepsy. Since glutamate receptor channels are essential elements in synaptic function and plasticity and mediate pathology in many neurological disorders, and since RED 1 is central in glutamate receptor channel control, ADARB 1 is a candidate gene for diseases with neurological symptoms, such as bipolar affective disorder and epilepsy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Run time {{monitoring}} {{observes the}} action stream from a program either allowing a token {{to pass through}} to the operating system if the action is deemed to be safe or terminating the program on an unsafe action. Schneider evaluates the types of policies enforceable by a security automata. Edit automata enhance the security automata by incorporating <b>edit</b> <b>actions</b> on the program action stream. We develop the notion of stream automata that sit between two communicating processes (we refer {{to one of the}} processes as the program and to the other as the system). The stream automata can perform simple <b>edit</b> <b>actions</b> on the program stream before forwarding it to the system and vice versa. These <b>edit</b> <b>actions</b> include action suppression, insertion, metamorphosis, forcing and twoway forcing. We demonstrate that stream automata are strictly more powerful than either of security automata or edit automata. We show many policies enforceable by stream automata which cannot be enforced with edit automata. Moreover, stream automata allow us to model an open/reactive system, the complete interaction between a program and its environment, which was not possible with the earlier models. We implemented a security policy against buffer overflow attacks to demonstrate the power of stream automata. I...|$|R
