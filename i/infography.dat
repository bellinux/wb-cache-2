Unlike Land Art artists, who work in a particular place using found materials, that they then typically capture, his approach is to shoot raw landscapes. He then modifies the image, using different tools, bringing straight lines or curves, and/ or adding shadows and light. In his work [...] " [...] Blue Mountains [...] ", he combines both <b>infography</b> and coloured pencil towards a pictorial result, halfway between photography and painting.|$|E
50|$|Experienced {{students}} enrolled in the Generative Systems program: John Dunn, a former student at SAIC, invented EASEL software for a Cromemco Z2D DOS computer. This was later followed by Lumena software in a Time Arts PC computer, produced by John Dunn’s California company, Time Arts, Inc, Ink jet printers were usually used. With this system she introduced the students to computers and digital image processing tools, to the basics of <b>infography</b> and computer animation. John Dunn also created, the software Vango for the PC. VanGo would evolve into Wonk. Jamy Sheridan worked with John Dunn on the visual part of this newer Wonk sound/image system.Sheridan shared her philosophical heritage about art, science and technology in society with her students: John Dunn, Greg Gundlach, Martha Loving Orgain, Mitch Petchenick, Craig Goldwyn, John Mabey, Phil Malkin, Marilyn Goldstein, Barbara MacKowiak, Michael Day, Jessie Affelder, Bill McCabe, Gerda Bernstein, Elizabeth De Ribes, Pete Lekousis, Brian Oglesbee, Suzanne L. Seed, Marisa González, Mary Jane Dougherty, Holly Pedlosky and Ric Puls.|$|E

This paper shows briefly this scientific experience, developed by experts on both <b>infography</b> and virtual reality, and Phoenician archaeology...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} ways how to {{represent}} results of LISp-Miner application {{on the world}} wide web. This thesis has three main sections. The first section is dedicated to description of data analysis process including description of newly established study of <b>infography</b> and its application in publishing results found du-ring the DZD process. The second part describes exporting of LISp-Miner as well as exporting formats of each module and its combining with other technologies, afterwards follows summarization of all kind of exports of lispminer and its im-provements or create a whole new templates. Third part is dedicated to develop-ment of a web-based application as a tool of repsentation results generated by lispminer. The very last part is contained of future improvements of this application...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} satisfy the {{information}} needs of the intended receivers information design comprises analysis, planning, presentation and understanding of a message—its content, language and form. Regardless of the selected medium, a well designed information material will satisfy aesthetic, economic, ergonomic, as well as subject matter requirements. Information design is a multi-disciplinary, multidimensional and worldwide consideration with influences from areas such as language, art and aesthetics, information, communication, behaviour and cognition, business and law, as well as media production technologies. This paper has two main sections. The first section, Literacies, presents views on literacy. The second section, Information Design, presents several views on information design. As a discipline information design has three main areas of knowledge: (1) <b>infography,</b> (2) infology, and (3) infodidactics. Information design encompasses studies of the way a representatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method based on 3 D reconstruction from images that demonstrates the utility {{and integration of}} close-range photogrammetry and computer vision as an efficient alternative to modelling complex objects and scenarios of forensic <b>infography.</b> The results obtained confirm {{the validity of the}} method compared to other existing alternatives as it guarantees the following: (i) flexibility, permitting work with any type of camera (calibrated and non-calibrated, smartphone or tablet) and image (visible, infrared, thermal, etc.); (ii) automation, allowing the reconstruction of three-dimensional scenarios in the absence of manual intervention, and (iii) high quality results, sometimes providing higher resolution than modern laser scanning systems. As a result, each ocular inspection of a crime scene with any camera performed by the scientific police can be transformed into a scaled 3 d model...|$|E

Este projeto {{consiste}} no desenvolvimento de um material de design informacional impresso, auxiliar à aprendizagem de conteúdos relacionados à Segunda Guerra Mundial. Para sua execução, foram pesquisados temas referentes a comunicação, design informacional, infografia e teorias de aprendizagem, realizadas entrevistas com profissionais de história e com possíveis usuários do produto final, revisão bibliográfica do assunto abordado, seleção das informações a serem apresentadas e uma análise de similares. This work {{presents the}} project developed {{as the result}} of the final papers I and II of the Visual Design graduation course of Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. The project comprises the development of a printed informational design material that works assisting the learning of contents related to World War II. For its implementation, some topics were surveyed in the areas of communication, informational design, <b>infography</b> and learning theories. Also, there were made interviews with history professionals and potential users of the final product, bibliographic review of the subject matter discussed, selection of information to be presented and an analysis with similar didactic materials...|$|E
40|$|Today, where {{information}} is continually transferred {{in the form}} of data, the word “information” has all but been exchanged for the word “data. ” This shift of terms has aided in effectively transforming the world into a network-world of data. In many areas, and for many professionals, condensing information has become an almost exclusive preoccupation. This need to condense information through selecting and summarizing events—via the use of statistics, <b>infography,</b> visualization software, reports, databases, and animations—has dominated our mental landscape; it dominates the way we structure our perception of reality. Therefore, it is important to rethink what this phenomenon represents and how artists are responding to it. In this network-world of data spam (which is unsolicited e-mail or electronic data sent en mass) {{has become one of the}} symbols representing the flux of disinformation, and/or unsolicited, information. Anti-spam is, therefore, a method of eliminating and screening the source data, a tool I call impedance. If we apply this point of view to contemporary art, we could consider the works of Pavel Braila, R. Luke DuBois and André Sier as anti-spam filters that allow the detection, screening, elimination, and subsequent reinvention of existing or non-existent data. In this essay, I propose considering the fundamental aspects of data mining, data visualization, projection mapping. From such considerations emerges the ability to generate, process, and recreate data from the work of these three artists. Finally, I introduce the perspective of the artist as a data miner, this reinvents its source in the new visual, social and political datascape...|$|E
