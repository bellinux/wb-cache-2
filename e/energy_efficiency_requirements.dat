40|$|The <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>requirement</b> of {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) is especially high because the sensor nodes are meant to operate without human intervention {{for a long period}} of time with little energy supply. Besides, available storage is scarce due to their small physical size. Therefore choosing the most storage- and energy-efficient block cipher for WSNs is important. However to our knowledge so far, no systematic work has been conducted in this area. In this paper, we have identified the candidates of block ciphers suitable for WSNs based on existing literature and authoritative recommendations. We have benchmarked these candidates and based on this benchmark, we have selected the suitable ciphers for WSNs, namely Rijndael for high security and <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> requirements; but MISTY 1 for good storage and <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In terms of operation mode, we recommend Output Feedback Mode for static networks, but Counter Mode for dynamic networks. 1...|$|R

Moreover, a large amount of carbon dioxide is emitted, results into increased global warming in near future.

50|$|A {{more recent}} {{phenomenon}} {{is the concept}} of combining the benefits of performance contracting with the benefits of green buildings, affectionately described as green performance contracting. The reason the concept makes sense is because for green buildings, the costliest pre-requisites to meet are usually the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>requirements.</b> The LEED rating system requires buildings to be benchmarked using the EPA EnergyStar system. The minimum score to meet the LEED prerequisites is a score of 75 or greater (meaning the building is in the top 75 percentile of benchmarked buildings). Since performance contracting attempts to find all the sources of energy waste, then a building that has gone through the performance contracting process should meet the LEED prerequisite.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a delay-QoS-driven spectrum and <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> optimization transmission technique. In particular, considering the cross-layer effective capacity (EC) model in Rayleigh fading channels, a spectrum- and energy-efficient power allocation strategy is proposed when maximum spectrum efficiency is achieved under minimum <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> (EE) <b>requirement.</b> For this purpose, at a target delay-outage probability, the spectrum efficiency {{is measured by}} the EC. Further, the EE is formulated as the ratio of the EC to the total expenditure power. At first, the maximum achievable EE of the link at the target delay-outage probability is found. Then, the optimal power allocation strategy is obtained to maximize the EC subject to a minimum EE constraint set at a certain ratio of the maximum achievable EE. We prove that the optimization problem is a concave maximization problem and develop the global optimal solution. The analytical results show that a considerable EC-gain can be achieved with a small sacrifice in EE. This gain increases considerably as the delay constraint becomes tight. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} for exploring heterogeneous computing engines which include GPUs and FPGAs as accelerators. Our goal is to systematically automate finding solutions for such engines that maximize <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> while meeting <b>requirements</b> in throughput and in resource constraints. The proposed approach, based on a linear programming model, enables optimization of system throughput and <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and analysis of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> sensitivity and power consumption issues. It {{can be used in}} evaluating current and future computing hardware and interfaces to identify appropriate combinations. A heterogeneous system containing a CPU, a GPU and an FPGA with a PCI Express interface is studied based on the High Performance Linpack application. Results indicate that such a heterogeneous computing system is able to provide energy-efficient solutions to scientific computing with various performance demands. The improvement of system <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> is more sensitive to some of the system components, for example in the studied system concurrently improving the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the interface and the GPU by 10 times could lead to over 10 times improvement of the system <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> ...|$|R
