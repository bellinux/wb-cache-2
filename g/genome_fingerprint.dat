40|$|Background: No {{attention}} has been paid on comparing a set of genome sequences crossing genetic components and biological categories with far divergence over large size range. We define it as the systematic comparative genomics and aim to develop the methodology. Results: First, we create a method, GenomeFingerprinter, to unambiguously produce a set of three-dimensional coordinates from a sequence, followed by one three-dimensional plot and six two-dimensional trajectory projections, to illustrate the <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprint</b> of a given genome sequence. Second, we develop a set of concepts and tools, and thereby establish a method called the universal <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprint</b> analysis (UGFA). Particularly, we define the total genetic component configuration (TGCC) (including chromosome, plasmid, and phage) for describing a strain as a systematic unit, the universal <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprint</b> map (UGFM) of TGCC for differentiating strains as a universal system, and the systematic comparative genomics (SCG) for comparing a set of genomes crossing genetic components and biological categories. Third, we construct a method of quantitative analysis to compare two genomes by using the outcome dataset of <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprint</b> analysis. Specifically, we define the geometric center and its geometric mean for a given <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprint</b> map, followed by the Euclidean distance, the differentiate rate, and the weighted differentiate rate to quantitatively describe the difference between two genomes of comparison.

40|$|How {{to compare}} whole genome {{sequences}} at large scale {{has not been}} achieved via conventional methods based on pair-wisely base-to-base comparison; nevertheless, no {{attention was paid to}} handle in-one-sitting a number of genomes crossing genetic category (chromosome, plasmid, and phage) with farther divergences (much less or no homologous) over large size ranges (from Kbp to Mbp). We created a new method, GenomeFingerprinter, to unambiguously produce three-dimensional coordinates from a sequence, followed by one three-dimensional plot and six two-dimensional trajectory projections to illustrate whole genome fingerprints. We further developed a set of concepts and tools and thereby established a new method, universal <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprint</b> analysis. We demonstrated their applications through case studies on over a hundred of genome sequences. Particularly, we defined the total genetic component configuration (TGCC) (i. e., chromosome, plasmid, and phage) for describing a strain as a system, and the universal <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprint</b> map (UGFM) of TGCC for differentiating a strain as a universal system, as well as the systematic comparative genomics (SCG) for comparing in-one-sitting a number of genomes crossing genetic category in diverse strains. By using UGFM, UGFM-TGCC, and UGFM-TGCC-SCG, we compared a number of genome sequences with farther divergences (chromosome, plasmid, and phage; bacterium, archaeal bacterium, and virus) over large size ranges (6 Kbp~ 5 Mbp), giving new insights into critical problematic issues in microbial genomics in the post-genomic era. This paper provided a new method for rapidly computing, geometrically visualizing, and intuitively comparing genome sequences at fingerprint level, and hence established a new method of universal <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprint</b> analysis for systematic comparative genomics.

40|$|We {{present an}} ultrafast method for {{comparing}} personal genomes. We transform the standard genome representation (lists of variants {{relative to a}} reference) into “genome fingerprints” via locality sensitive hashing. The resulting <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprints</b> can be meaningfully compared even when the input data were obtained using different sequencing technologies, processed using different pipelines, represented in different data formats and relative to different reference versions. Furthermore, <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprints</b> are robust to up to 30 % missing data. Because of their reduced size, computation on the <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprints</b> is fast and requires little memory. For example, we could compute all-against-all pairwise comparisons among the 2504 genomes in the 1000 Genomes data set in 67 s at high quality (21 μs per comparison, on a single processor), and achieved a lower quality approximation in just 11 s. Efficient computation enables scaling up a variety of important genome analyses, including quantifying relatedness, recognizing duplicative sequenced genomes in a set, population reconstruction, and many others. The original genome representation cannot be reconstructed from its <b>fingerprint,</b> effectively decoupling <b>genome</b> comparison from genome interpretation; the method thus has significant implications for privacy-preserving genome analytics...|$|R

A total of 835 isolates from 72 unrelated patients and 22 siblings with CF {{were analyzed by}} <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> and serotyping, bacteriophage typing, and pyocin typing.

The physical genome analysis allowed us to classify P. aeruginosa strains in terms of DNA relatedness. Related strains differed by fewer than six DraI bands in the fingerprint, whereas unrelated strains differed by more than 20 DraI bands. All unrelated CF patients were colonized with different strains. The absence of a nosocomial spread of organisms at the CF center was attributed to the strict hygiene measures observed at the hospital.

These results revealed {{for the first time the}} existence of bacteriophages that are active against L. fallax and confirmed the presence and diversity of bacteriophages in a sauerkraut fermentation. Since a variety of L. fallax strains have been shown to be present in sauerkraut fermentation, bacteriophages active against L. fallax are likely to contribute to the microbial ecology of sauerkraut fermentation and could be responsible for some of the variability observed in this type of fermentation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{implemented}} {{a method that}} identifies the genomic origins of sample proteins by scanning their peptide-mass fingerprint against the theoretical translation and proteolytic digest of an entire genome. Unlike previously reported techniques, this method requires no predefined ORF or protein annotations. Fixed-size windows along the genome sequence are scored by an equation accounting {{for the number of}} matching peptides, the number of missed enzymatic cleavages in each peptide, the number of in-frame stop codons within a window, the adjacency between peptides, and duplicate peptide matches. Statistical significance of matching regions is assessed by comparing their scores to scores from windows matching randomly generated mass data. Tests with samples from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria and Escherichia coli have demonstrated the ability to produce statistically significant identifications, agreeing with two commonly used programs, peptident and mascot, in 86 % of samples analyzed. This <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprint</b> scanning method has the potential to aid in genome annotation, identify proteins for which annotation is incorrect or missing, and handle cases where sequencing errors have caused framing mistakes in the databases. It might also aid in the identification of proteins in which recoding events such as frameshifting or stop-codon read-through have occurred, elucidating alternative translation mechanisms.

Based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences, PCR-based <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, they formed two groups, A (119 strains) and B (12 strains). As members of each group were highly similar, a single strain of each group was subsequently characterized by a polyphasic taxonomic approach.

40|$|Abstract Background Syphilis {{spirochete}} Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum {{remains the}} enigmatic pathogen, since no virulence {{factors have been}} identified and the pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood. Increasing rates of new syphilis cases per year have been observed recently. Results The genome of the SS 14 strain was sequenced to high accuracy by an oligonucleotide array strategy requiring hybridization to only three arrays (Comparative Genome Sequencing, CGS). Gaps in the resulting sequence were filled with targeted dideoxy-terminators (DDT) sequencing and the sequence was confirmed by whole <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> (WGF). When compared to the Nichols strain, 327 single nucleotide substitutions (224 transitions, 103 transversions), 14 deletions, and 18 insertions were found. On the proteome level, the highest frequency of amino acid-altering substitution polymorphisms was in novel genes, while the lowest was in housekeeping genes, as expected by their evolutionary conservation. Evidence was also found for hypervariable regions and multiple regions showing intrastrain heterogeneity in the T. pallidum chromosome. Conclusion The observed genetic changes do not have influence {{on the ability of}} Treponema pallidum to cause syphilitic infection, since both SS 14 and Nichols are virulent in rabbit. However, this is the first assessment of the degree of variation between the two syphilis pathogens and paves the way for phylogenetic studies of this fascinating organism. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed-field gel {{electrophoresis}} of DNA macrorestriction fragments (macrorestriction analysis) allows epidemiologic typing and delineation of genetic relatedness of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by indexing {{variations in the}} global chromosome architecture. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -mediated <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> can also discriminate MRSA strains by detecting locally variable DNA motifs. To assess the correlation between these methods, 48 epidemic MRSA strains collected from 20 hospitals over a 10 -year period were tested in a blind comparison by (i) macrorestriction analysis with SstII or SmaI endonuclease and (ii) PCR fingerprinting with four primer sets aimed at the mecA gene, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences, and arbitrary sequences. Isolates were discriminated into 22 macrorestriction patterns and 15 PCR fingerprints. MRSA strains belonging to 12 distinct clones by macrorestriction analysis showed 11 distinct PCR genotypes distinguished by multiple band differences. In contrast, 34 of 37 MRSA strains found to be clonally related by macrorestriction analysis clustered in two highly related PCR genotypes that differed by a single DNA fragment (P < 0. 0001). These data demonstrate concordant clonal delineation of epidemic MRSA by macrorestriction analysis and PCR fingerprinting and thereby indicate that the rapid PCR assay may be an efficient epidemiologic typing system.

40|$|Here {{we present}} a new {{analytical}} framework for physical mapping of complex <b>genomes</b> using <b>fingerprinting</b> data for BAC libraries. The corresponding tool, Linear Topology Contig (LTC) software package for contig assembly is based on exploring the topology of clone overlaps. We demonstrate how LTC {{can be used for}} construction, verification, elongation, merging, and “curing ” of the contigs. The examples are based on practice with real and simulated data. Some more detailed explanations on LTC approach can be found also in our attached manuscript (Frenkel et al [1]) ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: An {{outbreak}} of gram-negative bacteremia in patients undergoing {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP) was investigated to determine the sources of infection and to control transmission. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: The incidence of post-ERCP bacteremia increased from 1. 6 % (60 of 3, 696) procedures to 3. 6 % (53 of 1, 454) procedures (relative risk 2. 3, p < 0. 0001) after endoscopes were processed in a new automated disinfector. Bacteremia involved nine species of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae, which were also isolated from processed endoscopes. Seven epidemic strains with highly related genomic macrorestriction profiles each infected 2 or more patients, accounting for 29 (55 %) episodes of post-ERCP bacteremia. Strains recovered from endoscopes and from the disinfector were associated with 22 (42 %) and 5 (9 %) bacteremic episodes respectively. Effective endoscope disinfection was achieved by cleansing and disinfection of a blind channel not processed in the disinfector, additional isopropanol- air flush of all channels, and auto-disinfection of the disinfector. In the following period, the incidence of post-ERCP bacteremia returned to the pre- epidemic rate (1. 7 %, p = 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Bacterial <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> by macrorestriction analysis enabled delineation of a multi-strain {{outbreak of}} post-ERCP bacteremia. Cross-contamination, {{and to a lesser}} extent, common- source contamination, appeared related to inadequate disinfection of endoscopes processed in an automated disinfector.

40|$|The use of {{molecular}} markers to track loci and genome regions in barley is routinely applied in many breeding programs. The location of major loci {{is now known}} for many disease resistance genes, tolerances to abiotic stresses and quality traits. There are three aspects that are particularly significant. First, we now have markers closely linked to many traits of importance in the breeding programs. Indeed we have markers for more loci than we can screen in a conventional breeding program. Second, we have tools that allow marker scanning of the whole genome. SSR markers form the base for this analysis and highly multiplexed SSR screens {{have been developed for}} barley. This has improved our capacity for whole genome screens. Third, through association mapping projects we have or {{are in the process of}} developing, whole <b>genome</b> <b>fingerprints</b> for many key lines and varieties of importance in breeding. Existing strategies for marker-assisted selection (MAS) were initiated with a view of markers as providing a rapid and cheap alternative to bioassays and they have largely been used in this role. While highly successful, this strategy does not fully utilize the technology. The key challenge of new work is to investigate strategies for whole genome breeding: that is, to see how we can use genome information to design optimal breeding strategies that integrate as much of the available information as possible.
