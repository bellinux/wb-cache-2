The OEE method (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) was used for the analysis. The selected company deals with the produc-tion of tapered roller bearings. The analysis of effectiveness was done for 17 automatic grinding lines working in the department of grinding rollers. Low level of efficiency of machines was affected by problems with the availability of ma-chines and devices. The causes of machine downtime on these lines was also analyzed. Three basic causes of downtime were identified: no kanban card, <b>diamonding,</b> no operator. Ways to improve the use of these machines were suggested.

40|$|Key words:diamond;saw blade; {{drilling}} bit;embedding strength Abstract. It is {{stated that}} <b>Diamond</b> saw blades requires high embedding {{strength of the}} <b>diamond,</b> while <b>diamond</b> drill bits do not. It is necessary to improve the embedding strength of <b>diamond</b> in <b>diamond</b> saw blades, {{rather than in the}} <b>diamond</b> drilling bits. It is recommended to count the number of <b>diamond</b> particles on the matrix surface and get the embedding strength of <b>diamond</b> by calculation. Another recommendation is to use the compound powder of cobalt and tungsten carbide for pelletizing in order to improve the embedding strength of <b>diamond</b> and lower the cost of matrix. There are people studying how to raise embedding strength of <b>diamond,</b> for both <b>diamond</b> saw blades and <b>diamond</b> drilling bit. However, the requirements for embedding strength of <b>diamond</b> saw blades and <b>diamond</b> drilling bit are different. The following parts include the analysis for this problem. Requirement of embedding strength for <b>diamond</b> drilling bit As shown in Figure 1, there are two counter forces on the surface <b>diamond</b> drill bit matrix. Force n is upwards, which won’t causes the <b>diamond</b> to fall off. The only possibility is Force t. Force t forms a very small torque, which can hardly pull the <b>diamond</b> down, especially in the presence of Force n. Only when the matrix has worn away heavily, the <b>diamond</b> might fall down...|$|R

5000|$|A pink <b>diamond</b> is only {{considered}} genuine, valuable, and investment-grade {{if it is}} pink {{from its}} inception.

A synthetic <b>diamond</b> is chemically the same as a mined <b>diamond</b> but its value is proportionally much lower. Therefore, a synthetic pink <b>diamond</b> does not have the value of a genuine pink <b>diamond.</b> Generally speaking, if a <b>diamond</b> is priced well beneath the market value, it is because the <b>diamond</b> is synthetic and the seller is hoping to make a sale.
