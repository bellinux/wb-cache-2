2500|$|The Long Depression was a {{worldwide}} price and economic recession, beginning in 1873 and running either through {{the spring of}} 1879, or 1896, depending on the metrics used.What actually constitutes the Long Depression has been debatable, for {{at first it was}} called the Great Depression, and then that title was transferred to the 1930s. Consequently, some limit the term Long Depression to the worldwide price recession beginning in 1873 and running through the spring of 1879. Six years is not exactly a [...] "long" [...] depression, that <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> is 26 years – the typical maximum period which Japan entered following 1989.95. Europe appears to be completing a 13 year depression from 2007 into 2020 thanks to austerity – deliberate deflation to support bondholders. It was the most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fueled by the Second Industrial Revolution in the decade following the American Civil War. The episode was labeled the [...] "Great Depression" [...] at the time, and it held that designation until the Great Depression of the 1930s. Though a period of general deflation and a general contraction, it did not have the severe economic retrogression of the Great Depression.|$|E
2500|$|John Foster wrote {{a review}} for the April 1811 Eclectic Review which said, [...] "We must repeat then, {{in the first}} place, our censure of the {{adoption}} or creation of so absurd a fable" [...] and [...] "The next chief point of censure would be, that this absurdity is also paganism; but this has been noticed so pointedly and repeatedly <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>analysis,</b> that a very few words here will suffice." [...] In an analysis of other aspects, Foster argued, [...] "The general diction {{of the work is}} admirably strong, and various, and free; and, in going through it, we have repeatedly exulted in the capabilities of the English language. The author seems to have in a great measure grown out of that affected simplicity of expression, of which he has generally been accused. The versification, as to measure and rhyme, is a complete defiance of all rule, and all example... This is objectionable, chiefly, as it allows the poet to riot away in a wild wantonness of amplification". An anonymous review in the June 1811 Literary Panorama stated, [...] "If we were desired to name a poet whose command of language enables him to express in the most suitable and energetic terms the images which agitate his mind, we should name Mr. Southey; if we were requested to point out a poem which to freedom of manner in the construction of its stanzas, united a condensation of phrase, with a happy collocation of words, thereby producing force, we should recommend Kehama".|$|E

The laws of mind as {{characterized}} in {{the preceding}} chapter, compose the universal or abstract portion of the philosophy of human nature; and all the truths of common experience, constituting a practical knowledge of mankind, must, {{to the extent to}} which they are truths, be results or consequences of these.

6000|$|If we {{have been}} right <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> of mind, the {{ultimate}} data of psychology are only sensations and images and their relations. Beliefs, desires, volitions, and so on, appeared to us to be complex phenomena consisting of sensations and images variously interrelated. Thus (apart from certain relations) the occurrences which seem most distinctively mental, and furthest removed from physics, are, like physical objects, constructed or inferred, {{not part of the}} original stock of data in the perfected science. From both ends, therefore, the difference between physical and psychological data is diminished. Is there ultimately no difference, or do images remain as irreducibly and exclusively psychological? In view of the causal definition of the difference between images and sensations, this brings us to a new question, namely: Are the causal laws of psychology different from those of any other science, or are they really physiological? ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. In all {{branches}} of practical business {{there are cases}} in which individuals are bound to conform their practice to a pre-established rule, while there are others {{in which it is}} part of their task to find or construct the rule by which they are to govern their conduct. The first, for example, is the case of a judge, under a definite written code. The judge is not called upon to determine what course would be intrinsically the most advisable in the particular case in hand, but only within what rule of law it falls; what the legislature has ordained {{to be done in the}} kind of case, and must therefore be presumed to have intended in the individual case. The method must here be wholly and exclusively one of ratiocination, or syllogism; and the process is obviously, what <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> of the syllogism we showed that all ratiocination is, namely the interpretation of a formula.|$|E

60|$|An {{emotion in}} its {{entirety}} is, of course, something much more complex than a perception. An emotion is essentially a process, {{and it will be}} only what one may call a cross-section of the emotion that will be a perception, of a bodily condition according to James, or (in certain cases) of an external object according to his opponents. An emotion {{in its entirety}} contains dynamic elements, such as motor impulses, desires, pleasures and pains. Desires and pleasures and pains, according to the theory adopted in Lecture III, are characteristics of processes, not separate ingredients. An emotion--rage, for example--will be a certain kind of process, consisting of perceptions and (in general) bodily movements. The desires and pleasures and pains involved are properties of this process, not separate items in the stuff of which the emotion is composed. The dynamic elements in an emotion, if we are right <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>analysis,</b> contain, from our point of view, no ingredients beyond those contained in the processes considered in Lecture III. The ingredients of an emotion are only sensations and images and bodily movements succeeding each other according to a certain pattern. With this conclusion we may leave the emotions and pass to the consideration of the will.|$|E
60|$|Thus far {{of labor}} or wages {{as an element}} in cost of production. But <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>analysis,</b> in the First Book, of the {{requisites}} of production, we found that there is another necessary element in it besides labor. There is also capital; and this being the result of abstinence, the produce, or its value, must be sufficient to remunerate, not only all the labor required, but the abstinence of all the persons by whom the remuneration of the different classes of laborers was advanced. The return from abstinence is Profit. And profit, we have also seen, is not exclusively the surplus remaining to the capitalist after he has been compensated for his outlay, but forms, in most cases, no unimportant part of the outlay itself. The flax-spinner, part of whose expenses consists of the purchase of flax and of machinery, has had to pay, in their price, not only the wages of the labor by which the flax was grown and the machinery made, but the profits of the grower, the flax-dresser, the miner, the iron-founder, and the machine-maker. All these profits, together {{with those of the}} spinner himself, were again advanced by the weaver, in the price of his material—linen yarn; and along with them the profits of a fresh set of machine-makers, and of the miners and iron-workers who supplied them with their metallic material. All these advances form part of the cost of production of linen. Profits, therefore, as well as wages, enter into the cost of production which determines the value of the produce.|$|E
60|$|It was shown, however, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> of {{the effects}} of {{international}} trade, as it had been often shown by former writers, that the importation of foreign commodities, in the common course of traffic, never takes place except when it is, economically speaking, a national good, by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country. To prohibit, therefore, this importation, or impose duties which prevent it, is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be, and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad. The amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported. In the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor, or of the capital which supports that labor. Those who are supposed to be benefited, namely, the makers of the protected articles (unless they form an exclusive company, and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners), do not obtain higher profits than other people. All is sheer loss to the country {{as well as to the}} consumer.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} landesque capital {{was first used}} in {{academic}} texts by economist Amartya Sen. It occurred in his 1959 thesis on the choice of techniques of agriculture for “underdeveloped countries”. Sen claimed that previous studies had failed {{to take into account}} the implications of such technical investments for non-wage economies with land as a dominant factor of production: Once land is introduced <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>analysis,</b> we have to distinguish between two types of capital goods—those which replace labour (e.g., tractors) and those which replace land (e.g., fertilizers). We may call them, for the sake of brevity, “laboresque” capital and “landesque” capital respectively.... Our experience seems to suggest that while investment in fertilizers,or in irrigation, or in pest control, increases yield per acre considerably(without replacing labor), investment in machines like tractors, threshing machines, etc., is useful mainly in replacing labor (without raising yield per acre).|$|E

5000|$|In other words, while Milton's Satan embodies {{a spirit}} of rebellion, and, as Maud Bodkin claims, [...] "The theme of his heroic {{struggle}} and endurance against hopeless odds wakens in poet and reader a sense of his own state as against the odds of his destiny". However, Satan's character is flawed because his aims are not humanistic. Satan is like Prometheus in his struggle against the universe, but Satan loses his heroic aspect after being turned into a serpent who desires only revenge and becomes an enemy to mankind. But Bodkin, unlike Shelley, believes that humans would view Prometheus and Satan together in a negative way:We must similarly recognize that within our actual experience the factors we distinguish are more massively intangible, more mutually incompatible and more insistent than they can appear as translated into reflective speech. Take, for example, the sense of sin imaginatively revived as we respond to Milton's presentation of Satan, or to the condemnation, suggested by Aeschylus' drama, of the rebellion of Prometheus in effecting the 'progress' of man. What <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> we might express as the thought that progress is evil or sinful, would, {{in the mind of}} Aeschylus, Abercromer comments, 'more likely be a shadowy relic of loyalty to the tribe' - a vague fear of anything that might weaken social solidarity. Not in the mind of Aeschylus only but {{in the mind of the}} reader of to-day.|$|E
