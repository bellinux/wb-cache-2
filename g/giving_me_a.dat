500|$|In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison {{explains}} that the song title was a reference to [...] "a 'headache' {{as well as a}} footpedal", the wah-wah pedal being a guitar effect that he favoured for much of the early Get Back sessions. The message of the song, according to Harrison, was: [...] "you're <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bloody headache." [...] Leng identifies [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as being directed at the [...] "artifice" [...] and [...] "pretense" [...] surrounding the Beatles.|$|E
5000|$|In a long {{interview}} {{conducted by}} Alan Lomax in 1938, Jelly Roll Morton recalled {{that the first}} blues he had heard, probably around 1900, was played by a singer and prostitute, Mamie Desdunes, in Garden District, New Orleans. Morton sang the blues: [...] "Can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ You can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ Just to feed that hungry man of mine".

500|$|... "Million Reasons" [...] {{is written}} in the key of C major with its tempo {{swinging}} around 64 beats per minute, and is accompanied by piano and guitar. Gaga's vocals span from G3 to E5 in the song, which in common time, follows a progression of C–Am–F–G, with a chorus of F–C–Am–G. During the song's chorus, Gaga croons [...] "You're <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> million reasons {{to let you go}} / You're <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> million reasons to quit the show". Its discussion of heartbreak and hope, as described by International Business Timess Nicholas Mojica, was guaranteed to [...] "resonate with [...] listeners" [...] of the record. Bustles Amy Roberts theorized that, like most of the songs from Joanne, [...] "Million Reasons" [...] had extra hidden depth in its lyrics and predicted it to be about Gaga's separated boyfriend Taylor Kinney. The phrase [...] "quit the show" [...] was described as a metaphor by Roberts about Gaga feeling dejected about her life, with the second verses confirming this. Both romantic heartbreak as catalyst and religious faith of the singer were represented as different sides of the lyrics. Roberts concluded by saying that [...] "hough the song may seem extremely fraught with sadness, confusion and heartache, its main message appears to be a pretty positive one".|$|E
500|$|Despite Booth's views {{being more}} genteel {{than that of}} most of his teammates, there was minimal {{friction}} or disconnect. Early in his state career, Booth declined to join a Melbourne Cup gambling sweep organised by captain Keith Miller. However, Miller included Booth in the event by assigning him {{to look after the}} money. Booth said [...] "That was typical of Keith. That he was able to turn something that might have been a problem into something positive, <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> responsibility, making me feel part of the team." [...] He added [...] "The boys just accepted me for what I was. If they didn't share the strength of my convictions, they were quite happy for me to hold them." [...] Simpson said that Booth never attempted to impose his worldview on his teammates and never gave any inkling that he disapproved of their behaviour.|$|E
500|$|In December 1864, the {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, ordered {{an invasion of}} the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation for an attack on Rio Grande do Sul. The invasions resulted in an alliance between Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Following the resignation of Caxias's government in 1862, successor cabinets were headed by the Progressive League, the rival of the Conservative Party. As a Conservative, Joaquim Inácio found himself largely sidelined. He humorously commented that the Progressives [...] "have not lifted my excommunication by <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> better ration of soup , thus I shall remain on a diet". In October 1865, Joaquim Inácio {{was sent to the}} north of Brazil, charged with recruiting volunteers, but soon resigned that commission and opted to devote his time to the Holy House of Mercy.|$|E

500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> reason to live. All I had to do was look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E
500|$|Second, Schulz is {{credited}} with being the first center to {{step back from the}} line while playing defense. [...] Prior to Schulz's innovation, centers played in the line on defense. [...] In 1905, Schulz began dropping back from the line, enabling him to use his speed to move laterally and giving him greater coverage across the field of play. [...] At the time, the innovation was referred to as a [...] "roving center", but it was effectively the birth of the linebacker position in American football. [...] Asked how he developed the [...] "roving center" [...] idea, Schulz noted that the backs started from five yards behind the line and concluded, [...] "No back living could move five yards while I was moving four". [...] He described his thinking to Coach Yost this way: [...] "It's all very simple, Yost. The ball carrier travels five yards while I travel only four yard to meet him. [...] I know of no back who can beat me in a five-yard race after <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> one-yard handicap".|$|E

The clip was official released {{few hours after}} she posted a 2000-word thank you message to fans on her official website on August 28, 2013. A part of the letter reads,I may get quiet at times, but when I do have something to say, I mean every word. I decided to share my thoughts with you at length and tell you openly how I feel.

It also featured guest appearances from Nicole Richie, Christina Milian, Chris Mann, Aguilera's son, Max Bratman, and her current boyfriend Matthew Rutler.

2500|$|Known for reinventing {{her style}} and image, Rihanna's music and fashion sense are {{noted by the}} media. In 2009, New York {{magazine}} described Rihanna's early look as that of [...] "a cookie-cutter teen queen", noting she has the ability [...] "to shift looks dramatically and with such ease". Around {{the time of the}} release of her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound, and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé. In an interview with Look magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyonce: [...] "Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles". She revealed during Oprah's Next Chapter that Def Jam's pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label. According to Rihanna, [...] "I felt like they were <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was." [...] With the release of her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller Æon Flux (2005). She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound.|$|E
