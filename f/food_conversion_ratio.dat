40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The osmoregulatory {{capabilities}} and tolerance of Kelp greenling, Hexagrammos decagramrnus, were studied {{in a series}} of seven salinities ranging from fresh water to concentrated sea water of 50 ppt. Results indicated that they were tolerant over a wide range of salinities but were incapable of surviving below 5 ppt and above 45 ppt. In moderate salinities ranging from 7. 5 to 45 ppt, the fish required approximately 48 hours for their plasma osmolarity to stabilize. Kelp greenling were hyperosmotic at 7. 5 ppt but at higher salinities of 15 ppt and above, became hyposmotic, capable of maintaining the plasma osmolarity about 360 mOsm/Kg in sea water. Acclimation to low salinity (7. 5 ppt) for more than two months had no effect on their survival or tolerance to challenges to sea water. The effects of different salinities (7. 5, 15, and 30 ppt) on growth, <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> and oxygen consumption were studied.

Two offshore cages (339 m 3) were placed {{at a depth}} of 10 m in a sheltered area 500 m off the coast. Juveniles (101. 97 ± 14. 54 g), caught with seine nets 400 - 1200 m from the coast, were stocked in the cages at 250 per cage. Fish in one cage, Group A, were fed commercial pellets for all 20 months whilst fish in the second cage, Group B, were fed pellets for the first 16 months and frozen sardines for the following four. The mean live weight, survival, feed <b>conversion</b> <b>ratio,</b> daily feed consumption, and water quality parameters were recorded monthly. Group B reached a significantly (p< 0. 05) greater weight (2785. 00 ± 64. 91 g) than Group A (2441. 14 ± 38. 13 g). <b>Food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> ranged 1. 16 - 2. 46 for group A and 1. 10 - 2. 28 for group B, low when compared with other studies on amberjacks in the Mediterranean. Average mortality was 25 %, due to a Zeuxapta seriolae (Monogenea: Heteraxinidae) infection in December 2006 (20 %) and fish handling for measurement in June 2007 (~ 5 %).

Bacillus subtilis, as a probiotic, may have beneficial effects on Y. tilapia with compound 1 -deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), which has antibacterial activities. The effects of dietary probiotic supplementation on Y. tilapias were evaluated. Results: Juvenile Y. tilapia was fed with B. subtilis for 56  d. Y. tilapia was infected by Aeromonas hydrophila and survival rate was compared. Dietary B. subtilis increased weight gain rate, specific growth, <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> and <b>food</b> intake rate of Y. tilapia. The diet improved the cumulative survival rate (CSR) of juvenile Y. tilapia when the concentration of B. subtilis was more than 2. 05  ×  1010  cfu/kg and CSR reached a maximum rate when the concentration of bacillus was 4. 23  ×  1010 (P <  0. 05). Meanwhile, B. subtilis improved total antioxidant capacity (TAC), spleen index, the activities of serum lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (P <  0. 05). In contrast, B. subtilis reduced serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA) and C 3 complement (P <  0. 05). DNJ was isolated from secondary metabolisms and proved to increase the levels of SOD, CAT and reduce the levels of AST, ALT and MDA at cell levels. After A. hydrophila infection, DNJ prevented the reduction in survival rate of Y. tilapia (P <  0. 05).

30|$|In {{natural systems}} C. {{destructor}} and C. cainii {{are known to}} consume predominantly animal matter, such as small fishes and gastropods in summer; however, during winter, diets shift towards a more herbivorous predominance with crayfish consuming greater amounts of Melaleuca spp. when the abundance of high-protein food sources became limited (Beatty 2006). There are no studies that have documented this dynamic in extensive or semi-intensive aquaculture pond systems. Species richness and abundance of naturally occurring pond biota will likely vary seasonally, particularly at farms where water is sourced from natural river systems such as Biboorha Farm, which obtains water directly from the Barron River, and at farms with little to no filtration of incoming water. However, Stenroth et al.

The authors suggested that the crayfish either had a consistent diet throughout the seasons or that crayfish muscle tissue had a turnover rate slow enough to mask any differences of the diet during those months in-between sampling. Given the variability of pond productivity and performance of supplementary feed a nutritionally complete feed that is water stable, digestible by redclaw and therefore utilised more efficiently will result in improved <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> (FCRs), reduce nutrient loading in pond aquaculture systems and decrease harvest times, all of which have direct cost benefits to the farmer.

Using a construct in which an ocean pout antifreeze promoter drives a chinook salmon growth hormone gene, dramatic growth enhancement has been demonstrated, in which the mean weight of the 7 month old G 2 transgenic fish is more than three fold that of their non transgenic siblings. Somewhat surprisingly G 1 fish transgenic for a construct consisting of a sockeye salmon metallothionein promoter spliced to a sockeye salmon growth hormone gene exhibited no growth enhancement, although salmon transgenic for this construct do show greatly enhanced growth. The growth enhanced transgenic lines were also strongly positive in a radio-immuno assay for the specific hormone in their serum, whereas the non growth enhanced lines were negative. Attempts to induce expression from the metallothionein promoter by exposing fish to increased levels of zinc were also unsuccessful. Homozygous transgenic fish have been produced from the ocean pout antifreeze=chinook salmon GH construct and preliminary trials suggest that their growth performance {{is similar to that}} of the hemizygous transgenics.

The aim of this study, then, was to elucidate the characteristic metabolic organization of octopus paralarvae throughout an ontogenic period of 12 days post-hatching, as well as assess the effect of diet enrichment with live prey containing abundant marine phospholipids. Our results showed that throughout the ontogenic period studied, an increase in anaerobic metabolism took place largely due to an increased dependence of paralarvae on exogenous food. Our studies showed that this activity was supported by octopine dehydrogenase activity, with a less significant contribution of lactate dehydrogenase activity. Regarding aerobic metabolism, the use of amino acids was maintained {{for the duration of the}} experiment. Our studies also showed a significant increase in the rate of oxidation of fatty acids from 6 days after-hatching. A low, although sustained, capacity for de novo synthesis of glucose from amino acids and glycerol was also observed. Regardless of the composition of the food, glycerol kinase activity significantly increased a few days prior to a massive mortality event. This could be related to a metabolic imbalance in the redox state responsible for the high mortality. Thus, glycerol kinase might be used as an effective nutritional and welfare biomarker. The studies in this report also revealed the important finding that feeding larvae with phospholipid-enriched Artemia improved animal viability and welfare, significantly increasing the rate of survival and growth of paralarvae.

40|$|Give {{a person}} a fish {{and he will}} have food for a day; teach him to grow fish and he will have food for a lifetime", so goes the old Chinese saying. Application of this wisdom on a world-wide scale could {{go a long way}} in {{producing}} food for the hungry millions. To help spread this principle and philosophy is important in aquaculture. This thesis focuses on strategies to improve the growing techniques of juvenile flatfish with emphasis on yellowtail flounder, Limanda ferruginea (Storer), which has been identified as a potential species for cold-water aquaculture along the north-east coast of Canada. [...] Optimal food rations can affect the commercial success of any aquaculture venture. The effects of ration levels on growth performance of 0 + juvenile yellowtail flounder was examined for fish held under a 16 L: 8 D photoperiod. Two experiments were conducted; the first using ration levels of 1, 2, 4, 6 % (body weight⋅d⁻¹ (bw ⋅d⁻¹)) on small juveniles (mean initial weight ± SE 1. 0 ± 0. 04 g) held at 7. 0 °C with a stocking density of 0. 95 kg⋅m⁻ ²(~ 45 % bottom coverage). The second experiment used ration levels of 1, 1. 5, 2, 3 % bw ⋅d⁻¹ on large juveniles (mean initial weight ± SE 7. 39 ±. 07 g) held at 10 °C with a stocking density of 1. 45 kg⋅m⁻² (~ 34 % bottom coverage). Survival in both experiments was not significantly different. Results of experiment 1 indicated that fish fed 1 % bw ⋅d⁻¹ had significantly lower growth (weight, length, body depth and specific growth rates) (p< 0. 05) than those fed 2, 4 and 6 % bw ⋅d⁻¹. Significant differences (p< 0. 05) with gross <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> rations (GFCR's) were found between fish fed rations of 1 % and 2 % and those fed 4 % and 6 % rations, but 4 - 6 % bw ⋅d⁻¹ were poor in terms of gross <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios,</b> resulting in <b>food</b> wastage. Results of experiment 2 indicated that fish fed 1, 1. 5 and 2 % bw ⋅d⁻¹ had significantly lower growth (weight, length and specific growth rates) (p< 0. 05) than fish fed 3 % bw ⋅d⁻¹. Gross <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> rations (GFCR's) were significantly different (p< 0. 05) for all 4 rations. Overall, this study demonstrated that it would be more feasible to use a ration of 2 % bw ⋅d⁻¹ for small juveniles and 1 - 1. 5 % bw ⋅d⁻¹ for large juveniles. [...] It has been demonstrated that increased photoperiods improve growth and survival during the larval stage of this species. I conducted an experiment to determine the effect of photoperiod on growth and survival of 1 + juvenile yellowtail flounder. This experiment compared growth and survival rates of juveniles (mean initial weight ± SE = 9. 25 ± 0. 22 g) under 24, 18, 12 and daily ambient photoperiod. A stocking density of 0. 47 kg⋅m⁻² (~ 10 % bottom coverage) and a feeding ration of 2 % (body weight⋅d⁻¹ (bw⋅d⁻¹)) was used. Temperature was held at 7. 0 °C. No significant differences in growth or survival among juveniles were found under the different photoperiods. It appears that the most cost-effective approach is to provide a simulated natural photoperiod for juvenile yellowtail flounder. [...] There is a need for an "optimal stocking density" of juvenile flatfish to be established for cultured species in hatchery situations. This final study in my thesis examined the effects of three different stocking densities on the growth performance and survival of 0 + juvenile yellowtail flounder held under 16 L: 8 D photoperiod. Three densities of 0. 47, 0. 95 and 1. 9 kg⋅m⁻² with 23 %, 45 % and 90 % bottom coverage was used. Juvenile yellowtail (mean initial weight ± SE = 1. 02 ± 0. 05 g) were fed a feed ration of 2 % (body weight⋅d⁻¹ (bw⋅d⁻¹)). Temperature was 7. 0 °C. No significant differences in growth or survival between juveniles were found under the different stocking densities. However, stocking densities with 90 % bottom coverage had slightly lower growth rates and higher gross <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios.</b> [...] Overall results suggests that juvenile yellowtail flounder can be stocked at densities greater than 100 % bottom coverage. Economically, it appears more feasible to use a ration of 2 % bw⋅d⁻¹ for small juveniles and 1 - 1. 5 % bw⋅d⁻¹ for larger juveniles and it appears that the most cost-effective approach is to provide simulated natural photoperiod (min. 6 - 8 hours) for juvenile yellowtail flounder production...|$|R
40|$|Egyptian {{aquaculture}} production has grown rapidly to {{over one million}} tons per year so that it now provides most of the country's fish supply. However, Egyptian fish farmers have received little extension advice or training. An intervention starting in 2012 aimed to address this gap by providing best management practice (BMP) training for pond based tilapia monoculture and tilapia-mullet polyculture fish farmers. A series of field-based training modules were developed and designed with the participation of leading fish farmers and delivered through private sector farmer-trainers to over 2400 fish farm owners and managers. This paper reports {{on the results of}} an impact assessment survey carried out in 2015 comparing fish farm performance, production and profitability in randomly selected farms where the manager had received and was applying the principles of BMP training (BMP) and farms where the manager had not received IEIDEAS project training (control). The results show that although the two groups were very similar in terms of general farm characteristics, BMP farms were more likely to practice tilapia-mullet polyculture than monoculture of tilapia. The main BMP training messages apparent in the results were improved feed and fertilizer management. This resulted in more efficient <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> in BMP farms compared to control farms. Average fish yields and values were similar between the two groups, although BMP farms produced less small-sized tilapia and more mullet than the control farms. Lower feed costs resulted in significantly lower operating costs in BMP farms compared to control farms, whereas fixed costs were similar for the two groups. Average net profits were significantly higher in BMP farms compared to control farms equivalent to additional profits of over $ 15, 000 for an average farm size of 7. 5 hectares. Taking into account the number of farmers trained and BMP adoption rates suggests that $ 18. 9 million additional profits were generated through the intervention in 2014. The results demonstrate that fish farms in mature aquaculture systems can benefit significantly from the adoption of improved farm management practices suggesting that similar approaches, including field-based BMP training and the use of private sector farmer-trainers should be used to accelerate the development of nascent aquaculture sectors in other parts of Africa.

Three production traits were studied: <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratio,</b> days to 100 KG, and average daily gain, using a panel of 39, 436 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In total, we detected 11 genome-wide and 162 chromosome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism trait associations. The Gene ontology analysis identified 14 candidate genes close to significant single nucleotide polymorphisms, with growth-related functions: six for days to 100 KG (WT 1, FBXO 3, DOCK 7, PPP 3 CA, AGPAT 9, and NKX 6 - 1), seven for <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratio</b> (MAP 2, TBX 15, IVL, ARL 15, CPS 1, VWC 2 L, and VAV 3), and one for average daily gain (COL 27 A 1).

Additionally, we found four haplotype blocks composed of suggestive single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the growth trait-related quantitative trait loci and further narrowed down the ranges, the largest of which decreased by ~ 60 Mb. Hence, our results could be used to improve pig production traits by increasing the frequency of favorable alleles via artificial selection...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of a lactic acid bacterium, Pediococcus acidilactici (strain MA 18 / 5 M, CNCM), as a dietary {{probiotic}} on growth performance and some nutritional and microbiological aspects of the shrimp Litopenaeus stylirostris. Experimental shrimp culture was carried out over 10 weeks, using floating cages of 14 m 2 each set in earthen ponds, in a New Caledonia farm affected by "Summer syndrome", a septicaemic vibriosis caused by Vibrio nigripulchritudo. The experiment design testing probiotic-coated pellets against control was replicated in two earthen ponds. High mortalities, characteristic of Summer syndrome, were observed during the first 2 weeks of the trial. The probiotic improved production in the treated cages from both ponds with increases in the survival rate (7 % and 15 % respectively) and final biomass (8 % and 12 % respectively). No differences were recorded among treatments on growth performances, but significant lower <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> were obtained with probiotic treatment. After 5 weeks of rearing, the Hepatosomatic Index and the adjusted dry weight of the digestive gland were significantly increased by 10 % and by 9 % respectively in shrimps treated with probiotic. In the meantime, the specific activities of a amylase and trypsin in the digestive gland showed a significant effect of the probiotic treatment with respective increases by 35 % and 55 %. The rise in total trypsin activity following morning feeding was also enhanced by the probiotic treatment (P< 0. 001). The highest concentration of probiotic (between 104 - 105 CFU g- 1 of fresh gut) in the shrimp gut was obtained 2 h after feeding. The concentration remained high for 4 h after feeding before decreasing until the next meal. Total bacterial counts on Marine agar and TCBS in the gut were significantly lowered by the probiotic treatment over the 10 weeks of the experiment. Additionally, during the first 2 weeks, prevalence and load of V. nigripulchritudo strains in haemolymph was lower in animals fed with the probiotic diet. This study demonstrated, under pond conditions, that feeding shrimp with live terrestrial lactic acid bacteria can be an effective treatment for improving shrimp culture affected by vibriosis...|$|R
40|$|Two {{rooms of}} a pig house {{were used to}} study 2 deep litter systems where the animals were kept on a 50 cm thick layer of sawdust or of chopped straw (10 cm). Seven days {{before the arrival of}} the animals, slurry and a {{microbial}} product used to stimulate the fermentation were added to the litters. Fifteen pigs on sawdust and seventien pigs on straw (floor spaces : 1. 4 and 1. 2 M 2 /pig) were fattened from 23. 1 to 93. 1 kg live weight. Excreta from pigs was dung into the bedding weekly and treated with the microbial product. This labour was considered as too hard in the straw room and was ended at day 105. No sawdust was added during the fattening period but straw was added 5 times to keep the pigs clean and to keep the temperature in the bedding higher than 30 -degrees-C. The mean temperature in the sawdust bed was higher (38 +/- 5, 4 -degrees-C vs 35 +/- 6, 7 -degrees-C, p > 0, 001) and more constant (mean daily variation 1, 3 +/- 1, 6 vs 2, 2 +/- 2, 4 -degrees-C, p > 0, 001) than the temperature recorded in the straw bed. The air temperature and the relative humidity were similar in the 2 rooms (21 -degrees-C and 60 The concentrations of ammonia in the air were measured with Gastec tubes. The average ammonia concentrations recorded during the 7 days before the arrival of the animals (48 +/- 36 ppm vs 12 +/- 9, 2 ppm) and those recorded after the eighth day (11 +/- 5, 6 ppm vs 6, 7 +/- 3, 9 ppm) were significantly higher with the straw system compared with the sawdust system. The daily gains were not significantly different in the 2 rooms (552 g on average) and the <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> in the 2 rooms were 3, 6 kg/kg (on sawdust) and 3, 85 kg/kg (on straw). Carcasses were of equal quality. In conclusion, results were better with the sawdust bed than with the straw bed. The sawdust bed provided a higher temperature in the bedding and a lower ammonia concentration in the air. The routine weekly task of digging was easier in the sawdust bed and the bedding was used for a second batch. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{the culture}} of small {{flounder}} has increased in recent years due to their fast growth, low metabolic activity and good quality white flesh. Egg production and larval rearing of yellowtail flounder (Pleiironectes fernigineus) has improved and large numbers of juveniles are capable of being produced. However, protocols for grow-out of juveniles have not been developed and little is known of the nutritional requirements and feeding of this species. This study was undertaken as a preliminary investigation into feeding strategies for yellowtail flounder, in order to increase growth during the juvenile stage and to provide recommendations {{for the development of a}} species-specific diet. [...] It is known that growth and <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> are influenced by feeding frequency (number of meals per day) and experiments were set up to determine the best feeding regimes for optimal growth and <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> of 0 + fish (under one year of age). Yellowtail flounder responded well to differing feeding regimes, and displayed good growth rates and low <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> (FCRs) when fed one, two, or four meals a day, and twice every other day. However, feeding frequency was shown to affect growth rates and food consumption. Behavioural observations showed that juveniles fed fewer meals per day ingested more pellets per feeding but were not as accurate at hitting the pellets as fish fed more often. Juveniles fed twice daily had the highest growth rates and lowest FCR, and it is recommended that fish at this stage of grow-out be fed twice per day. [...] Body composition, condition factors and hepatosomatic indices (HSI) of wild and cultured yellowtail flounder were examined to make estimates for the possible formulation of diets for yellowtail, as well as to determine if present diets are adequate. Levels of storage fat were higher in the muscle and liver of cultured flounder and HSI was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in these fish, demonstrating an accumulation of fat. This, combined with higher condition indices in these fish, may suggest obesity, or a surplus in body fat due to caloric intake exceeding the amount of energy required, relative to wild counterparts. Total proportions of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were higher in wild fish. Body composition of wild and cultured fish closely resembled the respective diets, and it is recommended that a diet be formulated for juvenile on-growing with high levels of protein, low levels of lipid and, within this lipid, high levels of PUFA. [...] The effect of n- 3 PUFA on the growth and body composition of cultured 0 + juvenile yellowtail flounder was examined in a third experiment. Yellowtail flounder did not display typical essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency symptoms observed in other marine fish when fed levels of n- 3 PUFA as low as 0. 4 % for twelve weeks. However, they show poor growth after four weeks and preferentially conserve PUFA in phospholipid of liver and muscle and accumulate triacylglycerol in the liver, suggesting the commencement of a deficiency. The increase in the ratio of DHA/EP A in polar tissues of yellowtail flounder was related to good growth. Neutral fatty acid composition in both liver and muscle was affected by diet. Results suggest that yellowtail flounder require 2. 5 % n- 3 PUFA as a percentage of dry diet, with 10 % lipid, for optimal growth and development. This level is higher than has been seen in the literature, and maybe due to its cold natural climate and wild diet of invertebrates, such as polychaete worms or amphipods...|$|R
