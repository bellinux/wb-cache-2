30|$|However, in reality, SMEs {{have made}} {{significant}} progress {{even in the}} absence of a regular financial system, which impelled researchers to turn their focus to financing channels outside the regular financial system, such as underground private banks, civil bidding, and even exorbitant usury. Taking nongovernmental finance in Wenzhou as an example, there are nongovernmental loans, industrial loans, and civil bidding (Wang et al. 2004; Zhang 2000; Guo and Liu 2002). Whether through financing channels within or outside the regular financial system, SMEs had to pay certain rates for loans since all these financial services are offered for profit. Thus, the SMEs were under the double restriction of a shortage of regular capital supply channels and the high cost of irregular capital supply (Zhou 2007). The cost of regular capital supply was also considerable. With overcapacity in China’s economic sector and the rise of the RMB exchange rate, the profit rate of export-oriented enterprises decreased more and more. Influenced by changes in international marketing conditions, SMEs entrepreneurs who depend heavily on such financing channels tended to experience cracks in the capital supply chain. A large number of entrepreneurs have gone into hiding due to the pressure to repay loans. These SMEs have collapsed on a large scale due to the <b>guarantee</b> <b>chain</b> for the credit warranty system established by banks and massive mutual interenterprise debt. Thus, the causes for the capital shortage were first, that financing approaches were seriously limited and second, SMEs entrepreneurs intended to restrict the scale of financing in order to avoid risks. This raises the question of whether there are any other approaches to tackling the capital shortage problem that emerged in the course of SME operations as market subjects.|$|R

The firms exist in a two-dimension supply chain strategic space defined by efficiency and responsiveness. In this paper, we examine the effect of manufacturer loyalty on supply chains’ performance in an innovative products market from system perspective.

40|$|This {{research}} examines vertically differentiated retailers' {{incentives to}} offer price-matching guarantees. It suggests that offering and not offering a price-matching guarantee are both signals of a retailer's service-price profile, {{a way of}} branding the retailer to uninformed consumers.

Data from a sample of Canadian retail chains support this prediction. In addition, larger retail chains are more likely to offer price-matching <b>guarantees</b> than smaller <b>chains,</b> and competition has an interactive effect with service. As the intensity of competition a chain faces increases, lower-service retailers are even more likely to use a guarantee, and higher-service retailers are less likely to do so, suggesting that price-matching guarantees are competitive tools, not collusive tools, as the literature has often implied.

40|$|Markov {{chains are}} one of the most popular models for the {{evaluation}} of performance and dependability of information processing systems. To obtain performance measures, typically long-run or transient state probabilities of Markov chains are determined. Sometimes the Markov chain at hand is equipped with rewards and computations involve determining long-run or instantaneous reward probabilities. This note summarises a technique to determine performance and dependability <b>guarantees</b> of Markov <b>chains.</b> Given a precise description of the desired guarantee, all states in the Markov chain are determined that surely meet the guarantee. This is done in a fully automated way. Guarantees are described using logics. The use of logics yields an expressive framework that allows to express well-known measures, but also (new) intricate and complex performance guarantees. The power of this technique is that no matter how complex the logical guarantee, it is automatically checked which states in the Markov chain satisfy it. Neither manual manipulations of Markov chains (or their high-level descriptions) are needed, nor the knowledge of any numerical technique to analyze them efficiently. This applies to any (time-homogeneous) Markov chain of any structure specified in any high-level formalism...|$|R

MEH-PPV was deposited onto a surface from a toluene solution {{and covered with a}} polymer cap layer of poly(vinyl alcohol) spin-coated from an aqueous solution for protection against air. Because MEH-PPV is insoluble in water, such sample preparation <b>guarantees</b> that MEH-PPV <b>chains</b> do not mix with the cap polymer. We found that this "host matrix free" environment results in substantially stronger fluorescence spectral diffusion than that observed for conjugated polymer single chains embedded into polymer matrices. The average spectral diffusion range was 500 cm(- 1), and the maximum registered value reached 1100 cm(- 1), which is similar to 6 times larger than the values reported before. We analyzed spectral diffusion by observation of temporal evolution of the fluorescence intensity, the position of the maximum, and the width of fluorescence spectra. We propose that the transition energy shifts are caused by the differences of the London dispersive forces in slightly different polymer chain conformations. Such conformational changes are possible even at low temperatures because the MEH-PPV single chains in our samples have more freedom for fluctuations than in the usual "in host" arrangement...|$|R

40|$|Supply chain {{responsiveness}} is {{an important}} and tangible supply chain key performance indicator. We define such a responsive supply chain as a supply chain that is able to meet a fluctuating demand with variable, but relatively short lead times. Ideally, this means that a responsive supply chain is still able to satisfy the customer's demand in case of undesirable variability of the process durations as well as variability stemming from externalities. Previous research has integrated multi-echelon inventory management into {{the design of a}} responsive supply chain by using the guaranteed service approach. We build further upon this work by integrating the production capacity and product flow to capture the supply chain's responsiveness. The production capacity is modeled with a queuing network to handle the variability of the production processes as well as the demand variability. Therefore this work aims to study the trade-offs between supply chain responsiveness, inventories and production capacity for <b>guaranteed</b> service supply <b>chains.</b> Furthermore, we address the importance of the design of a responsive vaccine supply chain in literature as well as in industry. The vaccine industry is characterized by complex manufacturing processes and stakeholder interactions (e. g. stringent regulatory processes) which tend to be slow.

40|$|The {{so-called}} leakage-chain rule is a {{very important}} tool used in many security proofs. It gives an upper bound on the entropy loss of a random variable X in case the adversary who having already learned some random variables Z_ 1, [...] .,Z_ℓ correlated with X, obtains some further information Z_ℓ+ 1 about X. Analogously to the information-theoretic case, one might expect that also for the computational variants of entropy the loss depends only on the actual leakage, i. e. on Z_ℓ+ 1. Surprisingly, Krenn et al. have shown recently that for the most commonly used definitions of computational entropy this holds only if the computational quality of the entropy deteriorates exponentially in |(Z_ 1, [...] .,Z_ℓ) |. This means that the current standard definitions of computational entropy do not allow to fully capture leakage that occurred "in the past", which severely limits the applicability of this notion. As a remedy for this problem we propose a slightly stronger definition of the computational entropy, which we call the modulus computational entropy, {{and use it as a}} technical tool that allows us to prove a desired chain rule that depends only on the actual leakage and not on its history. Moreover, we show that the modulus computational entropy unifies other,sometimes seemingly unrelated, notions already studied in the literature in the context of information leakage and chain rules. Our results indicate that the modulus entropy is, up to now, the weakest restriction that <b>guarantees</b> that the <b>chain</b> rule for the computational entropy works. As an example of application we demonstrate a few interesting cases where our restricted definition is fulfilled and the chain rule holds. Comment: Accepted at ICTS 201...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{supply chain}} {{management}} covers interactions between the economic dimension, the environment, and society. My dissertation, titled multi-criteria methods for designing and evaluating sustainable supply chains, studies supply chain decisions-making and trade-offs at the interface between supply chain’ operations and the environment. My dissertation comprises four research papers that develop novel approaches that enhance the literature of {{supply chain management}}. The first article, titled “A two-phase multi-criteria decision support system for supply chain management ”, focused on the economic dimension, considered {{for a long time}} as the only performance that <b>guarantee</b> supply <b>chain</b> design and planning efficiencies. The proposed approach introduces a two-phase hierarchical approach to solve a multi-criteria SCM problem integrating both strategic and tactical decisions. The first phase evaluates different potential configurations of supply chains using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The second phase solves the network for the optimal safety stock placement using dynamic programming. Although the environmental and social criteria are not considered, they can be added at the first phase as additional criteria to ensure the selection of sustainable supply chain. However, it is better to include these criteria at the design phase to consider the most important strategic decisions that influence the economic, environmental and social performance of the supply chain. Thus, the second article, titled “Designing and evaluating sustainable supply chains”, introduces a multi-objective linear programming model for sustainable supply chain design that takes into account the economic and the environmental objectives at the design time. This article addresses the design of supply chains that are also sensitive to the carbon market. The proposed methodology provides decision makers with the ability to evaluate the tradeoffs between total logistics costs and carbon offsetting under different supply chain operating strategies, environmental regulatory constraints and carbon market price evolution. Validation using an illustrative example derived from the steel industry, where legislation imposes caps on greenhouse gases emissions, shows the advantages of such novel approach. This paper shows also that under the dynamic of the carbon market place, {{it is important to consider}} a multi-period model for the strategic planning of sustainable supply chains. The third article, titled “Design of sustainable supply chain under the emission trading scheme”, focus on the long-term, strategic planning of sustainable and closed-loop supply chains. The design task is formulated as a multi-objective optimization linear program that accounts for the minimization of total logistics costs (economic performance) and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (environmental impact). From an economic perspective, the link with “Environmental Economics Solutions” is made through the Emission Trading Scheme. On the other hand, the environmental performance evaluation is based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology that quantifies the burdens and impact along the life cycle stages. Thus, the material and energy balances are considered in the supply chain network design problem as well as many critical outputs. Capabilities of the proposed model are illustrated through a numerical study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Since the {{function}} of a protein is largely dictated by its three dimensional configuration, determining a protein's structure is of fundamental importance to biology. Here we report on a novel approach to determining the one dimensional secondary structure of proteins (distinguishing α-helices, β-strands, and non-regular structures) from primary sequence data which makes use of Parallel Cascade Identification (PCI), a powerful technique {{from the field of}} nonlinear system identification. Results Using PSI-BLAST divergent evolutionary profiles as input data, dynamic nonlinear systems are built through a black-box approach to model the process of protein folding. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are applied in order to optimize the architectural parameters of the PCI models. The three-state prediction problem is broken down into a combination of three binary sub-problems and protein structure classifiers are built using 2 layers of PCI classifiers. Careful construction of the optimization, training, and test datasets ensures that no homology exists between any training and testing data. A detailed comparison between PCI and 9 contemporary methods is provided over a set of 125 new protein <b>chains</b> <b>guaranteed</b> to be dissimilar to all training data. Unlike other secondary structure prediction methods, here a web service is developed to provide both human- and machine-readable interfaces to PCI-based protein secondary structure prediction. This server, called PCI-SS, is available at [URL]. In addition to a dynamic PHP-generated web interface for humans, a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface is added to permit invocation of the PCI-SS service remotely. This machine-readable interface facilitates incorporation of PCI-SS into multi-faceted systems biology analysis pipelines requiring protein secondary structure information, and greatly simplifies high-throughput analyses. XML is used to represent the input protein sequence data and also to encode the resulting structure prediction in a machine-readable format. To our knowledge, this represents the only publicly available SOAP-interface for a protein secondary structure prediction service with published WSDL interface definition. Conclusion Relative to the 9 contemporary methods included in the comparison cascaded PCI classifiers perform well, however PCI finds greatest application as a consensus classifier. When PCI is used to combine a sequence-to-structure PCI-based classifier with the current leading ANN-based method, PSIPRED, the overall error rate (Q 3) is maintained while the rate of occurrence of a particularly detrimental error is reduced by up to 25 %. This improvement in BAD score, combined with the machine-readable SOAP web service interface makes PCI-SS particularly useful for inclusion in a tertiary structure prediction pipeline. </p...|$|R

Even where the energy systems are successfully installed, the cost ofmaintaining a - 20 ºC or - 80 -ºC freezer perennially is hard to afford by laboratories in these countries. Thissituation exists in laboratories in Sierra Leone. Moreover, evidence abounds that, Whatman, fasttechnology for the analysis of nucleic acids, (FTA) cards, can store nucleic acids at room temperature. The FTA cards were developed to protect nucleic acid samples from degradation by nucleases and otherprocesses. They are embedded with a weak base, chelating agent, anionic surfactant or detergent, and uricacid (or a urate salt) added to a cellulose-based matrix. FTA cards have been shown to adequately storedeoxyrinucleic acid samples at room temperature for weeks or years without noticeable degradation,however, it is uncertain if ribonucleic acids can be stored on FTA cards at temperatures well above roomtemperature, or when subject to dramatic changes in temperature. Objectives: The main objective of this paper was to investigate if FTA cards can store pathogen RNAextracts at temperatures above 25 ºC, identical with temperatures in resource-poor settings in West Africawhere dry ice or cold chains are barely available. Methods: Three sets of FTA cards were spotted with known amounts of RNA extracted from a sample ofinfluenza B. Each set of cards was exposed to different temperature conditions: 1) Room temperature(20 - 25 °C); 2) Incubation at 30 °C; and 3) Outside during the summer (30 - 45 °C). After 24 -hour, 3 -day,and 10 -day incubation periods under these conditions, the quality of the RNA on the FTA cards and RNAstored at - 20 °C was analyzed by RT-PCR as described previously. Results: Visualization of the PCR products following agarose gel electrophoresis indicates no discernibledegradation of RNA stored on FTA cards at temperatures up to 45 °C. PCR products (copydeoxyribonucleic acid, cDNA) from the samples with lowest RNA concentration (102 copies/μL) werenot apparent after the 10 -days under any of the incubation conditions. However, the lack of a DNA,(PCRProduct) ‘smear’on the gel, suggests that the DNA concentration was merely below the limits for PCRamplification. Limitations: the study was limited by the unavailability of other pathogen RNA’s apart from Flu B. Conclusion: It is evident that FTA cards can be used to store ribonucleic acid samples at temperatures upto 45 °C for at least 10 days without any sign of degradation...|$|R
