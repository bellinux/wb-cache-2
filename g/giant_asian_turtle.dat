2500|$|There are 25 {{recorded}} {{species of}} reptiles in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area [...] with 4 species {{listed on the}} IUCN Red List as Vulnerable: the Southeast <b>Asian</b> Box <b>Turtle</b> (Cuora amboinensis); the <b>Giant</b> <b>Asian</b> Pond <b>Turtle</b> (Heosemys grandis); the Black Marsh Turtle (Siebenrockiella crassicollis) and the Southeast Asia Softshell Turtle (Amyda cartilaginea). Two species are currently listed as Endangered - the Yellow-headed Temple Turtle (Hieremys annandalii) and the Yellow-headed Tortoise (Indotestudo elongate), {{both of which are}} also listed on CITES due to trade exploitation. Populations of these species have declined in Thailand due to extensive habitat loss from land conversion into rice fields, rubber tree plantations and shrimp farms. The Four-toed Terrapin (Batagur baska), a semi-aquatic species that lives in terrestrial and freshwater habitats, was once found in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area, however is now Extinct in the Wild in Thailand,.|$|R

40|$|The turtle fauna of Asia {{is one of}} {{the most}} diverse in terms of number of species, but is also the most endangered. This is a result of human {{activities}} such as habitat destruction and over-harvesting for the pet, food, and medicine trades (van Dijk et al., 2000). Effective conservation measures require adequate baseline data on the ecology, systematics, and geographic distribution of each species. Unfortunately, <b>Asian</b> <b>turtle</b> research is difficult because of the longstanding, high-volume <b>Asian</b> <b>turtle</b> trade that includes long-distance transport. Not only are wild turtles increasingly difficult to find, those found in the field may have escaped or been released into the wild. In particular, because of the turtle trade, reconstructing the natural distributions of turtles becomes a problem; turtle records from Asia need to be treated with caution. A specific example of this situation was pointed out by Parham 2 ̆ 6 Li (1999), where some records from the pet trade proved to be misleading...|$|R
