2500|$|If {{one used}} Planck's energy quanta, {{and demanded that}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quantum hν, then the photoelectric effect could be explained very simply. Low-frequency light only ejects low-energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon. Increasing {{the intensity of the}} low-frequency light (increasing the number of photons) only increases the number of excited electrons, not their energy, because the energy of each photon remains low. Only by increasing the frequency of the light, and thus increasing the energy of the photons, can one eject electrons with higher energy. Thus, using Planck's constant h to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency, the energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency; the gradient of the line being Planck's constant. These results were not confirmed until 1915, when Robert Andrews Millikan, who had previously determined the charge of the electron, produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein's predictions. While the energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck's constant, the existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the photon antibunching effect, of which a modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate-level labs. This phenomenon could only be explained via photons, and not through any semi-classical theory (which could alternatively explain the photoelectric effect). When Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921, it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious special and general relativity, but for the simple, yet totally revolutionary, suggestion of quantized light. Einstein's [...] "light quanta" [...] would not be called photons until 1925, but even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave-particle duality. Electromagnetic radiation propagates following linear wave equations, but can only be emitted or absorbed as <b>discrete</b> <b>elements,</b> thus acting as a wave and a particle simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Discrete</b> <b>element</b> {{modelling}} (DEM) is {{an approach}} {{for the analysis}} of granular material response that explicitly considers the interaction between individual particles. With increasing computational speeds, the use of particle-based DEM is becoming more widespread amongst geotechnical engineers in both research and practice. This paper provides a brief overview of the theoretical basis for <b>discrete</b> <b>element</b> modelling. The practicalities of carrying out <b>discrete</b> <b>element</b> analyses are addressed, specifically considering boundary conditions, the risks associated with numerical instability, and some useful approaches {{that can be used to}} postprocess the vast quantities of data that emerge from DEM simulations. The limitations of our current DEM modelling capabilities are outlined and the likely trends for development of DEM codes in the near future are considered. The benefits of <b>discrete</b> <b>element</b> analyses to geotechnical engineers interested in the micromechanics of soil response are demonstrated by considering the results of simulations of both quasi-static soil mechanics element tests in two and three dimensions. ...|$|R
