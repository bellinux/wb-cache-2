5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother {{is the head of}} the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E

Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning.

Children forced {{out of school and}} into labour to help their families make ends meet are denied the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills needed for <b>gainful</b> future <b>employment,</b> thereby perpetuating the cycle of poverty. This study therefore sought to investigate the impact of child domestic labour on children's education in Lusaka City of Zambia. The study employed an exploratory qualitative case study design. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Respondents were purposively sampled for study. Snowball sampling was also used to locate children. The results of the study showed that child domestic labour negatively affects school enrolment as parents send their children to do domestic work to supplement family income. Evidence also showed that for those who attempt to enrol, school attendance becomes poor and eventually they drop out of school to concentrate on work. Moreover, childrenâs performance at school becomes very poor as they cannot concentrate on their studies and work at the same time. In terms of gender, many girls drop out of school as they are more engaged in domestic work than boys. However, results showed that domestic work enables children to find money to pay school fees and buy school materials. Child-sensitive social protection, free and compulsory education for all children should be the policy measures for elimination of child labour...|$|R

40|$|India's {{economy had}} {{virtually}} stagnated over a quarter-century {{until the early}} 1980 s, with autarkic policies on trade and direct foreign investment. The expansion {{of the public sector}} had turned into an epidemic, trespassing into most areas of industrial activity, and not just utilities; and the licensing system had become a maze of irrational restrictions. With growth at 3. 5 % and population increasing at 2. 2 % annually, per capita income grew at a snail's pace (the infamous "Hindu rate of growth"). It therefore failed to pull the mass of people out of poverty and into <b>gainful,</b> sustained <b>employment.</b> We should then have expected a "revolution of falling expectations": The poor could have risen in revolt, bundling the ruling Congress Party out of power because there was no hope of improvement. One should note that the ratio of the poor to the overall population in India has declined dramatically over the period 1987 - 2000, in both rural and urban areas. If one goes by the official estimates, the decline has been to 26. 8 % from 39. 4 % in rural areas and to 24. 1 % from 39. 1 % in the cities. If we go by the alternative calculations done by Princeton economist Angus Deaton, the rural poverty ratio fell to 26. 3 % from 39. 4 %, and the urban to 12. 0 % from 22. 5 %.

40|$|The {{challenge}} {{posed by}} child domestic labour remains very large in Zambia. Children {{forced out of}} school and into labour to help their families to make ends meet are denied schooling opportunities and skills needed for <b>gainful</b> future <b>employment,</b> thereby perpetuating the cycle of poverty in the family. Child labour therefore not only constitutes a serious violation of the rights of the children concerned, but also impacts on social development of Zambians. This study therefore sought to investigate and analyze the impact of child domestic work on childrenâs psychosocial wellbeing from a human rights perspective. An explorative qualitative single case study design was used. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and document analysis. Child domestics, parents and key informants were purposively sampled for study. Snowball sampling was also applied to locate child domestics in hidden homes. The findings show that child domestics come from poor families and households affected by HIV/AIDS. The children are not satisfied with their jobs because they earn very little money despite the huge tasks that they perform. Further, child domestics are not pleased with their jobs because it deprives them of schooling opportunities and enjoyment of social and family life. Nevertheless, domestic work enables children to find money to pay school fees and continue schooling; a situation that appears difficult to resolve. Child domestic work perpetuates child poverty as it deprives children of schooling opportunities and lifelong skills which they can use to fight poverty along the life course. However, domestic work enables children and their families to earn money to sustain their livelihoods. Inadequate child protection policies pose a challenge to protection of the rights of children from child labour and abuse. The only way children can be protected from exploitative domestic work is to educate and equip them with vocational skills which they can use to fight poverty...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{the results}} suggest that it is more {{difficult}} to leave benefits receipt via labour market integration for the 18 - to 24 -year-old beneficiaries with a poorly qualified mother or father than for young people with parents with school graduation given equal qualifications of the young beneficiaries. 10 However, the effect is significant on a 10 per cent level. But there is no effect of the parental social background on partial exits off benefits receipt; the young beneficiariesâ labour market participation in jobs or training positions under the socio-economic existence minimum is not depending on the social background. Overall, the young beneficiaries with a relative higher social background are more likely to gain access to <b>gainful</b> training or <b>employment</b> positions. In light of HypothesisÂ  7, an explanation could be that young adults growing up in families with a poor socio-economic status have accumulated fewer resources besides qualifications that are crucial on the labour market. Furthermore and in contradiction to the assumptions according to the cultural hypothesis (HypothesisÂ  3), young beneficiaries with a poor social background do not accept transitions into job or training positions below the social benefit threshold to a lesser extent than young adults with qualified parents. There is no evidence for the interpretation that young people with low-qualified parents are a subgroup that has adopted a low work orientation.|$|R

With the basic understanding that a high dropout rate is costly both in economic terms and in human terms, something quite obviously {{needs to be done}} to reduce the dropout rate in Ontario schools and, in doing so, ensuring Ontario and its graduates an active role in a growing global economy. This study is an exploratory pilot study in that it examined mentoring and the role that mentoring can play in assisting a student in staying in school and graduating from secondary school. Also incorporated in this is co-operative education and the role it can play, through mentoring, in making students aware of lifestyle level of employment, and of the skills necessary to obtain <b>gainful,</b> meaningful <b>employment.</b> In order to gain information on student attitudes, needs and expectations of a mentoring situation, a series of three questionnaires was used. Also, a questionnaire was distributed to the various co-operative education employers. The intent of this questionnaire was to probe the attitudes, needs and expectations of a mentoring situation from the perspective of an employer. The findings of this study indicated that co-operative education and mentoring are a very valuable and useful component in education. There exist certain factors in a co-operative education setting that serve to enhance and to augment the traditional or "theoretical" setting of the classroom. In addition, a mentoring situation tends to add a sense of relevance to education that students seem to require. Also, an opportunity is offered that allows a student to practice and further refine the skills that have been taught over the course of the student's academic life. Results from this study suggested that a mentoring situation, occurring through a co-operative education situation, adds relevance and a sense of "application" to the traditional or classroom schooling situation. The whole idea of mentoring bodes well for the future of education and of the student. Many advantages are identified in a mentoring situation. One of the advantages is that the schools are able to work quite closely with the community and business in order to stay current and informed on the needs and expected needs of the business community. Co-operative education has now gone beyond being an "experimental" mode of education. All students can benefit from being involved in the program. Certainly at-risk students are aided with staying in school. Those students who are said to be not at-risk can also benefit from being enrolled in the program by gaining hands-on work experience and some of the necessary skills to ensure a place in a growing world economy...|$|R
