40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{effects of}} lindane, a <b>gamma-isomer</b> of hexachlorocyclohexane, were studied on transmembrane {{potentials}} and currents of frog atrial heart muscle using intracellular microelectrodes {{and the whole}} cell voltage-clamp technique. RESULTS: Lindane (0. 34 microM to 6. 8 microM) dose-dependently shortened the action potential duration (APD). Under voltage-clamp conditions, lindane (1. 7 microM) increased the amplitude of the outward current (Iout) which developed in Ringer solution containing TTX (0. 6 microM), Cd 2 + (1 mM) and TEA (10 mM). The lindane-increased Iout was not sensitive to Sr 2 + (5 mM). It was blocked by subsequent addition of quinidine (0. 5 mM) or E- 4031 (1 microM). E- 4031 lengthened the APD; it prevented or blocked the lindane-induced APD shortening. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data revealed that lindane increased the quinidine and E- 4031 -sensitive rapid delayed outward K+ current which contributed to the AP repolarization in frog atrial muscle...|$|E

40|$|The biliary {{excretion}} {{of the four}} isomers of bilirubin-IX was studied in Wistar rats (JJ) and homozygous Gunn rats (jj). Synthetic preparations of 14 C-labelled pigments were used. 1. After intravenous administration, the alpha-isomer was rapidly excreted in conjugated form in bile of Wistar rats. In Gunn rats excretion was insignificant. In contrast, both rat species promptly excreted the non-alpha-isomers at rates that were comparable with that found for bilirubin-IXalpha in Wistar rats. 2. In normal rats about 16 % of the beta- and delta-isomers and at least 50 % of the <b>gamma-isomer</b> were excreted as ester conjugates of the injected parent bile pigments. Conjugation of the beta- and delta-isomers had occurred exclusively at the carboxyl groups of pyrrole ring D and C respectively. For bilirubin-IXgamma no preference for any carboxyl group could be established. 3. In homozygous Gunn rats the non-alpha-isomers were apparently excreted chemically unaltered. This suggests that, as for bilirubin-IXalpha, conjugation of the non-alpha-isomers is also deficient in Gunn rats. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Insecticyanin, a blue biliprotein {{isolated}} from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta L., is involved in insect camouflage. Its three-dimensional structure has now been solved to 2. 6 A resolution using the techniques of multiple isomorphous replacement, non-crystallographic symmetry averaging about a local 2 -fold rotation axis and solvent flattening. All 189 amino acids have been fitted to the electron density map. The map clearly shows that insecticyanin is a tetramer with one of its molecular 2 -fold axes coincident to a crystallographic dyad. The individual subunits have overall dimensions of 44 A X 37 A X 40 A and consist primarily of an eight-stranded anti-parallel beta-barrel flanked on one side by a 4. 5 -turn alpha-helix. Interestingly the overall three-dimensional fold of the insecticyanin subunit shows remarkable similarity to the structural motifs of bovine beta-lactoglobulin and the human serum retinol-binding protein. The electron density attributable to the chromophore is unambiguous and shows that it is indeed the <b>gamma-isomer</b> of biliverdin. The biliverdin lies towards the open end of the beta-barrel with its two propionate side chains pointing towards the solvent and it adopts a rather folded conformation, much like a heme...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{insecticide}} lindane (the <b>gamma-isomer</b> of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexachlorocyclohexane) on membrane potential, cytosolic free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and surface biophysical properties were studied in human spermatozoa. The insecticide induces rapid, transient and reproducible membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels leading {{to an increase in}} [Ca 2 +]i. In contrast with the effect in somatic cells, lindane did not affect gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-linked Cl- currents. Ca 2 + and K+ currents were found to drive lindane-induced membrane depolarization and repolarization respectively, whereas Na+ and Cl- fluxes appear not to have a role in the phenomenon. The insecticide was still able to produce membrane depolarization both in the combined absence of extracellular Ca 2 + and Na+ and in high-K+ buffer, suggesting that lindane alters the membrane dipole potential. In agreement with this, Laurodan and Prodan fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that lindane partition into the sperm plasma membrane lowers water molecular dynamics in the uppermost region of the membrane external leaflet, probably as the result of reordering of water dipoles. We propose that the first effect of lindane partitioning into the sperm plasma membrane is a change in the membrane dipole potential, which results in the activation of membrane-located Ca 2 +-influx pathways...|$|E
40|$|The {{disruption}} of the reproductive system {{of male and female}} animals in the wild has been attributed to environmental chemicals (xenobiotics). The effects seen mirror alterations one might anticipate if the steroid hormone-dependent processes that regulate these systems were impaired. To determine whether xenobiotics (present at a concentration of 100 microM) exert their action through steroid-mediated pathways, we examined their ability to inhibit the binding of [3 H]physiological ligands (present at a concentration of 7 nM) to the androgen and estrogen receptors, rat androgen-binding protein (ABP), and human sex hormone-binding globulin (hSHBG). The gamma- and delta-isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, congeners of dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT; p,p'-DDT; p,p'-DDE; o,p'-DDT), dieldrin, atrazine, and pentachlorophenol, caused a statistically significant inhibition of specific binding of [3 H] 5 alpha-DHT to the androgen receptor that ranged from 100 % (p,p'-DDE) to 25 % (dieldrin). Methoxychlor, o,p'-DDT 1, pentachlorophenol, and nonylphenol significantly reduced [3 H] 17 beta-estradiol binding to the estrogen receptor by 10, 60, 20, and 75 %, respectively. The binding of [3 H] 5 alpha-DHT to ABP was inhibited 70 % by the delta-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane, but the <b>gamma-isomer</b> did not reduce binding significantly. Methoxychlor, p,p'-DDT, atrazine, and nonylphenol reduced [3 H] 5 alpha-DHT binding to ABP by approximately 40 %. Nonylphenol reduced the binding of [3 H] 5 alpha-DHT to hSHBG by 70 %. Hexachlorocyclohexane reduced [3 H] 5 alpha-DHT binding to hSHBG by 20 %, but the stereospecific effects observed with ABP did not occur. o,p'-DDT and pentachlorophenol resulted in a statistically significant 20 % inhibition of [3 H] 5 alpha-DHT binding to hSHBG. Some xenobiotics resulted in dissociation of [3 H]ligands from their binding proteins that was statistically identical to that caused by the unlabeled natural ligand, whereas others resulted in slower or more rapid dissociation rates...|$|E
40|$|Resultados significativos foram obtidos na análise do sabor de amostras de purês preparados com batatinhas procedentes de ensaios de aplicação de vários inseticidas no solo, na folhagem e em batatas-semente. Em 1959, dos inseticidas aplicados no solo (BHC, Heptaclor, Aldrin, Parathion e Lindane) apenas o BHC imprimiu sabor estranho bastante pronunciado semelhante a môfo, diferindo da testemunha ao nível de 1 %. Para Heptaclor e Aldrin não foram verificadas alterações de sabor; Lindane e Parathion apresentaram leves odores estranhos, semelhantes a medicamento. Disyston, aplicado nas batatas-semente, e Metasystox, na folhagem, imprimiram ao purê sabor ardido e odor a remédio, mostrando-se inferiores, respectivamente, aos níveis de 5 e 1 %. tanto à testemunha, tratada com carvão, como ao item sem qualquer tratamento. Parathion, aplicado na folhagem, comparado com as mesmas testemunhas, não apresentou diferenças significativas. Em 1960, dos inseticidas aplicados no solo, apenas Lindane, em dose normal e dobrada, diferiu da testemunha ao nível estatístico de 1 %, apresentando sabor estranho, semelhante a môfo. Heptaclor, Aldrin e Toxafeno. em doses normal e dobrada, não diferiram da testemunha. classificando-se o sabor do primeiro como regular e dos dois últimos como bom. Organoleptic {{tests were}} carried out in 1959 and 1960 to {{determine}} the possible occurrence of off-flavor in potato tubers, caused by the application of insecticides to the soil where the plants were grown, on the seed, and on the plant leaves. In 1959 the treated samples were compared against the control by the triangular test; in 1960, in a lattice square 3 x 3 with four replications. The insecticides applied to the soil in 1959 were as fallows: BHC (<b>gamma-isomer),</b> Heptaclor, Aldrin, Parathion, and Lindane. BHC induced a very strong mold-like «rmusty» off-flavor, significant {{in relation to the}} control at the 1 % level. Parathion and Lindane induced an unidentified off-flavor, called by the testers as a medicin odor, but not differing statistically from the control; Heptaclor and Aldrin did not confer any off-flavor. Also in 1959 the samples from the plots which received seed treatment with Disyston and leaf spraying with Rhodiatox and Metasystox were compared with a control to which charcoal had been added and with another, without theatment. The results were statistically significant in relation to the control for Disyston and Matasystox, but not for Rhodiatox. Both Disyston and Metasystox conferred a medicin odor and a slight fiery taste to the puree. The 1960 insecticides, applied in normal and double dosages, were Lindane, Toxafeno, Heptaclor, and Aldrin. Both dosages of Lindane conferred the same musty off-flavor to the potato puree, this results differing from the control and normal toxafeno at the 1 % level. The other treatments were not statistically different from the control...|$|E
