50|$|On 17 September 2013, during TPG's {{financial}} year results presentation, {{it was announced}} that the company plans on constructing <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Building</b> (FTTB) networks, capable of offering a bandwidth of 100Mbit/s, in five major capital cities. It was also estimated that the cost of the plans would be $69.99 per month, lower than the current price of NBN plans though it excludes initial connection and setup costs. Although, final costs have yet to be determined, the network is expected to compete with the NBN, leading to calls from the research director of Ovum, David Kennedy, for NBN Co to respond competitively.|$|E

Regional and Remote areas were mainly unchanged {{as a result of}} the strategic review and typically receive a service using either Fixed Wireless, using LTE technology, or Satellite.|$|E

The basic model consists to sequence of construction, network topology, passive and active parts. The collection contains examples of alternative technology such as Wireless LAN with different frequency.

After that there are demonstrating type of wavelength division multiplexer used in metropolitan area network – passive planar PCL splitter. One of the passive planar splitter are used to increase optical fibre channel. At the end of the collection a simplified examples of used measurements – optical time domain reflectometry and optical fibre transmission. Contains standard protocols or reflectogram. The conclusion of this thesis summarizes costs of FTTb (<b>Fibre</b> <b>To</b> <b>The</b> <b>Building)</b> model of optical metropolitan area network in Czech republic and future contribution for society...|$|E
5000|$|<b>To</b> support <b>the</b> {{aspiration}} <b>to</b> host multimedia industries, Cyberjaya was specified {{with extensive}} and intensive fibre optic cabling. As Malaysia's premier IT hub, Cyberjaya has a telecommunication backbone running primarily on fibre optics known as Cyberjaya Metro Fibre Network (CMFN). Operated by Setia Haruman Technology Sdn Bhd, CMFN is a carrier neutral and open access infrastructure where multi-leading Telco/Carriers/ISPs are riding on CMFN's <b>fibre</b> optic network <b>to</b> provide their services {{to end customers}} in Cyberjaya. CMFN delivers <b>fibre</b> connectivity straight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> under <b>the</b> concepts of [...] "Fibre-To-The-Building (FTTB)" [...] and [...] "Fibre-To-The-Home (FTTH)". As such, most of <b>the</b> commercial <b>buildings</b> and offices are connected <b>to</b> CMFN. With <b>the</b> ring topology; CMFN offers full redundancy throughout the network - with the availability of high capacity and resiliency network, many data centres are located here and connected to CMFN. However, some older commercial and residential units still use copper lines to provide [...] "last mile" [...] access to customers. Broadband access covering wireless and fixed line is readily available. Broadband access is serviced primarily by City Broadband (Ethernet Broadband-Over-Fibreoptic), TMnet, MyKris, NTT MSC (formerly ARCnet) and recently Air Broadband which has announced its test pilot plans in Cyberjaya for Wimax.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> {{potential of}} hemp buildings in different climates. The report examines and models two different energy efficient <b>building</b> concepts – <b>the</b> more common passive house and the environmental friendly hempcrete building system. These two buildings thermal performances were then simulated and compared in different climates followed by a brief discussion about their economic and environmental impact. The simulation was performed with the energy calculating program VIP-energy v 2. 1. 1 with the two models located in Kiruna, Sundsvall, Malmo, Berlin and Rome <b>to</b> represent <b>the</b> different climates. Simulations for different wall sizes and a sensitivity analysis of some significant parameters were also made. <b>The</b> hempcrete <b>building</b> system showed to have a thermal performance {{similar to that of}} passive houses in more southern climates. In the north of Sweden however <b>the</b> hempcrete <b>building</b> required up to 20 % more energy than <b>the</b> passive house <b>to</b> maintain comfortable indoor temperatures. This deficit could be compensated for with hemp <b>fibre</b> insulation <b>to</b> augment <b>the</b> <b>building</b> envelope and U-value. Furthermore the hygrothermal material properties that {{were not included in the}} simulation can be expected to have a significant positive impact on hemp buildings relative thermal performance. With a passive house thermal performance, a healthy indoor environment and an economically viable and environmental friendly production process hemp building demonstrated great potential in all the fields studied...|$|R

40|$|There is {{currently}} {{much interest in}} the use of passive optical networks (PONs) for applications such as fibre to the home, fibre to the curb and <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Some of these schemes use time division multiple access (TDMA), this enabling many users to share an optical channel with a bandwidth of typically up to 10 -Gb/s. However, high speed implementations involve high bandwidth components at the customers’ premises, and require ranging and scheduling on the uplink to avoid interference induced by multiple users simultaneously transmitting in the same optical channel. Leveraging recent advances in high speed RF technologies, subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) has been proposed as an alternative to time division multiplexing and code division multiplexing access technologies for PON applications. The proponents of SCM have cited advantages of flexible protocol transmission (where different channels can therefore be used for different services), easy upgradeability of present access networks and good fibre transmission performance. However, significant disadvantages have been acknowledged including in particular the generation of optical beat interference (OBI) between uplink sources. In this PhD dissertation, therefore, a bandwidth symmetric wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) /SCM-PON architecture incorporating a novel uplink combiner as a solution to remove OBI and provide large bandwidths (> 1 -GB/s) to the home is proposed. Here, the virtually-passive uplink combiner allows the simple and linear combination of SCM channels from multiple local users and inexpensive user components. In the proposed scheme, binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and 16 quadrature amplitude (16 QAM) modulations are used as base-band modulation schemes respectively. In order to enable a spectrally efficient (> 1 -bit/s/Hz) multi optical user network, the QPSK and 16 QAM SCM PON are studied in detail. A proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of a dual channel multi-user optical network using SCM-QPSK and 16 QAM modulation for high spectral efficiency is reported. In order to show the potential of feasibility of a 1 -Gb/s BPSK, QPSK, and 16 QAM SCM PON, computer simulation using a time domain model is performed, showing that each optical channel is respectively capable of supporting 10 x 1 -Gb/s QPSK and 20 x 1 -Gb/s 16 QAM dedicated links, and so serving 400 users and 800 users simultaneously when using 40 dense WDM (DWDM) channels.

40|$|Almost {{one third}} of the Dutch {{population}} has a fibre optic connection, also called <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Home (FttH). <b>Fibre</b> is currently the fastest and most reliable Internet technology. It consists of strong and flexible wires that are able to transport light signals over long distances. With such fibre optic connections, information is transmitted {{from one place to another}} when pulses of light are sent through an optical fibre and can reach Internet speeds of 500 Mb per second. In an ideal situation, all copper in the networks would be replaced by fiber. However, such an operation would be too expensive to complete all at once, so therefore, it would not be a feasible solution. However, it is also possible to replace parts of the copper network by fibre. For example, <b>the</b> extension of <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Curb could significantly increase <b>the</b> bandwidth, compared <b>to</b> services offered over a copper cable starting at the Central Office. Furthermore, for this extension, less costs are also involved compared to an extension of <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Home. On the other hand, <b>the</b> extension <b>to</b> a total <b>fibre</b> network will reach a higher bandwidth compared to an extension of <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Curb...|$|R
