40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to elicit information on college student’s actual smoking behavior and their perception of others smoking behavior and subjective norms to see if a relationship existed. A survey questionnaire was used to address the perception of tobacco use and actual smoking behavior. Fifty-Six college age students (18 to 24 years old) were solicited to complete the questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of questions regarding: the students feelings about cigarette smoking and then- perceived feelings of others including family, friends and significant others, the students own experience with cigarettes and the frequency o f their use of cigarettes, the students knowledge of others smoking behavior including, mother, father, siblings, partner, and friends. Results indicated that 55 % of the sample had never tried a cigarette while 45 % had tried. Of the 45 % who tried smoking, 14 % were regular smokers. The average age {{for the first time a}} participant tried a cigarette was 15 years old. Most students, 79 %, indicated they felt smoking <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>okay</b> and they felt their parents and siblings thought smoking <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>okay.</b> Results found two signigicant interactions: (1) the relationship between the subjects smoking status and whether or not they felt that smoking was okay and (2) the relationship between the subjects smoking status and whether or not they thought their friends felt smoking was okay. Research specifically targeting college age students smoking behavior is limited. Health education programs regarding tobacco use for the college age student are also limited. With the understanding that peers and social norms have on smoking behavior health educators can develop targeted interventions and conduct further research...|$|R

50|$|The {{religion}} of Godianism believes {{in one part}} that the response to a threat is usually violent {{and that it is}} part of man, by nature, on the principle of self-preservation. To say that non-violence in a violent human society, in which society is ranged against man, oppression against freedom and repression against life itself, is to Godianism a clamor which does not accord with the fact of human nature and the law of self-preservation. Godianism teaches that man has the right to return violence when given violence, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>okay</b> to <b>be</b> the one who provoked the violence.
