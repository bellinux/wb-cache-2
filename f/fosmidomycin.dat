40|$|Abstract <b>Fosmidomycin</b> is a phosphonic {{antibiotic}} which inhibits 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase (Dxr), {{the first}} committed {{step of the}} non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis Dxr is encoded by Rv 2870 c, and although the antibiotic {{has been shown to}} inhibit the recombinant enzyme 1, mycobacteria are intrinsically resistant to <b>fosmidomycin</b> at the whole cell level. <b>Fosmidomycin</b> is a hydrophilic molecule and in many bacteria its uptake is an active process involving a cAMP dependent glycerol- 3 -phosphate transporter (GlpT). The fact that there is no glpT homologue in the M. tuberculosis genome and the highly impervious nature of the hydrophobic mycobacterial cell wall suggests that resistance may be {{due to a lack of}} cellular penetration. Results We demonstrated that dxr (Rv 2780 c) is an essential gene in M. tuberculosis, since we could not delete the chromosomal copy unless a second functional copy was provided on an integrating vector. This confirmed that the intracellular target of <b>fosmidomycin</b> was essential as well as sensitive. We looked at the uptake of <b>fosmidomycin</b> in two mycobacterial species, the slow-growing pathogenic M. tuberculosis and the fast-growing, saprophytic Mycobacterium smegmatis; both species were resistant to <b>fosmidomycin</b> to a high level. <b>Fosmidomycin</b> was not accumulated intra-cellularly in M. tuberculosis or M. smegmatis but remained in the extra-cellular medium. In contrast, <b>fosmidomycin</b> uptake was confirmed in the sensitive organism, Escherichia coli. We established that the lack of intra-cellular accumulation was not due to efflux, since efflux pump inhibitors had no effect on <b>fosmidomycin</b> resistance. Finally, we demonstrated that <b>fosmidomycin</b> was not modified by mycobacterial cells or by extracts but remained in a fully functional state. Conclusion Taken together, these data demonstrate that <b>fosmidomycin</b> resistance in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis results from a lack of penetration of the antibiotic to the site of the sensitive target. </p...|$|E

Methods A total of 15 and 18 patients with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria who fulfilled the enrollment criteria were recruited from out-patient department of Mae Sot Hospital, Tak Province, Thailand. Patients were treated with monotherapy with <b>fosmidomycin</b> at the dose of 1, 200 mg every 8 hours for 7 days (n = 15) or combination therapy with <b>fosmidomycin</b> (900 mg every 12 hours for 7 days) and clindamycin (600 mg every 12 hours for 7 days) (n = 18). Blood samples were taken for pharmacokinetic investigations of clindamycin and/or <b>fosmidomycin</b> and 24 -hour urine samples were collected during dosing period. Efficacy assessments included clinical and parasitological evaluation. Safety and tolerability were assessed based on clinical and laboratory investigations. Results Both mono- and combination therapy regimens of <b>fosmidomycin</b> were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Combination therapy with <b>fosmidomycin</b> and clindamycin was proven highly effective with 100 % cure rate, whereas cure rate of monotherapy was 22 % (28 -day follow up). Pharmacokientics of <b>fosmidomycin</b> following mono- and combination therapy were similar except V z /F and CL/F, which were significantly smaller in the combination regimen.

40|$|The methylerythritol {{phosphate}} (MEP) pathway {{is essential}} in most prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes but absent from human cells, and is a validated target for antimicrobial drug development. The formation of MEP is catalyzed by 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR).

This compound also inhibits the growth of F. tularensis NIH B 38, F. novicida and F. tularensis subsp. holarctica LVS bacteria. Related compounds such as FR 900098 and lipophilic prodrugs of FR 900098 have been developed to improve the bioavailability of these DXR inhibitors. In disc-inhibition assays with these compounds, we observed breakthrough colonies of F. novicida in the presence of <b>fosmidomycin,</b> suggesting spontaneous development of <b>fosmidomycin</b> resistance (FosR). FosR bacteria had decreased sensitivity to both <b>fosmidomycin</b> and FR 900098. The two most likely targets for the development of mutants would be the DXR enzyme or the glycerol- 3 -phosphate transporter (GlpT) that allows entry of <b>fosmidomycin</b> into the bacteria. Sensitivity of FosR F. novicida bacteria to compound 1 was not abated suggesting that spontaneous resistance is not due to mutation of DXR. We thus predicted that the glpT transporter may be mutated leading to this resistant phenotype. Supporting this, transposon insertion mutants at the glpT locus were also found to be resistant to <b>fosmidomycin.</b> DNA sequencing of four different spontaneous FosR colonies demonstrated a variety of deletions in the glpT coding region. The overall frequency of FosR mutations in F. novicida was determined to be 6. 3 x 10 - 8.

Results Both regimens were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. The 28 -day cure rates for Group I and Group II were 91. 3 and 89. 7 %, respectively. Steady-state plasma concentrations of <b>fosmidomycin</b> and clindamycin were attained at about 24 hr after the first dose. The pharmacokinetics of both <b>fosmidomycin</b> and clindamycin analysed by model-independent and model-dependent approaches were generally in broad agreement. There were marked differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of <b>fosmidomycin</b> and clindamycin when given as two different combination regimens. In general, most of the dose-dependent pharmacokinetic parameters (model-independent C max : 3. 74 vs 2. 41 Î¼g/ml; C max-ss : 2. 80 vs 2. 08 Î¼g/ml; C max-min-ss : 2. 03 vs 0. 71 Î¼g/ml; AUC: 23. 31 vs 10. 63 Î¼g. hr/ml (median values) were significantly higher in patients who received the high dose regimen (Group II). However, C min-ss was lower in this group (0. 80 vs 1. 37 Î¼g/ml), resulting in significantly higher fluctuations in the plasma concentrations of both <b>fosmidomycin</b> and clindamycin following multiple dosing (110. 0 vs 41. 9 %). Other pharmacokinetic parameters, notably total clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F, V z /F) and elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 z, t 1 / 2 e) were also significantly different between the two dosage regimens. In addition, the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of both <b>fosmidomycin</b> and clindamycin tended to be lower in patients with recrudescence responses in both groups.

A <b>fosmidomycin</b> analogues library was designed with 43 analogues, their molecular interactions and binding affinities with DXR (PDB ID: 1 ONP) {{have been studied}} using Glide docking, QM-polarized ligand docking (QPLD), molecular mechanics based on generalized Born/surface area (MM-GB/SA) and multi-ligand bimolecular association with energetics (eMBrAcE). Prediction models were developed between DXR inhibition activity (pIC 50) of these compounds and molecular descriptors like Glide score, QPLDscore, binding energy and calculated free energy of binding. The r 2 value ranges from 0. 608 - 0. 807 indicating good data fit, and r 2 cv ranges from 0. 592 - 0. 799 indicating acceptable predictive capabilities of models. Linear correlation between predicted and experimented pIC 50 was observed (r 2 = 0. 603 - 0. 781). Low {{root mean square error}} (0. 39 - 0. 84) of inhibitors was established in all structure-centric approaches, an efficient tool for generating potential and specific inhibitors of DXR by testing rationally designed lead compounds based on <b>fosmidomycin</b> derivatization...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{inhibitory}} effect of <b>fosmidomycin</b> was evaluated against the asexual growth of bovine Babesia parasites (Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina). In the cultures with these parasites, severe reduction of parasite growth was observed {{by the addition}} of 1. 25 Î¼g/ml of the final drug concentration. Under these conditions, B. bigemina was completely cleared until the third day of cultivation. On the other hand, B. bovis was completely eliminated on the fourth day when the concentration was 6. 25 Î¼g/ml in the culture. These parasites failed to grow again when a drug-free medium was substituted for the subsequent cultivation. The IC 50 values of <b>fosmidomycin</b> against B. bovis were determined as 0. 88 and 0. 63 Î¼g/ml in the in vitro cultures with serum-containing M 199 and serum-free GIT media, respectively, while it was 0. 55 Î¼g/ml against B. bigemina in a serum-containing M 199 medium. Severe morphological changes, such as pycnotic and degenerative changes, were preferably observed in the treated parasites.

40|$|Bacteria, plants, and algae produce isoprenoids {{through the}} methylerythritol {{phosphate}} (MEP) pathway, an attractive pathway for antimicrobial drug development {{as it is}} present in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes but absent from human cells. The first committed step of the MEP pathway is catalyzed by 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR/MEP synthase). MEP pathway genes {{have been identified in}} many biothreat agents, including Francisella, Brucella, Bacillus, Burkholderia, and Yersinia. The importance of the MEP pathway to Francisella is demonstrated by the fact that MEP pathway mutations are lethal. We have previously established that <b>fosmidomycin</b> inhibits purified MEP synthase (DXR) from F. tularensis LVS. FR 900098, the acetyl derivative of <b>fosmidomycin,</b> was found to inhibit the activity of purified DXR from F. tularensis LVS (IC 50 = 230 nM). <b>Fosmidomycin</b> and FR 900098 are effective against purified DXR from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well, but have no effect on whole cells because the compounds are too polar to penetrate the thick cell wall. <b>Fosmidomycin</b> requires the GlpT transporter to enter cells, and this is absent in some pathogens, including M. tuberculosis. In this study, we have identified the GlpT homologs in F. novicida and tested transposon insertion mutants of glpT. We showed that FR 900098 also requires GlpT for full activity against F. novicida. Thus, we synthesized several FR 900098 prodrugs that have lipophilic groups to facilitate their passage through the bacterial cell wall and bypass the requirement for the GlpT transporter.

40|$|Equine Piroplasmosis (EP) is {{a disease}} that {{negatively}} impacts the horse industry worldwide and is caused by two distinct species of protozoan parasites, Babesia caballi and Theileria equi. Currently the United States is considered free of EP and strict regulations are in place to prevent its introduction. If an outbreak does occur, there are two options for infected horses: lifelong quarantine or humane euthanization. Treatment options are limited {{in their ability to}} clear infection. Rifampicin and <b>fosmidomycin</b> are anti-microbial agents that are successful at treating related protozoan diseases, such as malaria. These two drugs were screened for anti-protozoal properties against the erythrocytic stage of T. equi and B. caballi by performing in vitro inhibition assays. Parasite growth was evaluated over a 72 h treatment period and was significantly reduced for both species with notable morphological changes. Rifampicin was shown to possess more potent effects at lower concentrations than <b>fosmidomycin</b> for both T. equi and B. caballi. Based on data acquired during the trial, further in vitro and in vivo tests should be performed for rifampicin and <b>fosmidomycin.</b> Further, the results attained suggest that other existing anti-microbials should be evaluated for their efficacy in treating EP...|$|E
40|$|Quercus ilex (L.) leaves emit monoterpenes, {{particularly}} Î±-pinene, Î²-pinene and sabinene. Apart {{from the}} monoterpene pools that {{are stored in}} specialized structures and have a clear defensive or attractive role, the function of monoterpenes in Q. ilex leaves is unknown. We tested whether monoterpenes have an antioxidant role, as has previously been found for isoprene in isoprene-emitting leaves. We exposed Q. ilex leaves to either mild and repeated ozone exposure (Experiment I) or to a single acute ozone exposure (Experiment II) at temperatures ranging between 20 and 32 Â°C. Both ozone treatments rapidly stimulated monoterpene synthesis, but {{had no effect on}} photosynthesis and caused no visible damage to leaves maintained at 25, 30 or 32 Â°C. Ozone inhibited both photosynthesis and monoterpene synthesis in leaves maintained at 20 Â°C. To characterize the relationship between monoterpenes and ozone-induced damage, we fed detached leaves <b>fosmidomycin,</b> a selective inhibitor of isoprene synthesis. <b>Fosmidomycin</b> caused rapid and complete inhibition of monoterpene emissions in leaves maintained at 30 Â°C, confirming that monoterpenes are synthesized by the same biochemical pathway as isoprene. However, over the experimental period, <b>fosmidomycin</b> did not affect concentrations of compounds that are formed from chloroplastic isoprenoids and that might have conferred antioxidant protection, either directly (carotenoids) or indirectly (chlorophylls, xanthophylls). In leaves whose monoterpene synthesis had been inhibited by <b>fosmidomycin,</b> ozone rapidly and significantly inhibited photosynthesis and increased the production of hydrogen peroxide and malonyldialdehyde. We conclude that monoterpenes produced by Q. ilex leaves share the same biosynthetic pathway and function as isoprene. Furthermore, all volatile isoprenoids may have similar antioxidant properties and may be stimulated by the same stress-inducing conditions...|$|E
40|$|This Ph. D. study {{constitutes}} part of {{an extensive}} project dealing with the design and development of new agents with antimalarial activity. The enzyme 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), which {{is involved in the}} DOXP pathway for isoprenoid synthesis, was chosen as drug target. This non-mevalonate pathway is not operating in humans and inhibitors of DXR can therefore be considered as selective for parasites. <b>Fosmidomycin</b> and its methyl homologue FR 900098, well-known inhibitors of this enzyme that show antimalarial activity in vivo, were used as lead compounds for inhibitor design. The structure of <b>fosmidomycin</b> is characterized by a retrohydroxamic acid group, which acts as a ligand for the metal ion in DXR, and a phosphonate group, which mimics the phosphate group in the substrate structure. It was our objective to further expand the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of <b>fosmidomycin</b> as DXR inhibitor and to discover analogues showing superior activity against the enzyme and/or better antimalarial activity. Modifications were applied to the retrohydroxamic acid group and the propyl chain of the parent structures. Synthetic pathways to these modified fosmidomycines were elaborated. As initial screening method all new compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit DXR of Escherichia coli. The most promising inhibitors were further tested in an in vitro assay on two different Plasmodium falciparum strains. Our investigations are discussed in 4 chapters. 1. To explore the impact of structural modifications of the hydroxyl group of the retrohydroxamic moiety, analogues were synthesized with methyl, ethyl or hydroxyl ethyl substituents on the nitrogen (2. 1 - 2. 9). These modifications did not produce any acceptable inhibitors, which demonstrates the importance of the hydroxyl group in ligating the divalent metal. 2. A synthetic procedure for the preparation of Î±-aryl-substituted <b>fosmidomycin</b> analogues was developed starting from the corresponding benzylphosphonates or the appropriate cinnamaldehydes. Seven analogues were synthesized, allowing to perform an initial SAR study of this Î±-aryl series (3. 1 c,e and 3. 2 a-e). Although the Î±-aryl analogues were generally weaker DXR inhibitors than <b>fosmidomycin,</b> these analogues unambiguously surpassed the activity of <b>fosmidomycin</b> in inhibiting P. falciparum growth. Remarkably, the formyl analogues 3. 1 c and 3. 1 e consistently outperformed the acetyl derivatives 3. 2 c and 3. 2 e, both in the enzyme and the parasite growth inhibition assays. Compound 3. 1 e emerged as the most promising analogue with an IC 50 value of 0. 059 Î¼M. Due to their straightforward synthesis these compounds are suitable for upscaling in further drug development programmes. The deoxygenated sideproducts 3. 17 a,c demonstrated the contribution of the hydroxyl group to the overall affinity. The Michael addition procedure, used to prepare the Î±-substituted analogues from phenyl-substituted cinnamaldehydes, proved also valuable to prepare the <b>fosmidomycin</b> cyclopentyl analogues 3. 3 and 3. 4. These compounds, featuring a restricted mobility, showed that a trans orientation of the retrohydroxamic acid moiety and the phosphonate group is optimal for binding the enzyme. 3. An efficient and reliable synthesis was established for Î²- and Î³-oxa <b>fosmidomycin</b> analogues. Analogue 4. 4, which combines a Î²-oxa modification with a hydroxamate moiety was almost as potent in inhibiting DXR as FR 900098. In an in vitro assay it proved almost twice as active as FR 900098 in inhibiting the growth of a P. falciparum 3 D 7 strain. 4. Several synthetic pathways towards the transition state analogue 5. 1 were explored. A 10 -step sequence, involving an asymmetric dihydroxylation, afforded compound 5. 1 in a reasonable yield. Unfortunately, this compound did not show any worth mentioning inhibitory activity. In conclusion, this Ph. D. thesis highlights some important structural requirements for DXR inhibitors. This study also provides valuable information for modifications on <b>fosmidomycin</b> toward new and more efficient inhibitors: introducing aryl modifications on the Î±-position of the phosphonate moiety significantly improves the antiplasmodial activity in vitro and one oxa analogue with a hydroxamic acid proved to be a more potent inhibitor and to show superior antiplasmodial activity than the parent compound, <b>fosmidomycin.</b> Further investigation on analogues 3. 1 e and 4. 4 is desirable since these compounds are significantly more potent than <b>fosmidomycin</b> on P. falciparum strains. Especially the latter one is very interesting, since it can be easily synthesized. Before further development the toxicological properties of these analogues need to be investigated and their pharmacokinetic profile needs to be established. In vivo studies, employing murine and monkeys models, are required. Further drug design may involve other sterically hindered analogues as well as prodrugs of the most promising analogues.

40|$|ABSTRACT: 1 -Deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate reductoiso-merase (DXR), which catalyzes {{the first}} {{committed}} {{step in the}} 2 -C-methyl-D-erythritol 4 -phosphate pathway of isopre-noid biosynthesis used by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other infectious microorganisms, is absent in humans and therefore an attractive drug target. <b>Fosmidomycin</b> is a nanomolar inhibitor of DXR, but despite great efforts, few analogues with comparable potency have been developed. DXR contains a strictly conserved residue, Trp 203, within a flexible loop that closes over and interacts with the bound inhibitor. We report that while mutation to Ala or Gly abolishes activity, mutation to Phe and Tyr only modestly impacts kcat and Km. Moreover, pre-steady-state kinetics and primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects indicate that while turnover is largely limited by product release for the wild-type enzyme, chemistry is significantly more rate-limiting for W 203 F and W 203 Y. Surprisingly, these mutants are more sensitive to inhibition by <b>fosmidomycin,</b> resulting in Km/Ki ratios up to 19 -fold {{higher than that of}} wild-type DXR. In agreement, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that <b>fosmidomycin</b> binds up to 11 -fold more tightly to these mutants.
