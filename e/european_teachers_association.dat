5000|$|Music {{professor}} Dr. David C. F. Wright, in {{an article}} acknowledging her contributions, notes that she made her American debut at Carnegie Hall in 1965.

In 2005, she was the international president of the <b>European</b> String <b>Teachers</b> <b>Association</b> (ESTA). Wright offers his impression of her abilities: Her recordings are few. There is the Dvořák Concerto, Prokofiev 1 and a sensational performance of the Berg conducted by Rudolf Kempe. I have heard and marvelled at her solo Bach and Bruch's first concerto with the BBC Philharmonic ... Along with Ginette Neveu, she is the best.|$|R
