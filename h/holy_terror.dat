40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the instances of the figures of mythology of the antiquity in the works of Jean Cocteau and their application. It focuses on the character of Narcissus, which is examined in connection to Oedipus and Orpheus, while concentrating mainly on the topic of mirroring and the related motives of the eye and sight. This mirroring is then not examined only on the level of an aesthetic object, but also in relation to the recipient and in mutual interferences between various media. The thesis is methodologically based on selected philosophical theses by Maurice Merlau-Ponty and the theoretical concepts of Pierre Brunel, Mieke Bal and Mary Ann Caws. Within the works of Jean Cocteau the thesis is primarily concerned with the analysis of the novels The <b>Holy</b> <b>Terrors</b> (Les Enfants Terribles), Le Livre Blanc and their illustrations, the poem "Tombeau de Narcisse", the play La Machine infernale and the films Blood of a Poet, Orpheus and The Testament of Orpheus...|$|R

2500|$|Frank Miller {{has also}} stated that All Star Batman & Robin does exist in the same {{continuity}} as the other storylines in his Dark Knight Universe. [...] This consists of Miller's , its sequel , [...] and the Frank Miller/Todd McFarlane collaboration on Spawn/Batman. Of these, only Year One is considered canonical to the mainstream DC Universe. However, this has been proven difficult as The Dark Knight Returns is set during the Cold War with an older Batman while All Star Batman & Robin features a younger Batman in a more modern setting, specifically 2008. An additional story, titled <b>Holy</b> <b>Terror,</b> Batman!, was also to be included within the same continuity. However, in 2010, Miller stated {{that he was no}} longer working on the project. [...] He later clarified his statement by explaining that it would feature a new character called The Fixer rather than Batman, and not be published by DC. In 2007, Frank Miller's [...] "Dark Knight Universe" [...] was officially designated as Earth-31 within the new DC Comics Multiverse composed of 52 alternate universes.|$|E
2500|$|From quite {{early in}} his career, he sought {{a better way to}} organise society and wrote a number of Utopian novels. The first of these was A Modern Utopia (1905), which shows a {{worldwide}} utopia with [...] "no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all"; two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (In the Days of the Comet (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in The Shape of Things to Come (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 Alexander Korda film, Things to Come). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending World War, with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of fascist dictators in The Autocracy of Mr Parham (1930) and The <b>Holy</b> <b>Terror</b> (1939). Men Like Gods (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the critic Malcolm Cowley stated: [...] "by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer".|$|E
