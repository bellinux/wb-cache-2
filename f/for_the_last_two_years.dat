5|$|Although the Inaccessible Island rail {{may have}} been known to the Tristan Islanders who visited the island {{annually}} to hunt seals, the species first {{came to the attention of}} scientists during the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876.

5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When {{the war ended}} he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing {{in a city with}} little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Bowers {{returned}} to Nevada. Her hearing had diminished significantly, {{and she was}} forced to give up the scrying business as she was unable to hear the requests of her clients. She launched a claim against the government asking for financial assistance in return for the $14,000 she and Sandy Bowers had donated to support the Union cause in the Civil War and to finance the 1860 Paiute War, but was ignored. Destitute, she was placed in the Washoe County poorhouse, and became the subject of a protracted legal dispute between the governments of Nevada and California over who was to pay for her care. In August 1901 it was agreed that California would take responsibility for her welfare, and she was summarily put on a San Francisco-bound train by Reno officials with $30 cash. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of her life she lived at the King's Daughters Home in Oakland, dying on October 27, 1903. Her ashes were returned to Nevada and buried alongside Sandy and Margaret at the Bowers Mansion.|$|E
