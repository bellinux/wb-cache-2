5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to <b>fold</b> <b>the</b> paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had been}} hailed as a hero, first for saving the Colonels from moving to Cincinnati and then for {{bringing}} a championship to Louisville, Brown came under intense public criticism following the Colonels' championship season for selling the rights to center Dan Issel to the Baltimore Claws in a cost-saving move. He frequently clashed with coach Hubie Brown during the 1975–76 season, {{and at the end}} of the year, he accepted $3 million to <b>fold</b> <b>the</b> team during the 1976 ABA–NBA merger rather than paying $3 million for the team to join the National Basketball Association (NBA).|$|E

5|$|When {{bound to}} a protein, NAD and NADH are usually held within a {{structural}} motif {{known as the}} Rossmann <b>fold.</b> <b>The</b> motif is named after Michael Rossmann {{who was the first}} scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins. This fold contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide, binding domains for NAD consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each fold binding one of the two nucleotides of the cofactor. However, this fold is not universal among NAD-dependent enzymes, since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme, but lack this motif.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, as a Third Division side, Oxford United faced closure {{because of}} the club's {{inability}} to service the debts owed to Barclays Bank, but were rescued when businessman Robert Maxwell took over the club. In April 1983, Maxwell proposed merging United with neighbours Reading, {{to form a new}} club called the Thames Valley Royals, to play at Didcot. Jim Smith would have managed the club and been assisted by Reading boss Maurice Evans. The merger was called off as a result of fans of both clubs protesting against the decision. Furthermore, the Reading chairman stepped down and was replaced by an opponent of the merger. Maxwell also threatened to <b>fold</b> <b>the</b> club if the merger did not go through. Oxford won the Third Division title after the 1983–84 season under the management of Jim Smith, who also guided them to the Second Division title the following year. This meant that Oxford United would be playing First Division football in the 1985–86 season, 23 years after joining the Football League. Smith moved to Queens Park Rangers shortly after the promotion success, and made way for chief scout Maurice Evans, who, several seasons earlier, had won the Fourth Division title with Reading.|$|E
5|$|The vannus is {{bordered by}} the vannal fold, which {{typically}} occurs between the postcubitus {{and the first}} vannal vein. In Orthoptera it usually has this position. In the forewing of Blattidae, however, the only fold {{in this part of}} the wing lies immediately before the postcubitus. In Plecoptera the vannal fold is posterior to the postcubitus, but proximally it crosses the base of the first vannal vein. In the cicada the vannal fold lies immediately behind the first vannal vein (lV). These small variations in the actual position of the vannal fold, however, do not affect the unity of action of the vannal veins, controlled by the flexor sclerite (3Ax), in the flexion of the wing. In the hindwings of most Orthoptera a secondary vena dividens forms a rib in the vannal <b>fold.</b> <b>The</b> vannus is usually triangular in shape, and its veins typically spread out from the third axillary like the ribs of a fan. Some of the vannal veins may be branched, and secondary veins may alternate with the primary veins. The vannal region is usually best developed in the hindwing, in which it may be enlarged to form a sustaining surface, as in Plecoptera and Orthoptera. The great fanlike expansions of the hindwings of Acrididae are clearly the vannal regions, since their veins are all supported on the third axillary sclerites on the wing bases, though Martynov (1925) ascribes most of the fan areas in Acrididae to the jugal regions of the wings. The true jugum of the acridid wing is represented only by the small membrane (Ju) mesad of the last vannal vein. The jugum is more highly developed in some other Polyneoptera, as in the Mantidae. In most of the higher insects with narrow wings the vannus becomes reduced, and the vannal fold is lost, but even in such cases the flexed wing may bend along a line between the postcubitus and the first vannal vein.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA recent {{method for}} {{modeling}} folds uses a fold frame with coordinates {{based on the}} structural geology of folds: fold axis direction, fold axial surface and extension direction. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> geometry can be characterised by rotating <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> frame by <b>the</b> pitch of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> axis in <b>the</b> axial surface and the angle between <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> foliation and <b>the</b> axial surface. These rotation angles can be expressed as 1 D functions of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> frame coordinates. In this contribution we present methods for extracting and automatically modeling <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometries from structural data. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> rotation angles used for characterising <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometry can be calculated locally from structural observations. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> rotation angles incorporate the structural geology of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> and allow for individual structural measurements to be viewed {{in the context of}} <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> structure. To filter out the effects of later <b>folding</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> rotation angles are plotted against the coordinates of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> frame. Using these plots the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> can be interpolated directly from structural data where we use a combination of radial basis function and harmonic analysis to interpolate and extrapolate <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometry. This contribution addresses a major limitation in existing methods where <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometry was not constrained from structural data.

25|$|Other {{than the}} two orders with direct flight muscles, all other living winged insects fly using a {{different}} mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles. This mechanism evolved once, and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera; it corresponds, probably not coincidentally, {{with the appearance of}} a wing-folding mechanism, which allows Neopteran insects to <b>fold</b> <b>the</b> wings back over the abdomen when at rest (though this ability has been lost secondarily in some groups, such as in the butterflies).|$|E
