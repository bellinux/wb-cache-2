5|$|Because of its {{extensive}} ethnomedical tradition, the phytochemistry of P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the topic of several studies. Analysis of the plant's essential oil has identified over two dozen compounds, although the compounds detected and their relative prevalence have not been consistent. Most analyses have identified various monoterpenes and monoterpenoids as the dominant components, such as carene, <b>eucalyptol,</b> limonene, γ-terpinene, and (+)-β-thujone, although the essential oil of a sample from the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Torino had camphor as its most prevalent component. Other monoterpenes, camphene, α-pinene, and β-pinene are also present, as are sesquiterpenes such as γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, trans-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Several terpenoid alcohols—borneol, cedrol, and menthol—have been extracted from P.atriplicifolia, as have caffeic acid and ferulic acid. More complex compounds have been isolated, {{some of which were}} first identified in this manner, including perovskatone; the glycosides atriplisides A and B; and atricins A and B, a pair of triterpenes that are similar to oleanane.|$|E
25|$|Mouthwashes with {{essential}} oils are also useful. For example, American Dental Association approved plaque reducers and anti-inflammatory agents such as thymol, menthol, <b>eucalyptol,</b> and methyl salicylate are originally derived from thyme, mint, eucalyptus, and willow, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The active {{ingredients}} {{approved by the}} American Dental Association that [...] "reduce plaque and demonstrate effective reduction of gingival inflammation {{over a period of}} time" [...] are triclosan, chlorhexidine digluconate, and a combination of thymol, menthol, <b>eucalyptol,</b> and methyl salicylate. These ingredients are found in toothpaste and mouthwash. Hydrogen peroxide was long considered a suitable over-the-counter agent to treat gingivitis. There has been evidence to show the positive effect on controlling gingivitis in short-term use. A study indicates the fluoridated hydrogen peroxide-based mouth rinse can remove teeth stain and reduce gingivitis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eucalyptol</b> is {{also known}} {{by a variety of}} synonyms: 1,8-cineol, 1,8-cineole, cajeputol, 1,8-epoxy-p-menthane, 1,8-oxido-p-menthane, <b>eucalyptol,</b> eucalyptole, 1,3,3-trimethyl-2-oxabicyclo2,2,2octane, cineol, cineole.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2003 study, <b>eucalyptol</b> {{was found}} to control airway mucus {{hypersecretion}} and asthma; after, in a previous study, the authors found <b>eucalyptol</b> to suppress arachidonic acid metabolism and cytokine production in human monocytes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eucalyptol</b> {{is used as}} an {{insecticide}} {{and insect}} repellent.|$|E
50|$|The most {{abundant}} component found in laurel essential oil is 1,8-cineole, also called <b>eucalyptol.</b> The leaves contain about 1.3% essential oils (ol. lauri folii), consisting of 45% <b>eucalyptol,</b> 12% other terpenes, 8-12% terpinyl acetate, 3-4% sesquiterpenes, 3% methyleugenol, and other α- and β-pinenes, phellandrene, linalool, geraniol, and terpineol, contains lauric acid also.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eucalyptol</b> has a fresh mint-like {{smell and}} a spicy, cooling taste. It is {{insoluble}} in water, but miscible with ether, ethanol, and chloroform. The boiling point is 176 °C and the flash point is 49 °C. <b>Eucalyptol</b> forms crystalline adducts with hydrohalic acids, o-cresol, resorcinol, and phosphoric acid.

50|$|The {{leaves of}} Melaleuca quadrifaria contain {{significant}} quantities of essential oils, especially the monoterpene, 1,8-cineole (<b>Eucalyptol).</b>|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{pleasant}} spicy aroma and taste, <b>eucalyptol</b> {{is used in}} flavorings, fragrances, and cosmetics. Cineole-based {{eucalyptus oil}} {{is used as a}} flavouring at low levels (0.002%) in various products, including baked goods, confectionery, meat products and beverages. In a 1994 report released by five top cigarette companies, <b>eucalyptol</b> was listed as one of the 599 additives to cigarettes. It is claimed that it is added to improve the flavor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eucalyptol</b> {{comprises}} up to 90 {{percent of}} the essential oil of some species of the generic product Eucalyptus oil, hence the common name of the compound. It {{is also found in}} camphor laurel, bay leaves, tea tree, sweet basil, wormwood, rosemary, common sage, Cannabis sativa and other aromatic plant foliage. <b>Eucalyptol</b> with a purity from 99.6 to 99.8 percent can be obtained in large quantities by fractional distillation of eucalyptus oil.|$|E

5000|$|Myrtol {{standardized}} is a phytotherapeutic extract (distillate) consisting {{mainly of}} three monoterpenes: (+)-α-pinene, d-limonene and 1,8-cineole (as known as <b>Eucalyptol,</b> but {{not be confused}} with Eucalyptus oil). For example, in one product (Gelomyrtol forte) the ratio between distillates of <b>Eucalyptol</b> (eucalyptus oil extract), D-limonene (lemon peel extract), and an essential oil mixture of Myrtle and lemon, is (66:32:1:1). This can be somewhat confusing since the first two ingredients are part of the second two.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{chemical}} {{components of}} Eucalyptus oil, <b>eucalyptol</b> and alpha-terpineol, give the essential oil a soothing, cooling vapor. This makes Eucalyptus oil useful for massage ...|$|E
50|$|Other bicyclic monoterpenes include carene, sabinene, camphene, and thujene. Camphor, borneol and <b>eucalyptol</b> are {{examples}} of bicyclic monoterpenoids containing ketone, alcohol, and ether functional groups, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oil of air-dried I. anisatum obtained by hydrodistillation leaves? was analyzed by GC-MS. Fifty-two components {{were identified in}} the {{essential oil}}, and the main component was <b>eucalyptol</b> (21.8%).|$|E
5000|$|The {{specific}} name honours Francois Stanislas Cloez (1817-1883), a French chemist, who isolated <b>eucalyptol</b> from eucalyptus leaves and recommended its {{use for the}} treatment of bronchitis, coughs, colds and flu.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, <b>eucalyptol</b> {{is one of}} many {{compounds}} that are attractive to males of various species of orchid bees, which gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones; it is commonly used as bait to attract and collect these bees for study. One such study with Euglossa imperialis, a non-social orchid bee species, has shown that the presence of cineole (also <b>eucalyptol),</b> elevates territorial behavior and specifically attracts the male bees. It was even observed that these males would periodically leave their territories to forage for chemicals such as cineole, thought to be important for attracting and mating with females, to synthesize pheromones.|$|E
50|$|Although {{it can be}} used {{internally}} as a flavoring {{and medicine}} ingredient at very low doses, typical of many essential oils (volatile oils), <b>eucalyptol</b> is toxic if ingested at higher than normal doses.|$|E
50|$|Mouthwashes with {{essential}} oils are also useful.
