50|$|Two {{commercial}} preparations using <b>hexachlorophene,</b> pHisoDerm and pHisoHex, {{were widely}} used as antibacterial skin cleansers {{in the treatment}} of acne, with pHisoDerm developed for those allergic to the active ingredients in pHisoHex. In the US during the 1960s, both were available over the counter. After the ban was enacted, pHisoDerm was reformulated without <b>hexachlorophene,</b> and continued to be sold over-the-counter, while pHisoHex, which contained 3% <b>hexachlorophene</b> (three times the legal limit imposed in 1972), became available (and remains available today) as a prescription body wash. In the European Community countries during the 1970s and 1980s, pHisoHex was available over the counter. A related product, pHisoAc, was used as a skin mask to dry and peel away acne lesions. Another preparation, pHiso-Scrub, was a hexachlorophene-impregnated sponge for scrubbing, has since been discontinued. Several substitute products (including triclosan) were developed, but none had the germ-killing capability of <b>hexachlorophene.</b> Sanofi-Aventis was the sole manufacturer of pHisoHex, while The Mentholatum Company owns the pHisoDerm brand today.

50|$|NEPACCO {{went out}} of {{business}} in 1972, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had issued a ban that limited the use of <b>hexachlorophene.</b> The ban was motivated by the death of thirty-two infants in France who were exposed to high levels of <b>hexachlorophene</b> in baby powder. During an inspection of the old NEPACCO facility in Verona, which was now entirely owned by Syntex Agribusiness, the CDC discovered an old tank filled with 4,300 gallons of NEPACCO still bottoms at a dioxin concentration of more than 340 ppm. Due to a lack of incinerators in proximity to the Verona plant, the proper disposal of the leftover still bottoms would not be completed until 1979.|$|E

50|$|Because {{cosmetics}} are loosely {{regulated by}} the FDA, consideration for the ingredients, age, and usage of the mascara is advisable. A substance is considered a cosmetic if it is {{used in conjunction with}} the body in a manner that does not alter the structure of the body or its functions. This leaves a great deal of freedom for the beauty industry in the formulation of cosmetics. Of course, some chemicals are explicitly forbidden from inclusion in a cosmetic. These include biothional, chloroform, halogenated salicylanilides, <b>hexachlorophene,</b> methylene chloride, vinyl chloride and mercury compounds.

5000|$|From 1970 to 1972, NEPACCO was {{primarily}} {{involved in the}} production of <b>hexachlorophene</b> (3), an antibacterial agent used in soap, toothpaste, and common household disinfectants, from 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (1) and formaldehyde (2).2,4,5-trichlorophenol is synthesized from 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene by the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Unfortunately, instantaneous dimerization of the resulting phenol produces trace amounts of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, an extremely toxic compound known to have both acute and chronic adverse effects.Beginning the process of production with 2,4,5-trichlorophenol that contained 3-5 parts per million (ppm) of dioxin, NEPACCO was able to reduce the concentration of dioxin in <b>hexachlorophene</b> to 0.1 ppm. The result of this purification process led to the storage and accumulation of heavily concentrated dioxin still bottoms, or thick, oily residues, in a storage tank located near the facility in Verona. When NEPACCO first began operations, the still bottoms were sent to a waste facility in Louisiana for incineration. [...] Although incineration was the best method to destroy dioxins at the time, it was also very expensive. Looking for less costly alternatives, NEPACCO contracted the services of the Independent Petrochemical Corporation (IPC). However, IPC, a chemical supplier company, knew very little about waste disposal, and subcontracted the NEPACCO job to Russell Martin Bliss, the owner of a small and local waste oil business. Charging NEPACCO $3000 per load, IPC paid Bliss $125 per load. Between February and October 1971, Bliss collected six truckloads (nearly 18,500 gallons) of chemical waste heavily contaminated with dioxin. Bliss took most of the still bottoms to his storage facility near Frontenac, Missouri, where the contaminated NEPACCO waste was unloaded and mixed into tanks containing used crankcase oils. Subsequently, some of the contaminated oil was sold to MT Richards, a fuel company in Illinois, and to the Midwest Oil Refining Company in Overland, Missouri.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{are usually}} {{visible on the}} {{behaviour}} of the host. Infected sheep and cattle become severely anorexic or digest food inefficiently and become unthrifty. Continuous diarrhoea is an obvious indication of heavy infection in the digestive system, thus a primary diagnosis. The fluid faeces are examined to identify immature flukes. Paramphistomiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease, with no prescription drug for treatment and control. Thus management of infection is based mainly on to reduce the host snail population. There are some treatment strategies demonstrated. A common regime is to drench with hexachloroethane-bentonite-water suspension, which is highly effective against adult parasites. Treatments with reported success (efficacies >90%) are resorantel, oxyclozanide, clorsulon, ivermectin and the combination of bithional and levamisole. Most important commercial anthelmintics are shown to be practically useles, including albendazole, praziquantel, nitroxynil, triclabendazole, profenophos and netobimin; while niclosamide has high efficacy (99%) against immature fluke but not adult fluke, and 2-tertiary-butyl benzthiazole compound (CGA 72630), <b>hexachlorophene</b> and resorantel are highly effective against both adult and immature flukes. An in vitro demonstration shows that plumbagin exhibits high efficacy on adult flukes.|$|E
