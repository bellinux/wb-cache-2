5|$|Archaeologists have {{discovered}} traces of platinum {{in the gold}} used in ancient Egyptian tombs and hieroglyphs as early as 1200 BC. However, the extent of early Egyptians' knowledge of the metal is unclear. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> possible they did not recognize there was platinum in their gold.|$|E
5|$|Finally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{possible}} that the sail or hump combined these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during the mating season, being used to cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threatened.|$|E
5|$|Still, most of {{the people}} who use BZP, even though they say <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> easy to stop, do not want to, and {{continue}} to use the drug, feeling that it helps them to reach higher levels of mood, sociability, and energy.|$|E

5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> possible that the sails or humps of these dinosaurs were used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock's tail. Stromer speculated that males and females may have differed {{in the size of the}} neural spine.|$|E
5|$|Next to it, but {{higher up}} and almost inaccessible, are two cells; then a well; and, thirdly, a small vihara, with three cells, {{two of them}} with stone-beds. Some rough cutting on the back wall between the cell-doors resembles a dagoba in low relief, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> unfinished. Outside are two more cells and a chamber or chapel {{at the end of}} a veranda that runs along in front both of the vihara and the cells.|$|E
5|$|The addax is a {{critically}} endangered species of antelope, as classified by the IUCN. Although extremely rare in its native habitat due to unregulated hunting, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> common in captivity. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena vitilis are found growing {{scattered}} or in groups on debris in hardwood or mixed conifer and hardwood forests. Along the Pacific Coast {{it is sometimes}} abundant in Red alder slashes. In eastern North America <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> commonly found growing in the autumn months of October and November with M.semivestipes and M.pullata. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe (for example, Britain, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal).|$|E
5|$|Thorium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Th and atomic number 90. Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black {{when it is}} exposed to air, forming the dioxide; it is moderately hard, malleable, and has a high melting point. Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry {{is dominated by the}} +4 oxidation state; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.|$|E
5|$|As sweet {{a little}} nook as ever Ulysses mooned away a day in, during his memorable voyage homeward. Though merely a small bay, {{about a mile}} in breadth, and curving inland for {{a mile and a}} half, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{sheltered}} from all winds save the east, being flanked to the south and west by Haskeval and Hondeval, and guarded on the northern side by a low range of heathery slopes. In this sunny time, the sheep are bleating from the shores, the yacht lies double, yacht and shadow, and the bay is painted richly with the clear reflection of the mountains.|$|E

5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
5|$|Instead of annexing Shishman's lands, Milutin reinstalled Shishman as the despot of Vidin and {{concluded}} {{an alliance with}} him. To confirm the alliance, Shishman married the daughter of Serbian Grand Prince Dragoš. The future marriage of Shishman's son and future Bulgarian emperor Michael Shishman (r. 1323–1330) to Milutin's daughter Anna Neda was also arranged at the time {{with the intention of}} further sealing the union. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> apparent that Shishman's unlikely reinstallment in Vidin and alliance with Serbia were dictated by Nogai, as at the same time Serbia also came under Tatar dependence. Milutin was even forced to send his son Stephen Dečanski into captivity in order to prevent a Tatar attack.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
5|$|The art {{of glass}} making {{is thought to}} have {{developed}} during Ahmose's reign. The oldest samples of glass appear to have been defective pieces of faience, but intentional crafting of glass did not occur until the beginning of the 18th dynasty. One of the earliest glass beads found contains the names of both Ahmose and Amenhotep I, written in a style dated to about the time of their reigns. If glassmaking was developed no earlier than Ahmose's reign and the first objects are dated to no later than his successor's reign, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> likely {{that it was one of}} his subjects who developed the craft.|$|E
5|$|The {{brick wall}} around the {{platform}} is in a considerably preserved state as well, although parts of it have broken off. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> thickand was presumably constructed to protect the stupa from the sides. There is evidence that inner surface of the wall had been adorned with paintings. Its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design. Below the wall, {{the side of the}} upper platform itself is decorated with carvings, as is the side of the lower platform.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} said to have been rebuilt, after serious fire damage, around 1257–1265, though whether this was a rebuilding, or a {{continuation}} of work commenced after 1246, is unclear. It is not inconceivable that the fire damage was caused when, in 1256, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, with a large army, seized Llanbadarn Fawr from Norman control. Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, son of King Henry III and brother of King Edward I, was Lord of Cardigan from 1265. Given the size of the church it is probable that construction took many years, even if it were not interrupted. If it commenced in 1246 <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> conceivable that work was not complete until 1265, or later.|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{stingray}} {{is found}} throughout the inshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico (where {{it is the only}} representative of its family) and the Caribbean Sea, including Florida, the Bahamas, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles to Trinidad. On rare occasions, it ranges as far north as Cape Lookout in North Carolina. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> abundant in the Florida Keys and parts of the Antilles, and rather uncommon elsewhere. Off Mexico, this species occupies a salinity range of 26–40ppt.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although this is partly {{due to the lack of}} sources—nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.|$|E
