Changes in the geometry resulted from modification of the conven-tional <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> into a compact <b>drafting</b> <b>system.</b> For the investigations, construction parameters of the machine and the technological process of spinning were taken into con-sideration. Numerical investigations were based on the mathematical model for the dynam-ics of yarn motion through the twisting-winding unit. Experimental tests were performed on the Polish ring spinning machine type PJ 35, equipped with a conventional <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> and the author’s compact <b>drafting</b> <b>system.</b> It was shown that changes in the spinning zone geometry on the spinning machine caused by modification of the conventional <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> into a compact system had no effect on the mean tension value of the yarn. Instead it diminished the amplitude of tension during the revolution around the spindle. Key words: compact spinning, mathematical model, numerical experiment, yarn motion dynamics...|$|R

25|$|Some Spaniards {{objected to}} the encomienda system, notably Bartolomé de las Casas, who insisted that the Indians were humans with souls and rights. Due to many revolts and {{military}} encounters, Emperor Charles V helped relieve the strain on both the Indian laborers and the Spanish vanguards probing the Caribana for military and diplomatic purposes. Later on New Laws were promulgated in Spain in 1542 to protect isolated natives, but the abuses in the Americas were never entirely or permanently abolished. The Spanish also employed the pre-Columbian <b>draft</b> <b>system</b> called the mita, and treated their subjects as something between slaves and serfs. Serfs stayed to work the land; slaves were exported to the mines, where large numbers of them died. In other areas the Spaniards replaced the ruling Aztecs and Incas and divided the conquered lands among themselves ruling as the new feudal lords with often, but unsuccessful lobbying to the viceroys of the Spanish crown to pay Tlaxcalan war demnities. The infamous Bandeirantes from São Paulo, adventurers mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, penetrated steadily westward {{in their search for}} Indian slaves. Serfdom existed as such in parts of Latin America well into the 19th century, past independence.|$|E

40|$|Although collars {{represent}} {{only a small}} area of the pattern-making experience, they form a natural focal point when combined with the main parts of the garment. They are therefore an important design element that needs {{a considerable amount of}} thought. Presently, collar pattern-making follows a number of developmental paths that diverge considerably in their outcomes. Each collar style has a different collar drafting method to obtain the required collar silhouette and within each method there are many variations. Generally, drafts cannot be transported between styles, even changing the stand and fall measurements may not be possible without resorting to trials and drafting instruction alterations. Because of this individualistic approach {{there is a lack of}} standardisation and predictability to collar drafting in general and not all collar drafting methods are equal, some are better than others. Determining the more useful and advanced drafting techniques from, sometimes, conflicting methods is a matter of trial and error which, in itself, acknowledges and enlarges these unpredictable methods. Through an empirical knowledge of current collar drafting methods, coupled with an overview of the body of collar drafting methods derived from the literature, this thesis evaluated a number of selected collar drafting methods to identify their common elements, their underlying strengths and weaknesses and reasons for the scarcity of predictability of final collar forms. From the results of three-dimensional fabrications, a series of questions concerning their performances are developed to evaluate the drafting outcomes. A conceptual analysis, in which the mannequin was divided vertically in to a number of discrete 'sections' showed the importance of the relationships between all of the collar styles, their front opening positions and individual body neck-lines, giving a better understanding of how collars actually work. Conceptually dividing the mannequin in to a finite number of sections formed the foundations of the 'composite' collar <b>drafting</b> <b>system.</b> A composite collar <b>drafting</b> <b>system,</b> with a single set of instructions was developed that could enable designers and pattern-makers to create collar styles and their numerous variations, with the assurance that the envisaged two-dimensional collar will also be the final three-dimensional silhouette. The composite collar <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> instils confidence in the entire process leading to a reduction in the number of toiles required to confirm a design. Novices should find the single composite collar <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> easy to remember and apply, thus reducing the required learning period needed to master collar drafting. From the very beginning the whole design and pattern making procedure is obvious in methods, layouts and conclusions, making collar drafting a predictable cost-effective endeavour The composite collar <b>drafting</b> <b>system,</b> which may be capable of computerisation (something that is not, at present, available to the practitioner), positions itself outside of the current main-stream two-dimensional manual and computer methods and the small number of computerised three-dimensional versions of manual collar drafting, which only describe single collar types.

Compounding this issue, NPB employs a [...] "reverse designation" [...] <b>draft</b> <b>system.</b> Instead of teams choosing players, as in MLB, players can choose what team {{they would like to}} play for. According to former Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles general manager Marty Kuehnert, the teams with the most money could offer amateur players money under the table in exchange for their pledge. Traditionally, NPB teams existed to advertise their parent company, unlike MLB teams that are businesses attempting to maximize their profits. With prime-time advertising spots being expensive in Japan, corporations bought NPB teams for the primary purpose of keeping themselves in the public eye for the entirety of a baseball season. For years, potential profits were secondary. The recession of the 1990s and 2000s started to change this mentality.|$|E
