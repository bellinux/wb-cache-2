5000|$|The <b>Guy</b> West <b>Bridge</b> {{is named}} after the first {{president}} of Sacramento State, Guy West. At the time of its opening in 1967, the <b>Guy</b> West <b>Bridge</b> was hailed as the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in the United States. The bridge cost approximately [...] to construct, and it was named a special prize winner in the 1968 AISC steel bridges contest.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two local}} walks {{comprising}} the recreation reserve of approximately 40 hectares accessible immediately {{south of the}} <b>Guy</b> Fawkes River <b>bridge</b> near the hotel. This walk follows the Guy Fawkes River south for {{about half of the}} walk. Some birdlife can be seen with typical local open grazing land and river views.|$|R
25|$|The Keller's Mill Covered Bridge is {{a covered}} bridge that spans Cocalico Creek in Ephrata Township, Lancaster County in the US state of Pennsylvania. A county-owned and {{maintained}} bridge, its official designation is the Cocalico No. 5 Bridge. It is also sometimes known as <b>Guy</b> Bard Covered <b>Bridge</b> (after a local jurist) and Rettew's Covered Bridge (after {{the person that}} Rettew's Road is named).|$|R
50|$|The second walk is {{accessed}} from by {{crossing the}} <b>Guy</b> Fawkes River <b>bridge</b> {{and following the}} pedestrian path to the left which winds north under the bridge. This path follows closely left of the Guy Fawkes River north and meets the national park's Upper and Lower Falls paths. Numerous wallabies , kangaroos and birdlife can be seen. The Upper and Lower Falls are most spectacular after heavy rain, but can also be very picturesque with normal to moderate flows. Early morning and evening are the best times for photography.|$|R

He leans on the rail and gasps, for here the mist has concentrated, lying like a foot-pad to garrote such of the Three Thousand as creep that way. The iron <b>bridge</b> <b>guys</b> rattle to the strain of his cough, a mocking phthisical rattle, seeming to say to him: [...] "Clickety-clack! just a little rusty cold, sir--but not from our river.

500|$|The track {{begins with}} a dark, desolate {{synthesizer}} beat, resembling 'howling wind', with electric guitar riffs being heard in the background. This slow introduction sets the course for the song's hypnotic pace, with Will Champion adding a metronomic beat to the drums throughout the song. As previously noted, the song features the main hook from Kraftwerk's [...] "Computer Love", replicated by Jonny Buckland's electric guitar riffs {{throughout much of the}} track. Buckland also uses the hook as a chiming note for more abrasive riffs during the bridge (or breakdown) {{near the end of the}} song. A string section can be heard during the choruses and before the start of the <b>bridge.</b> <b>Guy</b> Berryman also plays uptempo bass lines to compliment the track's pace, featuring slower, more abrasive riffs during the song's verses and bridge.|$|R
40|$|Cables, such as {{are used}} in {{cable-stayed}} <b>bridges,</b> suspension <b>bridges,</b> <b>guy</b> wires, transmission lines, and flexible space structures, are prone to vibration due to their low inherent damping characteristics. The mitigation of cable vibration is necessary to minimize negative impact. Transversely-attached passive viscous dampers have been implemented on some cables to dampen vibration. However, it can be shown that only minimal damping can be added if the damper attachment point {{is close to the}} end of the cable. For long cables, passive dampers may provide insufficient supplemental damping to eliminate vibration problems. A recent study by the authors demonstrated that “smart ” semiactive damping can provide significantly superior supplemental damping for a cable modeled as a taut string. This paper extends the previous work by adding sag, inclination, and axial flexibility to the cable model. The equa-tions of motion are given. A new control-oriented model is developed for cables with sag. Passive, active, and smart (semiactive) dampers are incorporated into the model. Cable response is seen to be dramatically reduced by semiactive dampers for a wide range of cable sag and damper location...|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} a guyed tower is presented. A computer program is developed to analyze, design, and estimate the mass and {{the total cost of}} a guyed tower. Matrix stiffness method is used for the static analysis of the mast. The non-linearity due to axial loads is accounted for by using the geometric stiffness matrix. The cable analysis including the change in sag of a guy cable due to change in tension is presented. An iterative procedure is adopted to satisfy compatibility conditions of guy attachment points. Four loading conditions are considered in the design. Structural steel angles are considered for the design of members of the mast. <b>Guy</b> strands and <b>bridge</b> strands are considered for the guy cables and deadman anchorages are adopted for guy anchorages. Variation in the mass and the total cost of a guyed tower due to the variation in (a) inclination of diagonal web members, (b) radial distance of guy anchor points, (c) height of guy connection points, and (d) size of the mast, are studied. An attempt is made to find an optimum design of a guyed tower. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

5000|$|... "I Swear" [...] was written, {{produced}} and released by N-Dubz during 2006. With Jamior Edwards being credited as the track's co-producer. The general {{style of the}} song is an upbeat hip-hop backing combined with the soulful vocals of Tulisa and the intensive rapping of Dappy forming an original British hip-hop grime track which's style {{is reflected in the}} forthcoming album tracks and singles that appeared on N-Dubz's debut album [...] "Uncle B". The song prominently features the two more common participants of N-Dubz in the singing and rapping of their songs: Tulisa and Dappy, with Fazer featuring as backing vocals and/or grunting throughout the song {{as well as in the}} final verse where he raps about how he caught his girlfriend cheating on him when he arrived home from tour. The first verse is rapped by Dappy with Tulisa in backing. This follows onto a call and response chorus between both Dappy and Tulisa. Verse two is led by Tulisa with Dappy in backing and the track is called-out with N-Dubz's signatures call-outs [...] "It's N-Dubz N-Dubz, what ye, it's N-Dubz N-Dubz, two thousand and sexy naa naa nii" [...] - rapped by Dappy and [...] "Uh-oh uh-oh" [...] sung by Tulisa. The song's general theme involves infidelity, a theme which is later followed on by the group's 2008 single [...] "Ouch". The song, through its lyrics, tells a story about how a man discovers that after his girlfriend starts regularly giving him the cold shoulder that she's in fact cheating on him. It's mentioned that he sees his girlfriend kissing another <b>guy</b> under a <b>bridge</b> and when he arrives home from tour he suspiciously finds a pair of Nike shoes that don't belong to him whilst his girlfriend is at home. The story of the lyrics goes on into an argument between the couple and the girlfriend admits that she didn't go chillin' with her girl-friends but did, as accused cheat on him. She states her reason for this as him not giving her enough love and she however consistently apologizes to him through the progression of the song and its lyrics. [...] "I Swear" [...] has also been featured as the concert opening track on N-Dubz's setlist for their Uncle B Tour.|$|R
