5000|$|SCU {{also allows}} an {{optimizing}} compiler to perform interprocedural optimization without requiring link-time optimization, therefore allowing optimizations such as inlining, and helps avoiding implicit code bloat due to exceptions, side effects, and register allocation. These optimizations {{are often not}} possible in many compilers, due to <b>independent</b> <b>compilation,</b> where optimization happens separately in each translation unit during compilation, but the [...] "dumb linker" [...] simply links object files, without performing any optimizations itself, and thus interprocedural optimization between translation units is not possible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{contrast}} to processors, current recongurable devices to-tally lack programming models {{that would allow}} for device <b>independent</b> <b>compilation</b> and forward compatibility. The key to overcome this limi-tations is hardware virtualization. In this paper, we resort to a macro-pipelined execution model to achieve hardware virtualization for data streaming applications. As a hardware implementation we present a hy-brid multi-context architecture that attaches a coarse-grained recong-urable array to a host CPU. A co-simulation framework enables cycle-accurate simulation of the complete architecture. As a case study we map an FIR lter to our virtualized hardware model and evaluate dierent designs. We discuss {{the impact of the}} number of contexts and the feature of context state on the speedup and the CPU load. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of a compilation manager (CM) for Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) is described. Truly <b>independent</b> <b>compilation</b> is difficult to implement correctly and efficiently for SML because one compilation unit may depend {{not only on the}} interface of another, but also on its implementation. In this paper we present an integrated compilation system based on the "visible compiler" primitives provided by SML/NJ that supports selective recompilation to minimize system build time in most situations. Large systems are presented as hierarchical source groups. An automatic dependency analyzer determines constraints on the order in which sources must be considered. By abstracting away from the specifics of the SML/NJ compiler, the CM readily generalizes to arbitrary "compilation tools" such as parser generators and embedded languages...|$|E
40|$|First-order multiparty {{interaction}} {{is one of}} the abstractions in the distributed programming model, called Interacting Processes (IP), proposed by N. Francez and I. R. Forman [1]. We argued elsewhere that the IP model is also ideal for parallel programming and it could become a mainstream programming model for parallel and distributed computing in the future. In this paper, we propose an e#cient algorithm for coordinating first-order multiparty interactions on demand. By taking advantage of multi-threading supported by modern operating systems, this algorithm requires less messages than the algorithm proposed by Joung and Smolka [2]. It also supports <b>independent</b> <b>compilation</b> of modules in IP, allowing them to be used as software components for open distributed and parallel computing.
