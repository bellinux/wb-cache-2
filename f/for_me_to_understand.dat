The episode's title refers to the song [...] "", by American alternative rock group Community Trolls. Featured music includes The Voluntary Butler Scheme's [...] "Trading Things In" [...] and Dragonette's [...] "Come On Be Good". Pompeo was pregnant during the episode, so the filming crew had to work around it. In the episode, Lexie advocated for Meredith to donate her liver, because she was unable to. Bans commented on this: [...] "It was REALLY easy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Lexie in this episode – 'cause that's how I imagine she grew up with [...] and Thatcher. There was taco night, and movie night, and if she had homework issues, {{one of them was}} always around to help. So now that her Dad needs some of her liver, recovering alcoholic or not, she’s gonna do it. She's not even thinking about the Chief's upcoming merger – and the fact that recovering from a major surgery will put her on the bench, out of the game, for at least a month. Lexie doesn't blink, because family isn't an obligation to her like it is {{for a lot of people}} - [...] it's a gift." [...] The scene in which Meredith offers her liver to Thatcher was originally intended to rekindle their relationship. Bans later changed this, following a request from Pompeo, and offered her insight: ...|$|E

She did neither, but when Alice turned her face back she seemed encouraged by Mrs. Brinkley's look to go on: [...] "I didn't appreciate her then; she was very generous and high-minded--too high-minded <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> even.

Regenerating codes allow distributed storage systems to recover from the loss of a storage node while transmitting the minimum possible amount of data across the network. We search for examples of Minimum Storage Regenerating Codes. To exhaustively search the space of potential codes, we reduce the potential search space in several ways. We impose an additional symmetry condition on codes that we consider. We specify codes in a simple alternative way, using additional recovered coefficients rather than transmission coefficients. We place codes into equivalence classes to avoid redundant checking. We find MSR codes for the parameters n = 5 and k = 3 in various fields. We demonstrate that it is possibl...|$|R
