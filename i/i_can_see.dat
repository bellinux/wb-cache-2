5|$|<b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! (sometimes <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It! {{or simply}} <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room!) is a 1961 {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is {{a painting of}} a man looking through a peephole. It formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (<b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E
5|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story {{published}} by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man looking {{through a hole in}} a door. His finger is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon.|$|E

5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E

25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category.

25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} was {{generally}} met with positive reviews from music critics. Romanian publication Libertatea praised the refrain of [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] for being optimistic, and described its beats as [...] "explosive". Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own website, expected the track to become a hit, although stating that the lyrics [...] "aren't exactly strong and Viper's solo in the song adds nothing. He has a unique voice but it's not something <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> myself listening to, he isn't a great singer, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> how his vocals change the track."

500|$|The work is {{an example}} of Lichtenstein's {{presentation}} of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It {{is considered to be a}} work on the subject of [...] "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room! with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room! should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as [...] "the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology.|$|E

500|$|During Casino Royale's {{final draft}} stages, Fleming allowed his friend William Plomer {{to see a}} copy, and remarked [...] "so far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the element of {{suspense}} is completely absent". Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first, they were unenthusiastic about the novel, but Fleming's brother Peter, whose books they managed, persuaded the company to publish it. On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s 6d, with a cover designed by Fleming. It was a success and three print runs were needed {{to cope with the}} demand.|$|E
