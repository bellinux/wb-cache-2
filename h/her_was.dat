5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated <b>her,</b> <b>was</b> blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E

5|$|Highly {{regarded}} {{during her}} active {{career as a}} portrait and landscape painter, by 1914 Fuller was represented in four public galleries—three in Australia and one in South Africa—a record {{for a woman who}} was an Australian painter at that time. In 1927 she began almost twenty years of institutionalization in a mental asylum, however, and her death went without notice. After her death, information about <b>her</b> <b>was</b> frequently omitted from reference books about Australian painters and knowledge of her work became obscure despite her paintings being held in public art collections including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Australia's National Portrait Gallery.|$|E

5|$|She {{suffered}} from bulimia very badly. That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed <b>her</b> <b>was</b> the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E
5|$|The only warship {{reported}} wrecked on the Doom Bar was , a 12-gun schooner.

On 15 September 1816, she ran aground on the Doom Bar as the tide was ebbing and the wind was from an unfavourable direction offering little assistance. According to court-martial transcripts, an attempt to move <b>her</b> <b>was</b> made at the next high tide, but she was taking on water and {{it was impossible to}} save her.|$|E
5|$|Grigory Orlov, one of Catherine's lovers, led {{a palace}} coup in June 1762 that ousted the Emperor Peter III and enthroned Catherine II. Sergeant Potemkin {{represented}} his regiment in the revolt. Allegedly, as Catherine reviewed her troops {{in front of}} the Winter Palace before their march to the Peterhof, she lacked a sword-knot (or possibly hat plumage), which Potemkin quickly supplied. Potemkin's horse then (appeared to) refuse to leave her side for several minutes before Potemkin and horse returned to the ranks. After the coup Catherine singled out Potemkin for reward and ensured his promotion to second lieutenant. Though Potemkin was among those guarding the ex-Tsar, it appears that he had no direct involvement in Peter's murder in July. Catherine promoted him again to Kammerjunker (gentleman of the bedchamber), though he retained his post in the Guards. Potemkin was soon formally presented to the Empress as a talented mimic; his imitation of <b>her</b> <b>was</b> well received.|$|E
