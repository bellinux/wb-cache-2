25|$|My dear Miss Hamilton, What can I have to say? Not much indeed! But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a {{favourite}} with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I {{should not have been}} acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.|$|E

25|$|In March 1926 Hopkinson <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of {{formally}} introducing {{his father}} Alfred to the House of Commons, after {{he won a}} by-election in the Combined English Universities. His father was, unlike him, elected as a Conservative, although Hopkinson was a generally reliable vote for the Conservatives in this period. After the general strike he was critical {{of the actions of}} the trade unions. However, he opposed the Baldwin government's Trades Disputes Bill which restricted union powers, {{on the grounds that it}} would hinder those trade unionists committed to reform from changing their unions, and also hinder employers who were committed to improving the liberty of their employees.|$|E
25|$|The mercenaries of the Ever Victorious Army, {{comprising}} some of {{the worse}} social elements of China, Britain and the United States were notorious for their practice whenever they marched into a new district of stealing everything while raping all of the women, which led Gordon to impose harsh discipline, with those soldiers accused of looting and/or rape being taken out and shot. Gordon also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of defeating Burgevine (a man whom Gordon detested) who had raised a mercenary force and joined the Taipings. After Gordon had surrounded Burgevine's force outside of Soochow, the latter had abandoned his own men and attempted to rejoin the Imperial side, which led Gordon to arrest him and send him to the American consul in Shanghai together with a letter asking that Burgevine be expelled from China.|$|E

25|$|In a low-scoring thriller at The County Ground, Derby, Dominic Cork <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> {{of beating}} his old county, though {{it became a}} tougher task than expected, {{considering}} that Derbyshire had not won a Championship match since 2004. Winning the toss and batting, Derbyshire had a good opening partnership between Australian Michael Di Venuto and Ben France, but Greg Chapple put the pressure on with some patient, economical bowling and reaped the rewards with three wickets for 29. However, it was Cork who got the most wickets, after taking the last three of the innings to finish with four for 40 and send Derbyshire off for 191. Lancashire lost two quick wickets in reply, and were in trouble when Warren Hegg departed at 128 for 6, but a fine innings worth 64 from Cork down the order - along with 24 from Muttiah Muralitharan - sent Lancashire into a 50-run lead. Muralitharan was, indeed, in contention for Man of the Match, bowling 27 overs in succession and taking six for 50 as Derbyshire collapsed to 185, setting a target of 136 to win. Lancashire {{thought that would be}} a walk in the park, especially as Iain Sutcliffe and Mal Loye paired up for 53 for the second wicket, but they then lost seven men for sub-12 scores and were in trouble at 131 for 9. Only Sutcliffe kept his head calm, carrying his bat to 62 not out, and he and Muralitharan managed to add the required five runs.|$|E

Devon journalist Gary Andrews remembered Stansfield as a man who would spend time with his family after matches while speaking to fans and the press. He wrote that [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of interviewing Adam on a regular basis...I say pleasure, because his answers were thoughtful and intelligent and he came across as a man who was delighted to be back home with his friends and family".|$|E
500|$|David Silverman {{describes}} the episode as [...] "one of my very favorite episodes that I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> to direct". He notes that several [...] "standard Homerisms" [...] appear {{for the first}} time in the episode, such as Homer's conversations with his brain and his high-pitched [...] "fairy voice". Silverman inserted a red herring into the episode in a scene where Mr. Burns says that he was rejuvenated. Silverman used a close-up of Burns when he says [...] "blood of a young boy" [...] in hopes of misleading viewers into thinking that the rest of episode would be about Burns seeking more of Bart's blood.|$|E

500|$|In 1853, {{while trying}} to arrange a match against Anderssen, Staunton met von der Lasa in Brussels. The two began a match, but had to abandon {{it in the middle}} of the thirteenth game, with von der Lasa leading (five wins, four losses, and three draws). Staunton was unfit to {{continue}} because of heart palpitations, which had affected him in the second match against Saint-Amant in 1843. In von der Lasa's opinion there was no chance that Staunton's health would be good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards.Note: some writers say Staunton and von der Lasa played a match in Berlin in 1844; but Staunton wrote in the Chess Player's Chronicle that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of making the personal acquaintance of von der Lasa in their 1853 encounter—see ...|$|E
500|$|As a director, Weitz <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of {{introducing}} and filming on new locations and sets. Of particular interest was the Quileute reservation and Jacob's house. Using the Quileute country in Washington as a basis, the production team decided to place Jacob's {{house on the}} edges of the territory, rather than in the community, because of Jacob's attachment to the wolves. To Weitz, Jacob's house was the stepping stone into the forest world, where the reality of the werewolves is hidden. The production designer was faced with a [...] "real world" [...] versus [...] "book world" [...] challenge when the barn they located, described in the book as a red barn, was green. Initially bordered by a green fence, the decision of painting the barn, aging it, and renovating the exterior proved to be a layout that fit well with Jacob's character.|$|E

Đính's ego had been played upon by the Ngô brothers, who had themselves reiterated this point and paid him a large cash bonus after the pagoda raids. In the heady times after the attacks, Đính had a [...] "somewhat incoherent" [...] debate with his American advisor, claiming [...] "he [...] was without doubt the greatest general officer in the ARVN, the saviour of Saigon... and soon {{he would be the}} top military man in the country."

Critics praised the film for its humour and uniqueness, noting that it touched a raw nerve among Singaporeans. For example, Sanjuro of LoveHKFilm.com wrote, [...] "I Not Stupid covers a variety of serious subjects, but all the while maintains a light comedic touch. Jack Neo [...] a clever, well-crafted social commentary and a damn good film to boot." [...] Other reviewers described I Not Stupid as [...] "one of the greatest cinematic feats I’ve <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of experiencing" [...] and displaying a [...] "simple and yet excellent execution".

[...] E! Online's Megan Masters has also compared Brittany to Sue, and stated that Brittany's one-liners [...] "easily rival" [...] Sue's.

Snarker called the two her [...] "new favourite Glee pairing", and commented: [...] "While Heather Morris (Brittany) and Naya Rivera (Santana) have had minimal screen time, they’ve made it count.

500|$|Mason had {{submitted}} {{his plan}} sometime between June 8 and 10, 1776. It named {{the new state}} the [...] "Commonwealth of Virginia", a name chosen pointedly by Mason to indicate that power stemmed from the people. The constitution provided for a popularly elected House of Delegates, chosen annually by men who owned or leased property, or who had fathered three or more Virginians. Most governmental power resided in the House of Delegates—the governor could not even veto a bill, and could only act {{as head of the}} state militia on the advice of his Council of State, whose members were elected by the legislature. The draft was considered by the committee, and it issued a report on June 24, at which time Jefferson's preamble and several amendments authored by him were included—George Wythe, who advocated for Jefferson's draft before the committee, found discussion far enough advanced that members were only willing to yield to Jefferson on a few points. The entire convention considered the document between June 26 and 28, and it was signed on the 29th. Richard Henry Lee wrote the day prior to the constitution's passage by unanimous vote, [...] "I have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> to see our new plan of Government go on well.
