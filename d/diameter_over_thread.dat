40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} fatigue lifetime acceptance test criterion by which studs having rolled threads, larger than 1. 0 inches in diameter, {{can be assured}} to meet minimum quality attributes associated with a controlled rolling process. This criterion is derived from a stress dependent, room temperature air fatigue database for test studs having a 0. 625 inch diameter threads of Alloys X- 750 HTH and direct aged 625. Anticipated fatigue lives of larger threads are based on thread root elastic stress concentration factors which increase with increasing <b>thread</b> <b>diameters.</b> <b>Over</b> the <b>thread</b> size range of interest, a 30 % increase in notch stress is equivalent to a factor of five (5 X) reduction in fatigue life. The resulting diameter dependent fatigue acceptance criterion is normalized to the aerospace rolled thread acceptance standards for a 1. 0 inch diameter, 0. 125 inch pitch, Unified National thread with a controlled Root radius (UNR). Testing was conducted at a stress of 50 % of the minimum specified material ultimate strength, 80 Ksi, and at a stress ratio (R) of 0. 10. Limited test data for fastener diameters of 1. 00 to 2. 25 inches are compared to the acceptance criterion. Sensitivity of fatigue life of threads to test nut geometry variables was also shown {{to be dependent on}} notch stress conditions. Bearing surface concavity of the compression nuts and thread flank contact mismatch conditions can significantly affect the fastener fatigue life. Without improved controls these conditions could potentially provide misleading acceptance data. Alternate test nut geometry features are described and implemented in the rolled thread stud specification, MIL-DTL- 24789 (SH), to mitigate the potential effects on fatigue acceptance data...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} one-year-patency of infrainguinal {{arterial}} reconstructions {{in relation to}} venous graft diameter and length. Material and Methods: 56 patent and failed infrainguinal autovenous by-pass reconstructions were followed up for no less than a year. The diameter of the vein was measured {{at the site of}} distal anastomosis, and the length after the completion of reconstruction. Results: Results are worse in venous grafts with diameter less than 3. 5 mm and length over 40 cm, but the difference between failed and patent by-passes with <b>diameter</b> <b>over</b> 3. 5 mm and bigger length is also significant. Shorter and with <b>diameter</b> <b>over</b> 3. 5 mm by-passes have the higher percentage patency.

30|$|Hepatic SUV indices and CT density were {{measured}} from a circular ROI of 3 -cm <b>diameter</b> <b>over</b> the right lobe of the liver, and spleen SUV indices from a circular ROI of 2.5 -cm <b>diameter</b> <b>over</b> {{the centre of}} the organ. Body weight and LBM, estimated from height and weight using the equations of Boer [30], were used as the whole-body metrics to give SUW and SUL, respectively. Both were expressed as the maximum voxel SUV (SUWmax and SULmax) and mean SUV in the ROI (SUWmean and SULmean). We assume that because it is soluble in water rather than fat, negligible FDG enters the fat droplets in hepatocytes. Using an equation relating fat content to CT density [31], hepatic SUV was therefore adjusted for the physical ‘dilutional’ effect of hepatic fat on the FDG signal, as previously described [32].|$|R
