40|$|Tool {{actions are}} {{characterized}} by a transformation (of spatio-temporal and/or force-related characteristics) between movements and their resulting consequences in the environment. This transformation {{has to be taken}} into account, when planning and executing movement and its existence may affect performance. In the present study we investigated how angular gain transformations between movement and visual feedback during circling movements affect coordination performance. Participants coordinated the visual feedback (feedback dot) with a continuously circling stimulus (stimulus dot) on a computer screen in order to produce mirror symmetric trajectories of them. The movement angle was multiplied by a gain factor (0. 5 to 2; 9 levels) before it was presented on the screen. Thus, the angular gain transformations changed the spatio-temporal relationship between the movement and its feedback in visual space, and resulted in a non-constant mapping of movement to <b>feedback</b> <b>positions.</b> Coordination performance was best with gain = 1. With high gains the feedback dot was in lead of the stimulus dot, with small gains it lagged behind. Anchoring (reduced movement variability) occurred when the two trajectories were close to each other. Awareness of the transformation depended on the deviation of the gain from 1. In conclusion, the size of an angular gain transformation as well as its mere presence influence performance in {{a situation in which the}} mapping of movement <b>positions</b> to visual <b>feedback</b> <b>positions</b> is not constant. When designing machines or tools that involve transformations between movements and their external consequences, one should be aware that the mere presence of angular gains may result in performance decrements and that there can be flaws in the representation of the transformation...|$|R

In this paper we present a design of a robust neuro-controller for a dynamic system {{to make the system}} response fast with no overshoot.

The <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> which controls the bandwidth of the system as well as the dynamic response {{is a function of the}} system error. For large error the <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> is made large increasing the bandwidth of the system, and for small errors the <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> value is small. Thus, during the dynamic response of the system the bandwidth of the system is controlled by the system error. Similarly, the velocity feedback which controls the damping in the system is kept very small for large errors, and large for small errors.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} and tries to identify the strategies of human operators (HO's) teleoperating a robot along 2 -D-trajectories in simulations of place-like tasks in an obstacle encumbered environment. The experiments utilize computer graphic simulations of a remote robot whose end-effector displacements are dynamically controlled in the X - Y plane by the HO's hand displacements. Four different modes are selected to provide suggested trajectories to the HO's that begin at the initial point of the robot's end-effector and end in the landing zone. For each mode, two different visual frames of reference are used to present the remote scene viewed by the HO: a stationary view of the environment, or {{a view from the}} end-effector of the robot, which produces the sensation of a mobile environment. The performance is described in the various displayed conditions in terms of movement duration, spatial and temporal errors, and energy. The data show that performance depends {{on the nature of the}} cues and instructions provided to the operators. Comparative analysis of the various conditions suggests that visual <b>feedback</b> <b>position</b> control is used when continuous static or dynamic information about the trajectory is provided, while feedforward control, corrected by sampled visual information, is adopted when a self-generated movement can be planned and executed. The data also show that for a given set of execution cues, an equivalent performance is achieved in both visual frames of reference. A fifth mode of trajectory presentation, suggested by the results of the former analysis, has been tested. This mode, which presents a few specific spatial cues (gates) on the screen during the execution of the movement, combines the features for trajectory planning and sampled visual <b>feedback</b> <b>position</b> control.

A {{model of}} cortico-spinal {{trajectory}} generation for voluntary reaching movements is developed to functionally interpret {{a broad range}} of behavioral, physiological, and anatomical data. The model simulates how arm movements achieve their remarkable efficiency and accuracy in response to widely varying positional, speed, and force constraints. A key issue in arm movement control is how the brain copes with such a wide range of movement contexts. The model suggests how the brain may set automatic and volitional gating mechanisms to vary the balance of static and dynamic feedback information to guide the movement command and to compensate for external forces. For example, with increasing movement speed, the system shifts from a <b>feedback</b> <b>position</b> controller to a feedforward trajectory generator with superimposed dynamics compensation.

40|$|A new {{technique}} for vibration suppression in Large Space Structures is demonstrated in laboratory experiments on a thin cantilever beam, resulting in substantially reduced dynamic response. This technique, called Positive <b>Position</b> <b>Feedback,</b> {{makes use of}} generalized displacement measurements to accomplish vibration suppression.
