2500|$|A {{number of}} {{software}} tools can decompile a WinHelp file into its source documentsâ€”HPJ, CNT, RTF, BMP, SHG). An HPJ file is the project file that is created and edited in the Help Workshop (or {{a third party}} help authoring tool). The HPJ contains information about what RTF files to compile into the help, the MAP IDs and Aliases that provide links from a calling application to the help file, and help file appearance (window size, default buttons, color schemes, etc.). The CNT file provides the table of contents for the help file. An SHG file is a [...] "SHED" [...] graphics file that essentially creates an image map of help calls for a <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> (e.g., a BMP).|$|E

50|$|Before 1994, ASDG {{had started}} on the Amiga, and {{produced}} an image processing application called Art Department Professional (ADPro), and in 1992 a precursor to Elastic Reality called MorphPlus. Other software products included Image Independence (<b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> conversion and scaling), ASDG Abekas driver, Lightning F/X (for lightning effects (Later called Avid LFX)) and NSA (No Strings Attached) for removing wires from live action effects.|$|E

50|$|Technically the {{standard}} HIRES graphics mode on the C128 {{was the same}} as on the C64 except that the default address in RAM where videoram (HIRES colors) are stored on the C128 directly preceded the default screen address (unlike the C64). This made loading a single BSAVE <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> in either a monochrome or color format (of the uncompressed type produced by DOODLE) possible on the C128.|$|E

50|$|Extended Vector Animation (EVA) is {{a web-based}} vector <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> format {{developed}} by Sharp Corporation in 1996. The EVA format differs from other vector formats because only {{the changes in}} vectors over time is recorded instead of information per frame. The format is popular in Japan and several versions of EVA Animator software have been sold and included as standard software in Japanese Sharp notebook computers such as the Mebuis.|$|E

5000|$|Metafile is a [...] {{term for}} a file format that can store {{multiple}} types of data. This commonly includes <b>graphics</b> <b>file</b> formats. These <b>graphics</b> <b>files</b> can contain raster, vector, and type data. A common use for these files is to provide support for an operating system's computer graphics; e.g., Microsoft Windows uses Windows Metafile, and Mac OS X uses PDF.|$|R
50|$|ZSoft Corporation, {{founded by}} Mark Zachmann, was a Marietta, Georgia {{software}} {{company in the}} 1980s known for the PC Paintbrush software and its PCX <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> format. ZSoft first merged in 1989 with Mediagenic. When Mediagenic went bankrupt in 1991, Zachmann was able to regain his independence just in time. ZSoft was bought by Wordstar, which was later bought by SoftKey, which was later bought by The Learning Company.|$|E
5000|$|IrfanView (...) is {{an image}} viewer, editor, {{organiser}} and converter program for Microsoft Windows. It can also play video and audio files, and has some image creation and painting capabilities. IrfanView is free for non-commercial use; commercial use requires paid registration. It is noted for its small size, speed, ease of use, and ability to handle {{a wide variety of}} <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> formats. It was first released in 1996.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 2001, Aaland began {{publishing}} {{a number of}} guidebooks about using the computer design program Photoshop to enhance digital photography; Photoshop Elements Solutions: The Art of Digital Photography was followed by second, third, and fourth volumes. He also acted as an unpaid adviser {{to the development of}} both the alpha, beta, and final versions of the Adobe Photoshop Elements application. Photoshop CS2 RAW: Using Adobe Camera Raw, Bridge, and Photoshop to Get the Most Out of Your Digital Camera (2006) was Aaland's first of two books explaining the <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> format RAW, which is used by professional photographers.|$|E
50|$|File headers {{may be used}} by an {{operating}} system to quickly gather information about a file without loading it all into memory, but doing so uses more of a computer's resources than reading directly from the directory information. For instance, when a <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> manager has to display {{the contents of a}} folder, it must read the headers of many files before it can display the appropriate icons, but these will be located in different places on the storage medium thus taking longer to access. A folder containing many files with complex metadata such as thumbnail information may require considerable time before it can be displayed.|$|E
50|$|Another useful {{application}} of dithering is for {{situations in which}} the <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> format is the limiting factor. In particular, the commonly used GIF format is restricted {{to the use of}} 256 or fewer colors in many graphics editing programs. Images in other file formats, such as PNG, may also have such a restriction imposed on them {{for the sake of a}} reduction in file size. Images such as these have a fixed color palette defining all the colors that the image may use. For such situations, graphical editing software may be responsible for dithering images prior to saving them in such restrictive formats.|$|E

50|$|Helicon Filter {{supports}} {{the most common}} raster <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> formats, such as JPEG, GIF (import only), and PNG, {{as well as some}} less common formats, such as the most recent RAW formats, JPEG 2000, Photoshop images (PSD), and both 16 and 8 bit TIFFs. Movie files may be played back, though they may not be edited. In the free version, files may only be saved as jpegs and bitmaps. As a security means in certain licenses to prevent extended license periods, photos dated later than the date of the computer do not open, and this has caused some complaints from those who have mis-dated pictures.|$|E

50|$|Skypix {{might have}} {{remained}} a curiosity if creator Michael Cox hadn't thought {{to include a}} programming interface. Sysops who were conversant with the ARexx language (a variant of REXX for the Amiga) could write games and other programs using Skypix graphics and include them anywhere in their systems. This resulted in an enthusiastic group of Skypix hobbyists and many firsts, from the world's first fully graphical online chess games to the first online graphic adventure games, to the first online paint and photo galleries. These were widely traded and the average Skyline sysop had many of them on their systems. Other innovations included a type of animated <b>graphic</b> <b>file</b> that predated {{the invention of the}} animated GIF and worked on the same principle.|$|E
