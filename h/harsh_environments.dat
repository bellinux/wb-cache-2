5|$|In some archaea, the {{lipid bilayer}} is {{replaced}} by a monolayer. In effect, the archaea fuse the tails of two phospholipid molecules into a single molecule with two polar heads (a bolaamphiphile); this fusion may make their membranes more rigid and better able to resist <b>harsh</b> <b>environments.</b> For example, the lipids in Ferroplasma are of this type, which is thought to aid this organism's survival in its highly acidic habitat.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in <b>harsh</b> <b>environments,</b> such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|Most {{laboratory}} {{techniques for}} growing bacteria use {{high levels of}} nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to <b>harsh</b> <b>environments,</b> such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (syntrophy).|$|E

5|$|About 1,150 {{species of}} fungi have been {{recorded}} from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths {{as a result of}} evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces antarcticus, and Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.|$|E

25|$|Strict categorization, however, is not {{possible}} for some complex species interactions. For example, seed germination and survival in <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> is often higher under so-called nurse plants than on open ground. A nurse plant is one with an established canopy, beneath which germination and survival are more likely due to increased shade, soil moisture, and nutrients. Thus, the relationship between seedlings and their nurse plants is commensal. However, as the seedlings grow into established plants, {{they are likely to}} compete with their former benefactors for resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} of evolutionary adaptedness is {{significantly different from}} modern society. The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning. Researchers look to existing hunter-gatherer societies for clues as to how hunter-gatherers lived in the {{environment of}} evolutionary adaptedness. Unfortunately, the few surviving hunter-gatherer societies are different from each other, {{and they have been}} pushed out of the best land and into <b>harsh</b> <b>environments,</b> so {{it is not clear how}} closely they reflect ancestral culture.|$|E
25|$|Another {{potential}} benefit of facilitation is insulation from competitive interactions. Like the now familiar example of nurse plants in <b>harsh</b> <b>environments,</b> nurse logs {{in a forest}} are sites of increased seed germination and seedling survival because the raised substrate of a log frees seedlings from competition with plants and mosses on the forest floor. The crab-coral interaction described above is also an example of refuge from competition, since the herbivory of crabs on seaweed reduces competition between coral and seaweed. Similarly, herbivory by sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) on kelps (Laminaria spp.) can protect mussels (Modiolus modiolus) from overgrowth by kelps competing for space in the subtidal zone of the Gulf of Maine, USA.|$|E

25|$|The two eland {{species are}} now semi-domesticated as their docile dispositions, large {{quantities}} of meat, and resilience in Africa's <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> has made them ideal alternatives to cattle in some parts in Africa. In a 2014 comparison between the quality of meat from common eland and cattle, {{it was found that}} the meat from male elands was low-fat and more beneficial for human nutritional health but it lacks the sensory texture and flavor that makes cattle meat so appealing to consumers. In addition to being on farm as exotic lifestock, eland as well as the other species of spiral-horned antelope have also been brought to private game reserves across the planet (in particular parts in North America and Africa) for recreational hunting. Unlike eland however, most of the other species are not as docile or tolerant of humans as they avoid any contact as possible.|$|E
25|$|To keep captives happy, certain needs {{will need}} to be fulfilled, such as food, rest, religion, fear, and order. Pirates, however, prefer anarchy and defense, along with grub, grog, wenches, and betting from various {{entertainment}} buildings as well as resting and stashing at personal homes. Anarchy measures the level of disorder in an area. Captives are prevented from escaping through the fear mechanic, which is maintained by special structures. Escaped workers may report to other monarchs and cause uprisings. Pirate ships may be built at boatyards or shipyards, and are used to plunder other islands or board enemy ships to steal gold with which the player can build a greater pirate base and occasionally wealthy captives, who do not work but have a ransom that increases as they use entertainment buildings. There are also several challenging scenarios in which the goal is to survive in <b>harsh</b> <b>environments,</b> from angry pirates to escaping captives.|$|E
25|$|Igapó is {{primarily}} characterized by seasonal inundation caused by abundant rainfall; in some areas, trees can be submerged {{for up to}} 6 months of the year. These ecosystems are relatively open and feature over 30% canopy cover with an average canopy height ranging from 20–25 m; sparse measurements of trees can reach 33–36 m. Tree composition includes a varied mixture of leaf types and seasonality. Development of tree communities within the freshwater swamp forests rely heavily on microtopography and flooding intensity. Swamp forests can have <b>harsh</b> <b>environments,</b> in which only a few adapted species are able to sustain life or dominate over other tree species. One of the tree species mostly found in freshwater swamp forests are legume trees, in which most swamp forests have high single legume species populations. Legume trees in these forests {{are thought to be}} abundant in nitrogen fixation, which is most common in waterlogged locations and is thought to be a favorable trait when experiencing seasonal and/or constant waterlogging.|$|E
