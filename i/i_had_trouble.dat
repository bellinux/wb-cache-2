25|$|While drawing {{advertisements}} for Flit, Geisel became adept at drawing insects with huge stingers, {{shaped like a}} gentle S-curve and with a sharp end that included a rearward-pointing barb on its lower side. Their facial expressions depict gleeful malevolence. These insects were later rendered in an editorial cartoon as a swarm of Allied aircraft (1942), and again as the Sneedle of On Beyond Zebra, and yet again as the Skritz in <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>Trouble</b> in Getting to Solla Sollew.|$|E
500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|He also {{received}} media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, [...] "you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so." [...] O'Neal later {{said it was}} locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he {{said a lot of}} Asians wouldn't see the humor. Yao joked, [...] "Chinese is hard to learn. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> with it when I was little." [...] O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he hazed Yao early in his career.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur Marks, a {{producer}} of Perry Mason, recalled Burr's talk of wives and children: [...] "I know he was just putting on a show. … That was my gut feeling. I think the wives and the loving women, the Natalie Wood thing, were {{a bit of a}} cover." [...] Dean Hargrove, executive producer of the Perry Mason television films, said in 2006, [...] "I had always assumed that Raymond was gay, because he had a relationship with Robert Benevides for a very long time. Whether or not he had relationships with women, I had no idea. I did know that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> keeping track of whether he was married or not in these stories. Raymond had the ability to mythologize himself, to some extent, and some of his stories about his past … tended to grow as time went by." ...|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Allyson Kazmucha of iMore criticized {{several aspects}} of the iPhone app. She wrote that [...] "The first thing you notice about Google Calendar is the bold interface", adding that [...] "Google {{automatically}} detects certain event types and puts graphics behind them, which is a nice touch". However, she criticized the amount of space the graphics take up, writing that [...] "it wastes {{a lot of space}} {{that could be used to}} show more events at a glance. It's not a huge peeve, but for anyone who has a busy calendar, it could result in a lot of scrolling". She also criticized the Smart Suggestions, writing that [...] "in my short time using Google Calendar, the natural language support leaves a lot to be desired. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> typing times or days and getting Google to understand it". She did, however, like the view options available, writing that [...] "The three day view is one of my favorites", but also noted that there was a lack of [...] "the ability to quickly drag events around to reschedule them". Kazmucha also criticized the then-lack of a widget in the Notification Center, but wrote conclusively that [...] "Google Calendar is off to a good start but it isn't making me switch away from [...]" ...|$|E

5000|$|Steeplechase burned {{during the}} 1907 season, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} park. The morning after the fire Tilyou posted a sign outside the park.

Admission to the burning ruins -- Ten cents.The park was rebuilt for the 1908 season, although the new park was not fully open until 1909. It now included a [...] "Pavilion of Fun" [...] in an indoor enclosure covered by steel and glass that covered 5 acre. Steeplechase burned again in less-destructive incidents in 1936 and 1939.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not Mr. Lloyd George I'm {{worrying}} about, sir," [...] he said, [...] "all I {{wants is}} enough for the missus and me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> to get that before the war." ...|$|E

6000|$|Austin made {{a little}} sign of comprehension. [...] "I don't {{remember}} what I promised them. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> to get them, but I certainly told them the place wasn't a healthy one.

60|$|This was a {{compliment}} to me, but it showed what a sad pass Steele had come to. My regret was that I had no sympathy to offer him. I failed him there. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> of my own. The feel of Sally's clinging {{arms around my}} neck, the warm, sweet touch of her lips remained on mine.

60|$|I {{had told}} Emett to hire some {{one who could}} put the horses on grass {{in the evening and}} then find them the next morning. In {{northern}} Arizona this required more than genius. Emett secured the best trailer of the desert Navajos. Jones hated an Indian; and Jim, who carried an ounce of lead somewhere in his person, associated this painful addition to his weight with an unfriendly Apache, and swore all Indians should be dead. So between the two, Emett and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> in keeping our Navajo from illustrating the plainsman idea of a really good Indian--a dead one.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw this}} nearly empty, as I {{looked into the}} ship's pantry, and I stuffed into it all the soft {{biscuits}} it would hold. There {{was some sort of}} jam left at the bottom, so that the one who gets the last biscuit will have somethin' of a little spread on it. And now, Mrs. Lecks," [...] she continued triumphantly, as she unscrewed the top, [...] "that rubber ring has kept 'em as dry as chips.

60|$|Now it will {{be remembered}} that, on the chance of their proving useful, Ragnall, in {{addition}} to our own sporting rifles, had brought with him to Africa fifty Snider rifles with an ample supply of ammunition, the same that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> in passing through the Customs at Durban, all of which had arrived safely at the Town of the Child. Clearly our first duty {{was to make the}} best possible use of this invaluable store. To that end I asked Harût to select seventy-five of the boldest and most intelligent young men among his people, and to hand them over to me and Hans for instruction in musketry. We had only fifty rifles but I drilled seventy-five men, or fifty per cent. more, that some might be ready to replace any who fell.|$|E

Then, one evening, we came to a creek. The stream had kept the channel open here and there, and I thought the ice thin, but it was open, rocky country round about, and I saw a clump of pines in the distance where we could camp. It got dark as we followed the creek and clouds drifted over the moon, but I wanted to find shelter and pushed on. Once or twice the ice cracked ominously, but it held until we came to a spot where the stream got narrower between high, rocky banks.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right; if {{you must}} know," [...] he began; {{and it seemed to}} Madeline that there was a gladness in his {{decision}} to unburden himself. [...] "You remember all about my little ranch, and that for a while I did well raising stock? I wrote you all that. Majesty, a man makes enemies anywhere. Perhaps an Eastern man in the West can make, if not so many, certainly more bitter ones. At any rate, I made several. There was a cattleman, Ward by name--he's gone now--and he and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> over cattle. That gave me a back-set. Pat Hawe, the sheriff here, has been instrumental in hurting my business. He's not so much of a rancher, but he has influence at Santa Fe and El Paso and Douglas. I made an enemy of him. I never did anything to him. He hates Gene Stewart, and upon one occasion I spoiled a little plot of his to get Gene in his clutches. The real reason for his animosity toward me is that he loves Florence, and Florence is going to marry me." ...|$|E
