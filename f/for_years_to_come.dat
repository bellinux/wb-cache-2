5|$|About 25 {{people were}} arrested {{in the first few}} days, {{including}} 196 workers; several hundred others were arrested in the following weeks. Stanisław Hejmowski, the lawyer who defended them, was later repressed for his statement that the government's actions had led to the death of innocent civilians. The government failed in its attempts to coerce the detainees into stating that they were provoked by foreign (Western) secret services; nonetheless, this became the official line of the government <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{defeated}} in the election, Willkie had become a major figure on the public scene, and at age 48, was deemed likely to remain one <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Landon had received some 6,000 letters commiserating {{with him in his}} defeat; Willkie received over 100,000. Financially independent, he was in no hurry to decide among the many offers of employment from top law firms and major corporations. He resumed his affair with Van Doren.|$|E

5|$|In November 2014, the Czech {{air force}} {{commander}} General Libor Štefánik proposed leasing a further six Gripens due to Russia's deteriorating {{relationship with the}} West. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, this proposal is just a personal vision {{of the air force}} commander. The fleet expansion is not on the agenda <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> More recently, the air force decided to upgrade its fleet to the MS20 configuration.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Erie Railroad {{continued}} {{on with a}} new station at Harriman, which remained prosperous <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> In June 1931, James Gorney, a resident of Pine Island, allegedly attempted to rob the station and station agent. Harriman police shot Gorney in the leg, which was crippling enough that it required amputation of the leg. His lawyer, who got him off third-degree burglary charges and several acquittals, also negotiated a payment of $20,000 to Gorney from Harriman for {{the pain and suffering}} of the amputated leg, despite the attempted crime he was shot for. The jury deliberated for five hours before reaching a verdict of awarding Gorney the money.|$|E

5|$|NESCo were {{represented}} by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner. The NESCo representatives argued {{that although the}} company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, {{a great deal more}} generating capacity would need to be built to meet the demand <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> and that the mid-Durham area was the best place to erect a new station. Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme was that it would interfere with the amenities of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements had to be made, they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{travelled}} {{thousands of}} miles to arrive in India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages {{to deal with the}} Indians. At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks. After the First Anglo-Maratha war, Warren Hastings declared in 1783 that the peace established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it {{was not going to be}} shaken <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Joint Session {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact on several leading Soviet academic neuroscientists, such as Pyotr Anokhin, Aleksey Speransky, Lina Stern, Ivan Beritashvili, and Leon Orbeli. They were labeled as anti-Pavlovians, anti-materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions. In addition to losing their laboratories some of these scientists were subjected to torture in prison. The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel. The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Pseudo-science took control.|$|E

5|$|The {{speech was}} a success and Ingersoll’s {{appellation}} of “plumed knight” remained a nickname for Blaine <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> On the first ballot, no candidate received the required majority of 378, but Blaine had the most votes, with 285 and no other candidate had more than 125. There were a few vote shifts {{in the next five}} ballots, and Blaine climbed to 308 votes, with his nearest competitor at just 111. On the seventh ballot the situation shifted drastically as anti-Blaine delegates began to coalesce around Hayes; by the time the balloting ended, Blaine’s votes had risen to 351, but Hayes surpassed him at 384, a majority.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the city}} drafted a new master plan, {{also known as}} the Growth Management Guide 2000, which would {{transform}} downtown Flagstaff from a shopping and trade center into a regional center for finance, office use, and government. The city built a new city hall, library, and the Coconino County Administrative Building in the downtown district, staking an investment by the local government <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> In 1992, the city hired a new manager, Dave Wilcox, who had previously worked at revitalizing the downtown areas of Beloit, Wisconsin and Missoula, Montana. During the 1990s, the downtown area underwent a revitalization, many of the city sidewalks were repaved with decorative brick facing, and a different mix of shops and restaurants opened up {{to take advantage of the}} area's historical appeal.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 10 March 1826 {{and in the midst}} of the siege of Sacramento, Joaquim Inácio boarded a small, unarmed boat {{accompanied}} by a single army officer and passed unnoticed through a line of nineteen enemy ships under cover of darkness. He reached the main Brazilian fleet on the morning of the next day and requested assistance from Vice-Admiral Rodrigo José Ferreira Lobo, the commander-in-chief of the naval forces operating in the war. Joaquim Inácio returned to Sacramento two days later under heavy enemy fire along with three boats carrying supplies and arms. Although welcomed as a hero in the besieged town, he was passed over for a promotion. Disregard for this achievement was due to his lack of wealth and family connections, a burden which continued to thwart his career <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E

5|$|Once again, the {{official}} end of hostilities did not spell {{an end to}} fighting and Israel remained engaged in Lebanon <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> When the Syrians introduced the SA-8 Gecko into Lebanon in July 1982, IAF Phantoms were sent to hunt down four launchers on July 24 and two were claimed by 69 Squadron. Up to its very disbandment in 1994, the squadron also took part in repeated strikes against terrorist organizations operating from Lebanon. On one such operation on October 16, 1986, a bomb exploded immediately after release from Kurnass 306, forcing both crew to eject. The pilot, Yishai Aviram, was rescued by an IAF AH-1 Cobra, but navigator Ron Arad was captured {{by members of the}} Shi'a Amal Movement. Initial negotiations for an exchange of prisoners failed and Arad has been missing since and his fate remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the reason for}} developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. <b>For</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.|$|E
5|$|The {{desire for}} {{responsible}} government {{resulted in the}} abortive Rebellions of 1837. The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. The Act of Union merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849. The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This {{paved the way for}} British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858). In 1867, the same year as Canadian Confederation, Britain declined to purchase for Canada the Alaska territory that was to that point tenuously held by Russia. With the United States purchasing Alaska instead, clearly demarcated borders for Canada, although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarkation of the Alaska-Yukon and Alaska-BC border <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} manuscript offering {{clues to}} governance and military {{conflict in the}} pre-1760 Mysore, seems to be Dias , an annual letter written in Portuguese by a Mysore-based Jesuit missionary, Joachim Dias, and addressed to his Provincial superior. After the East India Company's final 1799 victory over Tipu Sultan, official Company records began to be published as well; these include , a collection of Anglo-Mysore Wars-related correspondence between the Company's officials in India and Court of Directors in London, and , the first report on the new Princely State of Mysore by its resident, Mark Wilks. Around this time, French accounts of the Anglo-Mysore wars appeared as well, and included , {{a history of the}} wars by Joseph-François Michaud, another Jesuit priest. The first attempt at including a comprehensive history of Mysore in an English language work is , an account of a survey of South India conducted at Lord Richard Wellesley's request, by Francis Buchanan, a Scottish physician and geographer. By the end of the period of British Commissionership of Mysore (1831–1881), many English language works had begun to appear on a variety of Mysore-related subjects. These included , a book of English translations of Kannada language inscriptions, and , William Digby's two volume critique of British famine policy during the Great Famine of 1876–78, which devastated Mysore <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
5|$|The rest of Constantine's 1928 {{tour was}} {{generally}} successful; {{only in the}} three Test matches, the first played by the West Indies, was he less effective. Although he took the West Indies' first wicket in Test cricket, dismissing Charlie Hallows, and finished with innings figures of four for 82, he took only one more wicket during {{the remainder of the}} series and ended with five wickets at an average of 52.40; with the bat, he scored 89 runs in six innings at 14.83. Even so, Jack Hobbs said that Constantine's opening overs to him in the first Test were among the fastest he ever faced, Constantine believed his captain, Karl Nunes, over-bowled him; the pair did not get along well. When the tour ended, Constantine had scored more runs and taken more wickets and catches in first-class games than any other tourist. He was second in the team's batting averages with 1,381 runs at 34.52, and led the bowling averages with 107 wickets at 22.95. It was the manner in which Constantine played which set him apart from the restrained form of cricket generally played in England at the time: his style, aggression and entertainment value made a big impression on the crowds. According to Peter Mason in his biography of Constantine, he established a unique style of West Indian cricket and possibly established the template for West Indian cricketers <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E
