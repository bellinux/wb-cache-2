5|$|A {{study by}} Arima et al. {{published}} in May 2011 used spatial regression modeling {{to provide the}} first statistical assessment of ILUC for the Brazilian Amazon due to soy production. Previously, the indirect impacts of soy crops were only anecdotal or analyzed through demand models at a global scale, while the study took a regional approach. The analysis showed a strong signal linking the expansion of soybean fields in settled agricultural areas at the southern and eastern rims of the Amazon basin to pasture encroachments for cattle production on the forest frontier. The results demonstrate the need to include ILUC in measuring the carbon footprint of soy crops, whether produced for biofuels or other <b>end-uses.</b>|$|E

The introduction outlines the project, stating the purpose, the limitations and assumptions, and goals and methods. The background section presents basic information pertaining to solid wastes management and planning, landfill siting and design, and <b>end-use</b> considerations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{comprehensive}} {{study was to explore}} the principal determinants of six residential indoor water <b>end-use</b> consumption categories at the household scale (i. e. namely clothes washer, shower, toilet, tap, dishwasher, and bath), and to find an overarching research design and approach for building a residential indoor water <b>end-use</b> demand forecasting model. A mixed method research design was followed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from 210 households with a total of 557 occupants located in SEQ, Australia, utilising high resolution smart water metering technology, questionnaire surveys, diaries, and household water stock inventory audits. The principal determinants, main drivers, and predictors of residential indoor water consumption for each <b>end-use</b> category were revealed, and forecasting models were developed this study. This was achieved utilising an array of statistical techniques for each of the six <b>end-use</b> consumption categories. Cluster analysis and dummy coding were used to prepare the data for analysis and modelling. Subsequently, independent t-test and independent one-way ANOVA extended into a series of bootstrapped regression models were used to explore the principal determinants of consumption. Successively, a series of Pearson's Chi-Square tests was used to reveal the main drivers of higher water consumption and to determine alternative sets of consumption predictors. Lastly, independent factorial ANOVA extended into a series of bootstrapped multiple regression models was used for the development of alternative forecasting models. Key findings showed that the usage physical characteristics and the demographic and household makeup characteristics are the most significant determinants of all six <b>end-use</b> consumption categories. Further, the appliances/fixtures physical characteristics are significant determinants of all <b>end-use</b> consumption categories except the bath <b>end-use</b> category. Moreover, the socio-demographic characteristics are significant determinants of all <b>end-use</b> consumption categories except the tap and toilet <b>end-use</b> categories. Results also demonstrated that the main drivers of higher <b>end-use</b> water consumption were households with higher frequency and/or longer <b>end-use</b> events which {{are most likely to be}} those larger family households with teenagers and children, with higher income, predominantly working occupants, and/or higher educational level. Moreover, a total of 14 forecasting model alternatives for all six <b>end-use</b> consumption categories, as well as three total indoor bottom-up forecasting model alternatives were developed in this study. All of the developed forecasting model alternatives demonstrated strong statistical power, significance of fit, met the generalisation statistical criteria, and were cross-validated utilising an independent validation data set. The paper concludes with a discussion on the most significant determinants, drivers and predictors of water <b>end-use</b> consumption, and outlines the key implications of the research to enhanced urban water planning and policy design.

40|$|Reliable {{provision}} of water, energy and transportation, all supplied through infrastructure, {{is necessary for}} the most basic human and economic development to occur. Such development however, is not enabled by specific <b>end-use</b> products (e. g. litres of water, kWh of electricity, litres of diesel and petrol), or by infrastructure itself (i. e. the systems of energy, transport, digital information, water, waste and flood protection assets), but rather through the infrastructure <b>end-use</b> services (e. g. hygiene, thermal comfort, communication, or accessibility). The present form of infrastructure operation consists of supply systems provisioning unconstrained demand of <b>end-use</b> products, with larger consumption volumes corresponding to higher economic revenue. Providing infrastructure capacity to meet unmanaged growing demand is ultimately unsustainable, both in environmental and economic terms. Past research has focused on physical infrastructure assets on the one hand, and sustainable consumption and production on the other, often neglecting infrastructure <b>end-use</b> services. An important priority for sustainable infrastructure operation is therefore to analyse the infrastructure <b>end-use</b> service demands, and the variety of end-usersâ€™ wants and behaviours. This paper outlines the key aspects of an end-user and service-centred approach to infrastructure operation. It starts with an overview of relevant research areas and literature. It then describes the infrastructure <b>end-use</b> services provided by different infrastructure streams quantitatively, with the UK domestic sector as an illustration. Subsequently, insights into infrastructure integration at the end-user level are presented. Finally, the infrastructure <b>end-use</b> service perspective is described as a holistic framework for intervention: understanding technological changes in context, acting directly on <b>end-use</b> demand, and including social implications of service-based solutions...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{application}} of an <b>end-use</b> load shape estimation technique to develop annual energy use intensities (EUIs) and hourly <b>end-use</b> load shapes (LSs) for commercial buildings in the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) service territory. The results will update inputs for the commercial sector energy and peak demand forecasting models used by PG&E and the California Energy Commission (CEC). EUIs were estimated for 11 building types, up to 10 end uses, 3 fuel types, 2 building vintages, and up to 5 climate regions. The integrated methodology consists of two major parts. The first part is the reconciliation of initial <b>end-use</b> load-shape estimates with measured whole-building load data to produce intermediate EUIs and load shapes, using LBLâ€™s <b>End-use</b> Disaggregation Algorithm, EDA. EDA is a deterministic hourly algorithm that relies on the observed characteristics of the measured hourly whole-building electricity use and disaggregates it into major <b>end-use</b> components.
