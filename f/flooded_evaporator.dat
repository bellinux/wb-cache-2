40|$|The {{popularity}} of {{ground source heat pump}} systems for both {{heating and cooling}} has grown significantly over recent years. Ground heat exchangers are usually buried in the ground either vertically in boreholes or horizontally in trenches. Antifreeze fluids in closed-loop systems are commonly used in these plants to protect them from freezing phenomena and also to reduce the total length of the ground exchangers. In fact, the use of antifreeze fluid allows the system to work below 0 °C which implies higher temperature difference between the heat-carrier fluid and the undisturbed ground, consequently the heat flux increases and the total length of the boreholes can be reduced. This study has been set out to investigate three types of layout system: two conventional heat pumps using pure water and water-glycol respectively as the secondary fluid and an innovative heat pump with a <b>flooded</b> <b>evaporator</b> using pure water. The results demonstrated that, for conventional heat pumps with dry evaporator, the use of anti-freeze additives in mild climates is convenient only in grid-shaped borehole fields with a heating-dominant thermal load. In all other cases, the use of pure water decreases the overall operating costs. In addition, <b>flooded</b> <b>evaporator</b> heat pumps using pure water as a secondary fluid on the ground loop proved to be the most cost-effective solution...|$|E
40|$|Much {{experimental}} and theoretical analysis of potential R- 22 replacements has been accomplished. However, published {{information about the}} experimental analysis of any off-the-shelf air conditioner with a potential R- 22 replacement at realistic, operating conditions is still rare. This type of work could be useful because it provides baseline data for comparing the performance of R- 22 and its potential replacement at drop-in conditions. In this study, an off-the-shelf window air conditioner was tested at Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI) -rated indoor conditions and at different ambient temperatures, including the ARI-rated outdoor condition, with R- 22 and with its potential replacement, a ternary mixture of R- 32 (30 %) /R- 125 (10 %) /R- 134 a(60 %) (the ternary mixture). A test rig was built that provided for baseline operation and for the option of operating the system with a <b>flooded</b> <b>evaporator</b> by means of liquid over-feeding (LOF). The test results indicated the cooling capacity of the ternary mixture was 7. 7 % {{less than that of}} R- 22 at 95 {degrees}F ambient for baseline operation. The cooling capacity for both refrigerants improved when a <b>flooded</b> <b>evaporator,</b> or LOF, was used. For LOF operation, the cooling capacity of the ternary mixture was only 1. 1 % less than that of R- 22.

Du Pont De Nemours and Company, Inc., (CRADA No. 92 - 0161) for testing the use of heat exchangers as the evaporator and condenser in an air-conditioning rig. Heat exchangers at typical realistic operating conditions were tested with R- 22 and with its potential replacement, a ternary mixture of R- 32 (30 %) /R- 125 (10 %) /R- 134 a(60 %). A test rig was built that provided for operation of the low-temperature exchanger (evaporator) with flooded coils. The test results indicated that the performance of the evaporator heat exchanger using ternary mixture, in terms of cooling capacity, would be around 7. 4 % less than the performance using R- 22. The cooling capacity for both refrigerants improved with <b>flooded</b> <b>evaporator</b> operation by 8. 6 % for R- 22 and by 15 % for ternary mixture. Compared with R- 22 operation, operation with ternary mixture results in slightly higher compressor discharge pressure, lower compressor discharge temperature, slightly lower compressor power consumption, and a higher compressor high-low pressure ratio. Temperature glide for ternary mixture, for both evaporator and condenser, was clearly evident, but not as pronounced as expected because of the pressure drop (and thus the temperature drop) along the coils. Further improvement of the performance of ternary mixture is possible if the evaporator is arranged in a counter-cross-flow configuration to take advantage of the temperature glide. Current evaporator designs are mostly concurrent-cross-flow, which is more appropriate for single-component refrigerants or azeotropic refrigerant mixtures...|$|E
40|$|The high ozone {{depletion}} {{and global warming}} potentials of fluorocarbon refrigerants have resulted in prohibitions and restrictions in many markets. Hydrocarbon refrigerants have low environmental impacts and are successfully used in domestic refrigerators and car air conditioners but replacing fluorocarbons in centrifugal chillers for air conditioning applications is unknown. Hydrocarbon replacements need a heat transfer correlation for refrigerant in flooded evaporators and predictions for operating conditions, capacity and performance. Safety precautions for large quantities of hydrocarbon refrigerants are needed and control of overpressure in plantrooms requires accurate prediction. Reliable correlations exist for forced convection in a single phase flow, condensation outside tubes and evaporation off sprayed tubes. For flooded evaporators this thesis proposes a new correlation for forced convection boiling of any refrigerant. An enhancement factor is combined with a modified Chen coefficient using recent pool boiling and forced convection correlations outside tubes. This correlates within typically a factor of two to known boiling literature measurements for CFC- 113, CFC- 11, HCFC- 123, HFC- 134 a and HC- 601. The operating conditions, capacity and performance of replacement hydrocarbons in centrifugal chillers were predicted using fluorocarbon performance as a model. With the new heat transfer correlation hydrocarbon predictions for flooded evaporators were made. For any fluorocarbon refrigerant there exists a replacement mixture of hydrocarbons which with a rotor speed increase about 40 % gives the same cooling capacity in the same centrifugal chiller under the same operating conditions. For example replacing HCFC- 123 in a <b>flooded</b> <b>evaporator</b> with HC- 601 / 602 [90. 4 / 9. 6] and increasing the rotor speed by 43 % will increase the coefficient of performance by 4. 5 % at the same cooling capacity. The maximum plantroom overpressure considered was from leakage and ignition of a uniform air/refrigerant mixture with maximum laminar burning velocity. Flow was modelled using a turbulence viscosity due to Launder and Spalding and turbulent deflagration using a reaction progress variable after Zimont. These partial differential equations were solved approximately for two and three dimensional geometries using finite volume methods from the Fluent program suite. Simple overpressure predictions from maximum flame area approximations agreed with Fluent results within 13. 7 % promising safe plantroom design without months of computer calculation...|$|E

40|$|Carbon Dioxide, CO 2 (R 744) {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{commonly}} applied working fluids in the infancy of refrigeration more than 100 years ago. In contrast to ammonia it mainly disappeared after the first generation of synthetic refrigerants have been introduced to the market after 1930. One reason was that the transition from low-rpm belt driven compressors towards the direct electrical motor driven compressors (50 - 60 Hz) was not performed for CO 2 compressors before the revival introduced by Gustav Lorentzen in the 90 is of last century. Since 1988 an enormous R & D effort has been made to further develop CO 2 refrigeration technology in spite of the opposition from the chemical industry. Today CO 2 refrigeration and heat pumping technologies are accepted as viable and sustainable alternatives for several applications like commercial refrigeration, transport refrigeration, vehicle air conditioning & heat pumping, domestic hot water heat pumps and industrial applications. For some applications, the current threshold to introduce R 744 technology can be overcome when the system design takes into account the advantage of the thermo dynamical- and fluid properties of CO 2. I. e. The system is designed for transcritical operation with all it pros and cons and takes into consideration how to minimize the losses, and to apply the normally lost expansion work.

40|$|Industrial {{waste heat}} often {{contains}} {{large amounts of}} useable energy that cannot be utilized in its current form, {{and has to be}} used together with a waste heating technology to become useful. With increasing energy prices and carbon taxes, efficient use of energy is increasingly important to be able to reduce the net energy consumption and the emissions of greenhouse gases. This thesis aims at finding suitable, environmentally friendly and high efficiency heat pump solutions for waste heat recovery. This is done for a case where heat is extracted from the flue gas of a natural gas boiler, and used by a heat pump to produce hot water for washing purposes. It is important to have a reliable, efficient and long lasting heat pump, that can provide the desired heat and temperature to show their potential and to further increase their market share. A review of recent literature was conducted, giving an overview of recent developments in the field. A single-stage vapor compression cycle was chosen to solve the case, and suitable components were found. Simulation models were developed to investigate the performance of the heat pump using R 600, R 600 a and R 1234 ze(Z) at different operating conditions. The results of the simulations were then used to do economic evaluations of the heat pump in regards to investment and annual costs. The costs of choosing a heat pump over a natural gas boiler were also investigated. The results from the simulations shows the importance of reducing the losses in the heat pump cycle, especially in the evaporator. By increasing the evaporation temperature, thus the area of the heat exchanger, resulted in a significantly lower pressure drop. This reduced the work input in addition to reduce the required compressor volume and condenser size. R 1234 ze(Z) achieved the highest COP equal to 3, 8 and the lowest annual cost of 325 000 NOK/year resulting in a pay-off time of 3, 3 years when compared to a natural gas boiler. R 600 achieved higher performance than R 600 a. The operational costs were the biggest contributor to the annual costs, optimizing the operating conditions for the compressor are therefore of significant importance. This is especially important when the difference in electricity and natural gas prices are large, {{to be able to be}} a competitive heating solution. Heat pumps have the potential to reduce the energy consumption in industrial heating processes and at the same time being a profitable investment, even in markets where the electricity prices are a lot higher than fossil alternatives. However, the importance of optimizing the cycle is increasingly important when the electricity prices are high. A heat pump might cost less to operate yearly than a natural gas boiler, but if the savings are minimal the additional cost might make it in an unprofitable investment. It is therefore important to do economic evaluations when considering to invest in a heat pump solution. Further work should investigate further improvements to the heat pump cycle. Such as using <b>flooded</b> <b>evaporators,</b> optimizing the suction gas heat exchanger and finding the optimal operating conditions. The required safety measures for the selected refrigerants should also be looked into and how they affect the investment costs...|$|R

40|$|In falling film {{evaporation}} process {{the heat is}} transferred from the condensing fluid to the liquid flowing over it. Falling film types of evaporators are widely used in refrigeration, desalination, petroleum refining, chemical industries, etc. Compared to <b>flooded</b> type <b>evaporators,</b> falling film evaporators need less amount of refrigerant and will give higher heat transfer rates even at lower heat fluxes. Tube geometry and tube size {{have an important role}} on the performance of the falling film evaporators. Geometry of the tube can be varied by heat transfer enhancing techniques and also by changing the shape of the tube. Thermal spray metal coating is a heat transfer enhancement technique which is done by spraying molten metal on any heat transfer surface. Vertical plate with sinusoidal corrugation is a surface enhancement technique which can be cheaper, compact and lighter for falling film evaporation compared to shell and tube configuration. This paper presents a two dimensional CFD study of water falling film evaporation on a thermal spray metal coated vertical corrugated conduits. Two-phase flow simulation is done by using a finite volume method based commercial software, with turbulence modeling which is done by k-Â two equations with shear stress transport (SST).

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{geothermal}} energy, that is, energy emitted continuously {{in the form of}} heat from our planet, that from the deepest areas propagates towards the surface. The research activities have been carried out for evaluating different aspects related to geothermal energy and more specifically the way in which this energy can be extracted. The present work has tried to deal with all the different levels of temperature in which the geothermal energy is classified, i. e. low temperature, medium temperature and high temperature, as hereafter described more in detail. Geothermal Energy low temperature: this energy is transferred by means of ground heat exchangers coupled with a heat pump. In this case usually the heat transfer fluid can be water or a mixture containing water and an antifreeze fluid. In the frame of this technology first the characteristics of a GRT (ground response test) has been tested, in order to check the accuracy of the method to evaluate the average temperature of the ground, as well as to determine the thermal conductivity of the soil and the overall coefficient of linear heat exchange between the transfer fluid and the soil. The accuracy of the GRT has been evaluated for different sizes of the grout (an usual ground heat exchanger and a pile) as well as for different velocities of the aquifer. The simulations have been carried out by means of a Finite Element Method (FEM) software. Then the FEM has been used for evaluating the energy and structural analysis on piles foundations when they are used as ground heat exchangers. The work has shown the combined effect of structural loads in heating and cooling periods. The results are in agreement to the theory as well as to results carried out by measurements which have been found in literature. Finally a study for comparing different heat pumps and different fluids in the ground heat exchangers has been carried out in mild climates. The work shows the benefits of using pure water as heat transfer fluid in almost all conditions, since in mild climates the temperature of the ground is around 14 °C and usually heat pumps are used for both heating and cooling, thus allowing the ground to be regenerated over one year. The use of <b>flooded</b> <b>evaporators</b> in the heat pumps will allow the ground heat pumps to be more attractive in the next future. Geothermal Energy medium temperature: in this case the ATES (Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage) has been investigated. ATES is a particular type of thermal storage which uses water from the subsoil where the groundwater can vary between 15 °C and 130 °C. The extraction and reinjection wells should be sufficiently distant in order to avoid short-circuits. This technology could be used also for low temperature aquifers; in this case the water of the aquifer is used for cooling the condenser during summertime, while it is cooled down in winter time to transfer heat to the evaporator. The wells are used alternatively in order to accumulate a cold storage during winter time and a warm storage during summer time. The work of the present thesis has focused on the thermal influence of the reinjection well on the undisturbed temperature conditions along the aquifer, depending on the thickness of the aquifer. Results of a FEM model have been compared to the analytical solution of various authors (Carslaw and Jaeger, Lauwerier, Ghassemi). The goal is to evaluate the distance between the two wells in order to prevent thermal interference, {{as a function of the}} thickness of the aquifer. Geothermal Energy high temperature: it allows to extract dry and superheated steam without liquid phase (in this case they are called "dominant steam systems") or liquid water mixed with steam (in this case they are called "water-dominated systems"). The usual depth of these systems is between 3 km and 15 km in correspondence of magmatic intrusions. For these systems the thesis has the aim to study the heat exchange between the rock and hot water, considering the variation of the outlet temperature of the water as a function of time. These studies were developed at first considering a single fracture in the rock, then we moving to a more realistic model consisting in a multi rock-fracture.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringSteven J. EckelsThe current {{research}} presents the experimental {{investigation of the}} effect of tube pitch on enhanced tube bundles’ performance. The typical application of this research is <b>flooded</b> refrigerant <b>evaporators.</b> Boosting evaporator’s performance through optimizing tube spacing reduces cost and energy consumption. R- 134 a with the enhanced tube Turbo BII-HP and R- 123 with Turbo BII-LP were used in this study. Three tube pitches were tested P/D 1. 167, P/D 1. 33, and P/D 1. 5. Each tube bundle includes 20 tubes (19. 05 mm outer diameter and 1 m long each) constructed in four passes. The test facility’s design allows controlling three variables, heat flux, mass flux, and inlet quality. The type of analysis used is local to one location in the bundle. This was accomplished by measuring the water temperature drop in the four passes. The water-side pressure drop is included in the data analysis. A new method called the EBHT (Enthalpy Based Heat Transfer) was introduced, which uses the water-side pressure drop in performing the heat transfer analysis. The input variables ranges are: 15 - 55 kg/m². s for mass flux, 5 - 60 kW/m² for heat flux, and 10 - 70 % for inlet quality. The effect of local heat flux, local quality, and mass flux on the local heat transfer coefficient was investigated. The comparison between the bundle performance and single tube performance was included in the results of each tube bundle. The smallest tube pitch has the lowest performance in both refrigerants, with a significantly lower performance in the case of R- 134 a. However, the two bigger tube pitches have very similar performance at low heat flux. Moreover, the largest tube pitch performance approaches that of the single tube at medium and high heat fluxes. For the R- 123 study, the smallest tube bundle experienced quick decease in performance at high qualities, exhibiting tube enhancement dry-out at certain flow rates and high qualities. The flow pattern effect was demonstrated by the dry-out phenomena. At medium and high heat fluxes, as the tube pitch increases, the performance approaches that of the single tube. All tube bundles experience quick decrease in performance at high qualities. Evidently, P/D 1. 33 is the optimum tube pitch for the studied refrigerants and enhanced tubes combinations...|$|R
40|$|Artificial ground {{freezing}} (AGF) {{is a process}} used to strengthen soil and rock by freezing trapped pore water. Freezing is accomplished by pumping calcium chloride brine, chilled to approximately – 30 ˚C in ammonia refrigeration plants, through heat exchangers drilled into the ground. A knowledge gap exists {{in the field of}} AGF regarding the relationship between the performance of the refrigeration plants and the ground heat removal process. The coupling of these two aspects of AGF requires knowledge of the plant’s refrigeration capacity as a function of many factors; the most important of which is the temperature of the brine returning from the freeze pipes. However, refrigeration plant manufacturers do not provide sufficient information about the plant’s performance as a function of brine temperature. Typically, AGF plants are only rated at one operating point due to the impracticality in experimentally rating such large plants and the lack of any standard test methods. Refrigeration system models available in the existing literature do not emulate the compressor control system responsible for preventing compressor overloading. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop a model that can predict the performance of an AGF refrigeration plant over a range of operating points, using plant specifications that are readily available in the documentation provided by the manufacturer of the plant. To fill the knowledge gap, a thermodynamic model is developed of an existing 1500 TR AGF plant at Cameco’s Cigar Lake mine. The Cigar Lake plant uses <b>flooded</b> shell-and-tube <b>evaporators,</b> two-stage economized twin screw compressors, and air cooled condensers packaged into five refrigeration modules. Each component in the system, including the evaporator, compressor, and condenser, is modeled individually, and then the individual models are combined to calculate the overall system capacity. The model emulates the behavior of the compressor’s slide valves, which are used to limit the plant capacity, limit suction pressure, control intermediate pressure, and control the discharge pressures in the system. In addition, the model accounts for the effects of the oil injection into the screw compressors, which cools the compressors and seals the spaces between the lobes of the compressor rotors. The model is validated using operating data from the Cigar Lake plant, which was collected over a period of eight months by plant operators. After calibration, the modeled plant capacities and the temperature of the brine leaving the refrigeration plant are found to be in agreement with the measured capacities and brine temperatures. The overall plant capacity results match measured capacities within ± 14 %, and the predicted brine temperatures match the measured values leaving the plant within ± 5 %. The modeled capacities match the measured capacities within the uncertainty in the measured data. The simulation of the Cigar Lake plant demonstrates that the performance of the plant is highly dependent upon the temperature of the brine returning to the plant. For example, a ± 10 % change in brine temperature causes a 22 % overall change in the capacity of the refrigeration plant. The simulation also demonstrates that, even with the plant’s air cooled condensers, changes in the ambient temperature have little effect on the performance of the plant with the existing equipment. Furthermore, the results show that the selected suction pressure of the second compression stage, or intermediate pressure, affects the performance of the refrigeration plant. These findings lead to important plant performance optimization opportunities. An optimization study using the model demonstrates that, by selecting a lower intermediate temperature than what the existing literature suggests, an improvement in overall refrigeration plant capacity of 3 % can be achieved. Additional simulations identify the brine tank, which allows for different brine flow rates to exist on the field and plant side of the tank, as an inefficient component in the system. The brine tank not only cools the brine returning from the field before it is pumped to the refrigeration modules but it allows heat to be transferred between the warm and cold brine. By eliminating the tank, plumbing all of the refrigeration modules in parallel, and installing appropriately sized evaporators, the capacity of the refrigeration plant can be increased by 17 %. Further capacity gains can be realized by upgrading the evaporators to increase their capacity...|$|R
