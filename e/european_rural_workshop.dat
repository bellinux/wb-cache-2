40|$|The {{role that}} the {{agricultural}} sector plays in rural areas has considerably {{changed in the last}} five decades, and is reflected in a major shift towards multi-dimensional, multi-sectoral land use. Existing <b>European</b> <b>rural</b> typologies are mostly one-dimensional, based on a rather coarse administrative scale data and are unable to define adequately the diversity of the regions involved. The rural typology presented in this paper has been produced as a response to a new policy need for typologies addressing the diversity in regional rurality.

40|$|Research {{in family}} {{medicine}} is a well-established entity nationally and internationally, covering {{all aspects of}} primary care including remote and isolated practices. However, due to limited capacity and resources in rural family medicine, its potential is not fully exploited yet. An idea to foster <b>European</b> <b>rural</b> primary care research by establishing a practice-based research network has been recently put forward by {{several members of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Rural</b> and Isolated Practitioners Association (EURIPA) and the European General Practice Research Network (EGPRN). Two workshops on why, and how to design a practice-based research network among rural family practices in Europe were conducted at two international meetings. This paper revisits the definition of practice-based research in family medicine, reflects on the current situation in Europe regarding the research in rural family practice, and discusses a rationale for practice-based research in rural family medicine. A SWOT analysis was used as the main tool to analyse the current situation in Europe regarding the research in rural family practice at both meetings. The key messages gained from these meetings may be employed by the Wonca Working Party on research, the International Federation of Primary Care Research Network and the EGPRN that seek to introduce a practice-based research approach. The cooperation and collaboration between EURIPA and EGPRN creates a fertile ground to discuss further the prospect of a <b>European</b> practice-based <b>rural</b> family medicine research network, and to draw on the joint experience...|$|R

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>rural</b> landscapes are {{currently}} {{going through a}} process of degradation. In some regions, degradation arises via the intensification and industrialization of agricultural practices. On others, it results from the extensification of farming or even from its abandonment. This process, which leads to environmental and cultural loss, has been raising concerns about the preservation of <b>European</b> <b>rural</b> landscapes. But, while some conservation measures have already been enacted, the preservation of <b>European</b> <b>rural</b> landscapes faces several problems. One of the main difficulties results from the lack of knowledge about the process of landscape change, as this knowledge is fundamental to control landscape evolution. Within this context, this work brings some knowledge about the evolution of rural landscapes in Interior Alentejo, a region located in southern Portugal. Interior Alentejo is currently going {{through a process of}} landscape degradation via the extensification and abandonment of farming practices. The main rural landscapes identified in the region are: forest, montado, permanent crop landscapes, and open fields. Under permanent crop landscapes are classified orchards, olive groves, vineyards, mixed farming areas and tree coplanted fields. This dissertation describes the historic evolution of Interior Alentejo rural landscape from pre-history to present times. This study reveals the emergence of each landscape type and their main changes throughout history. At the same time, it allows the identification of the main anthropogenic factors of landscape change, and corresponding rules of action. To evaluate the effect of the interaction between anthropogenic factors and the main ecological factor varying in the region (soil fertility), the landscape evolution in counties with low and high soil fertility has been studied separately. Cultural heritage, political stability, the market, policies, social structure, population density, and technology have been the main anthropogenic factors of landscape change in Interior Alentejo. Knowledge about their rules of action, i. e., about their effect on the landscape, might be used to predict landscape changes and to control the process of landscape evolution...|$|R

40|$|Structured Abstract Purpose – The study aims at {{explaining}} that sustaining rural development helps to support entrepreneurship combining {{social and economic}} business leading to design hybrid organizations. Rural resources as entrepreneurial milieu shape the entrepreneurial process. <b>European</b> <b>rural</b> development policies support the economic growth of rural areas driving new business opportunities for rural entrepreneurs creating social and economic value. Design/methodology/approach – Social entrepreneurs address new social needs in entrepreneurial ways showing a high social responsible orientation by aligning the activities that generate profit, environmental and social benefits building hybrid organizations focusing on social value creation within or outside the organization’s boundaries. The study relies on archival and qualitative data drawn by review of literature on social entrepreneurship and hybrids organizations, {{on the role of}} rural development by describing the European framework and policies promoting the sustainable development of rural areas and communities. Originality/value – Rural development policies help to revitalize rural economies and communities.
