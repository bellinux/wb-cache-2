25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s the Norwegian Armed Forces changed their travel {{procurement}} practices, shifting focus on chartering aircraft to instead buying tickets on scheduled flights. This hit Busy Bee particularly <b>hard,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{had a large}} portion of its revenue tied up with the military contracts. To compensate, Busy Bee increased its focus on European wet lease contracts, which it signed with among others NLM CityHopper, Austrian Airlines and British Midland International.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, she is {{nominated}} in various awards (Golden Horse Awards, Hong Kong Directors' Guild Awards, Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards, Hong Kong Film Awards) again from {{her role in}} 'Blind Detective' where she received critical praise for her performance as the female inspector and sidekick of the blind detective (portrayed by Andy Lau). However, she lost to the highly popular actress, Zhang Ziyi this time due to the latter's strong presence in the film 'The Grandmaster'. In Golden Horse Awards, the head of jury, famous Hollywood director Ang Lee revealed that the selection for the best actress was <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> went through few rounds and that Sammi only lost to Zhang Zhiyi by few votes in the end.|$|E
500|$|Lost {{was planned}} to be a multi-cultural show with an {{international}} cast. The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable {{to go to the}} auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience. Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called The Beast, and was keen to have him on Lost. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army. Yunjin Kim originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several films. The producers were impressed with Kim's performance and wrote her the character of Sun, who was {{planned to be}} someone who could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it. Daniel Dae Kim was cast in the role of Jin, Sun's husband. Dae Kim described his audition as a [...] "really interesting experience". He found it especially <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was his first time acting in Korean, and he had not spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.|$|E

50|$|The {{limestone}} quarried in {{the area}} was soft and easily carved when first extracted, but became <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> endured the elements, making it a long-lasting building material. The historic Hubbell House used the stone in 1856, and it was likewise used in 1865 for the Dodge County Courthouse, designed by E. Townsend Mix and now the oldest working courthouse in Minnesota.|$|R

2500|$|Series fansite Llanview Labyrinth {{remarks that}} {{although}} Gillian Spencer's Victoria is featured at the show's outset, [...] "the obviousness of Viki being the shows unquestioned 'lead' did not smack the viewer quite as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> later would ," [...] with Spencer's Victoria melding into the ensemble cast. Joanne Dorian briefly {{stepped into the}} role beginning in October 1970, with a markedly less dynamic presence on the series than her predecessor.|$|E

2500|$|The song offers {{listeners}} {{something similar}} to that of Queen's earlier hit [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] with its complex harmonies and guitar solos; however instead of mimicking an English choir, the band turned to a gospel choir. It reached #2 in the UK and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. This song made it clear to fans that [...] "Queen could swing as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could rock, by channeling the spirit of gospel music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Walter Bonatti {{called his}} {{climbing}} philosophy [...] "The pursuit with the extremely hard". He {{pulled off a}} fantastic number of audacious ascents plus more remarkably survived some horrific climbs that killed some of his associates. The underlying idea of his approach was to accept to climb the mountain <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is, with fair means and in the simplest and most aesthetic way possible. In an interview left to John Crace of The Guardian on 30 June 2010 he said: Modern equipment is so technically advanced you can climb anything if you put your mind to it. The impossible {{has been removed from}} the equation.|$|E
2500|$|As the NHL {{expanded}} in the United States and free agency rules were liberalized, operating costs and salaries grew rapidly. [...] This development hit the league's Canadian teams particularly hard. Moreover, the revised free agency rules gave players the leverage to demand being paid in U.S. dollars. [...] Until {{about the early}} 1990s, Canadian teams were able to pay most of their players in Canadian dollars, with the only exceptions being contracts acquired in trades from U.S. teams. However, since the Canadian teams still collected most of their revenue in Canadian dollars, having to pay players in U.S. dollars {{proved to be a}} serious drain on finances given the declining value of the Canadian dollar. [...] By 1996, the exchange rate was $1.40 Canadian for each American dollar. [...] Winnipeg felt the pinch especially <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had always been one of the smallest markets in the league. For most of their NHL tenure, Winnipeg was the second-smallest market, and became the smallest market after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche in 1995. [...] Despite a loyal fan following, serious doubts were raised about whether Winnipeg could support an NHL team in this new environment. [...] Additionally, their home arena, Winnipeg Arena, was an aging building with no luxury suites and seating with obstructed views.|$|E

5000|$|During an {{interview}} for her experience at the show, Aslanidou had reported that when she got the proposition she had fear of appearing on the television. She also said about teaching the contestants that <b>it's</b> partly <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it's</b> not easy <b>as</b> you have to pass experiences, values and ideals that she also got from bigger artists.
