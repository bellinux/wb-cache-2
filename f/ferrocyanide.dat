5|$|Sodium <b>ferrocyanide,</b> {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium <b>ferrocyanide</b> as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rubidium}} is {{more abundant}} in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications {{and the lack}} of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate process and the <b>ferrocyanide</b> process.|$|E
5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with hydrous sodium <b>ferrocyanide</b> as an {{anticaking}} agent which, while harmless {{in its natural}} form, can undergo photodissociation in strong sunlight to produce the extremely toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide. Although sunlight is generally not intense enough to cause this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept {{as far as possible}} from waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted runoff water entering fisheries or farms.|$|E

50|$|The company {{divested}} its tar distillation {{activities to}} Lancashire Tar Distillers in 1926 {{so as to}} concentrate on the production of cyanides and blue pigments made from <b>ferrocyanides.</b> In 1956, the company acquired C.J. Schofield Ltd.|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} used {{anticaking}} agents include the stearates of calcium and magnesium, silica and various silicates, talc, as well as flour and starch. <b>Ferrocyanides</b> are used for table salt.The following anticaking agents are listed in order by their number in the Codex Alimentarius.|$|R
5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution {{the presence of the}} sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium <b>ferrocyanide,</b> which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{stability}} of their complexation with iron, ferrocyanides (Sodium <b>ferrocyanide</b> E535, Potassium <b>ferrocyanide</b> E536, and Calcium <b>ferrocyanide</b> E538) do not decompose to lethal levels {{in the human body}} and are used in the food industry as, e.g., an anticaking agent in table salt.|$|E

50|$|Calcium cyanide is used almost {{exclusively}} in the mining industry. It serves as an inexpensive source of cyanide in many leaching or vat operation to obtain precious metals such as gold and silver from their ores. It does this by forming coordination complexes with the metals separating them from the ores.It is distributed in either solid flake form or in liquid form. Calcium cyanide's high toxicity to touch, inhale, or ingest makes it useful as a rodenticide. For example, {{it has been used}} in the management of the population of Indian crested porcupines (Hystrix indica). Its toxicity has been similarly exploited as an insecticide. However its high toxicity makes it unfavorable in many cases and oftentimes other less damaging chemicals are used instead. It is also used in the making of hydrogen cyanide, ammonium cyanide, and <b>ferrocyanides.</b>|$|R
25|$|Potassium <b>ferrocyanide</b> is used {{to achieve}} a blue color on cast bronze sculptures during the final {{finishing}} stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue. It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.|$|E
25|$|While {{very common}} in citrus fruits, such as limes, citric acid is found only in very minute {{quantities}} in wine grapes. It often has a concentration about 1/20 that of tartaric acid. The citric acid most commonly found in wine is commercially produced acid supplements derived from fermenting sucrose solutions. These inexpensive supplements {{can be used by}} winemakers in acidification to boost the wine's total acidity. It is used less frequently than tartaric and malic due to the aggressive citric flavors it can add to the wine. When citric acid is added, it is always done after primary alcohol fermentation has been completed due to the tendency of yeast to convert citric into acetic acid. In the European Union, use of citric acid for acidification is prohibited, but limited use of citric acid is permitted for removing excess iron and copper from the wine if potassium <b>ferrocyanide</b> is not available.|$|E
500|$|Prussian blue, Fe43, is {{the most}} famous of the cyanide {{complexes}} of iron. [...] Its formation {{can be used as a}} simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ as they react (respectively) with potassium ferricyanide and potassium <b>ferrocyanide</b> to form Prussian blue.|$|E
40|$|Electrically Switched Ion Exchange (ESIX) is a {{separation}} technology being developed {{as an alternative}} to conventional ion exchange for removing radionuclides from high-level waste. The ESIX technology, which combines ion exchange and electrochemistry, is geared toward producing electroactive films that are highly selective, regenerable, and long lasting. During the process, ion uptake and elution are controlled directly by modulating the potential of an ion exchange film that has been electrochemically deposited onto a high surface area electrode. This method adds little sodium to the waste stream and minimizes the secondary wastes associated with traditional ion exchange techniques. Development of the ESIX process is well underway for cesium removal using <b>ferrocyanides</b> as the electroactive films. Films having selectivity for perrhenate (a pertechnetate surrogate) over nitrate also have been deposited and tested. A case study for the KE Basin on the Hanford Site was conducted {{based on the results of}} the development testing. Engineering design baseline parameters for film deposition, film regeneration, cesium loading, and cesium elution were used for developing a conceptual system. Order of magnitude cost estimates were developed to compare with conventional ion exchange. This case study demonstrated that KE Basin wastewater could be processed continuously with minimal secondary waste and reduced associated disposal costs, as well as lower capital and labor expenditures...|$|R
2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} cyanide coordination compounds are the octahedrally coordinated compounds potassium <b>ferrocyanide</b> and the pigment Prussian blue, which are both essentially nontoxic due to the tight binding of the cyanides to a central iron atom.|$|E
2500|$|Organic {{compounds}} used as fining {{agents are}} generally animal based, a possible cause {{of concern to}} vegans. The most common organic compounds used include egg whites, casein derived from milk, gelatin and isinglass obtained from the bladders of fish. Pulverized minerals and solid materials can also be used, with bentonite clay {{being one of the}} most common, thanks to its effectiveness in absorbing proteins and some bacteria. Activated carbon from charcoal is used to remove some phenols that contribute to browning as well as some particles that produce [...] "off-odors" [...] in the wine. In a process known as blue fining, potassium <b>ferrocyanide</b> is sometimes used to remove any copper and iron particles that have entered the wine from bentonite, metal winery and vineyard equipment, or vineyard sprays such as Bordeaux mixture. Because potassium <b>ferrocyanide</b> may form hydrogen cyanide its use is highly regulated and, in many wine producing countries, illegal. Silica and kaolin are also sometimes used.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogen cyanide {{was first}} {{isolated}} from a blue pigment (Prussian blue) {{which had been}} known since 1704 but whose structure was unknown. It is now {{known to be a}} coordination polymer with a complex structure and an empirical formula of hydrated ferric <b>ferrocyanide.</b> In 1752, the French chemist Pierre Macquer made the important step of showing that Prussian blue could be converted to iron oxide plus a volatile component and that these could be used to reconstitute it. The new component was what we now know as hydrogen cyanide. Following Macquer's lead, it was first prepared from Prussian blue by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1782, and was eventually given the German name Blausäure (lit. [...] "Blue acid") because of its acidic nature in water and its derivation from Prussian blue. In English, it became known popularly as prussic acid.|$|E

5000|$|Sodium <b>ferrocyanide</b> is {{the sodium}} salt of the {{coordination}} compound of formula Fe(CN)64−. In its hydrous form, Na4Fe(CN)6·10H2O (sodium <b>ferrocyanide</b> decahydrate), it is sometimes known as yellow prussiate of soda. It is a yellow crystalline solid that is soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. The yellow color {{is the color of}} <b>ferrocyanide</b> anion. Despite the presence of the cyanide ligands, sodium <b>ferrocyanide</b> has low toxicity (acceptable daily intake 0-0.025 mg/kg body weight). The ferrocyanides are less toxic than many salts of cyanide, because they tend not to release free cyanide. However, like all <b>ferrocyanide</b> salt solutions, addition of an acid can result in the production of hydrogen cyanide gas, which is toxic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferrocyanide</b> and its {{oxidized}} product ferricyanide cannot freely {{pass through}} the plasma membrane. For this reason <b>ferrocyanide</b> {{has been used as}} a probe of extracellular electron receptor in the study of redox reactions in cells. Ferricyanide is used thus any increase in <b>ferrocyanide</b> can be attributed to secretions of reductants or transplasma membrane electron transport activity.|$|E
50|$|Experiments {{have been}} done about the {{stability}} of ferric <b>ferrocyanide</b> in the soil around manufactured gas plant sites. Ferric <b>ferrocyanide</b> is, on its own, of fairly low toxicity. In fact, {{there is evidence that}} being complexed with iron retards the mobility of the cyanide ion, which is the problematic species of this compound. This means that the mobility of cyanide is entirely dependent on the stability of iron-cyanide complexes. Below pH 4 and above pH 6, ferric <b>ferrocyanide</b> begins to dissociate in water under this reaction:Fe4Fe(CN)63(s) + 12 H2O ↔ 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 3Fe(CN)6−3(aq) + 3e− + 12H+ This dissolved <b>ferrocyanide</b> can then go through a first-order photochemical dissociation pathway if exposed to sunlight, dissociating to iron ions and <b>ferrocyanide</b> between the rates of 2.2% per hour to 40% per hour depending on the flow of the body of water. The following reactions show the dissocation of <b>ferrocyanide,</b> then the future of the iron ion:Fe(CN)63− → 6CN− + Fe3+Fe3+ + 3OH− → Fe(OH)3This leads to free cyanide ions, which are not retarded in mobility. The rate of photo-dissociation of <b>ferrocyanide</b> is given by:C(CN, t) = C(CN, 0)e0.39twhere C is concentration, (CN, t) is cyanide concentration at a specified unit of time, (CN, 0) is initial cyanide concentration, and t is time.|$|E
