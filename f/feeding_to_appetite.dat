40|$|The {{complementary}} {{feeding period}} {{is an important}} stage of child development. The study aim was to develop an index reflecting the degree of adherence to complementary feeding guidelines, evaluate its convergent validity, and explore associations with socio-demographic factors and dietary pattern scores in childhood. Data were analyzed from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n = 6065) using parent-completed dietary questionnaires at 6 mo of age, sociodemographic information, and dietary patterns derived by principal component analysis at age 3 y. The Complementary Feeding Utility Index (CFUI) consists of 14 components: breastfeeding duration, <b>feeding</b> <b>to</b> <b>appetite,</b> timing of introduction to solids, exposure to iron-rich cereals, fruit and vegetable intake, exposure to high-fat/-salt/-sugar foods including sugary drinks, food texture, and meal/snack frequency. Regression analyses were undertaken to investigate associations between index scores, socio-demographic factors, food and nutrient intakes, and dietary pattern scores at age 3 y. Milk and food intake at 6 mo and nutrient intake at 8 mo of age varied across quintiles of index score in largely the expected directions. Associations were found among index score, maternal age, education, social class, maternal smoking history, and prepregnancy BMI. After adjustment for socio-demographic factors, the index score was associated with “processed“ [b = 20. 234 (95 % CI = 20. 260, – 0. 209) ] and “healthy” [b = 0. 185 (95 % CI = 0. 155, 0. 215) ] dietary pattern scores at age 3 y. The CFUI is able to discriminate across food intake, nutrient intake, and socio-demographic factors and is associated with later dietary patterns. Rebecca K. Golley, Lisa G. Smithers, Murthy N.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this work was to investigate variation in grain yield (GY), stover yield (SY), fodder quality of stover and their association in sorghum and pearl millet. These relationships were investigated in India in 12 genotypes of sorghum and six genotypes of pearl millet grown under high fertilizer (HF) and low fertilizer (LF) application. Fodder quality of stover was assessed by digestibility and intake measurements in bulls. In sorghum, highly significant genotype-dependent variation was found for GY, SYand fodder value of stover regardless of level of fertilizer application. GYand fodder quality of stover were not inversely related and the genotype with the highest GY, for example, had also the best fodder quality in the stover. High GYand high fodder quality in sorghum stover seem to be compatible traits. In pearl millet, genotypic variation in GYand SYand quality was expressed under HF but not under LF application. No consistent significant genotypic differences were found for fodder quality measurements in pearl millet except for cell wall digestibility. Digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) when bulls were fed <b>to</b> <b>appetite</b> was considered the crucial determinant of stover quality in sorghum and pearl millet. Live weight changes in bulls estimated by DOMI varied genotype-dependently from 140 to þ 100 g per day in 300 kg bulls.

40|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} an {{addictive}} behavior, {{and is the}} primary cause of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, and cancer (among other diseases). Cigarette smoke contains thousands of components that may affect caloric intake and energy expenditure, although nicotine is the major addictive substance present, and has the best described actions. Nicotine exposure from cigarette smoke can change brain <b>feeding</b> regulation <b>to</b> reduce <b>appetite</b> via both energy homeostatic and reward mechanisms, causing a negative energy state which is characterized by reduced energy intake and increased energy expenditure that are linked to low body weight. These findings have led to the public perception that smoking is associated with weight loss. However, its effects at reducing abdominal fat mass (a predisposing factor for glucose intolerance and insulin resistance) are marginal, and its promotion of lean body mass loss in animal studies suggests a limited potential for treatment in obesity. Smoking during pregnancy puts pressure on the mother&# 039;s metabolic system and is a significant contributor to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Smoking is a predictor of future risk for respiratory dysfunction, social behavioral problems, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type- 2 diabetes. Catch-up growth is normally observed in children exposed to intrauterine smoke, which has been linked to subsequent childhood obesity. Nicotine can have a profound impact on the developing fetal brain, via its ability to rapidly and fully pass the placenta. In animal studies this has been linked with abnormal hypothalamic gene expression of appetite regulators such as downregulation of NPY and POMC in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Maternal smoking or nicotine replacement leads to unhealthy eating habits (such as junk food addiction) and other behavioral disorders in the offspring...|$|R

40|$|Early Hong Kong colonial history {{offers a}} {{distinct}} angle {{for understanding the}} exceptional circumstances in which a place was colonized by both the British and their Chinese collaborators. The term ‘collaborative colonialism’ characterizes a political‐cultural formation where descriptions of flows and trajectories of forces may be more helpful than history in illuminating the colony’s murky pasts. Full of treacheries, conspiracies, betrayals and mistrust, such pasts can also help to explain the popularity of ‘undercover’ figures in Hong Kong’s movies. At risk of losing his true identity, the undercover figure was received as a social victim in the early 1980 s’ ‘new wave’ that followed the legacy of social realism. <b>To</b> <b>feed</b> the <b>appetite</b> for gang heroism, this ‘victim’ soon transformed into a tragic hero agonized by moral anxieties. Yet the frame imposed by the police‐gangster genre did not stop it from {{being used as a}} vehicle to reflect on Hong Kong’s geo‐political situation: a place located in‐between different political projects beyond the locals’ control, and gripped by the relentless march of policed‐managerial modern order. A twist in the 1990 s gave the undercover figure a cynicist and comedic turn. Postmodern celebrations of witty betrayal can be read as rewriting the undercover story to reinscribe Hong Kong’s fate: released from narcissistic heroism, new undercover images responding to the 1997 transition took identity less as a matter of authenticity than of performance. Unravelling this historically‐embedded structure of feelings shows how the way had long been paved for the success of the award‐winning series Infernal Affairs, extending a deeper reach into the local politics of memory and time...|$|R
