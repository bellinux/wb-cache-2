500|$|While {{composing}} the song's lyrics, Martin {{could not}} find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> studio and saw Stephanie, a friend who happened to be present in the studio at that time. Martin later titled the song [...] "Yellow" [...] as a reference to Stephanie's yellow glow. The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line [...] "Look at the stars". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> tent, and, espying a whip lying near a trunk, {{picked it}} up.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> words {{seemed to}} fail him. Their little {{corner of the}} winter garden was still uninvaded.|$|E
5000|$|Busoni {{did not set}} the {{subsequent}} closing speech of Oehlenschl√§ger's fortunate hero as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> magic cave for the last time: but Dent's assertion that [...] "The actual meaning of the words hardly matters" [...] can be balanced against Aladdin's final lines: ...|$|R
60|$|When the {{stranger}} {{had finished the}} story of his adventures, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> attentive faces of the maidens.|$|R
60|$|His face darkened. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> slowly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{magnificent}} room. He saw little, {{but what}} he could distinguish was impressive.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{room with}} the light yet cheerful curiosity of the pleasure-seeker. Then he leaned over towards Julien.|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] Thacher said. [...] "You must {{certainly}} {{have an interesting}} account to give, the three of you." [...] <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Ham, let us give 'em a {{dressing}} down before we leave," [...] whispered Carl Dudder. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> dock. [...] "Nobody here but ourselves." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} the teacher has {{proceeded}} thus far, he finds, as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, that the countenances of his pupils are assuming a listless and inattentive air. One is restless in his seat, evidently paying no attention. Another has reclined his head upon his desk, lost in a reverie, and others are looking round the room, at one another, or at the door, restless and impatient, hoping the dull lecture will soon be over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I ain't forgot {{how to do}} it," [...] {{he laughed}} as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> boy, who was {{studying}} the jacket and hat with a devouring gaze.|$|R
60|$|Sack Todd pushed Tom {{toward the}} doorway of the ranch, and the youth went inside. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for <b>the</b> {{government}} official, but that individual was nowhere to be seen.|$|R
60|$|Trent woke {{from his}} day-dream into the present. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room {{and saw that}} no papers had been omitted. Then he glanced keenly into his clerk's face.|$|E
60|$|The boy, having slept well in {{the arms}} of his friend, opened his eyes and sat up. Then, as a child will, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room and saw all that it contained.|$|E
6000|$|... "He went ahead, to get {{two good}} seats for us," [...] {{answered}} Dick Rover. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> crowd that had gathered to take the train. [...] "Hi, there, Songbird, this way! Come in this car, Hans!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> before replying. <b>The</b> {{old habits}} had not deserted him.|$|R
60|$|The Professor pushed past. <b>He,</b> too, <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, {{and gazed}} at the two bodies with an {{expression}} of blank and absolute terror. Then he fell back into Craig's arms.|$|R
50|$|Alf {{decides to}} visit the Canberra war {{memorial}} with some students when he realises they do not care about ANZAC Day. As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> memorial, <b>he</b> starts to suffer flashbacks to his time in Vietnam. Later that night, the students and Alf sleep outdoors in trenches {{as part of the}} war experience. Alf continues to suffer flashbacks and wanders off by himself, before collapsing. He is taken to the hospital and diagnosed with PTSD. He initially refuses to deal with it, but eventually opens up to a therapist.|$|R
60|$|The {{man stood}} on the {{threshold}} of the room opening out from the bedroom--tall, florid, untidily dressed, with clean-shaven, humorous face, ungloved hands, and a terribly shabby hat. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room and shrugged his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> {{soldiers}} had wandered away again, {{back toward the}} exit of the building. They were standing outside, looking at the valley and the sky. A few of them were carefully climbing down the slope.|$|E
60|$|But {{all this}} had taken time, and Matt {{knew it would}} now be useless to attempt to follow Paul Carden. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner, and seeing nothing of the fellow, retraced his steps to Randolph Fenton's establishment.|$|E
60|$|Gabriel {{could only}} stare, and {{struggle}} with {{a tide of}} thick-coming remembrances. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> him; <b>the</b> sun was beating down on the old familiar objects, everything was unchanged--and yet this face, this voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{few hours}} {{more or less}} won't make much difference," [...] said Darry. <b>He</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> trapper's cabin, and was interested. [...] "Let us wait." [...] And so it was arranged.|$|R
50|$|The birds song {{merges with}} the dawn chorus which then wakes Dunbar. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> for <b>the</b> garden <b>he</b> {{saw in his}} dream but finds it gone. While half-frightened, he starts to write the poem.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{this ring}} belong to you?" [...] asked the Judge, severely, {{the jury and}} spectators craning their ears forward with an {{expectant}} smile already on their faces. But the prisoner's eyes only sparkled maliciously as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> court.|$|E
60|$|The officer {{produced}} it. Selingman {{threw it}} on the floor and spat upon it. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, in the further corner of which two men and a woman were standing upon chairs to look {{over the heads of the}} little crowd.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, when supper was over, and {{the pair}} were {{seated in the}} sitting-room before the fire, this episode was forgotten. Mrs. Rylands {{produced}} her husband's pipe and tobacco-pouch. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> formal walls and hesitated. He {{had been in the}} habit of smoking in the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|As this aged minister, {{with the}} {{beautiful}} face that God gives {{to all who}} love Him and follow His commandments, spoke of his youth, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> wistfully <b>around</b> <b>the</b> faded parlour.|$|R
6000|$|The Indian {{turned slowly}} in what I thought a most {{offensive}} manner, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> faces {{of those who}} completely encircled him, and then would have moved away, but that General Herkimer asked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} he would prefer a good home to {{traveling}} around with a cheap jewelry man," [...] was Matt's comment, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> comfortable house Mrs. Inwold occupied. [...] "I know I would." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{landing on}} which they stood, at the miserable, uncarpeted floor, the ill-painted doors on which the long-forgotten varnish stood out in blisters, the jumble of {{dilapidated}} hot-water cans, a mop, and a medley of brooms and rags all thrown down together in a corner.|$|E
60|$|As {{these various}} {{signs of life}} and {{activity}} obtruded themselves upon the skipper of the Smiling Jane, his wrath rose higher and higher as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> wet, deserted deck of his own little craft. Then he walked forward and thrust his head down the forecastle hatchway.|$|E
60|$|It was weird, unnerving. He {{could not}} forget it, even now. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> small room uneasily. What did it signify, the coming to life {{of metal and}} plastic? All at once they had found {{themselves}} inside a living creature, in its stomach, like Jonah inside the whale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Toby, {{with some}} hesitation, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> {{two or three}} empty seats that remained, [...] "I didn't {{want to get in}} anybody else's place an' I didn't know where to sit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, Bill," [...] {{said one}} of the {{passengers}} sympathizingly, [...] "we'll catch that man Wiles at Rawlings sure;" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> inchoate vigilance committee, already [...] "rounding into form" [...] about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "With pleasure," [...] the Premier agreed. [...] "I think, gentlemen," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table, [...] "that we {{need not}} detain Major Thomson any longer? We others have still a little {{business}} to finish." ...|$|R
