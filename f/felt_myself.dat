[...] "We had 16 years of blissful happiness," [...] Cameron told a {{journalist}} adding [...] "it was the kind of marriage that every day I <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> filled with wonder that I had such a person to share my life with. Every day I said a little prayer of thanks." ...|$|E

Sam was shut up... and the meeting was dissolved forthwith leaving you [...] master of the field after 4 hours battle." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 7, 1955, Anderson {{became the}} first African-American to perform with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. On that occasion, she sang the part of Ulrica in Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (opposite Zinka Milanov, then Herva Nelli, as Amelia) at the {{invitation}} of director Rudolf Bing. Anderson said later about the evening, [...] "The curtain rose on the second scene and I was there on stage, mixing the witch's brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note, I <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> tightening into a knot." [...] Although she never appeared with the company again after this production, Anderson was named a permanent member of the Metropolitan Opera company. The following year she published her autobiography, My Lord, What a Morning, which became a bestseller.|$|E

2500|$|Colt {{capitalized}} on Harney's testimony {{to produce a}} report featuring the endorsement and various statistics about the Ring Lever rifles. [...] Endorsements for Colt's Ring Lever rifles came from other sources as well, including First Sergeant P. W. Henry of Harney's second dragoons who drilled soldiers {{in the use of}} the revolving rifles. [...] Henry claimed that when [...] "passing through Indian country, I always <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> safer with one of your rifles in my hands, than if I was attended by a body of ten or fifteen men armed with the common musket or carbine." [...] In spite of the personal endorsements Colt gathered, he received no more contracts for Ring Lever rifles from the U.S. Army. [...] In 1839, however, after difficulty in selling arms to state governments, 100 Ring Lever rifles were ordered by the Texas Navy.|$|E
2500|$|... 'And yet,' I <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> {{constrained}} to say, as I {{listened to}} these strange products of a Counter-reformation psychosis working upon a late medieval art form, 'and yet {{it does not}} matter that he's all in bits. The whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order, is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order prevails even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in the broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a completely coherent work. At least you aren't lulled into a sense of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order. You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate order. So in a certain sense disintegration may have its advantages. But of course it's dangerous, horribly dangerous. Suppose you couldn't get back, out of the chaos...' ...|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E

2500|$|Although not required, Sacks {{chose to}} stay on for an {{additional}} year to undertake research, after {{he had taken a}} course by Hugh Macdonald Sinclair. Sacks recalls, [...] "I had been seduced by a series of vivid lectures on the history of medicine" [...] and nutrition, given by Sinclair. Sacks adds, [...] "And now, in Sinclair's lectures, it was the history of physiology, the ideas and personalities of physiologists, which came to life." [...] Sacks then became involved with the school's Laboratory of Human Nutrition under Sinclair. Sacks focused his research on Jamaica ginger, a toxic and commonly abused drug known to cause irreversible nerve damage. After devoting months to research, he was disappointed by the lack of help and guidance he received from Sinclair. Sacks wrote up an account of his research findings but stopped working on the subject. As a result he became depressed: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> sinking into a state of quiet but in some ways agitated despair." [...] His tutor at Queen's and his parents, seeing his lowered emotional state, suggested he extricate himself from academic studies for a period. His parents then suggested he spend the summer of 1955 living on Israeli kibbutz Ein HaShofet, where the physical labour would help him.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought I had lost my mind. This music is going to just ruin your life... it ruined your life... But it was a music that I learned from again... You wouldn't believe the people that would come to this club. They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, my ex-husband and I. And I think at the time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other. And {{it got to the point}} that we didn't know each other..." [...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E
2500|$|Gray was a keen {{student of}} medieval history, {{and in time}} came to make a {{particular}} study of the oldest Welsh poetry, though without actually learning the language. [...] Several pages of his commonplace books are devoted to notes on Welsh prosody, and he also mentioned there a legend, now considered quite unhistorical, which he had come across in Thomas Carte's A General History of England (1747–1755). [...] When Edward I conquered Wales, [...] "he is said", wrote Gray, [...] "to have hanged up all their Bards, because they encouraged the Nation to rebellion, but their works (we see), still remain, the Language (tho' decaying) still lives, {{and the art of}} their versification is known, and practised to this day among them". [...] Gray also studied early Scandinavian literature, and found in one Old Norse poem the refrain [...] "'Vindum vindum/ Vef Darradar'", which was to reappear in The Bard as [...] "Weave the warp and weave the woof". [...] In 1755 he began work on The Bard, and by August of that year had completed two thirds of the poem. [...] Initially he worked with a speed and a sense of identification that were both unusual for him. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> the Bard", he declared. [...] But composing the third and final strophe proved more difficult, and he eventually ground to a halt. [...] For two years the poem remained unfinished, but then in 1757 he attended a concert by John Parry, a blind harpist who claimed that the traditional Welsh harp repertoire went back as far as the druids. [...] Gray was so inspired by this experience that he returned to The Bard with new enthusiasm, and was soon able to tell his friend William Mason, [...] "Mr Parry, you must know, has set my Ode in motion again, and has brought it at last to a conclusion." [...] Gray sold the copyright of this poem and of his [...] "The Progress of Poesy" [...] to the publisher Robert Dodsley for 40 guineas, and Dodsley issued them together under the title Odes by Mr. Gray. [...] The book was printed by Gray's friend Horace Walpole who had just set up a printing press at his home, Strawberry Hill, and who had set his heart on inaugurating the enterprise with Gray's poems. [...] The Odes were published on 8 August 1757 as a handsome quarto, with a print run of 2000 copies priced at one shilling. [...] Walpole prevailed on Gray to add four footnotes to The Bard for the first edition, though Gray told Walpole, [...] "I do not love notes…They are signs of weakness and obscurity. [...] If a thing cannot be understood without them, it had better not be understood at all." [...] These proved, for many readers, inadequate to explain the poem, and Gray complacently wrote to Mason [...] "nobody understands me, and I am perfectly satisfied." [...] Rather against his will, he was persuaded to add a few more notes for the 1768 edition.|$|E

60|$|I {{shall never}} forget, in that moment, how {{instantly}} conscious I became of my manhood. The primitive deeps of my nature stirred.

She leaned against me, so light and lily-frail, and as her trembling eased away {{it seemed as though}} I became aware of prodigious strength.

I <b>myself</b> <b>felt</b> that one could really think of him as the ultimate conformist.|$|R
