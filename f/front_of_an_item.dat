Thirty six children were recruited, twenty of them were males and sixteen were females; most of the children were closer to 3 years of age (34 months). The way these subjects were recruited was via telephone calls and letters from birth state records that were found. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine which type of test helped increase memory retention in toddlers. There were four types of test, the door task, three boxes-stationary task, three boxes scrambled, and the three pegs task. Three of these tests were working memory tasks and one was an inhibitory/cognitive control test. The first test that was given was the door task; in this task children were asked to sit in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> or electronic device that consisted of a pathway where balls could be rolled down into different slots. A barrier was included to mislead the child and test the memory of what slot the ball went into. They were then instructed to search or point at where the hidden ball had landed. The second test was called three boxes stationary task. This test asked the participants to select a box of their choice that contained certain treats. The child kept getting distracted as the researcher pulled away the boxes and brought them back to his/her attention to choose the right box where the treat was in; along with this test the child was provided with feedback. [...] The third test was similar to the second test; the only difference was that the boxes were scrambled. The last test consisted of a three peg task, this measured inhibitory control, in this test children were asked to identify pegs. The results of this study found that the inhibitory control test was the most effective in allowing the child to remember things. The improvements were found due to an increase in attention and reaction time. Most of these tasks involved analyzing a part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex.|$|E

(1) Shelf-space {{decision}} Shelf-space {{planning is}} a mid-term task and typically executed every six months, requiring a retailer to assign shelf space and shelf quantities to listed products under {{the constraints of}} limited shelf size (Hübner and Kuhn 2012; Hübner et al. 2013; Bianchi-Aguiar et al. 2016). The results of these decisions are visualized in a planogram which displays the number of facings, display orientation and position on the shelf for every item (cf. Fig.  1). A facing is the first visible unit <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> in the <b>front</b> row <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shelf. Behind each facing, there is certain quantity of stock, i.e., additional units of the respective item. The number of facings and the stock per facing determine the total shelf quantity <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item.</b> Furthermore, items can be displayed lengthwise or crosswise (cf. Drèze et al. 1994). Particularly when single units <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> are stored in cartons, the retailer must decide on the display orientation of the respective carton. Figure  1, left, shows the difference between facings and shelf quantities. For example, <b>item</b> <b>a</b> gets 2 facings with <b>a</b> stock <b>of</b> 4 units each, resulting in <b>a</b> total quantity <b>of</b> 2 · 4 = 8 units. Item b gets 1 facing with <b>a</b> stock <b>of</b> 6 units and a total shelf quantity of 6. The right of Fig.  1 explains the difference between length- and crosswise display orientation.|$|R

40|$|There {{is nothing}} {{absolute}} in this world. However, this study could prove that vagueness is inherit {{in the nature}} of language. Vagueness exists in today's newspapers. Concerning this situation and so far there has been no thesis discussing vagueness in newspapers, the researcher could find that vagueness in newspapers is an interesting topic to be further discussed. Moreover, vagueness in newspapers can be used as an instrument to determine the quality of the newspapers. Vagueness is considered as an uncertain, unclear, or imprecise thing which is lack of specification. Moreover, vagueness should be avoided in communicating news since its existence causes misunderstanding among the readers. Driven by her curiousity to know more about vagueness in the writing of news, the researcher formulated two questions, "What kinds of vagueness are found in politics, social-affairs, and economics news in the first pages of Jawa Pos newspaper during the May- 2000 edition?, and, "How is the quality of Jawa Pos newspaper on May- 2000 in terms of writing politics, social-affairs, and economics news in the first pages viewed from the four kinds of vagueness?, as the research questions of the study. According to Kempson in Semantic Theory, there are four kinds of vagueness, namely referential vagueness, indeterminacy of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> or phrase, lack of specification in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> and the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> involves the disjunction of different interpretations. Depending on these kinds of vagueness, the researcher could find kinds <b>of</b> vagueness in <b>a</b> newspaper and judge its quality concerning its ability avoiding vagueness. In line with this case, this study analyzed the news on politics, social-affairs, and economics of the first pages of Jawa Pos newspaper during the edition of May 2000, to find the vagueness contained in the news and to judge the quality of the newspaper under study. The vagueness found was then categorized into referential vagueness, indeterminacy of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> or phrase, lack of specification in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> and the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> involves the disjunction of different interpretations. After that, the researcher count the percentage of the quality that Jawa Pos acquired. The lower the precentage is, the better the quality of Jawa Pos newspaper would be. The analysis on the news found that there were three kinds of vagueness in the news. They were indeterminacy of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> or phrase, lack of specification in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> and the meaning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> involves the disjunction of different interpretations.

On two real world datasets, we demonstrate the predictive ability of our model and its effectiveness in learning explainable user biases to provide insights towards a more reliable product quality estimation.

40|$|Abstract. A Bloom filter {{has been}} widely {{utilized}} to represent <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> <b>items</b> {{because it is a}} simple space-efficient randomized data structure. In this paper, we propose a new structure to support the representation of items with multiple attributes based on Bloom filters. The structure is composed of Parallel Bloom Filters (PBF) and a hash table to support the accurate and efficient representation and query of items. The PBF is a counter-based matrix and consists of multiple submatrixes. Each submatrix can store one attribute <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item.</b> The hash table as an auxiliary structure captures <b>a</b> verification value <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> which can reflect the inherent dependency of all attributes for the item. Because the correct query <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> with multiple attributes becomes complicated, we use a two-step verification process to ensure the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>item</b> to reduce false positive probability. ...|$|R
