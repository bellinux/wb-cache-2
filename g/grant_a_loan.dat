The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances, refused to make any loans to the king, as did foreign powers. In this extremity, in July Charles seized silver bullion worth £130,000 held in trust at the mint in the Tower of London, promising its later return at 8% interest to its owners.

2500|$|In larger transactions, {{sometimes}} {{all or part}} of these two debt types is replaced by high yield bonds. Depending {{on the size of the}} acquisition, debt as well as equity can be provided by more than one party. In larger transactions, debt is often syndicated, meaning that the bank who arranges the credit sells {{all or part of}} the debt in pieces to other banks in an attempt to diversify and hence reduce its risk. Another form of debt that is used in LBOs are seller notes (or vendor loans) in which the seller effectively uses parts of the proceeds of the sale to <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to the purchaser. Such seller notes are often employed in management buyouts or in situations with very restrictive bank financing environments. Note that in close to all cases of LBOs, the only collateralization available for the debt are the assets and cash flows of the company. The financial sponsor can treat their investment as common equity or preferred equity among other types of securities. [...] Preferred equity can pay a dividend and has payment preferences to common equity.|$|E
60|$|In {{connection}} with this matter, I will pass to the Financial clauses of the Report. When the country was annexed, the public debt amounted to 301,727 pounds. Under British rule this debt was liquidated {{to the extent of}} 150,000 pounds, but the total was brought up by a Parliamentary <b>grant,</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> from the Standard Bank, and sundries to 390,404 pounds, which represented the public debt of the Transvaal on the 31st December 1880. This was further increased by moneys advanced by the Standard Bank and English Exchequer during the war, and till the 8th August 1881, during which time the country yielded no revenue, to 457,393 pounds. To this must be added an estimated sum of 200,000 pounds for compensation charges, pension allowances, &c., and a further sum of 383,000 pounds, the cost of the successful expedition against Secocoeni, that of the unsuccessful one being left out of account, bringing up the total public debt to over a million, of which about 800,000 pounds is owing to this country.|$|E

The exact financial structuring will depend on the backer's desire to balance the risk with its return, with debt being less risky but less profitable than capital investment.|$|E

50|$|One American builder {{estimates}} that 5% of its buildings have an attached living area, {{some of which}} are small apartments. They cite several concerns about building a housebarn. Since fewer people are interested in owning a living quarters attached to the house, housebarns have a more limited marketability. This causes lending institutions to be less likely to <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan.</b> Bankers are less likely to accept housebarns as collateral. Housebarns are more costly to insure since they are treated like barns, which have a higher risk of fire. The house portion may get unwanted pests that are common in barns like mice, flies, and birds.|$|E

BR-800's sales dropped to almost nothing in 1990. In 1992, Gurgel launched a car based on Gurgel BR-800, the Gurgel Supermini. Like its similar model, the Supermini's sales were very low. Fernando Collor refused to <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> (without guarantees) of about US$80,000,000 from BNDES to Gurgel. Even so, Gurgel got two loans; both of them from state's governments. One from BEC (then bank of Brazilian state of Ceará) and other loan from Banespa - then bank of Brazilian state of São Paulo. Again, both loans didn't have any guarantee. Even with these generous loans, the Gurgel's sales remained very small. In fact they fell unstoptable between 1990 and 1993. Just about 1,500 Supermini Gurgel's cars were produced, in 1992 and 1993.(1) ...|$|E
50|$|A {{mortgage}} system {{depends on}} the effective registration of property units and rights in land. The cadastre, maintained by the National Survey and Cadastre, identifies each land parcel and property unit. The identification is used by other national information systems. The Land Registration Court handles registration of titles to land, mortgages and other charges. The mortgage banks <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> only on condition that the mortgage deed is registered, but without {{any other type of}} security. Also, a very detailed credit check isn't done on the borrower; the collateral of the loan is the property, rather than the borrower. The details of the process of setting up a mortgage loan are described in English. The Municipalities of Denmark maintain information systems, recording among others zoning, building construction details and taxable value, and the tax authorities maintain a mass appraisal system. Both latter systems are updated through compulsory abstracting of title deeds, collected through the municipalities.|$|E

Since the collateral {{values of the}} projects' tangible assets diverge, the willingness of banks to <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> depends {{not only on the}} firm's financial wealth but also on the share of FDI in total investment.

Second, country-specific macroeconomic shocks have asymmetric effects on investment depending on where the shock occurs. multinational corporations; foreign direct investment; financial constraints; investment fluctuations...|$|E

Value at Risk, being a value weighted sum of individual risks, provides a more adequate measure of monetary losses on a portfolio of loans than default risk.

Especially neural networks have in recent years received a lot of attention. However, while they are generally able to achieve a high predictive accuracy rate, the reasoning behind how they reach their decisions is not readily available, which hinders their acceptance by practitioners.

Building on earlier work on discrimination, we propose a new method to identify favors and information from classical data collected at time of promotion. Under natural assumptions, we show that promotion decisions look more random for connected candidates, due to the information channel. We obtain new identification results and show how probit models with heteroscedasticity can be used to estimate the strength of the two effects.
