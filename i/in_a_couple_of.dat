5|$|Although the {{relevant}} words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E

40|$|Summary Starting {{off from}} common {{assumptions}} {{on the relationship}} between ambiguity and the process of disambiguation with regard to the technique of underspecification, we argue that disambiugation may be viewed as non-monotonic in nature in certain cases involving anaphora resolution.

Concluding the paper, we also discuss some consequences of our proposal for formal discourse semantics in general. ...|$|R
