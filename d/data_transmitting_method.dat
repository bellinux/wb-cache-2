40|$|Secure data {{transmission}} network is a decisive issue for wireless technology networks (WTNs). Clustering {{is an effective}} and practical way to enhance the system performance & methods of WTNs. In this respective paper, we study a secure <b>data</b> <b>transmitted</b> for cluster-based <b>method</b> of WTNs (CWTNs), where the clusters are formed dynamically and periodically. We propose two Secure and Efficient data Transmission (SET) protocols for CWTNs, called SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS, by using the Identity-Based digital Signature (IBS) scheme and the Identity-Based Online/Offline digital Signature (IBOOS) scheme, respectively. In SET-IBS, security relies on the hardness of the Diffie-Hellman problem in the pairing domain. SET-IBOOS further reduces the computational overhead for protocol security, which is crucial for WTNs, while its security relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. We show the feasibility of the SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS protocols {{with respect to the}} security requirements and security analysis against various attacks. The results show that, the proposed protocols have better performance than the existing secure protocols for CWTNs, in terms of security performance overhead and energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|Template {{matching}} {{has been}} shown to outperform the H. 264 prediction modes for Intra video coding thanks to better spatial prediction and no additional ancillary <b>data</b> to <b>transmit.</b> The <b>method</b> indeed works well when the template and the block to be predicted are highly correlated, e. g., in homogenous image areas, however, it obviously fails in areas with non homogeneous textures. This paper explores the idea of using a block-matching intra prediction algorithm which, thanks to a Rate-Distorsion (RD) based decision mechanism, will naturally be used in image areas when template matching (TM) fails. This new method offers a significant coding gain compared to H. 264 Intra prediction modes and the template matching based prediction. Indeed, the TM-based algorithm and the proposed hybrid algorithm lead, with the Bjontergaard measure, to rate gains of up to respectively 38. 02 % and 48. 38 % at low bitrates when compared with H. 264 Intra only...|$|R
