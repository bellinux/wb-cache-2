25|$|The {{story of}} the exodus is the {{founding}} myth of Israel, telling how the Israelites were delivered from slavery by Yahweh and therefore belong to him through the Mosaic covenant. The Book of Exodus is not a historical narrative in any modern sense: modern history writing requires the critical evaluation of sources, and does not accept God {{as a cause of}} events, but in Exodus, everything is presented as the work of God, who appears frequently in person, and the historical setting is only very hazily sketched. The purpose of the book is not to record what really happened, but to reflect the <b>historical</b> <b>experience</b> of the exile community in Babylon and later Jerusalem, facing foreign captivity and the need {{to come to terms with}} their understanding of God.|$|E
40|$|This book explores rhythmanalysis as a {{philosophy}} {{and as a}} research method {{for the study of}} cultural <b>historical</b> <b>experiences.</b> It formulates 'rhythm' as a critical concept which is defined in dialogic relationships to intellectual traditions, yet introducing unique philosophical positions that serve to re-think ways of conceiving and addressing cultural political issues. Engaging with the notion of 'conjunctural shift', which for Stuart Hall captures the ruptured social landscape of Britain in the 1970 s, the book then puts the method of rhythmanalysis to work by testifying the changing cultural experiences in rhythmic terms. This particular rhythmanalytical project instantiates while opening up ways of using rhythmanalysis for exploring cultural <b>historical</b> <b>experiences...</b>|$|R

In a survey conducted in 1994, most Polish unionists, in both the Solidarity and OPZZ main unions, saw their proper role as promoters and facilitators of the market reform and privatization processes, not in protecting themselves from the shock therapy effects. Such attitude, conditioned [...] by their <b>historical</b> <b>experience</b> and current government propaganda, rendered the workers unable to defend their class interests under the new system.|$|E
500|$|The Ministers {{are fully}} aware of the need to fight {{actively}} against terrorism. As regards the regulation of the possession of firearms, it is necessary to focus the adopted measures primarily on illegal firearms, not legally-held firearms. Illegal firearms represent a serious threat. Within the European Union, it is necessary to prevent infiltration of illegal firearms from the risk areas. It should be taken into account that bans on possession of certain types of firearms that are not, in fact, abused for terrorist acts can lead to negative consequences, especially to a transition of these firearms into the illegal sphere. The V4 states have profound <b>historical</b> <b>experience</b> with such implications.|$|E
500|$|Historian Frank Bongiorno {{described}} Hirst as a [...] "creative historian {{capable of}} engaging a wide audience, {{as well as}} a public intellectual who delighted, infuriated and provoked". He contributed many influential opinion pieces and commentaries to leading Australian newspapers and journals. Jeremy Sammut has noted that Hirst was motivated by an independent mind and a distaste for unthinking conformity. He [...] "defied simplistic categorisation as a partisan because his politics were idiosyncratic". Hirst described himself as an old-fashioned social democrat. To read Hirst is not to encounter a reactionary but [...] "to be delighted as he marshals facts, logic and evidence with unarguable skill and precision to establish the heterodox case, while conveying powerful insights into whatever <b>historical</b> <b>experience</b> or process is discussed". A common theme in the obituaries cited is that Hirst was fearlessly honest, whatever the subject. As Sammut has noted, he was inspired by a commitment to [...] "the rigorous pursuit of historical truth that drove him to explore the deeper patterns and meanings of the past, and the contemporary implications, that others had missed or misled us about".|$|E

Secondly, I shall hone in on a specific area within higher education – the <b>historical</b> <b>experiences</b> of women academics within faculties of theology in {{institutions of higher education}} in South Africa. I shall argue that their experiences constitute a dynamic narrative that challenges conventional understandings of the “breeding ground” of race, class and gender discrimination in South African institutions of higher education.
