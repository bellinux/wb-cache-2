25|$|Hydrocyclones {{are useful}} for the {{greatest}} range of oil droplet sizes operating from less than 10 microns and up and can operate continuously without water pre-treatment and at any temperature and pH. Applications where hydrocyclones are found are in industry where oily water sources arise in workshops, vehicle wash bays, transport <b>hubs,</b> fuel <b>depots</b> and aluminium billet processing. Animal fats from meat processing and dairy manufacturing can also be removed without the need of chemical treatment that often is required for dissolved air flotation (DAF) systems.|$|R

40|$|Scheduling the {{deliveries}} from {{a regional}} distribution centre (RDC) to large stores {{of a major}} fmcg retailer includes every possible vehicle routing complexity. Usual constraints, like {{the size of the}} vehicle and the length of the driving day, apply. More importantly, loading feasibility is a major factor, with frozen goods being at the front, produce and perishable products in the middle, and groceries at the tail of the rear end loading vehicle. Moreover, these three product types have different time windows, determined store by store. Items like medium movers and alcoholic drinks may only be stocked at particular <b>hub</b> <b>depots,</b> from where they must be collected and then delivered to the retail outlets. Collections of salvage are made from the stores and goods from suppliers are backhauled to a RDC, which may not be the vehicle's base. Then there may be trunking between RDCs. In this case study, deliveries and collections by vehicles at a RDC are presently scheduled by updating daily a basic plan prepared every six months, using the skills of an experienced distribution professional. A simulated annealing based algorithm has been developed to speed up the process by circumventing the need for the skeletal schedule. In the application tested, the solution produced by the algorithm requires the same number of vehicles as actually used, though the total delivery time is slightly longer. Further improvements, particularly in the quality of the initial solution, may be possible by exploiting the problem structure in recognisable ways...|$|R
50|$|In April 2004, a {{new home}} {{delivery}} service, Deliver2Home, was launched adding to the one man home and white glove two man Pacemaker delivery services. The company over time developed a niche in delivering irregular dimension and weight, or IDW, freight and soon became the market leader within that specific segment. Nightfreight operated a fleet of over 1000 vehicles and employed over 2,500 people, spanning across three <b>hubs</b> and 52 <b>depots</b> around the United Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|On June 28, 1861, {{the three}} newly created three-year regiments began {{the journey to}} Virginia, where in June they were joined with a brigade of three-month {{enlistment}} New Jersey Militia regiments to form a division commanded by Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon. This {{was the first time}} the New Jersey regiments officially formed the brigade. During the First Bull Run Campaign, most of the brigade saw service in the field guarding train <b>hubs,</b> supply <b>depots</b> and roadways, being considered too [...] "green" [...] to be reliable in combat. However, a few companies of the 1st and 2nd New Jersey Infantries were directed to help stem the retreat at Centreville, Virginia, after the Confederates routed General Irvin McDowell's forces at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. They were unsuccessful, and many officers and men retreated in the route as well.|$|R

30|$|Variant {{model of}} VRP {{obtained}} by generalization {{of the classical}} VRP (Cordeau et al. 2007). An extension of VRP is MDVRP that is studied in this paper. MDVRP deals with routing of several vehicles from different depots. Mathematical programming models of the MDVRP have been developed by several researches. Crevier et al. (2007) presented {{an extension of the}} MDVRP that vehicles may use the intermediate depots along their route to become full. Ray et al. (2014) worked out a new integer linear programming model, called multi-depot split-delivery vehicle routing problem (MDSDVRP) which allows establishing depot locations and routes for serving the customer demands within the same objective function. Aras et al. (2011) proposed two mixed-integer linear programming formulations for the selective MDVRP that are extensions of the classical MDVRP in which each visit to a broker is associated with a gross profit and a purchase price to be paid to take the cores back. Wasner and Zapfel (2004) investigated the necessity of developing a VRP with considering the number and locations of <b>hubs</b> and <b>depots</b> and their assigned service areas. Karakati and Podgorelec (2014) optimized an extension of the classical VRP by adding multiple depots. Kang et al. (2000) designed a least costly schedule for MDVRP to minimize transportation costs.|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} {{event in the}} development of Tacony was the acquisition of land there in 1846 for a ferry-wharf by the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad, which had first laid tracks through the town in 1834, along the route from its depot at modern Frankford Avenue and Montgomery Avenue, Kensington, to Trenton, New Jersey. Banned from traversing the District of Kensington southbound to connect with other rail lines, the Philadelphia and Trenton built Tacony Depot, an important early transportation <b>hub.</b> The <b>depot</b> and the community which grew around it was, for a short time, called Buena Vista, named for the recent Mexican War victory. A waterfront mansion on the property was converted to the Washington House Hotel at the foot of what would become Disston Street. Through passengers traveling from New York de-trained at Tacony and took a steamboat to Walnut Street, where they could connect with stagecoaches and other rail lines. North-bound passengers did the reverse. Steamboats and steam ferries stopped at Tacony several times a day for over eight decades. The railroad's Kensington Depot continued to be used for freight and some passenger traffic, but the steamboat transfer continued until 1867, when the Connecting Railway opened from Frankford Junction to Mantua, near the Philadelphia Zoo, enabling a connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad.|$|R
40|$|We study {{a problem}} of {{tactical}} planning in a divergent supply chain. It involves decisions regarding production, inventory, internal transportation, sales and distribution to customers. The problem is motivated by {{the context of a}} company in the speciality oils industry. The overall objective at tactical level is to maximize contribution and, in order to achieve this, the planning has been divided into two separate problems. The first problem concerns sales where the final sales and distribution planning is decentralized to individual sellers. The second problem concerns production, transportation and inventory planning through refineries, <b>hubs</b> and <b>depots</b> and is managed centrally with the aim of minimizing costs. Due to this decoupling, the solution of the two problems needs to be coordinated in order to achieve the overall objective. In the company, this is pursued through an internal price system aiming at giving the sellers the incentives needed to align their decisions with the overall objective. We propose and discuss linear programming models for the decoupled and integrated planning problems. We present numerical examples to illustrate potential effects of integration and coordination and discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the integrated over the decoupled approach. While the total contribution is higher in the integrated approach, it has also been found that the sellers' contribution can be considerably lower. Therefore, we also suggest contribution sharing rules to achieve that both the company and sellers get a better outcome under the integrated planning...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the global}} Great Depression enveloped Europe, Le Corbusier devoted {{more and more}} time to his ideas for urban design and planned cities. He {{believed}} that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise {{the quality of life for}} the working classes. In 1922 he had presented his model of the Ville Contemporaine, a city of three million inhabitants, at the Salon d'Automne in Paris. His plan featured tall office towers with surrounded by lower residential blocks in a park setting. He reported that [...] "analysis leads to such dimensions, to such a new scale, and to such the creation of an urban organism so different from those that exist, that it that the mind can hardly imagine it." [...] The Ville Contemporaine, presenting an imaginary city in an imaginary location, did not attract the attention that Le Corbusier wanted. For his next proposal, the Plan Voisin (1925), he took a much more provocative approach; he proposed to demolish a large part of central Paris and to replace it with a group of sixty-story cruciform office towers surrounded by parkland. This idea shocked most viewers, as it was certainly intended to do. The plan included a multi-level transportation <b>hub</b> that included <b>depots</b> for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and created an elaborate road network. Groups of lower-rise zigzag apartment blocks, set back from the street, were interspersed among the office towers. Le Corbusier wrote: [...] "The center of Paris, currently threatened with death, threatened by exodus, is in reality a diamond mine...To abandon the center of Paris to its fate is to desert in face of the enemy." ...|$|R
