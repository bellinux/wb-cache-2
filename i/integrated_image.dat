40|$|STUDY DESIGN: A {{retrospective}} study of 78 patients with right thoracic idiopathic scoliosis was done. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate {{the reliability of}} the <b>integrated</b> Shape <b>Imaging</b> System scan (Oxford Metrics Ltd, Oxford, UK) in detecting progression of scoliosis and the use of back shape data in predicting scoliosis progression. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: At first presentation and every 3 - 6 months during the follow-up period, all patients underwent <b>integrated</b> Shape <b>Imaging</b> System scans and radiographic examinations, from which the Cobb angle was measured. The follow-up period was 18 - 49 months (mean = 31. 4 months). METHODS: Patients were divided into three groups according to the severity and progression of the Cobb angle. The spinal fusion, brace, and observation groups were compared using analysis of variance and the student's t test to detect significant differences among groups in the progression of deformity as measured by the <b>integrated</b> Shape <b>Imaging</b> System parameters and the Cobb angle. RESULTS: Three of the <b>Integrated</b> Shape <b>Imaging</b> System parameters detected significant progression in the spinal fusion group 1 year earlier than the Cobb angle. Only one of the <b>Integrated</b> Shape <b>Imaging</b> System parameters detected a significant difference in progression between the brace and observation groups. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>Integrated</b> Shape <b>Imaging</b> System technique demonstrated significant changes in this group of patients with progressive scoliosis. Serial measurements of back surface shape, particularly the size of the rib hump, may be predictive of progression. Serial <b>Integrated</b> Shape <b>Imaging</b> System scanning has advantages over serial radiography in the management of idiopathic scoliosis in addition to the avoidance of exposure to ionizing radiation...|$|R

The results of the experiment indicate that the system could do as well as human subjects in accomplishing the tasks of similarity analysis and image categorization.

50|$|In 1908, Lippmann {{introduced}} integral photography, {{in which}} a plane array of closely spaced small lenses is used to photograph a scene, recording images of the scene as it appears from many slightly different horizontal and vertical locations. When the resulting images are rectified and viewed through a similar array of lenses, a single <b>integrated</b> <b>image,</b> composed of small portions of all the images, is seen by each eye. The position of the eye determines which parts of the small images it sees. The effect is that the visual geometry of the original scene is reconstructed, so that {{the limits of the}} array seem to be the edges of a window through which the scene appears life-size and in three dimensions, realistically exhibiting parallax and perspective shift with any change in the position of the observer. This principle of using numerous lenses or imaging apertures to record what was later termed a light field underlies the evolving technology of light-field cameras and microscopes.|$|E
50|$|Deaconâs early 1990âs output {{focused on}} the visual and the physical, {{with a series of}} {{performances}} exploring object manipulation and personification. Later work began questioning the spatial limitations and social conventions imposed on performance with a series of interventions in public and televisual spaces, including an impromptu interrogation of former UK Home Secretary Michael Howard on the Channel 5 show, The Wright Stuff. The late 1990s saw a series of performances that explored issues of racial politics, and notions and definitions of obscenity produced in collaboration with performance artist and film actor Laurence R. Harvey. From the early 2000s, he began producing a series of works that used spoken word and lecture based presentation, such as Harry and Me (2004). This performance lecture described Deaconâs search for television footage of himself as a member of his school choir on an edition of Harry Secombeâs religious program Highway. The performance interrogates media representations of multiculturalism, pursuing the narrative that he was planted in the choir to provide a more racially <b>integrated</b> <b>image.</b> Deacon also become known for his works in political biography, with a series of performances on the lives of former US Secretary of State Colin Powell (2004-08) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (2005). Both these performances were characterized by a humorous and often satirical approach to the subject matter. These works also had a strong multimedia element and were often rewritten in response to prevailing news events regarding their subjects. Deacon's later performance piece Prototypes (2006-09) stylistically referenced the output of documentary films produced by the British Transport Commission. Between 2011 and 2013, two new lecture based performances (The Argument Against the Body and White Balance: A History of Video) were presented in their early form. Following a development award from Franklin Furnace Inc. and a three day in progress presentation of the work at the Emily Harvey Gallery, NYC, a final version of White Balance was presented as part of the Conversations at the Edge series at the Gene Siskel Theater in Chicago (2015), and at the Spill Festival at the Barbican Centre, London (2015).|$|E
