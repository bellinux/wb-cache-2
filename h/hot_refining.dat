40|$|AbstractThe role of {{anthraquinone}} (AQ) greatly {{depends on}} the nature of the cellulosic pulp during alkali refining. AQ acts in two ways; firstly penetration within the molecular chains separating them further apart leading to their decrystallisation; secondly stabilization of the polysaccharide chains. Cotton linter is known by its long macromolecular crystalline chains. The cold refining helps the swelling cotton linter and the penetration of AQ leads to decrystallisation of linter even at low AQ concentration (namely 0. 025 %). In comparison with paper Kraft pulp AQ does not reflect a considerable change on its characteristics, except on <b>hot</b> <b>refining</b> using higher AQ concentration (namely 0. 2 %). This is due to the nature opening structure of the paper Kraft pulp in addition to the hemicellulose content which preferentially stabilized by AQ giving a reasonable increase in the pentosan content. This is associated by improving in the reactivity towards xanthation...|$|E
40|$|A {{process for}} the {{preparation}} of a wholesome smoked and canned product from dhoma (Sciaenid sp.) is discussed. The dressed dhoma is cold blanched in 15 % brine containing 0. 5 % potash alum and 0. 2 % citric acid and smoked for 120 minutes at 45 ± 5 °C. The smoked fish after filling in cans is precooked at 0. 35 kg/sq. cm steam pressure for 50 minutes in inverted position, filled with <b>hot</b> <b>refined</b> groundnut oil, sealed and processed for 60 minutes at 0. 7 kg/sq. cm steam pressure...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{hot forging}} as an {{alternative}} thermo-mechanical treatment to refine a quasicrystalline reinforced Mg-Zn-Y cast alloy has been explored. <b>Hot</b> forging <b>refines</b> the grain size of the cast Mg-Zn-Y alloy and induces a strong texture with the basal planes perpendicular to the forging direction. However, forging is not effective to distribute the I-phase homogeneously through the magnesium matrix. At low temperature, grain refinement is the main strengthening mechanism and contributes to increasing the mechanical strength of the forged-Mg-Zn-Y alloy. Furthermore, the basal texture affords an additional strengthening contribution whose magnitude depends only on the texture intensity. © 2008. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
30|$|In {{the light}} of {{increasingly}} serious air pollution caused {{by the use of}} fossil fuel, sulfur in fuels, especially gasoline and diesel, has been a <b>hot</b> issue of <b>refining</b> industry for several years. Many countries have set the content of total sulfur in gasoline and diesel to lower than 10  μg g− 1 in their regulations [1]. It means that the technique of ultra-deep desulfurization of oil must be updated to make fuels meet rigorous standards.|$|R
40|$|Steel is the world’s most {{important}} material. Steel production requires iron, steel scrap and flux. Iron production requires: iron ore, coal and limestone, dolomite. The iron ore is smelted {{to produce an}} impure metal called “hot metal” when liquid, or “pig iron” when solid. The <b>hot</b> metal is <b>refined</b> to remove impurities and to develop the desired composition. The liquid steel is continuously cast into semi-finished products which are processed into the desired shapes by rolling or forging. Iron {{is one of the}} most used metals, accounting 95 % of world steel production. After oxygen, silicon and aluminium, iron is the fourth most plentiful element in Earth’s crust.

40|$|Red mud is a toxic {{by-product}} {{from the}} <b>hot,</b> caustic <b>refining</b> of bauxite to produce alumina, and {{is produced in}} the form of an aqueous slurry. It is typically thickened, and transported to a surface storage facility. The volume of red mud generated worldwide is increasing dramatically, leading to a massive amount of red mud to be stored annually. In order to alleviate the ongoing demand for the storage of red mud, means by which it may be used in civil engineering construction and manufacturing are being investigated. Its suitability for use demands that it 2 ̆ 7 s geotechnical and geochemical behaviour and parameters be better understood. The geotechnical characterisation of the red mud sample involved the determination of its as­supplied moisture content, specific gravity, particle size distribution, and Atterberg limits. The geochemical characterisation of the red mud sample involved the determination of its paste electrical conductivity, pH, chemistry and mineralogy, which also influence its mechanical behaviour and responses to external loading. The critical geotechnical parameters of red mud, such as compaction, shear strength, compressibility and permeability, also need to be determined, as a function of its moisture state. This paper describes the results of a series of geotechnical and geochemical characterisation and geotechnical parameter testing of a red mud sample to determine its applicability and potential uses in civil engineering construction and manufacturing applications...|$|R
40|$|Background: Globally, <b>hot</b> cooked <b>refined</b> rice is {{consumed}} {{in large quantities}} and is {{a major contributor to}} dietary glycaemic load. This study aimed to compare the glycaemic potency of hot- and cold-stored parboiled rice to widely available medium-grain white rice. Method: Twenty-eight healthy volunteers participated in a three-treatment experiment where postprandial blood glucose was measured over 120 min after consumption of 140 g of rice. The three rice samples were freshly cooked medium-grain white rice, freshly cooked parboiled rice, and parboiled rice stored overnight at 4 °C. All rice was served warm at 65 °C. Chewing time was recorded. Results: incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of the control rice, freshly cooked medium-grain white rice, was the highest: 1. 7 -fold higher (1. 2, 2. 6) than reheated parboiled rice (p < 0. 001) and 1. 5 -fold higher (1. 0, 2. 2) than freshly cooked parboiled rice (p = 0. 001). No significant difference in postprandial glycaemic response was observed between freshly cooked and reheated parboiled rice samples (p = 0. 445). Chewing time for 10 g cold-stored parboiled rice was 6 s (25 %) longer and was considered more palatable, visually appealing and better tasting than freshly cooked medium-grain (all p < 0. 05). Conclusions: For regular consumers of rice, reheating cooked rice after cold storage would lower the dietary glycaemic load and, in the long term, may reduce the risk for type 2 and gestational diabetes. More trials are needed to identify the significance...|$|R
40|$|We {{determine}} the sizes and albedos of 20 classical Kuiper belt objects. Our observations with the PACS instrument on-board Herschel Space Observatory cover the wavelength range where the thermal emission from trans-Neptunian objects has its maximum. We use a consistent method for data reduction and aperture photometry of this sample, and determine sizes and albedos using thermophysical models. We compare {{the results to}} previous ground- and spacebased estimates. Our new results confirm the recent findings that there are very diverse albedos among the classical KBOs, which has important implications to their global properties, such as size distribution and the total mass of the belt. An increased average albedo would mean a decreased total mass of these targets. Almost all of the 20 targets have higher albedos than assumed. There are variations between the different groups within our sample: the cold classicals together with the two inner hot classicals have higher albedos than the <b>hot</b> classicals. Our <b>refined</b> sizes and albedos make {{an important contribution to}} the estimates of the fundamental properties of these objects...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the California Line Source for Queuing & <b>Hot</b> Spot Calculations <b>Refined</b> (CAL 3 QHCR) {{model was}} used to assess the {{contribution}} of particulate matter (PM) from vehicular exhausts to the air quality of a specific site in downtown Belo Horizonte. Meteorological, traffic, signalization, and vehicular emissions data were collected and analyzed according to the CAL 3 QHCR model’s requirements. Due to the absence of PM emission factors for the Belo Horizonte region, it was opted to use previously established factors for vehicles as measured in the São Paulo metropolitan area. Concentration results obtained through simulations were compared to PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentration experimental data, which consisted of samples collected from an air quality monitoring station located in the micro-region selected for this research. For all scenarios considered, concentration values predicted by the model were lower than experimental concentrations. The sensitivity analysis showed that the vehicular emissions factor influenced simulation results more than other input parameters. Thus more research in the area would be indispensable for obtaining specific emission factors for the region without discarding the possibility of establishing a vehicle inspection program through random sampling in Belo Horizonte...|$|R
