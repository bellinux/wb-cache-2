There are many methods to simulate hysteresis effects. However most studies only focus on loss calculation {{but not on}} other important issues. Based on field orientation interpolation method, four-quadrant hysteresis effects are taken into consideration in the proposed cogging torque computation. Simulation results using finite element analysis (FEA) show that laminated materials with high hysteresis effects give higher <b>detent</b> <b>torque</b> when compared to those with narrow hysteresis loops. Two brushed type PMDC motors, with a 4 -pole, 22 -slot configuration and with different laminated steel materials, are built, and their test data are used to validate the analysis.

50|$|Cogging torque of {{electrical}} motors is the torque {{due to the}} interaction between the permanent magnets of the rotor and the stator slots of a Permanent Magnet (PM) machine. It is also known as <b>detent</b> or 'no-current' <b>torque.</b> This torque is position dependent and its periodicity per revolution depends on the number of magnetic poles and the number of teeth on the stator. Cogging torque is an undesirable component for the operation of such a motor. It is especially prominent at lower speeds, with the symptom of jerkiness. Cogging torque results in torque as well as speed ripple; however, at high speed the motor moment of inertia filters out the effect of cogging torque.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} model is proposed {{to analyze and}} predict {{the characteristics of a}} double stator linear and rotary permanent magnet machine (DSLRPMM). In order to simplify the magnetic field calculation, the DSLRPMM is cut along the axial direction (z direction) and transferred into a planar one. Hence, {{an analytical}} model of the machine considered the orthogonal effect (OE) is proposed based on the combined solution of Maxwell’s equation, conformal mapping, and equivalent magnetic circuit model (EMCM). The magnetic field distributions of the DSLRPMM are calculated with and without considering the OE, and some important electromagnetic parameters, including the back electromotive force (EMF), <b>detent</b> force, cogging <b>torque,</b> and output torque and thrust, are also predicted and compared to the 3 D finite element analysis (FEA). The results show that the errors between the proposed analytical model and the 3 D FEA results are less than 0. 2 % and even less than 0. 1 % for certain parameters, that is, the results obtained from the proposed analytical model agree well with that of the FEA. Moreover, the analyzed and predicted results are also verified by the experimental results on the prototype of the DSLRPMM...|$|R
40|$|Stepper motors {{are widely}} used on most {{spacecraft}} mechanisms requiring repeatable and reliable performance. The unique <b>detent</b> <b>torque</b> characteristics of these type of motors makes them behave differently when subjected to low duty cycle excitations where the applied driving pulses are only energized {{for a fraction of}} the pulse duration. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in discrete permanent magnet stepper motors used in the space industry. While the inherent high detent properties of discrete permanent magnets provide desirable unpowered holding performance characteristics, it results in unique behavior especially in low duty cycles. Notably, the running torque reduces quickly to the unpowered holding torque when the duty cycle is reduced. The space industry's accepted methodology of calculating the Motorization Ratio (or Torque Margin) is more applicable to systems where the power is continuously applied to the motor coils like brushless DC motors where the cogging torques are low enough not to affect the linear performance of the motors as a function of applied current. This paper summarizes the theoretical and experimental studies performed on a number of space qualified motors under different pulse rates and duty cycles. It is the intention of this paper to introduce a new approach to calculate the Motorization Ratios for discrete permanent magnet steppers under all full and partial duty cycle regimes. The recommended approach defines two distinct relationships to calculate the Motorization Ratio for 100 percent duty cycle and partial duty cycle, when the motor detent (unpowered holding torque) is the main contributor to holding position. These two computations reflect accurately the stepper motor physical behavior {{as a function of the}} command phase (ON versus OFF times of the pulses), pointing out how the torque contributors combine. Important points highlighted under this study are the torque margin computations, in particular for well characterized mechanisms. The rationale at CDR level versus TRR/TRB level will be discussed, aiming at avoiding too much conservatism for units that have extensive test and in flight heritage. A critical topic is related to the magnetic losses and how to sort out such phenomena as a function of the motor type being used. For instance, <b>detent</b> <b>torque</b> is a major contributor that has no reason to evolve during life and is not an uncontrolled torque loss...|$|E
40|$|A DC motor's {{performance}} is usually {{characterized by a}} series of tests, which are conducted by pass/fail criteria. In most cases, these tests are adequate to address the performance characteristics under environmental and loading effects with some uncertainties and decent power/torque margins. However, if the motor performance requirement is very stringent, {{a better understanding of the}} motor characteristics is required. The purpose of this paper is to establish a standard way to extract the torque components of the brushless motor and gear box characteristics of a high gear ratio geared motor from the composite geared motor testing and motor parameter measurement. These torque components include motor magnetic <b>detent</b> <b>torque,</b> Coulomb torque, viscous torque, windage torque, and gear tooth sliding torque. The Aerospace Corp bearing torque model and MPB torque models are used to predict the Coulomb torque of the motor rotor bearings and to model the viscous components. Gear tooth sliding friction torque is derived from the dynamo geared motor test data. With these torque data, the geared motor mechanical efficiency can be estimated and provide the overall performance of the geared motor versus several motor operating parameters such as speed, temperature, applied current, and transmitted power...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{new type}} of hybrid {{stepping}} motor (HSM) with permanent magnets (PMs) embedded in the stator, namely the stator-permanent-magnet hybrid stepping motor (SHSM), is presented. It has the same operation principles as the traditional HSM, with a 2 -D distributed magnetic field nature and superiorities such as simpler rotor structure, easier PM cooling, higher torque and power density, and higher power grade. Its structural topology and operation principles are initially presented. Then an investigation on the performance comparison between the HSM and the SHSM, in terms of PM flux density, PM torque, <b>detent</b> <b>torque,</b> positional holding accuracy, stator core saturation issue, PM flux leakage, and PM utilization rate is carried out theoretically to make an assessment of the performance superiorities of the SHSM. A prototype of a 2 -phase 8 -pole 50 -rotor-tooth SHSM is fabricated and experimentally compared with the HSM by using finite element analysis (FEA) to verify the motor’s operational feasibility and the theoretical analysis. The FEA and experimental results show that the proposed SHSM has performance advantages such as higher torque density, higher power grade, and higher pull-out torque, holding torque, and torque-speed property, although it has performance defects such as higher torque ripple and relatively lower positional holding accuracy in the open-loop operation than the conventional HSM. Consequently, this novel SHSM is more suitable for electromechanical energy conversion applications rather than positioning mechanisms, especially taking into account the open-loop control advantage...|$|E
40|$|A novel spherical two-degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) hybrid {{stepping}} motor is proposed in this paper, {{which has a}} simple and compact mechanical structure and is easy to manufacture, assemble, control and apply. The motor is composed of two sub-motors, {{each of which is}} a hybrid stepping type with an arc-shaped stator and a specially designed bearing structure. The rotational axes of these two sub-motors cross at the sphere center, and this structure enables the 2 -DOF motor to move in any direction. Due to the mutual influence of permanent magnet (PM) leakage flux between the two sub-motors, the 3 -D magnetic field distribution inside the motor becomes more complex, and thus the 2 -D equivalent magnetic field analysis method is proposed, with two types of 2 -D equivalent motor models established. The accurate one can take into account of the PM leakage flux influence yet is only suitable for solving motor’s static and steady state problem, whilst the simplified one can solve all the problems and is applicable for the more typical situation where the PM leakage flux influence can be almost neglected via optimal structure design. A prototype of the proposed spherical 2 -DOF motor with outside diameter of 50 mm is newly manufactured and experimented to validate the feasibility of motor’s operational principle, and the accuracy of both 2 -D equivalent motor models is verified by the 3 -D finite element analysis (3 -D FEA) calculation results. Based on the 2 -D equivalent motor models, the 2 -D FEA is employed for the performance analysis, such as no-load back electromotive force (EMF), tooth-layer permeance harmonics, <b>detent</b> <b>torque,</b> pull-out torque, unbalanced force, etc., which is characterized by time- saving, high accuracy and good versatility...|$|E
40|$|Electrical drives {{are widely}} used in today’s society. They {{can be found in}} bothhousehold {{products}} and in the industry. One application where electrical drivesare used is in robots for mowing lawns. In the studied robots the motors in theelectrical drives used for propulsion are Brush Less Direct Current motors, BLDCmotors. The BLDC-motor has its maximum torque at high speeds and thereforea gearbox is needed. The gearbox is space consuming, add costs and consists ofmechanical parts that wear during use. Of interest is therefore to investigate ifthere are other electrical drives which can be used for propulsion. A motor who has its maximum torque at low speeds is the Stepper motor, andtherefore it is of interest to investigate if a stepper motor could replace the BLDCmotor. A drawback with the stepper motor is that it always consumes maximumcurrent and therefore a current controller is beneficial. Together with currentcontrol, speed control is needed to make the robot run at desired speed. To beable to perform an accurate current and speed control feedback from the motor isneeded. Information about the rotor angle and velocity can be used for the speedcontrol and the load angle can be used for the current control since the current isproportional to the load torque. To estimate the rotor angle and velocity a model has been developed. Themodel is based on fundamental electrical and mechanical equations and neglectsthe current and position dependence of the inductance and flux linkage. To completethe model three motor parameters, the maximum <b>detent</b> <b>torque</b> Tdm, themaximum flux linkage  m and the friction constant B was determined. Parameterdetermination was done by linear regression and by using an Extended KalmanFilter, EKF. The result of the parameter determination were Tdm = 0. 2152 Nm, m = - 0. 002854 Vs/rad and B = 0. 01186 Nms/rad. The model is used in an EKF to estimate the rotor angle and angular velocity. The result of the implemented EKF seems promising. When making the rotortake a step in velocity from 3. 927 rad/s to 7. 85 rad/s the EKF estimates the stateswith only a small bias: 0. 02 rad for the angle, 0. 3 rad/s for the velocity, 0. 005 Afor phase a current and 0. 0004 A for phase b current. To estimate the load angle the Sliding Discrete Fourier Transform is used. Theexpected relation between the load torque and load angle is sinusoidal. The loadangle is calculated from data where the external load is between 0 - 2. 5 Nm. Inthat area the load angle shows the expected sinusoidal appearance and the loadangle is in the area between 0. 1 and 0. 45 rad. At 3 Nm the rotor stalls and it isshown that the load angle varies between 0 and 2 rad when the rotor is stalled...|$|E
