25|$|Cordwood {{construction}} {{can save}} significant space and was often used with wire-ended components in applications where space {{was at a}} premium (such as fuzes, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in high-speed computers, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with <b>jumper</b> <b>wire,</b> or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads. To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special nickel-leaded components had {{to be used to}} allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause physical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.|$|E
2500|$|Analog meter {{movements}} are inherently more fragile physically and electrically than digital meters.

50|$|For {{testing it}} is more {{difficult}} to reliably connect to a working circuit on a 110 block than on older style blocks. The circuit must be broken, or insulation displacing contacts may be used on jumper wires. Repeated use of insulation displacing contacts may lead to a difficult to locate broken or intermittent <b>jumper</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{vertical}} blocks {{are used}} to terminate the permanent outside lines entering the station. Horizontal blocks {{are used to}} terminate inside plant equipment. This arrangement permits the association of any outside line with any desired terminal equipment. These connections are made either with twisted pair wire, normally referred to as <b>jumper</b> <b>wire,</b> or with optical fiber cables, normally referred to as jumper cables.|$|E
50|$|For example, the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) {{located at}} a {{telephone}} central office terminates the cables leading to subscribers on the one hand, and cables leading to active equipment (such as DSLAMs and telephone switches) on the other. Service is provided to a subscriber by manually wiring a twisted pair (called a <b>jumper</b> <b>wire)</b> between the telephone line and the relevant DSL or POTS line circuit.|$|E

50|$|Some {{telephone}} technicians used various phrase, such as red-right-ring-rear, or ring-right-red-rough, {{to remember}} that the red wire connects to the right-side post in the wall jack and to the ring on the plug and to the rear lug on main distribution frames. Sometimes rough or ridge was added for <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> with a tactile code.|$|R
5000|$|A jump wire (also {{known as}} jumper, <b>jumper</b> <b>wire,</b> jumper cable, DuPont wire, or DuPont cable - named for one {{manufacturer}} of them) is an electrical wire {{or group of}} them in a cable with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them - simply [...] "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering.|$|E

5000|$|Crippleware {{has been}} defined in realms of both {{software}} and hardware. In software, crippleware means that [...] "vital features of the program such as printing {{or the ability to}} save files are disabled until the user purchases a registration key". While crippleware allows consumers to see the software before they buy, they are unable to test its complete functionality because of the disabled functions. Hardware crippleware is [...] "a hardware device that has not been designed to its full capability". The functionality of the hardware device is limited to encourage consumers to pay for a more expensive upgraded version. Usually the hardware device considered to be crippleware can be upgraded to better or its full potential by way of a trivial change, such as removing a <b>jumper</b> <b>wire.</b> The manufacturer would most likely release the crippleware as a low-end or economy version of their product.|$|E

50|$|Many freeband {{operators}} use amateur radios {{modified to}} transmit out of band, which is illegal in some countries. Older amateur radios may require component changes; for instance, the 1970s Yaesu FT-101 was modified for CB by replacing a set of crystals used to tune portions of the 10-meter band, although some variants of the FT-101 were sold with the US FCC channels standard and were capable of transmitting {{above and below the}} legal 40 channels by another 10 or more channels. On some newer radios, the modification may be as simple as disconnecting a <b>jumper</b> <b>wire</b> or a diode. Many types of amateur transceivers may be found on CB and freeband, ranging from full-coverage HF transceivers to simpler 10-meter mobile radios. In the United States, the FCC bans the importation and marketing of radios it deems easily modifiable for CB; it is illegal to transmit on CB frequencies with a ham radio except in emergencies where no other method of communication is available.|$|E
5000|$|... 1940s {{tube-type}} land mobile two way radios {{often had}} one channel and were carrier squelch. Because radios were costly {{and there were}} fewer radio users, {{it might be the}} case that no one else nearby used the same channel. A transmit and receive crystal had to be ordered for the desired channel frequency, then the radio had to be tuned or aligned to work on the channel. 12-volt mobile, tube-type radios drew several amperes on standby and tens-of-amperes on transmit. Equipment worked ideally when new. The performance of vacuum tubes gradually degraded over time. US regulations required an indicator lamp showing the transmitter had power applied and was ready to transmit and a second indicator, (usually red,) that showed the transmitter was on. In radios with options, wire jumpers and discrete components were used to select options. To change a setting, the technician soldered an option <b>jumper</b> <b>wire</b> then made any corresponding adjustments.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1940s, the {{earliest}} electronic digital systems had no operating systems. [...] Electronic systems {{of this time}} were programmed on rows of mechanical switches or by <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> on plug boards. [...] These were special-purpose systems that, for example, generated ballistics tables for the military or controlled the printing of payroll checks from data on punched paper cards. [...] After programmable general purpose computers were invented, machine languages (consisting of strings of the binary digits 0 and 1 on punched paper tape) were introduced that sped up the programming process (Stern, 1981).|$|R
5000|$|In Linux, each {{serial port}} is {{referenced}} by two device names - one being (for the first serial port) [...] versus [...] Although these both {{refer to the}} same physical port, one important distinction between the way Linux treats these two device names {{has to do with}} the DCD line. When ttyS0 is waited on in a system call, Linux assumes that since this device is for receiving telephone calls, it will put a process to sleep - [...] figuring that so long as DCD is low, there is nothing to do. When cua0 is used - as it is when placing telephone calls - Linux assumes that the software needs to access the port while DCD is low for the purpose of dialing the number, so this blocking behavior doesn't exist. Nevertheless, there is a control mode flag called CLOCAL that is what actually activates or deactivates this behavior, and by default the flag is set for cua0 but not for ttyS0. An application that insists on using a [...] "tty" [...] port versus a [...] "cua" [...] port is an example of one that might require a <b>jumper</b> <b>wire</b> to force DCD high in order to work properly.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the safety system on the Michigan Line, a derailment occurred just east of Niles, Michigan, on October 21, 2012, after a Wolverine train exited the main line and entered a freight yard due to a misaligned switch. The train had a green signal and was traveling at about 60 mph when it hit the switch. The incident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and was found to be Amtrak's fault, caused by one of its employees improperly applying <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> to the signal system, bypassing safeguards that had been designed to prevent such an occurrence.|$|R
50|$|On many TEA2025-based boards, Creative used 47uF {{capacitors}} for the amplifiers {{inverting input}} DC decoupling (connecting the Feedback pins on the amplifiers pin-out), whereas the datasheet recommended 100uF units against {{an increase in}} low-pass cutoff. In addition, Creative installed 1 uF input decoupling capacitors on the TEA2025s inputs, which according to the datasheet should have been 0.22uF units and were only necessary when a volume control slider or knob was present, but were installed regardless if the volume knob was present. (These capacitors may be replaced with short <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> if no volume control slider or knob is present.) Finally, Creative used polarized capacitors where non-polarized capacitors should have been used.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, a main {{distribution}} frame (MDF or main frame) is a signal distribution frame for connecting equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate distribution frames (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate on the same MDF or on a separate trunk {{main distribution}} frame (TMDF).|$|R
50|$|Jump <b>wires</b> (also called <b>jumper</b> <b>wires)</b> for {{solderless}} breadboarding can {{be obtained}} in ready-to-use jump wire sets or can be manually manufactured. The latter can become tedious work for larger circuits. Ready-to-use jump wires come in different qualities, some even with tiny plugs attached to the wire ends. Jump wire material for ready-made or homemade wires should usually be 22 AWG (0.33 mm2) solid copper, tin-plated wire - assuming no tiny plugs are to {{be attached to the}} wire ends. The wire ends should be stripped 3/16 to 5/16 in. Shorter stripped wires might result in bad contact with the board's spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer stripped wires increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. Needle-nose pliers and tweezers are helpful when inserting or removing wires, particularly on crowded boards.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} an FPGA-like interconnect fabric for structured ASICs which is based upon fixed metal and programmable vias. We call this type of device a viaprogrammed structured ASIC or VPSA. We look at {{two different types of}} VPSA routing fabrics: one uses <b>jumper</b> <b>wiring</b> and the other uses crossover wiring. The performance of these fabrics is compared against an ASIC-like interconnect fabric, otherwise known as a metal-programmed structured ASIC or MPSA, which can be configured by customizing metal and via layers. We study the impact of these routing fabrics on cost, area, power and delay metrics. The results for different fabrics span a wide range, suggesting the routing architecture plays a very important role intheir overall performance and itshould be thoroughly researched.

40|$|INTRODUCTION All {{aspects of}} human-computer interaction, from the {{high-level}} concerns of organizational context and system requirements to the conceptual, semantic, and syntactic levels of user interface design, are ultimately funneled through physical {{input and output}} actions and devices. This chapter considers the input half of this physical level of human-computer interaction, the final {{means by which the}} user communicates information to the computer. It is also called the Lexical level of the design of an interactive system, in contrast to the successively higher Syntactic, Semantic, and Conceptual levels [Foley, 1990 a]. Computer input once consisted of such actions as setting switches and knobs and plugging and unplugging <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> in patch boards. For many years after that, the primary form of computer input was the punched card.

50|$|Besides being {{illegal for}} several reasons, {{access to the}} lines on payphones is usually limited by conduit or armor, but only for the first few, usually six to ten, feet. Payphones {{modified}} with discrete <b>jumper</b> <b>wires</b> for diodes to be clipped on were very popular in the early 1970s. Contrary to the green box, the diode allowed control from the calling payphone. A modified phone with a poor quality diode could be quickly identified by the constant clicking sound produced by the coin return mechanism. The single payphone at Canadian Village (also known as Lake Shore) located {{on the road to}} the marina of Huntington Lake in California was well known for this issue. Children would gather in the area to collect coins after a caller left, often to buy candy at the store across the road. Operation required using actual coins and lengthy long distance calls with mid-call Collect signals required deft manipulation of the noisy coins falling to the return, usually by covering the microphone with the hand or simply turning ones back to the phone.|$|R
50|$|Circuit pairs are {{connected}} to the block with a punch-down tool by terminating the tip wire on the leftmost slot of one row and ring wire on the leftmost slot of the row beneath the mating tip wire. Typically, a 25-pair cable coming from the phone company is punched down {{on the left side of}} the block in pairs. The right hand side of the block is wired to the customer premises equipment with <b>jumper</b> <b>wires.</b> Bridging clips are used to connect the two center terminals, connecting the left-hand side of a split block with its right-hand side, thus completing the circuit. The clips form the point of interface between the subscriber and the provider. The bridging clips can be easily removed by either the subscriber or phone company personnel for trouble isolation, allowing the ability to split a circuit and determine in which direction trouble may exist. An orange insulating cover attached to a 66 block denotes its designation as a demarcation point by the local exchange carrier.|$|R
5000|$|The {{computer}} {{was based on}} a single printed-circuit board, with all semiconductors manufactured by Motorola including the MC6809E CPU, MC6847 VDG, MC6883 SAM, and RAM, which consisted of 2104 (4kx1) chips (4k models) or 4116 (16kx1) chips (16k models). The early CoCos only had eight RAM sockets, so upgrading to 32k requiring piggybacking two sets of 4116 chips and adding a few <b>jumper</b> <b>wires.</b> A later motherboard revision removed the 4K RAM option and were upgraded to 32K with [...] "half-bad" [...] 4164 DRAMs. These boards have jumpers marked HIGH/LOW to determine which half of the memory chip was good, in addition, they removed the -5V and -12V power lines used by the older DRAM types. This was transparent to the BASIC programmer since in either configuration 32K of memory was available. As memory production yields improved and costs went down, many (perhaps most) 32K CoCo 1s were shipped with perfectly good 4164 memory chips; many utilities and programs began {{to take advantage of the}} [...] "hidden" [...] 32K.|$|R
