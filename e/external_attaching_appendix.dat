40|$|The third {{planning}} workshop of the Human Genome Diversity Project {{was held}} {{on the campus of}} the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, from February 16 through February 18, 1993. The second day of the workshop was devoted to an exploration of the ethical and human-rights implications of the Project. This open meeting centered on three roundtables, involving 12 invited participants, and the resulting discussions among all those present. Attendees and their affiliations are listed in the <b>attached</b> <b>Appendix</b> A. The discussion was guided by a schedule and list of possible issues, distributed to all present and <b>attached</b> as <b>Appendix</b> B.

40|$|Chemotaxonomic {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to determine relationships within a wide range of extremely halophilic archaebacteria including a newly isolated group of alkaliphilic strains. DNA- 16 SrRNA hybridization has revealed that these organisms form a distinct order comprising ten genera within two families. DNA-DNA reassociation studies indicate seventeen species within these genera. Polar lipid compositions of strains {{have been shown to be}} a useful diagnostic tool for the elucidation of groups at the generic level. Analysis of lipids also revealed the presence of a novel archaebacterial C 20 C 25 diether core lipid within certain genera. Satellite DNA was present in many strains and its presence is correlated with the presence of large plasmids in the cells. Conventional biochemical tests have been applied to a number of strains in parallel with the chemotaxonomic analyses.

50|$|The abdomen {{contains}} {{most of the}} tubelike {{organs of}} the digestive tract, {{as well as several}} solid organs. Hollow abdominal organs include the stomach, the small intestine, and the colon with its <b>attached</b> <b>appendix.</b> Organs such as the liver, its attached gallbladder, and the pancreas function in close association with the digestive tract and communicate with it via ducts. The spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands also lie within the abdomen, along with many blood vessels including the aorta and inferior vena cava. Anatomists may consider the urinary bladder, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries as either abdominal organs or as pelvic organs. Finally, the abdomen contains an extensive membrane called the peritoneum. A fold of peritoneum may completely cover certain organs, whereas it may cover only one side of organs that usually lie closer to the abdominal wall. Anatomists call the latter type of organs retroperitoneal.|$|R

Research requirements have resulted in very important design drivers on the SS: three labs, three crewmembers per shift, low microgravity in the labs, minimum disturbances, high power for users, high data rates, multiple <b>external</b> <b>attach</b> points, and clean induced environment. Also addressed are the design capabilities that allow the SSF to support the development of technologies and the operations to expand the human presence in the solar system...|$|R
