40|$|The lower natural {{frequencies}} {{and the associated}} modes of vibration of uniform circular arches which are either fixed or simply supported at the ends are computed and studied in this thesis. A general theory which considers the effects of rotatory inertia and shearing deformations as Well as extensional and flexural deformations was used. When both rotatory inertia and shearing deformations are neglected the general theory reverts to a well -known classical theory which {{is based upon the}} same assumptions as Flugge's theory for the bending of cylindrical shells. The governing differential equations were solved numerically by a Holzer -type iterative procedure combined with an initial value integration method. A Runge- Kutta integration technique was used.

40|$|The {{inadequacy}} of beam -to-column connections in RC precast structures can cause catastrophic collapses due, for instance, to loss of s upport phenomena {{in the case}} of absence of mechanical devices. In order to achieve an adequate global seismic capacity, hence, the retrofitting of these connections is a necessary step for existing precast structures. An experimental campaign is performed in order to investigate the seismic behavior of typical beam -to-column connections for precast one- story buildings. The reference connection is a dowel beam -to-column connection, tested under cyclic shear loads up to collapse. It showed a very brittle fai lure with concrete cover splitting in the column and a non- symmetric behavior for the two loading directions. In particular, for pulling loads (i. e. horizontal loads against the column frontal cover) a significant strength degradation occurs after the attainment of the maximum shear strength, corresponding to the occurrence of the first crack in the column concrete cover. After the cyclic shear test, the described beam -to-column connection was retrofitted. The proposed retrofitting solution is based on two main mechanical principles: the three <b>hinged</b> <b>arch</b> and the dowel effect so that the total seismic force applied to the beam is transferred to the other two hinges on the column by two steel profiles. The cyclic global behavior in terms of force -displacement curve was investigated and the damage patterns after the test were described by means of both visual inspections and instrumentation records. The experimental results demonstrate a good behavior under seismic actions, since no significant damage in the concrete was recorded due to the large concrete covers in the retrofitted system which prevented brittle failures in the connected elements. The horizontal shear force was mostly sustained by the three hinges mechanism, ensured by the two steel profiles unde r axial loads. Moreover, the comparison between the retrofitted and the dowel beam -to-column connection also allow to define the main critical features of this connection system, as the concrete cover of steel bars in the connected structural elements. T he retrofitted connections showed larger shear strength as well as larger dissipated energy values than the standard dowel connection...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is two-fold: First, to present an {{adequate}} treatment of secondary stresses, and second, to introduce-three new methods evolved by the writer. During recent years when the importance of secondary stresses has exhibited itself a large amount of literature has been written on the subject for advancing the science of structural design* 2 ̆ 6 critical study made of these papers will at once reveal that they are subject to one or more defects which greatly impair their practical value. In the first place, too much attention has been paid to the mathematical theories, which could be greatly shortened for the benefit of practical engineers. Secondly, the treatment of the subject is generally limited to a narrow field, in which only a few methods are applied to only a certain class of structure. Thirdly, the treatment of the four existing methods is entirely too individual, in that the methods are generally considered as being separate from each other^notwithstanding the fact that they are more or less equivalent. Lastly, but not the least, the effect of secondary stresses on the design is not adequately considered and sometimes sadly neglected. With a view to avoid the above defects it has been the writer 2 ̆ 7 s endeavor that the subject be treated in an entirely different way——that it be more practical, more comprehensive, and more logical; so that it could be easily understood and appreciated by those for whom the secondary stress has the most direct bearing the practical engineers. The writer is aware that not all of these objects are attained in this paper, on account of limited amount of time, but it is believed that the- scope of the work and the arrangement of materials are sufficiently effective so as to produce the desired results, The methods for computing secondary stresses have been greatly improved in recent years. Two objections, however, still stand in the ways First, the amount of time involved is often excessive-, and second, the lack of a checking device by which the correctness of the various steps of procedure may be ensured. While there are numerous other defects these two alone are generally sufficient to reduce their practical utility. Ever since the beginning of 1917, when the writer undertook the analysis of secondary stresses in a two <b>hinged</b> <b>arch,</b> the results of which have been published in the Transactions of American Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. 82, p. 1104, it always occurred to him that there must be some method which is not only shorter and less cumbersome than the current ones but which also admits of a unique check. For two a and half years he has worked on the subject almost incessantly, striving to find some new method that will accomplish both. At last, much to his satisfaction, the graphic method of deformation contour was obtained; which not only takes less time, furnishes unique check, but also gives remarkably accurate results. Along with this method, almost contemporaneously, two more methods were evolved— the graphic method of successive deduction and the analytic solution of the graphic methods. All of the three methods are described in detail in Part III, page 2 ̆ 738, which,being treated more or less independently, could be read without reference to other parts of the paper. A perusal of Chapter 10, page 105, is hereby recommended. As these methods are new in their field it is hoped that their usefulness be actually tested by further investigators. Besides the two purposed of the paper as heretofore mentioned the following points deserve special attention: (1) The method for the solution of simultaneous equations, p. 25.

40|$|Abstract. The {{wrought iron}} {{building}} structures constituting {{part of the}} architectural heritage, e. g. handrails, gate <b>hinges,</b> columns, <b>arch</b> ties and wall ties represent incorporeal value, but operate as load bearing structures as well. There are few information on their mechanical properties and quality. Due to the inhomogeneity of the material of wrought iron building structures generated during the production, the known metal testing methods, as the tensile and hardness tests or metallographic examination, are not enough to survey the properties of such structures in depth. For the further and more accurate examinations, the application of X-ray and back-wall echo ultrasonic tests are essential.

40|$|For {{construction}} {{purposes and}} to avoid detrimental influences of foundation settlements arches are not always made from a single arch-rib but are built by connecting two curvilinear elements at the crown with a <b>hinge.</b> These <b>arches</b> are also known as crown-hinged arches. This paper presents an analytical procedure to approximate the plastic collapse load of circular crown-hinged steel arches. The development of the analytical method employs the lower- and upper bound theorem of plastic theory and the kinematic admissibility requirements. The influence of normal forces on the plastic moment capacity of the steel section is taken into account. The plastic collapse load is obtained by an iterative method {{as there is a}} non-linear relationship between the acting loads and the reduction of the plastic moment capacity due to normal forces.

40|$|Seismic loading {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} threats to the {{stability}} of masonry architecture is many parts of the world. Buildings that have stood for centuries under their self-weight, could suffer collapse in an unprecedented seismic event. The current research aims at furthering our understanding of how masonry vaulted buildings behave in earthquakes. Our ability to anticipate damages or collapse of existing structures will depend on this understanding. Based on the study of ancient Roman buildings, this work focuses on types of masonry that exhibit cohesive behaviour due to the presence of strong mortar or to the interlocking between the components of the material matrix. Roman concrete is one of those materials. The idea behind this work is to be able to base the experimental and theoretical work on real buildings, and vice-versa, to be able to relate any experimental and theoretical findings to real buildings. Hence the work has evolved around the case study of the Basilica of Maxentius in Rome. The Basilica of Maxentius is a valuable case study for the study of the seismic behaviour of vaulted structures: not only does it feature the largest barrel and cross vaults known to have been built by the Romans, but it also underwent partial collapse, believed to have been triggered by an earthquake at some unknown point in the middle ages. A detailed survey of the Basilica of Maxentius has been carried out to obtain a geometrical model of its current state; to study the deformations as a source of information for exploring the mechanical history of the structure; and to obtain a geometrical model of the original geometry of the building. The main techniques used in the survey were total station surveying and 3 D photogrammetry. The foundations of the south nave of the Basilica, built over the remains of earlier ruins, were also surveyed to assess their quality and to look for potential signs of seismic damage. No clear signs of structural damage were observed on the foundations themselves, but some of the earlier remains featured clear signs of damage under the effect of lateral loads. Shaking table tests on continuous circular arches and cross vaults constructed in lime mortar, a quasi-brittle material like Roman concrete but with weaker strength, have yielded interesting results that demonstrate that the dynamic behaviour of these structures is different to that of structures made of discrete blocks. Arches collapse by forming a four-link mechanism, but the hinge position is different to that observed in block arches: hinges are placed symmetrically about the mid-span axis. Only 2 cracks formed in all arches, leading to collapse by four-link mechanisms with hinges at the 2 cracks and at the 2 supports. Hinges were observed to remain fixed at these positions during rocking. When inwards sliding of supports is possible, the first crack typically forms by mobilising a slider-crank mechanism, the final crack forming a four-link mechanism in the reversed half-cycle. It was also observed that pre-existing cracks in the arch had a very significant effect: these cracks become hinges and only 1 more crack is needed to form a four-link mechanism. The common crack at mid-span frequently found in real arches caused by spreading of the supports leads to mechanisms that require higher accelerations than a pre-existing crack offset from midspan. It is arguable that many real masonry structures will feature a degree of cohesiveness, and thus this observation opens a path for further investigations into the need to consider pre-existing cracks. The formation of cracks has been analysed using limit and quasi-static linear elastic approaches. These analyses have been unsuccessful in predicting the formation of the first crack in undamaged arches (hyperstatic <b>arches</b> with <b>hinges</b> at the supports). Conventional limit analysis cannot be used because of the quasi-brittle nature of the material, while the elastic analysis fails to capture the behaviour observed in tests. The formation of the fourth <b>hinge</b> in pre-cracked <b>arches</b> has been analysed by application of equilibrium equations alone to the three-pin statically determinate arch. Good correlation has been obtained between experimental results and this analysis. Finally, discrete element modelling code LMGC 90 has been validated for analysis of dynamic behaviour of block arches, by comparison with experimental results. </p...|$|R
