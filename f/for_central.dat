5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees <b>for</b> <b>central</b> eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees <b>for</b> <b>central</b> eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
