5|$|With a new {{administrative}} structure capable of supporting continuous growth {{and with its}} autonomy secured, Unicamp went {{through a period of}} consolidation in the 1990s. There was an increase in night programs, created to provide an alternative for low-income students who had to work during the day, and to increase utilization of classrooms and the <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> reaching one third of total available places.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light Rail to Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the light rail to use <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} {{concern of the}} dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds that}} the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.|$|E
30|$|Such actions {{include the}} {{construction}} of new infrastructure, the upgrading of <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructures</b> or the more efficient use of <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> It is costly to build new infrastructures, and therefore, the optimal use of <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is important. The issue of improving the use of the rail transport system can be directly linked to the capacity of infrastructure, transportation vehicles, timing of movement and the behavior of travelers [2].|$|R

5|$|The daric also {{improved}} {{government revenues}} as {{the introduction of}} the daric made it easier to collect new taxes on land, livestock and marketplaces. This led to the registration of land which was measured and then taxed. The increased government revenues helped maintain and improve <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and helped fund irrigation projects in dry lands. This new tax system also {{led to the formation of}} state banking and the creation of banking firms. One of the most famous banking firms was Murashu Sons, based in the Babylonian city of Nippur. These banking firms provided loans and credit to clients.|$|E
5|$|This growth {{spurred the}} {{reorganisation}} of {{the governance of}} the town. Prior to 1818, the town was run by a mixture of bodies. The Sheffield Town Trust and the Church Burgesses, for example, divided responsibility {{for the improvement of}} streets and bridges. By the 19th century both organisations lacked funds and struggled even to maintain <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The Church Burgesses organised a public meeting on 27 May 1805 and proposed to apply to Parliament for an act to pave, light and clean the city's streets. The proposal was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{was then}} given a {{significant}} opportunity {{that became the}} focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to help establish one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding Spring. In the early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among the experts involved. Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end. In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to collaborate on the construction of a large telescope, {{to be known as the}} Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Given the <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure</b> of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT. Gascoigne was one of the four members of the Technical Committee established to guide the telescope's development. He provided leadership on the design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, {{parliament}} {{started a}} new process to consider Heimdal as the primary airport, {{in part because the}} airlines and the Civil Aviation Administration stated that they felt Værnes was insufficient. However, higher costs—due to bad ground conditions and <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure</b> at Værnes, valuated at NOK 150 million—caused parliament to support Værnes. Construction of the new runway therefore commenced in January 1959, with the work subcontracted to Selmer. First the artificial peninsula was built, then the delta of the Stjørdal River was moved, before a tunnel was built around the highway and railway. Finally, the runway could be built on top, and construction completed on 21 October 1961. In 1963, the airport had 115,000 passengers, increasing to 195,000 the following year. That year, SAS started using the Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft on their route.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hazel, a three-day period of national mourning was declared in Haiti for hurricane victims. With <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure</b> already poor, the recovery was very slow {{since many of the}} few existing roads were blocked, and communications equipment was either out, damaged, or destroyed. The Haitian Red Cross appealed for assistance to the International Red Cross, while the American Red Cross made a donation of $25,000 (1954 USD). Pan American World Airways offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid, and the US aircraft carrier USS Saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies. Despite the relief effort, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following Hazel {{due to a lack of}} clean water.|$|E

Titan will itself be replaced by an approximately 200 petaFLOPS system in 2016 as part of ORNL's plan to operate an exascale (1000 petaFLOPS to 1 exaFLOPS) machine by 2020. The initial plan to build a new 15,000 square meter (160,000 ft2) building for Titan, was discarded in favor of using Jaguar's <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The precise system architecture was not finalized until 2010, although a deal with Nvidia to supply the GPUs was signed in 2009. Titan was first announced at the private ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference (SC10) on November 16, 2010, and was publicly announced on October 11, 2011, as {{the first phase of the}} Titan upgrade began.|$|E

5|$|The city soon {{experienced}} {{its most}} dire fiscal crisis yet, {{due to the}} stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs. The system was already in decline; the subway had seen a 40% decrease in ridership since 1947, and a $200 million subsidy for the MTA {{as well as a}} 1952 fare increase had not been enough to pay for basic upkeep for the subway system, let alone fund massive expansion projects like the Second Avenue Subway. When plans were finalized in 1971, the subway had been proposed for completion by 1980, but two years later, its completion date was forecast as 2000. In October 1974, the MTA chairman, David Yunich, announced that the completion of the line north of 42nd Street was pushed back to 1983 and the portion to the south in 1988. On December 13, 1974, New York City mayor Abraham Beame proposed a six-year transit construction program that would reallocate $5.1 billion of funding from the Second Avenue Line to complete new lines in Queens and to modernize the <b>existing</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> which was rapidly deteriorating and in dire need of repair. Beame issued a stop-work order for the line in September 1975, whereupon construction of the section between Second and Ninth Streets was halted, and no other funding was allocated to the line's construction. Besides the Chrystie Street Connection, only three sections of tunnel had been completed; these tunnels were sealed.|$|E
