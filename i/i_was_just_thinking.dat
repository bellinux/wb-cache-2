500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Tennis Court" [...] address Lorde's newly {{established}} fame and criticise the [...] "high life." [...] Lorde said {{she wrote the}} song [...] "after having had {{a glimpse into the}} music industry, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> about how superficial people can be and how we put up all these fronts." [...] She found the idea of a tennis court [...] "very visually beautiful" [...] and [...] "something I kept coming back to on Tumblr and all that sort of thing", saying it was [...] "kind of a symbol of nostalgia for me. It was something which was familiar and safe to me." [...] She also described the song as being [...] "about the town where she grew up and the friends [...] she would ... hang out all summer." [...] Paul Lester, writing for The Guardian, compared the song's lyrical theme to that of two other songs by Lorde: [...] "Royals" [...] and [...] "Million Dollar Bills" [...] (from The Love Club EP).|$|E
500|$|... "Movin' Down the Line", an ode to a love unrequited, {{features}} mellow horns, jangling guitar, heavy bass lines, and a swelling {{string and}} piano conclusion. In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> about growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you, and tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Assembly Cut" [...] {{has several}} key plot {{elements}} {{that differ from}} the theatrical release. The alien gestates in an ox rather than a dog, {{and one of the}} inmates discovers a dead facehugger. Ripley's unconscious body washes up on the shore of the planet in the Assembly Cut instead of being found in the ship's wreckage as in the theatrical cut. Some scenes are extended to focus more on the religious views of the inmates. The inmates succeed in their attempt to trap the alien, but it is later released by the disturbed inmate Golic. In this version, the alien Queen does not burst from Ripley's chest as she falls into the furnace. There is also a scene in the prison's assembly hall in which one of the inmates suggests to Dillon that they lead the creature to the furnace so that they can incinerate it. One notable scene that was not restored for the DVD or Blu-ray extended versions was the full autopsy scene. Greg Cannom, who worked on the special make-up effects, said in the Alien Quadrilogy special features that, [...] "I saw the rough cut of the film, uncut, and there were some scenes in there that were pretty gross. There was an autopsy scene on the girl [...] and I like certain gore in the films. I do it , and it made me sick. It really grossed me out and I remember people got up and left, walked out of the theatre and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'This will never be in the film. They can't show this stuff.' It was just too much I thought. And when the film came out, it wasn't in the film." ...|$|E
5000|$|In week six, having {{performed}} [...] "On My Own" [...] from Les Misérables, {{she received}} some {{criticism from the}} judges. Lloyd Webber suggested {{that she needed to}} learn how to disguise the break in her voice, and Charlotte Church agreed, saying that her top notes could get [...] "a little bit shouty". Sheila Hancock agreed with Church, but was still full of praise, saying that she saw a similar [...] "star quality" [...] to that of Catherine Zeta-Jones. In this sing-off, Hope competed against Jessica Robinson, who was the only remaining contestant not to have been in the bottom two. After performing [...] "Take That Look Off Your Face" [...] from Tell Me on a Sunday, Lloyd Webber once again saved Hope, stating that [...] "Both of you are really terrific girls, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> of Dorothy here, so <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to save Danielle".|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, we {{are always}} pleased to see you," [...] Mr. Parker {{declared}} warmly. [...] "Sit right down, Mr. Cullen! You'll join us, <b>I</b> trust? We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> of ordering a little supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is in {{my boots}} now," [...] said the invalid, plaintively; [...] "tight boots, too. Do you know what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>just</b> now when you looked at me in that alarmed, {{compassionate}} way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Well, I mean it, Haines said, still {{speaking}} to Stephen. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of it when}} that poor old creature came in.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have met}} Lord Romsey and also Madame Selarne," [...] he observed. [...] "For the rest, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> what a {{stranger}} I felt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing worth mentioning. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> that it {{reminded}} me a little up here of {{the first time you}} and I ever talked together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That was {{the very}} thing <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>just</b> now,' said Stickly-Prickly. 'I think scales are a {{tremendous}} improvement on prickles--to say nothing {{of being able to}} swim. Oh, won't Painted Jaguar be surprised! Let's go and find him.' ...|$|R
60|$|I thanked him; <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of asking}} {{him to do that}} very thing, as in a couple of days, as he knew, we were going to sea, where all our {{troubles}} of every sort would be over at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{the first}} ball for both of us," [...] said Lothair. [...] "I have not danced {{so much in the}} {{interval}} as you have. Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> <b>just</b> now, <b>I</b> have danced oftener with you than with any one else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] he agreed. [...] "I {{understand}} that perfectly. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking,</b> though, {{what a lot}} I shall have to teach you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in, Joe. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> over {{my future}} plans, and I daresay you can assist me, being, I suppose, {{in the same}} fix with myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, Briant; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of that as}} {{you came}} up. Go and see you make a tight job of it. Get Rokens to help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> {{able to go}} very far," [...] Ritzer said. [...] "These {{boots are}} a great deal too large for me, and are chafing my feet horribly. The road is good and level; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> <b>just</b> now, of taking them off and {{carrying}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then starting, {{and looking}} round the room, {{and at his}} father, he {{collected}} himself, and said, with a slight smile, [...] "I didn't know <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> asleep. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> awake <b>just</b> now, <b>thinking</b> about it. Papa, I'll give it up. I'll try to put next half out of my head, and not mind if they do pass me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay! {{my mother}} never blamed either, and I'm afraid, if the truth were told, my father was hot enough too, though it would all have been bygones with him long ago, {{if they would have}} let it. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>just</b> then of my own foolishness last winter, when I would not grant you it was pride, Mrs. Kendal, for fear I should have to repent of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, really," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "I had {{not noticed}} your fear! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> that you were quite the boldest young man I have ever met." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At this tree. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> {{what good}} snowshoes it would make,' {{answered}} the fox in an absent voice, {{as if he}} was not thinking of what he was saying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking.</b> Mamma {{thinks that}} I {{might go to}} college. If I went {{it would be nice}} if we went to two places that were near each other." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could have}} bitten him, the sawn-off little rube! It made me mad. He was ashamed to dance in public with his wife--didn't think her {{good enough for}} him. So he had dumped her in a chair, given her a lemonade, {{and told her to}} be good, and then gone off to have a good time. They could have had me arrested for what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>just</b> then.|$|R
6000|$|Having {{taken to}} our canoes once again, we were silently sailing along, when Media observed, [...] "Babbalanja; though I seldom trouble myself with such thoughts, <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking,</b> how {{difficult}} it must be, for the more ignorant sort of people, to decide upon what particular image to worship as a guardian deity, when in Maramma, it seems, there exists such a multitude of idols, and a thousand more are to be heard of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, as I said before, {{they are}} all {{business}} men and professional men; people who spend their lives in studies and counting-rooms and offices, and have come up here {{for a few weeks}} or a few days of well-earned repose. They are of all kinds of occupations: they are lawyers and doctors, and clergymen and merchants, and brokers and bankers. There's hardly any calling you Won't find represented among them. As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>just</b> now, our hotel is a sort of microcosm of the American republic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You {{must have}} been mad to come here!’ she broke out. ‘Of all places under heaven this {{is no place for}} you to come. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> you were safe in France!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but look}} here, Bone; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> about it, that's all. You're always {{drumming}} it into me about not taking anything for granted. Anyway, {{by the time}} I go to Plato I'll know----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> {{that you}} would be the only person who could be of use--you who know foreign {{languages}} and all their ways. If you could go abroad, and arrange it for me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} must be dull if she can't {{stand it}} {{for three weeks}} in the year," [...] said her husband dryly. [...] "But we really cannot open the San Francisco house for her summer vacation, nor can we move from the rancho to a more fashionable locality. Besides, it will do her good to run wild here. I can remember when she wasn't so fastidious. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>just</b> now how changed she was from the day when we picked her up"-- ...|$|R
60|$|TIMOTHY. And it's glad <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to see you, Mr. George, {{before you}} leave. And he an officer now! Sure, I mind {{him as a}} baby being wheeled up and down under the trees out there. My boy Bert was saying only this morning how we'd missed {{the sight of him}} in the shops this summer. You have a way with the men, Mr. George, of getting into their hearts, like. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>just</b> now, if Mr. George had only been home, in the shops, maybe we wouldn't be having all this {{complaint}} and trouble.|$|R
6000|$|... '"I didn't get brain fever, I did not {{drop dead}} either," [...] he went on. [...] "I didn't bother myself {{at all about}} the sun over my head. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} as coolly as any man that ever sat thinking in the shade. That greasy beast of a skipper poked his big cropped head from under the canvas and screwed his fishy eyes up at me. 'Donnerwetter! you will die,' he growled, and drew in like a turtle. I had seen him. I had heard him. He didn't interrupt me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>just</b> then that <b>I</b> wouldn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "I don't {{know her}} either, Willis. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> whether you couldn't manage this wretched man rather better alone. I--I'm afraid I confuse you; {{and he gets}} things out of me--admissions, you know--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} been mad to come here!" [...] she broke out. [...] "Of all places under heaven this {{is no place for}} you to come. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> you were safe in France!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] exclaimed Jacques, {{throwing}} {{down the}} remainder of the cargo as Charley landed with his booty, [...] "that's well. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> as I comed across that we should have to take to pemmican to-night." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know if you}} are a Barbey d'Aurevilly-an. <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> have a great {{delight in}} his Norman stories. Do you know the CHEVALIER DES TOUCHES and L'ENSORCELEE? They are admirable, they reek of the soil and the past. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather <b>thinking</b> <b>just</b> now of LE RIDEAU CRAMOISI, and its adorable setting of the stopped coach, the dark street, the home-going in the inn yard, and the red blind illuminated. Without doubt, THERE was an {{identity}} of sensation; one of those conjunctions in life that had filled Barbey full to the brim, and permanently bent his memory.|$|R
5000|$|On October 12, 2007, Lionsgate {{announced}} that the film title was being changed to Rambo: To Hell and Back. After some negative feedback from the online community, Stallone spoke with AICN's Harry Knowles and said: [...] "Lionsgate jumped the gun on this. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> that the title John Rambo was derivative of Rocky Balboa and might give people {{the idea that this}} is the last Rambo film, and I don't necessarily feel that it will be. He's definitely a superb athlete, there's no reason he can't continue onto another adventure. Like John Wayne with The Searchers." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{followed}} a deafening pealing of panpipes, drumming of drum, and yelling of voices. In that monstrous din <b>I</b> <b>was</b> past <b>thinking,</b> <b>just</b> being; and I bridled to myself like a schoolgirl {{caught in a}} delicious naughtiness, to hear the fine things--the charms and marvels--which my showman was bawling about me. Then one by one, at first a little owlishly, the Great Public, at the charge of 6d. per adult and half price for children (or [...] "full-growns under 3 foot") were admitted {{to the presence of}} the [...] "Signorina Donna Angélique, the Fairy Princess of Andalusia in Spain." [...] So at any rate declares the printed handbill.|$|R
