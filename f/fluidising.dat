50|$|After {{the first}} few {{fluidized}} beds were successfully applied into industrial processes, demand for more types of fluidization technology has rose to satisfy the growing industrial demand. The addition of vibratory mechanism to the fluidized bed in 1984 where Geldart showed that using mechanical vibrating sieve can improve the performance of <b>fluidising</b> small size of fine particles. These experiments are difficult to process these powders by fluidisation due to the unpredictable behaviours of particles. It was later found {{that it would be}} cheaper and more environmentally friendly by adding vibration into the fluidization process. This was then used as a starting point by many others for further fluidization research based on the effects of vibrations. Mujumdar (1988) devised two methods using vibration technic of fluidization for fluidizing hot-sensitive and paste-like materials. Yoshihide et al. (2003) studied the effect of vibration on fluidisation behavior and prediction of minimum fluidisation velocity. Kaliyaperumal et al. (2011) determined the effect of different vibration to the nano and sub-micro particles, those particles are hard to fluidise in the absence of mechanical vibration and have special properties.|$|E

Displacing any {{sediment}} grain {{requires a}} certain amount of work to overcome both inertia and the friction generated by all adjacent grains (both static and dynamic). The wedge does displacement work by using less force at the cost of increasing the distance the grain must travel. In order {{to reduce the size of}} an SPI device it makes sense to reduce the amount of work required to displace sediment for a given imaging area. Being in an aquatic environment gives the first advantage to reducing work. By increasing the water content of sediments, both static and dynamic coefficients of friction from grain-on-grain interactions are greatly reduced. At these large physical scales, viscosity interactions are very small compared to friction. Therefore, <b>fluidising</b> sediments would allow an SPI device to displace more and coarser sediments with less downward force. (Of course all mass-energy is conserved - more work is required to pump the water into sediments - but at least that can be done away from the wedge.) It is important to cleanly separate sediments to be fluidised and removed from the sedimentary fabric that must be imaged intact. Water lubrication can be used to reduce the amount of force required and lessen required workload, but can we also reduce the distance grains need to be displaced? The imaging mirror is the greatest constraint to reducing grain displacement so it makes sense to dispense with it. A number of commercial and consumer line scanners exist which digitise an image by moving in a plane recording the colour and intensity of light encountered. Flatbed scanners and digital photocopiers are examples of this technique. Light shining from the device reflects off the scene to be imaged to a sensor located near the light source. The light’s path can be folded and manipulated by a series of intermediary mirrors and lenses to a small linear sensor array or directly to a large array of tiny sensors. Pushing a thin flatbed scanner into sediments requires much less work than pushing a large prism, as concluded by Keegan et al. (2001):“In terms of its current design, the size of the prism in the SPI array impedes penetration in all but the softer, less compact sediments. When, for the sake of enhanced penetration, it becomes necessary to use the full complement of lead weights (66kg), the system becomes difficult to handle on smaller craft with restricted lifting equipment. Size and, correspondingly, weight could be reduced if the prism could be replaced to act more as a slim ‘digging blade,’ the whole exposed face of which could be digitally scanned in situ. Such a blade would not only facilitate easier and deeper penetration but also extend the use of SPI to more compact, fine to medium sands. The authors have already experimented with a suitable casing that penetrated these more resistant deposits to depths exceeding 55cm, however, a physically robust scanner that will tolerate the shock of impact and have a level of resolution adequate to the purpose remains to be identified.”The engineering problems of resolution, weight, and pressure and shock-resistance are compounded by keeping the scanner in a rectangular configuration (Patterson et al. 2006). Most underwater equipment is housed in cylinders because cylinders present a smaller surface area for enclosing a given volume than a rectangular enclosure. For a given surface (imaging) area, fewer sediment grains will need to be displaced a shorter distance when imaged from the perimeter of a cylinder than the oblique face of a wedge. It is a conceptually simple matter to modify a consumer flatbed scanner so that its scan head (containing light source and sensor array) moves in a circular path instead of a plane as illustrated in Figure 7. This configuration change allows for a more efficient wedge geometry or, as we’ll see later, permits its elimination.|$|E

40|$|Many {{experimental}} {{studies show that}} the presence of solid particles in <b>fluidised</b> beds enhances wall-to-bed heat transfer coefficients with respect to flows without particles.

Also, a technique was developed which enabled quantitative viscosity data to be extracted from the experimental results. The flow properties were found {{to be sensitive to the}} size, size-range and density of the fluidised material, the type of distributor used, and the moisture content of the <b>fluidising</b> gas. Tests in beds up to 120 mm deep showed that the fluidity of the bed improves with reduction in depth; and indicated a range of {{flow behaviour}} from shear-thinning to Newtonian, depending chiefly on <b>fluidising</b> velocity [...] Later, an apparatus was built which provided for a steady, continuous flow of fluidised material down an inclined open channel of 3 m length x 0. 15 m square, up to a mass flowrate of 10 kg/s (35 ton/hr). This facility has enabled data to be obtained that is of practical value in industrial applications; which is otherwise difficult in view of the present limited understanding of the true mechanism of fluidised flow. A correlation has been devised, based on analogy with laminar liquid flow, which describes the channel flow behaviour with reasonable accuracy over the whole range of shear-rates used. 1 he channeI results indicated that at low fluidiising velocities the flow was adversely affected by settlement of a stagnant layer of particles on to the distributor, which gave rise to increased flow resistance. Conversely, at higher <b>fluidising</b> velocities the resistance at the distributor appeared to be less than at the walls. In view of this, and also because of the disparity in shear-rates between the two types of apparatus, it is not possible as yet to predict exactly the flow behaviour in an open channel from small-scale viscometer tests...|$|E

40|$|Metallurgists {{operating}} Knelson Concentrators (KC) often rely on manufacturers {{recommendations for}} selecting operating parameters, such as <b>fluidising</b> {{water flow rate}} and cycle time. Recent {{studies have shown that}} these parameters are not only dependent on the machine parameters but also on the feed characteristics, such as size distribution of the gold and gangue particles and the composition of its constituent minerals. It is known that a particle entering a KC initially traverses a circular path within the bowl. For a particle to maintain a given orbit, the required centripetal force must be supplied by external means. It has been argued that this centripetal force which is dependent on the mass of the particle, its radial position and the rotational speed of the bowl, is provided by the fluid drag force created by inwardly moving <b>fluidising</b> water and the Bagnold's force created by the particle/particle collisions. Depending on the <b>fluidising</b> water flow rate, one of two situations can occur where the porosity of the bed increases or decreases which influences the amount of material retained within the bowl. The amount of material of a given size and density retained in the bowl is thus dependent on the extent of the centripetal force provided. Based on the above concept, a criterion {{that can be used to}} predict the amount of material recovered in the bowl has been derived and validated by experimental data. It may also be construed that this criterion demarcates the transition of the bed from a packed-bed state to a fluidised state. By identifying the transition values for the different constituent mineral particles in the feed, it is possible to estimate the optimal <b>fluidising</b> water flow rate that would maximise gold recovery while minimising gangue recovery. In addition, the kinetics of gangue displacement by incoming heavy mineral particles were also studied using synthetic mineral mixtures. The experimental data suggests that this process follows first order kinetics and that the build-up of heavy mineral reaches a maximum. A model has been proposed to predict the optimal batch cycle time for a KC in terms of the feed characteristics and machine operating parameters...|$|E
