5|$|Chopin's music, {{his status}} as one of music's {{earliest}} superstars, his association (if only indirect) with political insurrection, his love life and his early death <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a leading symbol of the Romantic era in the public consciousness. His works remain popular, {{and he has been}} the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Together {{they raised}} her {{children}} from her previous marriage, John Parke Custis and Martha Parke (Patsy) Custis. Later, they raised Martha's grandchildren Eleanor Parke Custis and George Washington Parke Custis. George and Martha {{never had any}} children together; his earlier bout with smallpox in 1751 may <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> sterile. The newlywed couple moved to Mount Vernon, near Alexandria, where he took up {{the life of a}} planter and political figure.|$|E
50|$|Jovkić's {{life as an}} {{itinerant}} worker <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a rebel and study <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a socialist.

5|$|A quietly spoken athlete, he {{frequently}} states that his victories are {{a tribute to}} his country. Eritrea is one of Africa's newest and least populous countries, and Zersenay's achievements on the world athletics stage <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> one of the country's most identifiable sportsmen. He is a popular public figure in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on Eritrean television. His brother, Kidane Tadese, is also a professional distance runner who has competed at the World Cross Country Championships and the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|As {{a senior}} Pressey earned TABC All-state {{recognition}} and Dallas Morning News first team All-area recognition. The All-area team included Perry Jones, Le'Bryan Nash, Marcus Smart and Kyan Anderson. During the 2010 SPC championship game, Pressey tallied 32 points, 9 assists, 8 rebounds and 3 steals against Greenhill School. Videos of him dunking {{in high school}} <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a YouTube sensation. During the 2010 TABC All-star game, he dunked over Tony Mitchell, {{who at the time}} was a player approximately a foot taller than Pressey. , this video has about 800,000 views. Because of his diminutive stature, he is often compared to another undersized Dallas basketball player, Spud Webb.|$|E
5|$|Because Poe {{was found}} on the day of an election, it was {{suggested}} as early as 1872 that he was the victim of cooping. This was a ballot-box-stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied, drugged, and used as a pawn to vote for a political party at multiple locations. Cooping had become the standard explanation for Poe's death in most of his biographies for several decades, though his status in Baltimore may <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> too recognizable for this scam to have worked. More recently, analysis suggesting that Poe's death resulted from rabies has been presented.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{was kept}} under the strict tutorship of Hansell until almost {{thirteen}} years old. Private tutors taught him German and French. Edward took the examination to enter Osborne Naval College, and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed. Following {{two years at}} Osborne College, {{which he did not}} enjoy, Edward moved on to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. A course of two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned. A bout of mumps may <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> infertile.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Josephson took up {{transcendental}} meditation {{and turned his}} attention to issues outside the boundaries of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, and <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a focus of criticism from fellow scientists.|$|E
5|$|After Fulin came {{to rule on}} his own in 1651, {{his mother}} the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang {{arranged}} for him to marry her niece, but the young monarch deposed his new Empress in 1653. The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her Khorchin Mongol clan, this time matching her son with her own grand-niece. Though Fulin also disliked his second empress (known posthumously as Empress Xiaohuizhang), he {{was not allowed to}} demote her. She never bore him children. Starting in 1656, the Shunzhi Emperor lavished his affection on Consort Donggo, who, according to Jesuit accounts from the time, had first been the wife of another Manchu noble. She gave birth to a son (the Shunzhi Emperor's fourth) in November 1657. The emperor would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> his heir apparent, but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, and he would suffer from its effects {{in the years that}} followed. He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from his first year in Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he wanted to take a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E
5|$|Although a real ninja wears {{black to}} be inconspicuous, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange {{jumpsuit}} {{to fit the}} shōnen genre. His wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger. According to him, a pre-existing design {{would not have made}} Naruto unique, whereas something original would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> too distinctive. Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses, the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume. Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes. The goggles Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, because they were too time-consuming to draw. One of the most difficult design choices was the color palette of Naruto's outfit. The orange in his costume makes Naruto pop and the blue parts are complementary. Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, as he considered it too difficult to animate.|$|E
5|$|Linden's long tenure {{with the}} Canucks (Linden holds second most games played in {{franchise}} history at 1,140), deep attachment {{to the city of}} Vancouver and history of charitable community service and involvement <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> one of the most beloved and respected players among fans {{in franchise history}}. His 2001 return to the Canucks was an emotional event for fans and players alike, with Linden admitting that he was too excited to sleep the night before his first game back. He is still often referred to affectionately as 'Captain Canuck', despite not having captained the team since 1997. On April 5, 2008, the Canucks' final game of the 2007–08 season, the Vancouver crowd gave Linden a standing ovation {{before the start of the}} third period. Once the game ended, the crowd again rose to their feet in recognition of Linden.|$|E

5|$|Males {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of 15, but do not {{typically}} reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years. One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia. This would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Members of Clann Somairle seem to {{have been}} attacking parts of the Crovan dynasty's island-kingdom, {{possibly}} taking advantage of the warring between Rögnvaldr and Óláfr. It may have been that they were also lending support to Alan's destabilising incursions into the Isles. Whatever the case, {{it is clear that the}} state of affairs in the Isles was chaotic and, because of Óláfr's inability to control of the situation, the formidable Hákon decided to pacify the region using Óspakr-Hákon. In fact, the saga notes that Óspakr-Hákon was also a son of Dubgall, and it is likely that his family connections would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a palatable over-king of the unruly Clann Somairle. Óspakr-Hákon's kingdom was likely meant to encompass the territories of Clann Somairle, and control of the Crovan dynasty's domain may have been retained by the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The inquest {{was opened}} and adjourned in April 2009. The City of London coroner, Paul Matthews, {{expressed}} concern about whether he had appropriate expertise, and Peter Thornton QC, who specializes in protest law, took over. The inquest opened on 28 March 2011 before a jury. The court heard from Kevin Channer, a cardiologist at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, who analysed electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the defibrillator paramedics had used on Tomlinson. He said the readings were inconsistent with an arrhythmic heart attack, but consistent with death from internal bleeding. Pathologist Nat Carey concurred regarding the cause of death. Graeme Alexander, a hepatologist, said that in his opinion Tomlinson had died of internal bleeding {{as a result of}} trauma to the liver after the fall. He told the court that Tomlinson had been suffering from serious liver disease, which would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> susceptible to collapse from internal bleeding.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{lines of}} the poem contain a {{dedication}} to Miles de Nanteuil, an early 13th-century churchman who was elected (but not confirmed) in 1201 as archbishop of Reims, and later became bishop of Beauvais, in northern France; he died circa 1235. According to Todd, the nobleman de Nanteuil {{may have been too}} young and wild to be elevated to the , but this would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a good candidate for Renart's dedication. This, plus evidence based on other names found in the poem, led Todd to conclude that the poem was composed around the year 1200. Later critics and researchers, however, date the poem between 1204 and 1228, and tend toward the earlier date.|$|E
5|$|Wrestling in Kristiansund {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Løvold wrestling at circuses and town fairs. On 8 January 1911 he held a major show against circus artist Erik Blixt, for which Løvold was promised 100 Norwegian krone (NOK) if he won. Although successful, he did not accept the prize money, as it would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a professional. He started competing for Fagforeningernes TIF and later IF Ørnulf in Oslo. He represented the latter {{when he won the}} 1912 Norwegian championships, thus qualifying him for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. There he participated in the Greco-Roman light heavyweight, but was sent home after losing both his introductory rounds, against Finland's Karl Lind and Austria's Karl Barl.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Darnley grew arrogant. Not {{content with}} his {{position}} as king consort, he demanded the Crown Matrimonial, which would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a co-sovereign of Scotland {{with the right to}} keep the Scottish throne for himself if he outlived his wife. Mary refused his request, and their marriage grew strained even though they conceived by October 1565. He was jealous of her friendship with her Catholic private secretary, David Rizzio, who was rumoured to be the father of her child. By March 1566, Darnley had entered into a secret conspiracy with Protestant lords, including the nobles who had rebelled against Mary in the Chaseabout Raid. On 9 March, a group of the conspirators, accompanied by Darnley, murdered Rizzio in front of the pregnant Mary at a dinner party in Holyrood Palace. Over the next two days, a disillusioned Darnley switched sides, and Mary received Moray at Holyrood. On the night of 11–12 March, Darnley and Mary escaped from the palace, and took temporary refuge in Dunbar Castle before returning to Edinburgh on 18March. The former rebels Lords Moray, Argyll and Glencairn were restored to the council.|$|E
