5|$|The regulars found {{themselves}} trapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> {{they were both}} outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Lacking effective leadership and terrified at the superior numbers of the enemy, with their spirit broken, and likely not having experienced combat before, they abandoned their wounded, and fled {{to the safety of}} the approaching grenadier companies coming from the town center, isolating Captain Parsons and the companies searching for arms at Barrett's Farm.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface can result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases {{in response to the}} applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while the battle was still ongoing, not after the battle was over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> concessions were necessary, {{in order to bring}} hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once the battle was over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after the battle was concluded.|$|E
25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychological {{explanation of}} domestic violence is that it represents male attempts to control female reproduction and ensure sexual exclusivity. Violence related to extramarital relations is seen as justified {{in certain parts of}} the world. For instance, <b>a</b> survey <b>in</b> Diyarbakir, Turkey, found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off. Similar feelings may at times be generated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> one partner is more financially successful.|$|R

5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E
5|$|Language contact {{may also}} lead {{to a variety of}} other {{linguistic}} phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{also held}} that the {{identification}} requirement did not violate Hiibel's Fifth Amendment rights {{because he had no}} reasonable belief that his name would be used to incriminate him; however, the Court left open the possibility that Fifth Amendment privilege might apply <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> there was a reasonable belief that giving a name could be incriminating.|$|E
25|$|Caregiver {{sensitivity}} {{has also}} {{been found to have}} a connection with empathy in children. Generally, securely attached children {{have been found to be}} more empathetic compared with insecurely attached children. The reasoning suggested for this result is that because securely attached children receive more empathy from caregivers during times that they themselves are distressed, they are more likely to show empathy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> someone else is distressed.|$|E

50|$|As this indicates, O'Donoghue uses {{specific}} narratives as motivations to {{make his}} work, and this allows him to explore 'ideas of place and identity in relation to historical and personal meaning'. However O'Donoghue has stated himself {{that he does not}} believe 'that artists wholly control the meaning of their work'. This results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> art becomes <b>a</b> conveyor of incomplete and subjective truths about events such as the Second World War. However, in O'Donoghue's own view the academic study of history is like this anyway. This means O'Donoghue's paintings are not simply reminiscent of historic History painting in terms of their scale and subject matter, but in the way O'Donoghue conceives of them as a kind of historical exegesis.|$|R

The tension mounts as all the people required to make the decision on acceptable collateral damage weigh in.|$|E
25|$|This beta {{function}} {{tells us}} that the coupling increases with increasing energy scale, and QED becomes strongly coupled at high energy. In fact, the coupling apparently becomes infinite at some finite energy, resulting in a Landau pole. However, one cannot expect the perturbative beta function to give accurate results at strong coupling, and so {{it is likely that the}} Landau pole is an artifact of applying perturbation theory <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> it is no longer valid.|$|E
25|$|With {{the demise}} of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, his empire {{dissolved}} amidst numerous succession wars and the vassals of the empire began to assert their independence. The administration of the southern districts of Tamil Nadu was fragmented with hundreds of Poligars or Palayakkarars governing a few villages each. These local chieftains often fought amongst each other over territory. This turned the political situation in the Tamil country and in South India in general into confusion and chaos. The European traders found themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> they could exploit the prevailing confusion to their own advantage.|$|E

25|$|Although Mali {{has enjoyed}} a {{reasonably}} good inter-ethnic relationships based on {{the long history of}} coexistence, some hereditary servitude and bondage relationship exist, as well as ethnic tension between settled Songhai and nomadic Tuaregs of the north. Due to a backlash against the northern population after independence, Mali is now <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> both groups complain about discrimination {{on the part of the}} other group. This conflict also plays a role in the continuing Northern Mali conflict where there is a tension between both Tuaregs and the Malian government, and the Tuaregs and radical Islamists who are trying to establish sharia law.|$|E
25|$|Studies on the {{formation}} of early states {{tend to focus on}} processes that create and institutionalize a state <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> a state did not exist before. Examples of early states which developed in interaction with other states include the Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations and the Malagasy civilization in Madagascar. Unlike primary state formation, early state formation does not require the creation of the first state in that cultural context or development autonomously, independently from state development nearby. Early state formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, if {{materials}} {{have failed to}} dry out several days after the suspected water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities {{even if it is}} not immediately visible. Through a mold investigation, which may include destructive inspection, one should be able to determine {{the presence or absence of}} mold. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold remediation may be needed. Mold testing and inspections should be carried out by an independent investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to insure accurate results; free mold testing offered by remediation companies is not recommended.|$|E

25|$|If no {{fluorescence}} is detected, {{an interaction}} may still {{exist between the}} proteins of interest, as {{the creation of the}} fusion protein may alter the structure or interaction face of the target protein or the fluorescence fragments may be physically unable to associate. To ensure that this result is not a false negative, that there is no interaction, the protein interaction must be tested <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> fluorescence complementation and activation requires an external signal. In this case, if the external signal fails to cause fluorescence fragment association, {{it is likely that the}} proteins do not interact or there is a physical impediment to fluorescence complementation.|$|E
25|$|Between 1989 and 2006, {{there were}} two {{separate}} FDIC funds– the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted {{to qualify for the}} BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.|$|E
25|$|Janet van Dyne {{is pulled}} into space and placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> she is {{expected}} {{to fight to the}} death with other heroes and villains. Instead of following the wishes of the Stranger—who they thought to be the Beyonder—Janet falls into the leadership position for the group, giving tactical orders in battle and calling upon her years of experience with the Avengers to handle the threats thrown at them. After tension between her and her ex-husband, Janet explains to Medusa why she can't reconcile with Hank Pym, despite an attempt to do so while in London. Upon learning that the Space Phantom has taken on the form of Spider-Man, Janet leads the group and keeps one of the team from being trapped in limbo when the Space Phantom attempts to take the person's form.|$|E
