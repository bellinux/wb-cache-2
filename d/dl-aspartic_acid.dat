The solution was cooled and the glass container it was in was rubbed with 20 mL of water and sat overnight. The result was a grainy precipitate. The next day, 10 mL of water and 10 mL of ethanol {{were added to the}} precipitate and filtered. The solid left over from filtering was put in cellophane dialysis tubing and left in a water bath for four days. When the inside of the tubes were observed and chromatograms were taken, it showed the presence of polypeptide chains. Fox called these protein-like structures [...] "proteinoids." [...] The polypeptide chains were composed of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and amino acids and the percentages of each suggested that the arrangement of the constituents were non-random. The experiment was meant to resemble the drying-out of amino acids in similar conditions to those of primordial Earth. Extremely high temperatures, around 140-180 °C, are required to polymerize amino acids without a catalyst. Fox says in his publications that these temperatures could have been reached in three different scenarios on primordial Earth; hot springs, dried-up lagoons, and pressurized volcanic magma.|$|E

40|$|Crystallisation induced at the {{air-water}} planar interface and oil-water interface in emulsions is explored. <b>DL-Aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> crystallisation under nylon 6 spread films is {{studied by}} neutron reflectivity and ER-FTIR, and {{shows that the}} resulting crystallisation occurs within, rather than underneath the spread film layer. It is shown that 50 % of the nylon 6 surface layer is composed of <b>DL-aspartic</b> <b>acid,</b> despite only 1 - 5 % being {{visible to the naked}} eye. This is attributed to sub-visible crystalline nuclei embedded in the nylon 6 film layer, whose growth to visible dimensions is impeded by the surrounding nylon 6 film. Calcium carbonate crystallisation induced by octadecanoic acid monolayers at moderate surface pressure is studied by GDCD and ER-FTIR and shows a tilting of the monolayer hydrocarbon chain towards the surface normal as crystallization progresses. Addition of polyacrylic acid to the subphase results in formation of an amorphous calcium carbonate film under the monolayer, with no corresponding tilt of the monolayer hydrocarbon chain observed. The crystallisation of ice induced by 1 -heptacosanol at the oil-in-water (o/w) interface in emulsions is studied and shows that a high curvature interface is a less effective ice nucleator than the low curvature systems. A much better ice nucleating ability is even observed when the interfacial density of 1 -heptacosanol is significantly less for the low curvature systems. This is attributed to the larger critical nucleus required for crystallisation induced at a high curvature interface and a poorer ability of the I-heptacosanol to pack in a way that favours ice nucleation. Glycine crystallisation in emulsions is shown for o/w and water-in oil (w/o) cases. Crystallisation in the o/w samples using Span surfactants typically show β-phase spherical crystal aggregates, whereas the o/w show β-phase crystals with elongated morphology. Systems prepared at the phase inversion boundary typically showed a poorer nucleating ability than analogous w/o and o/w emulsion systems. The use of water-soluble additives failed to alter the glycine polymorph, but use of octanoic acid did promote a glycine crystallisation and an unusual honeycomb structure due to the aggregation of octanoic acid attracted to the glycine crystals.

O Ãcido DL-aspÃrtico (C 4 H 7 NO 4) cristaliza-se no grupo espacial C 2 h 6 com oito molÃculas por cÃlula unitÃria, existindo portanto 128 Ãtomos na cÃlula unitÃria que darÃo origem a 384 modos normais de vibraÃÃo. Destes um total de 192 modos sÃo Raman ativos, que poderiam ser observados nos espectros nÃo polarizados, mas que por diversos fatores apenas parte desses modos Ã observada. Fez-se a identificaÃÃo tentativa de todos os modos normais de vibraÃÃo que aparecem no intervalo espectral entre 50 e 3200 cm- 1 e um estudo com variaÃÃo de temperatura entre 10 e 433 K. O intervalo compreendido entre 0 e 150 cm- 1 Ã de extrema importÃncia para detecÃÃes de transiÃÃes de fase estrutural pois contÃm os modos de vibraÃÃo da rede. No caso do Ãcido DL-aspÃrtico ocorreu uma inversÃo de intensidade para os modos em 82 e 87 cm- 1, considerando os extremos do intervalo de temperatura medido. Tal inversÃo foi interpretada como uma pequena mudanÃa conformacional, nada associado a transiÃÃo. Com exceÃÃo desse fato nÃo ocorreram anomalias, nem aparecimento ou surgimento de modos nessa regiÃo, o que apontou para a estabilidade do material. Outro evento ocorreu nessa regiÃo: as bandas em 116 e 132 cm- 1, bastante distintas a baixÃssimas temperaturas (< 150 K) tornam-se indistinguÃveis a 200 K. Tal fato nÃo pode ser associado a uma transiÃÃo de fase pois o prÃprio alargamento das linhas, consequÃncia do aumento da temperatura, implica a superposiÃÃo dos modos. Some-se a isso o fato de que nas vibraÃÃes de torÃÃo do NH 3 e rocking do CO 2 â (modos associados Ãs ligaÃÃes de hidrogÃnio) ter-se observado linearidade nas curvas frequÃncia-temperatura. Por fim realizou-se um estudo de calorimetria diferencial de varredura, confirmando-se o que havia sido observado pela espectroscopia Raman â a estabilidade da estrutura em todo o intervalo de temperatura investigado. This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of Raman scattering in crystals of <b>DL-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> under various temperature conditions. The <b>DL-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 4 H 7 NO 4) crystallizes in space group C 2 h 6 with eight molecules per unit cell, so there are 128 atoms in the unit cell that give rise to 384 normal modes of vibration. Of these modes a total of 192 modes are Raman active, which could be observed in not polarized spectra, but by various factors only some of these modes are observed. We did an attempt identification of all normal modes of vibration that appears in the spectral range between 50 and 3200 cm- 1 and a study with variation in temperature between 10 and 433 K. The interval between 0 and 150 cm- 1 is extremely important for detection of phase transitions because it contains the structural modes of vibration of the lattice. In the case of <b>DL-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> there was a reversal of intensity for the modes at 82 and 87 cm- 1, in considering the extremes of temperature interval measured. This reversal was interpreted as a small conformational change, not associated with a phase transition. With exception of this reversal there were not anomalies, not appearance or disappearance of modes in this region, which pointed to the stability of the material. Another event occurred in this region: the bands at 116 and 132 cm- 1, very different at very low temperatures (< 150 K) become indistinguishable at 200 K. This fact can not be associated with a phase transition because the broadening of bands, arising from increasing temperatures, implies the superposition of modes. Added to this there {{is the fact that the}} torsional vibrations of the NH 3 + and rocking of CO 2 - (modes associated with hydrogen bonds) behaved linearly in frequency-temperature curves. Finally we did a study of differential scanning calorimetry, which confirmed what had been observed by Raman spectroscopy - the stability of the structure throughout the temperature range investigated...|$|E

DL-Histidine at its optimal concentration (20 mg/ml) induced formation of prodigiosin (198 μg of prodigiosin per mg of bacterial protein) after incubation of cultures for 54 hr. Lower concentrations (10 mg/ml) of the other amino acids usually were optimum but less prodigiosin was synthesized, and the maximal amount of pigment occurred between 36 and 48 hr. DL-Methionine was not effective alone but at a low concentration (40 μg/ml) enhanced and accelerated biosynthesis of prodigiosin {{in the presence of}} other suitable amino acids.

Addition of 5 mg of dl-alanine or casein hydrolysate per ml to minimal medium increased by 30 % the amount of prodigiosin formed by growing cells after incubation for 7 days at 27 C. Cultures grown for 7 days at 27 C in 0. 2 % casein hydrolsate formed more prodigiosin than did suspensions of nonproliferating cells containing individual amino acids or casein hydrolysate.

RESULTS: (99 m) Tc-SSS was added during nanoprecipitation, using two different methods, to ensure good encapsulation. Radiolabeled NPs present increased diameters, with identical low polydispersity indexes and negative zeta potentials in comparison to non-radiolabeled NPs. CONCLUSION: A radiotracer was successfully encapsulated, but some further optimization is still needed. The next step will be to modify these radiolabeled NPs with a hepatotrope peptide, and to replace (99 m) Tc with (188) Re for therapy. Our team is also working on drugs' encapsulation and grafting of a fluorescent probe. Combining these modalities is of interest for combined chemo-/radiotherapy, bimodal imaging, and/or theranostic approac...|$|E
