Some examples of an inherently digital input would be a 24 V DC/AC signal, current switch, an air <b>flow</b> <b>switch,</b> or a volta-free relay contact (dry contact).

50|$|Invented in Brazil in the 1930s {{and used}} {{frequently}} since the 1940s, the electric shower {{is a home}} appliance often seen in South American countries due to the higher costs of gas distribution. Earlier models were made of chromed copper or brass, which were expensive, but since 1970, units made of injected plastics are popular due to low prices {{similar to that of}} a hair dryer. Electric showers have a simple electric system, working like a coffee maker, but with a larger water flow. A <b>flow</b> <b>switch</b> turns on the device when water flows through it. Once the water is stopped, the device turns off automatically. An ordinary electric shower often has three heat settings: low (2.5 kW), high (5.5 kW) or cold (0 W) to use when a central heater system is available or in hot seasons.|$|E
50|$|A sail switch, vane switch or <b>flow</b> <b>switch</b> is a {{mechanical}} switch that is switched {{on or off}} {{in response to the}} flow or non-flow of a fluid such as air or water. A sail switch typically operates {{through the use of a}} paddle which gets displaced due to the force of fluid moving past it. Sail switches find application in the detection of fluid flow and measurement of fan speeds. A sail switch might be used to protect a central heating system electric heating element from being energized before the air flow from the blower is established. Sail switches might also be used to alarm if a ventilation fan in a hazardous location fails and air flow has stopped. For some HVAC systems, a sail switch can activate an electronic air cleaner, a humidifier, or other equipment in response to airflow from the system fan.|$|E

40|$|Introduction One of the {{principal}} design considerations in a <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> network {{is the definition of}} a <b>flow.</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>switching</b> uses a network of connection oriented <b>switches</b> that allow <b>flows</b> to be cut-through on their own connection. The granularity of a flow can vary over a wide range from the very fine, for example an individual application level transaction, to the very coarse, such as the aggregated traffic on the next hop between adjacent routing nodes. There are technical trade-offs to be considered together with the constraints of current technology when addressing the question of the appropriate level of aggregation. It appears that all the levels of aggregation have their place in <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> and that the aggregation level should be a parameter available to network designers for optimization. <b>Flows</b> and <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> networks <b>Flow</b> <b>switching</b> networks are characterized by the combination of conventional store-and-forward routi...|$|R

5000|$|The system {{consists}} of all vital components for monitoring and controlling the {{discharge from the}} vessel's oily water separator. The white box includes a stainless steel cage with a locked door. The bilge water from the oily water separator is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil content meter. A <b>flow</b> <b>switch</b> secures that there is flow through the oil content meter and a flow meter counts the accumulated discharged overboard volume. If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil content meter is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil content meter, accumulated discharged volume, door position together with the vessels geographical position and time. The chief engineer possesses the key and when locked, the system [...] cannot be tampered with and equally importantly provides {{the evidence that the}} vessel has been compliant. The recorder data is stored in an encrypted format and can be presented to any official body such as Port State Control, United States Coast Guard, Vetting or Classification society officials to prove that the vessel has been compliant to MARPOL 73/78 (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships) or any national regulation, and that no illegal discharge has been made.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: We {{investigated}} whether {{control of}} constitutive endothelial cell {{nitric oxide synthase}} (cNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) by changes in shear stress might be important for the regulation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth and vascular diameter. Methods: Bilateral femoral arteriovenous fistulas were placed in baboons to increase the blood flow in the external iliac arteries. At 2 months, the fistula was ligated on one side to restore normal flow (<b>flow</b> <b>switch).</b> Results: In response to <b>flow</b> <b>switch</b> {{and a decrease in}} shear stress, iliac artery lumenal area decreased and SMC proliferation was induced. A decline in NO production, cNOS messenger RNA (mRNA), and protein were associated with these biological effects. In a subset of animals with iliac arteries under high flow, infusion of NÏ-nitro-l-arginine, an inhibitor of cNOS, did not induce proliferation. Conclusion: Shear stress can regulate cNOS, vasoconstriction, and SMC proliferation. A decrease in nitric oxide may be necessary, but is not sufficient to induce SMC proliferation in response to a decrease in blood flow. (J Vasc Surg 1998 : 28 : 514 - 21. ...|$|E
