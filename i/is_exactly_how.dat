5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> the previous system worked.|$|E
25|$|There are {{infinite}} ordinals as well: {{the smallest}} infinite ordinal is ω, {{which is the}} order type of the natural numbers (finite ordinals) and that can even be identified with the set of natural numbers (indeed, the set of natural numbers is well-ordered—as is any set of ordinals—and since it is downward closed it can be identified with the ordinal associated with it, which <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> ω is defined).|$|E
25|$|Most {{changes in}} {{cellular}} metabolism that allow cells {{to grow in}} a disorderly fashion lead to cell death. However once cancer begins, cancer cells undergo a process of natural selection: the few cells with new genetic changes that enhance their survival or reproduction continue to multiply, and soon come to dominate the growing tumor, as cells with less favorable genetic change are out-competed. This <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> pathogens such as MRSA can become antibiotic-resistant (or how HIV can become drug-resistant), and the same reason why crop blights and pests can become pesticide-resistant. This evolution is why cancer recurrences will have cells that have acquired cancer-drug resistance (or in some cases, resistance to radiation from radiotherapy).|$|E

50|$|As {{a tribute}} to the late {{director}} Kim Jong-hak (who died on July 23, 2013), cable subsidiary SBS Plus aired reruns of Sandglass from July 29 to August 15, 2013 at 20:40 every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with two consecutive episodes per night. This <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> the show <b>was</b> originally broadcast in 1995.|$|R
500|$|Several pre-release {{reviews of}} the episode were {{generally}} positive. Bruce Miller of the Sioux City Journal gave the episode a largely positive review and noted that [...] "If you can erase last season from your mind, you'll see this ... <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> The Office should have carried on after Steve Carell left." [...] Furthermore, he praised the addition of Duke and Lacy, calling their performances [...] "so good you could see them become {{the centerpiece of a}} new series." [...] Verne Gay of Newsweek awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and called the installment [...] "very (very) funny." [...] He was especially happy about the addition of Lacy and Duke, calling them [...] "flashbacks to a younger Jim and Dwight." [...] Furthermore, he noted that [...] "the ninth and final season actually may offer completion" [...] of a show that has just [...] "merely offered variations on [...] tics" [...] for the past eight seasons. Bob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the episode [...] "generally funnier than [...] was last season" [...] and wrote that the episode would be a good opportunity [...] "for viewers who quit the [...] last year ... {{to come back to the}} show." [...] Particularly, he was excited to [...] "see the seeds of the show's end planted." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the updated}} Player Search System (PSS) present {{at all times}} on the touchscreen, {{providing}} a seamless transition from solo play to player-to-player battles and trades, integration of online play was praised as [...] "masterly" [...] by Eurogamer. Polygon described it as [...] "completely interconnected experience, which <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> Pokemon {{is meant to be}} played". IGN stated that the PSS [...] "makes Pokémon X and Y feel dramatically new and more modern". The optional aspects of Pokémon-Amie and Super Training had mixed reception. Game Informer described the minigames of Super Training as forgettable. Polygon viewed these aspects as positively reinforcing bonds between trainers and their Pokémon, with Pokémon-Amie making them seem more like pets. IGN praised Super Training for making competitive training more accessible to players.|$|E
2500|$|Many of George's predicaments {{were based}} on David's past real-life experiences. In [...] "The Revenge", for example, when George quits his job in a fury only to realize {{he has made a}} mistake, he goes back the next day as if nothing happened; this mirrors David's actions while working as a writer for Saturday Night Live, when he quit and then {{returned}} to his job in the same manner. [...] As the show progressed, Alexander discovered that the character was based on David. As Alexander explains in an interview for the Seinfeld DVD, during an early conversation with David, Alexander questioned a script, saying, [...] "This could never happen to anyone, and even if it did, no human being would react like this." [...] David replied, [...] "What do you mean? This happened to me once, and this <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> I reacted." [...] After that, Alexander changed his performance from an imitation of Woody Allen to what he has called a [...] "shameless imitation of Larry David." ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 22, 1799, Decatur was {{promoted}} to lieutenant by President John Adams after serving {{for more than a}} year as midshipman aboard the frigate United States. [...] While United States was undergoing repairs Decatur received orders to remain in Philadelphia to recruit and assemble a crew for the vessel. While there, the chief mate of an Indiaman, using foul language, made several derogatory remarks about Decatur and the U.S. Navy, apparently because he had lost some of his crew to Decatur's recruiting efforts. Decatur remained calm and left the scene without further incident. When he related the matter to his father, however, Captain Decatur stressed that the honor of the family and of the Navy had been insulted and that his son should return and challenge the chief mate to a duel. Stephen's friend and shipmate, Lieutenant Somers, was sent ahead with a letter from Decatur asking if an apology could be obtained from the man. Refusing to apologize, the chief mate instead accepted Decatur's challenge and secured a location for the duel. Decatur, being an expert shot with a pistol, told his friend Lieutenant Charles Stewart that he believed his opponent not to be as able and he would thus endeavour to only wound his opponent in the hip, which <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> the duel turned out. The honor and courage of both duelists having been satisfied, the matter was resolved without a fatality.|$|E

I shall be perfectly happy if only you will be content to go with me and to grant at least that the work I am doing is worth while.

60|$|From {{this simple}} origin, then, the whole vast {{difference}} {{of right and}} left in civilised life takes its beginning. At first, no doubt, {{the superiority of the}} right hand was only felt in the matter of fighting. But that alone gave it a distinct pull, and paved the way, at last, for its supremacy elsewhere. For when weapons came into use, the habitual employment of the right hand to grasp the spear, sword, or knife made the nerves and muscles of the right side far more obedient to the control of the will than those of the left. The dexterity thus acquired by the right--see how the very word 'dexterity' implies this fact--made it more natural for the early hunter and artificer to employ the same hand preferentially in the manufacture of flint hatchets, bows and arrows, and in all the other manifold activities of savage life. It was the hand with which he grasped his weapon; it was therefore the hand with which he chipped it. To the very end, however, the right hand remains especially 'the hand in which you hold your knife;' and that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> our own children to this day decide the question which is which, when they begin to know their right hand from their left for practical purposes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{pouring into}} these letters, Stephen, the {{concentrated}} venom {{of years of}} brooding. My heart is black with rebellion against my lot and against the lot of woman. I have been given life and a fine position in the world, I made one fatal blunder in marrying to make these things secure, and now I can do nothing with it all and I {{have nothing to do}} with it. It astounds me to think of the size of our establishments, Stephen, of the extravagant way in which whole counties and great countries pay tribute to pile up the gigantic heap of wealth upon which we two lead our lives of futile entanglement. In this place alone there are fourteen gardeners and garden helps, and this is not one of our garden places. Three weeks ago I spent a thousand pounds on clothes in one great week of shopping, and our yearly expenditure upon personal effect, upon our magnificence and our margins cannot be greatly less than forty-five thousand pounds. I walk about our house and gardens, I take one of the carriages or one of the automobiles and go to some large pointless gathering of hundreds and thousands and thousands of pounds, and we walk about and say empty little things, and the servants don't laugh at us, the butlers don't laugh at us, the people in the street tolerate us.... It has an effect of collective insanity.... You know the story of one of those dear Barons of the Cinque Ports--a decent plumber-body from Rye or Winchelsea--one of the six--or eight--who claimed the privilege of carrying the canopy over the King"--she is speaking of King Edward's coronation of course--"how that he was discovered suddenly to be speaking quite audibly to the sacred presence so near to him: 'It is very remarkable--we should be here, your majesty--very remarkable.'
