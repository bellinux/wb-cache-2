I wanted to show that, in theory, today one could follow the entire chain of record production, from start to finish, on his own. But in practice it is very different. We cannot be burdened with all of the responsibilities of the record label. But I'm glad <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>for</b> having tried to." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{arranging}} {{a recording}} contract with A Records in 1982 for a then sixteen-year-old Janet, her father Joseph Jackson oversaw the entire production of her debut album, Janet Jackson, and its follow-up, Dream Street (1984); {{the latter of}} which was written and produced by Jesse Johnson and Janet's brothers Marlon and Michael. Jackson was initially reluctant to begin a recording career, commenting [...] "I was coming off of a TV show that I absolutely hated doing, Fame. I didn't want to do [...] I {{wanted to go to}} college. But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> my father..." [...] and elaborated that she was often in conflict with her producers. Amidst her professional struggles, she rebelled against her family's wishes by marrying James DeBarge of the family recording group DeBarge in 1984. The Jacksons disapproved of the relationship, citing DeBarge's immaturity and substance abuse. Jackson left her husband in January 1985 and was granted an annulment later that year.|$|E
500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to get that out of my system." ...|$|E

500|$|Joseph Jackson, {{patriarch of}} the Jackson family of musicians, was known for {{managing}} the careers of all nine of his children; most notably, the successful career of The Jackson 5. After arranging a recording contract with A in 1982 for a then 16-year-old Janet, he oversaw the entire production of her debut album, Janet Jackson, and its follow-up, Dream Street (1984); the latter of which was written and produced by her brothers Marlon and Michael, and Jesse Johnson. Best known as a television actress, she was initially reluctant to begin a recording career. She said, [...] "I was coming off of a TV show that I absolutely hated doing, Fame.

500|$|The 1999–2000 season {{would be}} Barkley's final {{year in the}} NBA. Initially, Barkley {{averaged}} 14.5 points on [...]477 shooting and 10.5 rebounds per game. Along with Shaquille O'Neal, Barkley was ejected from a November 10, 1999 game against the Los Angeles Lakers. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal. Barkley's season and career seemingly ended prematurely {{at the age of}} 36 after rupturing his left quadriceps tendon on December 8, 1999 in Philadelphia, where his career began. Refusing to allow his injury to be the last image of his career, Barkley returned after four months for one final game. On April 19, 2000, in a home game against the Vancouver Grizzlies, Barkley scored a memorable basket on an offensive rebound and putback, a common trademark during his career. He accomplished what he set out to do after being activated from the injured list, and walked off the court to a standing ovation. He stated, [...] "I can't explain what tonight meant. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me. I've won and lost a lot of games, but the last memory I had was being carried off the court. I couldn't get over the mental block of being carried off the court. It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own." [...] After the basket, Barkley immediately retired and concluded his sixteen-year Hall of Fame career.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 12 October 1954 with a night shoot at Chessington Zoo and continued from 18 October 1954 into December. The budget was £42,000, low {{even by the}} standards of Hammer at the time. [...] Special effects technician Les Bowie recalled, [...] "We did Quatermass on a budget so low it wasn't a real budget. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> wages not as a proper effects man who gets allocated a certain budget for a movie". The shots of the emergency services rushing to the rocket crash site {{at the beginning of the}} movie were filmed in the village of Bray, Berkshire, where Hammer's studios were located. The scenes with the crashed rocket were shot in a corn field at Water Oakley, near Bray. It was originally intended to make the crash site look more spectacular by setting fire to the field but bad weather put paid to this idea. Guest used a wide-angle lens for these shots to convey a feeling of vastness to the scene. Carroon's encounter with the little girl was filmed at the East India Docks in London. A second unit, under cameraman Len Harris, conducted additional location shooting around London for the montage scenes of the police search for Carroon. For the shot of the lights of London going out when the electricity is diverted to Westminster Abbey, an agreement was made with one of the engineers at Battersea Power Station to turn off the lights illuminating the outside of the station; however the engineer misunderstood and briefly cut all the power along the River Thames. Most of the remaining location shooting was done in the Windsor area. The rest of the film was shot at Hammer's Bray Studios, with the New Stage there housing the sets for the hospital and the interior of Westminster Abbey. Michael Carreras had written to the Abbey seeking permission to film there but was refused. The rooms of Down Place, the former country house Bray Studios were built around, were used for other scenes such as Inspector Lomax's office. Art director James Elder Wills, in his final film for Hammer, made great use of the existing architecture of Down Place to enhance the effectiveness of his sets.|$|E

[...] "This has been a dream of mine to recreate this walk", he explained. [...] "To {{be able to walk}} in his exact footsteps is an extremely huge honor, and I did this for him as much as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> my family to get some closure."

2500|$|The {{president}} of the Independent Democrats, Patricia de Lille, told the court she was handed information by people whose identity she did not disclose. She first asked for a commission of inquiry into the arms deal. When that was refused she asked Mbeki to issue a proclamation to allow the Heath unit to investigate. She said that her [...] "role was {{to pass on the}} information and hope and pray that it will be investigated. I was ostracised, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the people of the country. I wanted to assist government to root out the few bad apples."

Marie-Hélène, age 17, said [...] "I didn't really want to stand for the one minute silence, I didn't think it was right to pay homage to a man who insulted Islam and other religions too". Abdul, age 14, said [...] "of course everyone stood for the one minute silence, and that includes all Muslims... <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> those who were killed, but not for Charlie. I have no pity for him, he had no respect for us Muslims". It also {{reported that}} for most students at the Paul Eluard high school in Saint-Denis, freedom of expression is perceived as being [...] "incompatible with their faith". For Erica, who describes herself as Catholic, [...] "there are wrongs on both sides". A fake bomb was planted in the faculty lounge at the school.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 January 2006, it was {{announced}} that the band had reformed and signed a record deal with Parlophone. They subsequently began work on their third studio album, Studio 1. The first single, [...] "Rock Steady" [...] (released in November 2006), reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. Studio 1 entered the albums chart at number forty and sold 60,000 copies according to the BPI, being certified silver. A second single, [...] "Chick Fit" [...] failed to reach the top 200. Blatt discussed the reunion's failure in an interview with i-D magazine in 2012: [...] "I don't think it was done for the right reasons...
