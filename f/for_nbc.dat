5|$|After his {{retirement}} {{as a player}} in 1994, Simms first joined ESPN {{then went on to}} join NBC's lead broadcast crew, teaming with Dick Enberg and Paul Maguire on that network's coverage of Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XXXII.

5|$|In 1983, Nolan Bushnell {{founded a}} new computer-guided {{animation}} studio called Kadabrascope as {{a subsidiary of}} his Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres company, {{which was founded in}} 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas movie <b>for</b> <b>NBC</b> starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots. The animation movement would be made using Tweening instead of traditional cel animation. After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) would be sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope would be sold to LucasFilm. The Kadabrascope assets would be combined with the Computer Division of LucasFilm. Coincidentally, Steve Jobs, a main Apple shareholder and former CEO, worked under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT. PTT would later go bankrupt in 1985 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.|$|E
