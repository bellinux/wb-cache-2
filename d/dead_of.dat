5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making {{reference to the}} <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War. Many Zimbabweans see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} the white community than the black majority. Southern Rhodesia's <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> the two World Wars today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1975, Alyeska {{terminated}} Ketchbaw's {{contract and}} took responsibility for analyzing weld X-Rays itself. The controversy continued, however, as Kelley's lawsuit moved forward, a Ketchbaw manager was found <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> cyanide poisoning, and photographs of welds {{were stolen from a}} pump station construction camp. Alyeska began a review of all 30,800 welds that had been done in 1975, and submitted its report to the Interior Department in April 1976. In May, it submitted its technical analysis and a report on repair work under way. The review produced a list of 3,955 questionable welds—10 percent of 1975's work.|$|E

5|$|In 1981 a {{memorial}} {{to the men who}} died in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board, followed by a second in 2006, to honour the <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> both the 1901 and 1913 explosions. In October 2013, on the centenary of the tragedy, a Welsh national memorial to those killed in all Wales's mining disasters was unveiled at the former pithead, depicting a rescue worker coming to the aid of one of the survivors of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Europe, Romania built {{what were}} termed heroes' war grave cemeteries, either in {{existing}} heroes' cemeteries, on {{the sites of}} the World War I battles, or in new cemeteries symbolically placed {{on the edges of}} towns. The situation was somewhat different in Russia, however, where the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was used not just for the war <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> World War I, but also for the casualties of the Civil War, and then the victims of the secret police. It was finally closed by the Bolsheviks in 1925 and turned into a park; subsequently, possibly on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the Eastern Orthodox church and the headstones were systematically destroyed until almost no trace of the cemetery remained.|$|E

5|$|Messiaen's {{music was}} {{by this time}} championed by, among others, Pierre Boulez, who {{programmed}} first performances at his Domaine musical concerts and the Donaueschingen festival. Works performed included Réveil des oiseaux, Chronochromie (commissioned for the 1960 festival) and Couleurs de la cité céleste. The latter piece {{was the result of}} a commission for a composition for three trombones and three xylophones; Messiaen added to this more brass, wind, percussion and piano, and specified a xylophone, xylorimba and marimba rather than three xylophones. Another work of this period, Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum, was commissioned as a commemoration of the <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> the two World Wars and was performed first semi-privately in the Sainte-Chapelle, then publicly in Chartres Cathedral with Charles de Gaulle in the audience.|$|E

Meanwhile, as Mulder investigates Jorge's corpse, the room shakes. The door opens and the shadowy figure of an alien appears. Scully wakes Mulder up the next morning, finding him excited about the readouts and tapes of the signals—the proof of aliens he has sought for so long. However, the Blue Beret team arrives, forcing them to flee with only a tape reel.|$|E
5|$|One morning, after Tod's {{escape from}} the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt. After {{he picks up the}} fox's trail, Copper relentlessly pursues him {{throughout}} the day and into the next morning. Tod finally drops <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion, and Copper collapses on top of him, close to death himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, but after a few months the excitement over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E

5|$|The idea to memorialize the Confederate war <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> Hampshire County {{was first}} {{discussed}} {{in the spring of}} 1866. Following the decoration of the graves that summer, the Confederate Memorial Association engaged in fundraising for construction of the memorial, and by 1867 the necessary funds were raised. The inscription The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights was selected, and the contract for the memorial's construction was awarded to the Gaddes Brothers firm of Baltimore. The memorial's components were delivered to Indian Mound Cemetery on September14, 1867, and the memorial was dedicated on September 26 of that year. The construction of the Confederate Memorial marked the beginning of an era of post-war revitalization for Hampshire County following the American Civil War.|$|E
