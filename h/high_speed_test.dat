2500|$|Clarkson often {{discusses}} {{high speed}} driving on public roads, criticising road safety campaigns involving cameras and speed bumps. In 2002, a Welsh Assembly Member Alun Pugh wrote to BBC director general Greg Dyke {{to complain about}} Clarkson's comments that he believed encouraged people to use Welsh roads as a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>test</b> track. A BBC spokesman said that suggestions Clarkson had encouraged speeding were [...] "nonsense". Clarkson has also made similar comments about driving in Lincolnshire. As of 2004 Clarkson was reported as having a clean licence. In a November 2005 Times article, Clarkson wrote on the Bugatti Veyron, [...] "On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted {{to reach the top}} speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240 mph," [...] and [...] "From the wheel of a Veyron, France {{is the size of a}} small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn't believe me." [...] In 2007, solicitor Nick Freeman represented Clarkson against a charge of driving at 86mph in a 50mph zone on the A40 road in London, defeating it on the basis that the driver of the car loaned to Clarkson from Alfa Romeo could not be ascertained. In 2008, Clarkson claimed in a talk at the Hay Festival to have been given a speeding ticket for driving at 186mph on the A1203 Limehouse Link road in London.|$|E

2500|$|Neither Pixie IIIA, {{competing}} as biplanes, made as {{much impact}} at Lympne 1924, with the Cherub engined machine retiring early, though it flew {{later in the}} week as a monoplane.

Douglas completed all tasks but the two sets of five laps required by the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>tests.</b> [...] Only two aircraft, the Bristol Brownie and the Beardmore Wee Bee, the overall winner, did complete these <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>tests.</b> [...] It was the top-scorer in the low <b>speed</b> <b>test.</b> [...] At the end of the Lympne trials, no.19 went on to compete in the Grosvenor Cup handicap, where it finished fifth.
