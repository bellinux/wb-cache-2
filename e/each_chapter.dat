The year was initially believed to be 2003, coinciding with {{the date of the}} manga's serialization, but Azuma has stated that the manga always takes place in the present day. This allows the appearance of products created after 2003, such as the Nintendo DS Mr. Ayase plays in chapter forty-two.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 27 chapters, with a prelude, coda, {{bibliography}} and index. <b>Each</b> <b>chapter</b> deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks.

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} and sixteen chapters. <b>Each</b> <b>chapter</b> is written {{from the perspective of}} one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God.

5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, <b>each</b> <b>chapter</b> starting with a section giving {{a detailed description of the}} reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in <b>each</b> <b>chapter</b> then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E

5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The {{point of view of}} <b>each</b> <b>chapter</b> in the story is a limited {{perspective}} of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.|$|E
5|$|After VE Day, Ismay {{accompanied}} Churchill to the Potsdam Conference. Like Yalta, {{the conference}} focussed primarily on political issues, {{so there was}} little for Ismay to do. After Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election, becoming Prime Minister, Ismay kept his position, working with Attlee at the conference, but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends {{for the remainder of}} their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on <b>each</b> <b>chapter</b> of his manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with {{objectives}} which range from clearing enemy groups to capturing points of importance. Each map has unique terrain to be negotiated in battle ranging from mountains to rivers and flat plains. Viewed from an overhead perspective, there are castles and locations such as shops that the player can visit, the latter of which provides a means for obtaining items. <b>Each</b> <b>chapter</b> has {{a different set of}} victory conditions, which can be related to the number of turns taken or how the enemy force is dealt with. Battles play out using a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During battle, the combat screen appears, showing the fight from a sidelong perspective. Both sides move at least once, after which the combat screen fades. Battles between individual units are governed by the series' recurring Weapons Triangle, a rock–paper–scissors system where certain weapons have advantages over others — lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. As they participate in battles, each unit gains experience points (EXP) from their actions: they raise their experience level by one when they have accumulated 100 EXP. EXP can be earned in both normal battles and challenge fights in special arenas. Players can save at the end of <b>each</b> <b>chapter</b> or outside battle. They also have a single mid-chapter save available. All units are subject to permanent death: If a unit dies in battle, they are removed {{from the rest of the}} campaign.|$|E

5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it was rather simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of <b>each</b> <b>chapter</b> for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E

5|$|Kobayashi and his editors {{collaborated on}} the plotlines. Kobayashi would then draw the basic {{illustrations}} for <b>each</b> <b>chapter</b> before passing his material to assistants to finish. As the series' manga artist, Kobayashi also designed the cover art. Originally, the fifth volume's front cover was to feature Akira Takano, but after re-reading the volume Kobayashi concluded that since {{much of its}} plot in that volume revolves around Karen Ichijo, she {{should be on the}} cover instead. Desiring to feature a male character, he placed Harima on the cover of volume six. Kobayashi designed a poster to commemorate the ending of the series with the final chapter of School Rumble Z.|$|E
5|$|Kubah was {{the second}} novel written by Ahmad Tohari, {{who had been in}} senior high school when the G30S {{announced}} its coup. A devout Muslim who had trained as a doctor and ran a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Central Java, Tohari began to focus on writing when his first novel, Di Kaki Bukit Cibalak (On the Foothill of Cibalak; 1978), won a prize from the Jakarta Arts Council. He finished Kubah in two months, first making a thematic overview for <b>each</b> <b>chapter</b> and then developing it further while writing. He deliberately left the novel's ending open to interpretation, intending for readers to think for themselves.|$|E
