40|$|WOS: 000362058600048 International audienceIn an {{energetic}} world of fossil fuel, {{there is a}} need to reduce the CO 2 emission released to the atmosphere. CO 2 Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is one of the solutions. To optimize the CO 2 capture cost, thermodynamic cycles of power plants have to be modified, and resulting new designs inevitably lead to new combustion modes [1][2][3]. CO 2 capture of post combustion gases can be performed using membrane processes, but its efficiency is interesting only if the CO 2 concentration in the combustion process exhaust gases is higher than 30 % [4]. Unfortunately, in classical combustion processes (e. g. gas turbine), <b>diluted</b> <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Gases</b> (EG) contain no more than 5 % of CO 2 because combustion products are strongly diluted in air. Our objective consists in increasing the EG CO 2 concentration, by using both Oxygen-Enriched Air (OEA) combustion and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Our approach is based on numerical simulations and on experimental work. First, operating parameters which minimize the CO 2 capture cost are calculated and compared with the reference capture cost [5] (achieved by amine absorption of CO 2). In parallel, experiments and additional calculations are performed in order to check the quality and the operability of such combustion mode. This paper is organized as follows: the first part presents the optimization of a new thermodynamic GTCC cycle, using OEA and EGR to increase EG CO 2 concentration and capturing it in post-combustion with membrane separator. The effects of pressure and membrane selectivity will be studied in terms of CO 2 capture cost, avoided CO 2, implemented membrane surface, EGR rate and OEA quality. The second part is dedicated to the experimental and calculation [6] studies of combustion met in this type of configuration. A premixed swirl flame is fed first with Air, CH 4 and CO 2, then with OEA, CH 4 and EGR. To neglect the thermal aspect of NOx production, measurements are performed at constant adiabatic flame temperature. The flame structure, combustion instability and pollutant emissions are presented as a function of the EGR rate dilution...|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{particulate}} {{is composed}} of spherical or nearly spherical primary particles. In this study, the primary particle size and nanostructure were investigated at five engine operating conditions for a medium-duty direct injection diesel engine, using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM). The diesel particles were collected from <b>diluted</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> and an ultrasonic extraction method was used for obtaining the TEM samples. The TEM images reveal that primary particle size and nanostructure depend on the engine operating conditions. The mean diameter of the primary particles is in the range 23. 8 - 28. 5. nm, depending on the engine speed and engine load. The nanostructure could reflect the particle formation processes. The larger primary particles are formed at low engine speed and high engine load. They have irregular shape and distinguishable trace of pre-formed particle, indicating the combined effect of particle coalescence and surface growth. Primary particles with core-shell structure are common at high engine load with different engine speeds. The particles exhibit disorder structure at low engine load and high engine speed due to lower in-cylinder gas temperature and shorter combustion duration. Quantitative analysis of the nanostructures indicates that graphitization of primary particles is affected by engine load but not by engine speed. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of turbulent spray combustion occurs in all industrial furnaces that consume liquid fuels. It {{is essential that}} a furnace is capable to have high efficiency and performance while the pollutant emissions meet the stricter national and international regulations. One of the recently proposed solutions to improve the aforementioned conditions is flameless spray combustion. In this process the combustion of fuel is done with oxidizer <b>diluted</b> with recirculated <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases,</b> which results in a lower peak temperature and more distributed reaction zone, so the NOx produced in conventional burners is highly reduced. Hence, {{it can be a}} promising approach in order to increase efficiency and decrease pollutant emission. Because flameless combustion is a novel concept, it should be fully investigated and optimized before being applied to large-scale cases. Due to the considerable costs of experimental tests, numerical simulation is used more and more to predict the performance of the flameless furnaces before utilizing them in a real case. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop and validate computational models for flameless spray combustion base on a validation study using the Delft Spray-in-Hot-Coflow (DSHC) flame. The burner has been designed to mimic the flameless oxidation of light oils. The properties of DSHC ethanol flames are computed by using a combination of CFD models for turbulence, chemistry and dispersed multiphase flow. The results are validated by comparison with the available experimental data for gas-phase velocity and temperature as well as droplets statistics. Furthermore, the experimental data are available for another case in which air is used instead of air <b>diluted</b> with <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> This case is also simulated to validate the models. This study employs a Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulation approach. The combination of different turbulence and combustion models is investigated while the standard Lagrangian spray model is kept the same. The steady flamelet and the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) models are two combustion models that are validated. It is shown that the FGM model can predict flame structure such as double-reaction region, lift-off, etc. better than the steady flamelet model. Moreover, it was observed that the Reynolds stress and the realizable k-epsilon models show similar results while the standard k-epsilon model performs differently. The effects of other models and parameters are also investigated. The results show that radiative heat transfer, secondary atomization and coalescence of droplets as well as buoyancy have negligible effects on the DSHC ethanol flame. Still, the effects of complete two-way coupling between two phases (liquid and gas) are demonstrated to be important.

40|$|A new {{dual fuel}} Controlled Auto-Ignition (CAI) {{combustion}} concept was proposed and researched for lower exhaust emissions and better fuel economy. The concept takes {{the advantage of}} the complementary physical and chemical properties of high octane number gasoline and high cetane number Di-Methyl Ether (DME) to organize the combustion process. Homogeneous gasoline/air mixture is utilized as the main combustible charge, which is realised by a low-cost Port Fuel Injection (PFI) system. Pressurised DME is directly injected into cylinder via a commercial Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) injector. Flexible DME injection strategies are employed to realise the controlled auto ignition of the premixed charge. The engine is operated at Wide Open Throttle (WOT) in the entire operating region in order to minimize the intake pumping loss. Engine load is controlled by varing the amount of internal Exhaust Gas Recirculation (iEGR) which is achieved and adjusted by Positive Valve Overlap (PVO) and/or exhaust back pressure, and exhaust rebreathing method.

40|$|The {{challenge}} of achieving {{a clean and}} stable combustion in modem power plants or aero engines leads to develop new technologies and new combustors. Pioneer work on 'flameless' combustion has shown the great potential of such a technology for meeting modem requirements in term of safety and. low emissions. The idea behind this technique is to ensure low emissions by operating at very low fuel/air equivalence ratio but with high preheating to stabilize the combustion. In addition, a careful design of the combustor should ensure that fresh gases are <b>diluted</b> by hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> The result is a distributed but efficient oxidation region. This paper presents a new efficient model for simulating 'flameless' oxidation. The model is based on Large Eddy Simulation (LES) ensuring an accurate description of the mixing. In addition, a 'low-cost' technique for coupling the LES code with some complex chemistry is presented. This approach was used for simulating a reacting jet close to the 'flameless' regime. The simulation showed the capability of the present LES tool for understanding the flow dynamics and improving the design of 'flameless' combustors...|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} engine exhaust contain {{moisture}} {{that must be}} maintained in gaseous state when sampling particulates to prevent potential destruction of the particles or damage to the measurement apparatus. This is normally achieved by diluting the sample {{in order to reduce}} the partial pressure, thus avoiding condensation. When measuring size distributions of particulates emitted from a gasoline engine, a dilution ratio of at least 5 : 1 is recommended. However, in some operating modes (e. g. lean homogenous modes) or measurement locations (e. g. downstream of a particulate filter) this ratio can be too high for high-resolution measurements due to the low levels of particulates. The presented study investigates the potential for using a nafion dryer to remove water from the <b>exhaust</b> instead of <b>diluting</b> the sample. An electrical mobility measurement device, a Cambustion DMS 500 mk II, was operated without <b>diluting</b> the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> but with a nafion dryer to remove water from the exhaust. These dryers are commonly used for measuring particulates in airborne aerosols, but no information has been found in the open literature on their application in engine research. The sampling system was connected to a four cylinder SGDI-engine operating in modes that generate small amount of particulates. Samples were taken in four operating conditions, downstream of the catalyst. Overall losses in the complete system and components of the system were determined by tests with an artificially generated aerosol. Factors such as particulate losses, system performance and sample manipulation are discussed. Particulate size distributions were successfully recorded in operating regimes in which they are difficult to measure with conventional sampling systems using the required dilution. Particulate losses were found to be small in the nafion dryer but large in the heated hose prior to the nafion dryer...|$|R
