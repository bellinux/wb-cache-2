5|$|And to Think That <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> on Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book. It was {{published}} under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows {{a boy named}} Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father {{at the end of}} his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.|$|E
5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> go in, so I jumped.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E

25|$|He won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958 for Horton Hatches the Egg {{and again}} in 1961 for And to Think That <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> on Mulberry Street. Geisel's birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an {{initiative}} on reading created by the National Education Association.|$|E
25|$|Geisel's {{earliest}} elephants {{were for}} advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do. With And to Think That <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> on Mulberry Street! (1937) and Horton Hatches the Egg (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like angel wings and thus {{appropriate to the}} saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons. Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.|$|E

25|$|I saw as my {{farewell}} to the major stage of cricket, {{and it would be}} dishonest to say <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> sentimentally as an actor or an opera singer who wants to leave the stage with a memorable performance...I hoped to return to Australia for the fifth time, this time as England captain, and win the Ashes with the team I had built, nutured and encouraged. I was to learn, or course, that such romantic conceptions are not only born in the minds of fiction writers, but can die there as well.|$|E
25|$|I confess that, as {{a student}} unaware {{of the history of}} the subject and unaware of the {{connection}} with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.|$|E
25|$|Geisel {{was born}} and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. All four of his {{grandparents}} were German immigrants. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book And to Think That <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team.|$|E

25|$|In 1936, {{the couple}} were {{returning}} from an ocean voyage to Europe when {{the rhythm of the}} ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book: And to Think That <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> on Mulberry Street. Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers. According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press. Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II. This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by Horton Hatches the Egg in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.|$|E
500|$|A {{large crowd}} had started {{gathering}} around the paddock {{hours before the}} Belmont, many missing the races run {{earlier in the day}} for a chance to see the horses up close. Secretariat and Chenery were greeted with an enthusiasm that Chenery responded to with a wave or smile; Secretariat was imperturbable. A large cheer went up at the break, but as the race went on, the two most commonly reported reactions were disbelief and fear that Secretariat had gone too fast. When it was clear that Secretariat would win, the sound reached a crescendo that reportedly made the grandstand shake. Blood-Horse magazine editor Kent Hollingsworth described the impact: [...] "Two twenty-four flat! I don't believe it. Impossible. But <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> I can't breathe. He won by a sixteenth of a mile! <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> I have to believe it." ...|$|E
500|$|Smart {{also said}} of the opening scene that: [...] "It encapsulates that {{character}} in one moment and says so much about her impulsiveness. We could not have accomplished that with a dozen speeches. When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in the script, I thought 'this is great, this lady {{is going to be}} fun to play.|$|E

500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> the first time, I {{thought it was the}} story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Fernandez {{said of his}} design, [...] "I {{knew the}} dress {{would be one of}} other amazing pieces Gaga wore that night. It's very well made and looked great on her, on and off camera. We didn't get a chance to have a fitting. The only time she had it on was for the VMAs. Only when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in the monitor did I know it would be big." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, M.I.A. voiced {{her fears}} of the {{influence}} of video game violence on her son and his generation, saying, [...] "I don't know which is worse. The fact that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in my life has maybe given me lots of issues, but there's a whole generation of American kids seeing violence on their computer screens and then getting shipped off to Afghanistan. They feel like they know the violence when they don't. Not having a proper understanding of violence, especially what it's like {{on the receiving end of}} it, just makes you interpret it wrong and makes inflicting violence easier." ...|$|E

500|$|A Game Boy Color {{version of}} Jet Force Gemini was in {{development}} in 2000, but was ultimately cancelled. The {{owner of the}} prototype cartridge has attested that the game appears to be nearly complete, though it was never officially announced by either Rare or Nintendo. In an October 2012 interview, former Rare designer and producer Martin Wakeley commented: [...] "Jet Force Gemini on the Gameboy was the only occasion I can remember Rare outsourcing anything. It was being done by Bits Studios and was nearly done last time <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> I’m not sure what happened to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Designer Milton Knight {{recalled}} that [...] "audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World. The premiere audience <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> with certainly did." [...] The critical {{reaction to the}} film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "The DJ who was hosting the radio station's free preview of Cool World leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: 'If you liked Roger Rabbit, you'll love Cool World!' He was wrong, but you can't blame him—he hadn't seen the movie. I have, and I will now promise {{you that if you}} liked Roger Rabbit, quit while you're ahead." [...] The film was a box-office disappointment. While other film projects followed, Bakshi began to focus more attention on painting.|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} Asian filmmaker to achieve {{international}} prominence, Kurosawa has naturally {{served as an}} inspiration for other Asian auteurs. Of Rashomon, the most famous director of India, Satyajit Ray, said: [...] "The effect of the film on me [...] was electric. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> three times on consecutive days, and wondered each time if there was another film anywhere which gave such sustained and dazzling proof of a director's command over every aspect of film making." [...] Other Asian admirers include the Japanese actor and director Takeshi Kitano, Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo, Japanese anime director Hayao Miyazaki and mainland Chinese director Zhang Yimou, who called Kurosawa [...] "the quintessential Asian director".|$|E
