2500|$|Each step of a {{synthesis}} involves a chemical reaction, and reagents and conditions {{for each of}} these reactions must be designed to give an adequate yield of pure product, with as little work as possible. A method may already <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> for making one of the early synthetic intermediates, and this method will usually be used rather than an effort to [...] "reinvent the wheel". [...] However, most intermediates are compounds that have never been made before, and these will normally be made using general methods developed by methodology researchers. To be useful, these methods need to give high yields, and to be reliable for a broad range of substrates. [...] For practical applications, additional hurdles include industrial standards of safety and purity.|$|E
