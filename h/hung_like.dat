25|$|Mercado de Sonora {{is one of}} the {{traditional}} markets for purchasing items related to Day of the Dead in Mexico City on 2 November. During this time, the aisles fill with items such as sugar skulls, papel picado (crepe paper cut into designs and <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> flags), representations of skeletons and more. There is Halloween influence as well, with items made to resemble witches, ghosts, Jack-o'-lanterns, etc.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings in Germany use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; many town flags in Germany exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified. In 1996, a layout for the vertical version of the government flag was established: the [...] is displayed in {{the centre of the}} flag, overlapping with up to one fifth of the black and gold bands. When <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a banner or draped, the black band should be on the left, as illustrated. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the black band must face the staff.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011, the High Court of Australia {{ordered a}} stay of charges, ruling that Australian officials' {{participation}} in Moti's extradition from the Solomons had been unlawful under Solomon Islands law. Summarising its ruling, the court said: [...] "Further {{prosecution of the}} charges would be an abuse of process because of the role that Australian officials in Mr Moti being deported to Australia". This was a permanent stay of prosecution {{putting an end to}} all court proceedings against Moti; the ruling was a majority decision of six judges to one. Manasseh Sogavare stated, in response to the ruling: [...] "I am so pleased. This matter has <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a dark cloud over me and my government. This decision has vindicated me".|$|E
60|$|A rick-cloth was brought, {{and they}} <b>hung</b> it <b>like</b> a curtain across the channel. The flames {{immediately}} ceased {{to go under}} {{the bottom of the}} corn-stack, and stood up vertical.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the poem}} [...] "red-rag and pink-flag", poet e.e. cummings {{references}} the rhyme with the verse [...] "some like it shot, some <b>like</b> it <b>hung,</b> some <b>like</b> {{it in the}} twot nine months young." ...|$|R
5000|$|A small 0-4-0 or 0-2-2 steam {{locomotive}} with {{one end of}} a coach <b>hung</b> on it <b>like</b> an articulated lorry.|$|R
2500|$|The {{researchers}} {{stayed at}} Cape Thordsen from 7 to 9 August. Some of the graves contained bodies {{still in their}} beds, frozen into blocks of ice. These bodies were so well preserved that the expedition refrained from exploring them further. According to Dr. Aasebø these were remains rather than skeletons, and the permission granted, as well as ethical considerations, did not allow samples to be taken from these bodies. Two other bodies were buried in a shallow double grave, and from these skeletons samples were taken. The samples confirmed the theory, as the skeletons showed extremely high concentrations of lead. Furthermore, the tins that had contained the food had inside them [...] "so much lead, that it <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> icicles inside the cans." [...] The findings largely cleared the men of suspicions of negligence; according to Kjær the scientific expedition helped restore their posthumous reputation.|$|E
2500|$|These protests {{were the}} subject of the {{documentary}} The War at Home. David Maraniss's book, They Marched into Sunlight, incorporated the 1967 Dow protests into a larger Vietnam War narrative. Tom Bates wrote the book Rads on the subject (...) [...] Bates wrote that Dyke's attempt to suppress the annual Mifflin Street block party [...] "would take three days, require hundreds of officers on overtime pay, and engulf the student community from the nearby Southeast Dorms to Langdon Street's fraternity row. Tear gas <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> heavy fog across the Isthmus." [...] In the fracas, student activist Paul Soglin, then a city alderman, was arrested twice and taken to jail. Soglin was later elected mayor of Madison, serving from 1973 to 1979, 1989 to 1997, and is the current mayor, elected again in April 2011. During his middle term he led the construction of the Frank Lloyd Wright designed Monona Terrace.|$|E
2500|$|The {{men of the}} First and Third Brigades {{faced the}} same {{challenge}} faced by Second Brigade earlier in the day. [...] The vines in this area <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> ropes between the trees, {{and some of them}} boasted thorns three inches (76mm) [...] long. [...] Additionally, though Fourteen Mile Creek was just inches deep, the nearly vertical banks rose over [...] above the creek bed in places. [...] To compound the command problems created by the terrain, McPherson's men were operating under drum and bugle silence and orders had to be delivered by courier, causing the line to lurch forward unevenly. [...] The men of the 23rd Indiana Infantry Regiment experienced what must have seemed like a stroke of luck at the time—because of a turn in the creek, their right flank rested very near the creek. [...] With a little effort, the unit was across the creek and standing in formation. [...] In order to close the gap created by the march, the unit quick-stepped back the other direction looking {{for the rest of the}} brigade, and stumbled sideways into the jaws of the Confederate trap. The only thing that saved the 23rd Indiana Infantry from wholesale slaughter was the fact that the Confederates had never been issued bayonets.|$|E

60|$|Four {{o'clock in}} the {{afternoon}} found them {{on the edge of the}} swamp and not far from the bank of the Congo. Beyond was the cliff, overgrown in every part with rank vegetation, and the ever-present vines, which <b>hung</b> down <b>like</b> so many ropes of green.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quien sabe?" [...] {{returned}} Tucker, with {{a reckless}} laugh. [...] "Well, I <b>hung</b> on <b>like</b> grim death to that boat's keel {{until one of}} those Chinese fishermen, in a 'dug-out,' hauled me in opposite Saucelito. I chartered him and his dug-out to bring me down here." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{place had}} become suffocatingly hot; the fumes of rank tobacco, of rancid butter, and of raw spirits <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a vapour in mid-air.|$|E
60|$|The old hound <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a leech to the tree, {{making it}} {{difficult}} to dislodge him. At length he fell heavily, and venting his thick battle cry, attempted to climb again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a friend}} with me," [...] Vincent said; [...] "a {{faithful}} negro, who has helped me to escape, and who would be <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a dog if they could lay hands on him." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} merged shyly {{into the}} room, on bare feet. Billy's face was wide and grinning, {{but there was}} a great solemnity of being good in his round blue eyes. Dora, peeping from the floss of her fair hair, <b>hung</b> back <b>like</b> some tiny Dryad, that has no soul.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{travelling}} <b>like</b> <b>Hung</b> and Sit had to, Cantonese opera performers {{were introduced}} to assorted Chinese opera performers in Hong Kong by Cheng.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{question}} neither of them could answer. They {{looked out on the}} river, but the mist <b>hung</b> over everything <b>like</b> a pall.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sun with}} sullen and portentous gleam [...] <b>Hung</b> <b>like</b> a menace on the sea's extreme; [...] Nor the dead waters, nor the far, bleak bars [...] Of cloud were {{conscious}} of his failing beam.|$|E
60|$|He led the way, and {{the young}} man followed, filled with wonder and astonishment. Not a sound was to be heard, not a thing moved, but silence <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a veil between the earth and the sky.|$|E
60|$|It descended, its banners {{wavering}} in {{the winds}} of prayer; it hung above the Gates, the flowers of all splendours, Heaven's very rose, <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> an opal on the boundless breast of night, and there it stayed.|$|E
60|$|The {{words were}} scarce {{out of my}} mouth as we swept beneath the pitch-black opening. I threw the bow hard up, dragged the speed lever to its last notch, and {{clutching}} a stanchion with one hand and the steering-wheel with the other <b>hung</b> on <b>like</b> grim death and consigned my soul to its author.|$|R
6000|$|... "Know you," [...] {{said the}} burgess, [...] "that had you {{fallen into the}} Duke of Burgundy's hands, he would have <b>hung</b> you up <b>like</b> a chestnut?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{had already}} cobbled {{together}} {{a new record}} {{during the previous year}} of touring, Destroyer of the Void, a patchwork of songs from my past and present which <b>hung</b> together <b>like</b> a house of cards.

60|$|Then {{through the}} wet cobwebs, that <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> movable {{diaphragms}} on each blade and bough, {{he pushed his}} {{way down to the}} furrow which led from the secluded fir-tree island to the wide world beyond the field.|$|E
60|$|Mirrab's long {{strands of}} golden hair <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a veil {{over her face}} and breast; she had {{straightened}} herself out somewhat, but her head was still bent. Her tottering reason was very slowly and gradually returning to her.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, the Inquisition {{was never}} {{popular with the}} great body of the Spaniards; over whom its secret proceedings, and terrible cruelties, <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a dark cloud, as none could ever say {{that they might not}} be the objects of denunciation.|$|E
60|$|The {{occasional}} {{repetition of}} such acts as this, and the exhibition of dangling pirates, <b>hung</b> up <b>like</b> scarecrows {{at the entrance}} of the harbors, dampened the ardor of the freebooters a good deal, and for some years they kept away from the harbor of Charles Town, which had once been to them such a friendly port.|$|R

60|$|Under {{the little}} balcony wall Argyle had put square red-tiled pots, all round, {{and in these}} still bloomed a few pansies and asters, whilst in a corner a monthly rose <b>hung</b> flowers <b>like</b> round blood-drops. Argyle was as tidy and scrupulous in his tiny rooms and his balcony {{as if he were}} a first-rate sea-man on a yacht. Lilly remarked on this.|$|R
60|$|Lady Pollacke <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a cloud {{at sunset}} over us both, her cheek flushed {{with the effort}} to be amused at every {{sentence}} which Mrs Monnerie uttered and to share {{it as far as}} possible with the rest of her guests.|$|E
60|$|No thanks--no sign even {{of having}} heard. The man {{had moved to}} the window. He seemed fascinated by the view. There was a silence between them. Then he waved his hand towards that red glow which <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a mist of fire over the city.|$|E
60|$|Somehow we had stopped, {{as if by}} agreement, {{and were}} facing each other. There was a {{look in her eyes}} I had never seen there before. The {{twilight}} <b>hung</b> <b>like</b> a curtain between us and the world. We were alone together in a world of our own.|$|E
