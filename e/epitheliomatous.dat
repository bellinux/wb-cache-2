40|$|A case of <b>epitheliomatous</b> sebaceous {{carcinoma}} in a dog is described. Clinically, {{the skin}} lesion is a solitary, alopecic, round and ulcerated nodule. Cytological examination of fine needle aspirates from the nodule show a neoplastic population of mainly basaloid reserve cells {{and a few}} mature sebocytes. On histopathological examination the diagnosis is <b>epitheliomatous</b> sebaceous carcinoma. At 24 months follow up neither relapse nor metastasis have been noted. Nomenclature {{of some of the}} sebaceous neoplasia is still under debate and the biological behaviour is still not well known...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} histopathological {{evidence of}} mycotic {{infection of the}} gingival epithelium followed by inverted verrucous giant cell epitheliomata of the gingiva. Sections from biopsy tissue revealed intercellular spaces of the parabasal squamous epithelium parasitized by Periodic Acid Schiff stain positive branching septate hyphae and conidia of morphological appearance of Trichophyton. Epithelial cells presented <b>epitheliomatous</b> proliferation with formation of giant cells showing phagocytosed fragments of mold...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} and investigational study of 25 cases of Donovanosis was undertaken. The incidence {{was found to}} be 1. 53 &#x 0025; of all STD cases and 2. 9 &#x 0025; of GUD. M:F ratio was 2. 12 : 1. Incidence was more in unmarried people. Fleshy exuberant type was seen in 88 &#x 0025; of cases. Two patients (8 &#x 0025;) had extragenital ulcers. Donovan bodies were found in 88 &#x 0025;. Pseudo elephantiasis was seen in 8 patients. Biopsy was done in 8 cases and showed ocanthosis, plasma cell infiltration and pseudo <b>epitheliomatous</b> hyperplasia. One patient developed squamous cell carcinoma of vulva...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{histopathology}} was {{studied in}} 25 cases of scabies versus 25 cases of nodular scabies which {{were selected from}} Dermato-Venereology out patients. Salient differences observed were that in scabies lifting of stratum corneum at places was seen in all 100 &#x 0025; cases, spongiosis in 100 &#x 0025;, spongiotic vesicles in 28 &#x 0025;, burrows in 56 &#x 0025;, mite in 40 &#x 0025; and vasculitis in 28 &#x 0025; whereas in nodular scabies acanthosis was seen in 100 &#x 0025;, pseudo <b>epitheliomatous</b> hyperplasia in 8 &#x 0025;, burrows in 48 &#x 0025;, mite in 24 &#x 0025; and vasculitis in 84 &#x 0025;.

40|$|Until {{the year}} 1913, {{a case of}} primary <b>epitheliomatous</b> tumor of the bone of an {{extremity}} had never been recorded in the literature. Many primary tumors of bone of endothelial origin had been described, but Fischer reported the first epithelial bone tumor, a primary adamantinoma of the tibia. This tumor is apparently identical with that recognized in the jaw under the names “ adamantinoma “, “ adamantoblastoma “, and “ epithelial odontoma “, arising from the enamel-forming elements of the developing tooth of a four-months ’ foetus. Extramaxillary adaman-tinomata {{have been reported in}} the neighborhood of the pituitary gland. The report of Fischer’s first case was concerned largely with the diffi-culty of the microscopic diagnosis, very little space being devoted to the clinical side. In this case, the involved portion of bone was resected and an osteoperiosteal graft from the sound leg was inserted. Eight months after the operation, the patient was in good health. In 1930, Richter reported the second case. Under the diagnosi...|$|E
40|$|Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is an {{important}} adjunct in the diagnosis of neoplastic skin diseases. In addition to the many established IHC markers currently in use, new markers continue to emerge, although their general acceptance and routine application requires robust validation. Here, we summarize the most well-established and commonly used biomarkers along {{with an array of}} newer ones reported in the past several decades that either demonstrate or hold high clinical promise in the field of cutaneous pathology. We also highlight recent applications of novel IHC markers in melanoma diagnosis including genetic mutation status markers [e. g. BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) and NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog) ] and an epigenetic alteration marker (e. g. 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine). We specifically focus on the role of IHC in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous lesions that fall under the following categories: melanoma, epidermal tumors with an intraepidermal <b>epitheliomatous</b> pattern, spindle cell lesions of the dermis, small round blue cell tumors of the dermis, and cutaneous adnexal tumors. While IHC is a valuable tool in diagnostic dermatopathology, marker selection and interpretation must be highly informed by clinical context and the histologic differential diagnosis. With rapid progress in our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of tumorigenesis, new IHC markers will continue to emerge in the field of diagnostic dermatopathology...|$|E
40|$|An autopsy case of {{malignant}} mesothelioma probably {{originated in the}} left pleura of a 77 -year-old man is presented. In this case {{the spread of the}} tumor was at first characterized by continuous extension to subserous connective, adipose and muscular tissues of the left parietal pleura, and to interlobar fissures and pulmonary septas of the left lung, and secondly by metastases to bifurcation lymph nodes, right pleura and lung, heart, thyroid, liver, pancreas etc. The tumor had a strong tendency to spread by contiguity and serosal seeding, and most of the metastatic nodules of the right lung, liver etc. were also recognized just beneath the serosa. Microscopically, the tumor had a characteristic cytoarchitecture that was papillomatous or 2 ̆ 2 villous carcinoma 2 ̆ 2 -like appearance in some areas and fibrosarcomatous in others. The tumor cells showed frequently phagocytic activities, i. e., erythro-, siderophagocytosis, anthracosis, hyaline droplet degeneration etc. and sometimes formation of giant cells. At times tumor cells demonstrating central pale areas of the cytoplasm and peripherally arranged nucleus were recognizable, permitting an impression of signet ring cells. Such cells, however, contained no substance tinctorial with mucicarmine or periodic acid-Schiff 2 ̆ 7 s stain. It may be worthy of note that the tumor cells had a potency to proliferate in various kinds of environments, that is, in the serous cavity (pleural cavity), in the intramural organ tissues (pulmonary septa and alveolar wall, heart, thyroid, liver, pancreas etc.), in the body fluid (blood and lymph vessels) and on the internal surface of the body (alveolar surface), and the cytoarchitecture of the tumor was, in general, <b>epitheliomatous</b> or carcinomatous in the superficial or central layers and sarcomatous in the deeper or peripheral zone. Such a case may offer an evidence of multipotentiality of mesothelial cells even in their neoplastic transformation...|$|E
40|$|ELKRATOSIS palmaris et plantaris (tylosis) {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be an inherited disability of a comparatively trivial kind. That it sometimes may have a sinister significance is shown by this study of two Liverpool familiea with tylosis, in which 18 members have developed carcinoma of the oesophagus. A preliminary letter on the subject has already appeared in the British Medical Journal (Clarke, Howel-Evans, and McConnell, 1957). Tyloais 1. General features. Tylosis is one of many forms of dyskeratosis which have been well classified by Cockayne (1933). Its most conspicuous feature is great thickening of the skin of the palms and soles, and hyperhidrosisis also commonly present. Rarely the condition is confined to the soles. Microscopically there is general hypertrophy of all the layers of the skin, the epidermis being chiefly affected; in addition there is hypertrophy of the sweat glands and their ducts (Cockayne, 1933). In many patients with the abnormality the horny epidermis is shed at intervals in large flakes, or as a complete cast of the palm or sole, and this takes place as a rule every autumn; it leaves a red, tender surface, which soon becomes overgrown again with thick epidermis (Cockayne, 1933). 2. Associated abnormalities are rare. Cockayne (1933) quoted Hanhart, who described a Swiss family, the affected members of which developed tylosis at the age of 15 years and multiple lipomata at the age of 22. Cockayne com-mented that the late age at which the tylosis appeared made it doubtful whether it was the ordinary form of the disease. Many other abnormalities have been described in association with tylosis in isolated patients, but genetic linkage was not demonstrated in any of these cases. We have found no reports in the literature of an association between tylosis and mn. lignA. nt disease of other parts of the body, although Sequeira, Ingram, and Brain (1947) mentioned a case in which <b>epitheliomatous</b> change occurred in the skin of a tylotic patient's hand. ...|$|E
