His Uncle, Dennis Forbes, the other half, was a well-respected engineer who worked closely with Bob Seger. When Sean was five-years-old his parents bought him a drum set [...] after seeing him <b>follow</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> all of the songs that his parents played on the radio, especially [...] "Devil With A Blue Dress" [...] by Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels. Johnny [...] "Bee" [...] Badanjek, who is the drummer for Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels {{was a good friend}} of Sean’s dad and would come over to the house and teach Sean how to drum. This started a lifelong mission for Sean to find a way into the music business. In high school, Sean played in a band with childhood friends. He had dreams to be a drummer but knew first hand as a deaf person this would be extremely difficult. He attended the Rochester Institute of Technology(RIT)in Rochester, NY where the National Technical Institute for the Deaf is located. While attending RIT Sean noticed that there were many deaf and hard of hearing people that loved music, but didn’t have the same access to music Sean had while growing up. Fond with lyrics, Sean would often interpret into American Sign Language many of his favorite songs. After his 3rd year at RIT, he decided to take a leave of absence from school and move back home to Detroit to figure out the next what was next for him. While attending The Detroit Music Awards, Sean met recording studio owner and Eminem publisher Joel Martin. As the story goes Martin gave Forbes a piece of paper that said [...] "Free Eminem Tickets E-mail Me" [...] which fueled Forbes to e-mail Martin asking if he could work at the studio.

Her delicate evocations of mood —sometimes tender sometimes irritable — won ovations. Her well-received performance {{caught the eye}} of the Sai Chin Pao opera troupe and the troupe took her on. Her [...] "handsome" [...] appearance and superb technique at once made her the pillar of the Sai-Chin-Pao ke-tsai-hsi group and she was promoted alongside Hsiao Ming-ming (小明明), Hsiao Feng-hsien (小鳳仙), and other popular stars as the troupe's [...] "Seven Immortals"(七仙女). Since this group was quite famous at that time, the overseas Chinese community in the Philippines invited it to perform in Manila for six months.

5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a sleigh drive. The children ask <b>to</b> come <b>along,</b> but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and <b>follow</b> <b>along,</b> only <b>to</b> fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|R

Taking advantage of the denseness of the trees, he came close to the house and skirted round it. He was repaid for his trouble, for {{on the far side of}} the house, close to where the rocky frontage of the cliff fell away, he saw Oolanga crouched behind the irregular trunk of a great oak. The man was so intent on watching someone, or something, that he did not guard against being himself watched. This suited Adam, for he could thus make scrutiny at will.|$|R

Pervasive habits of observing and listening should be enmeshed in the whole approach to teaching. More than that; as children seek constantly to organize their knowledge into conceptual structures, their efforts must be met by teachers with responsible steps to support, to stretch the scope, of these understandings. Challenges and choices facing teachers in designing programs for classroom learnings then become the crucial fulcrum in understanding and counter-poising the differing aspects of what children do know, can know, and should know...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} this paper are twofold. First, we present our {{experiences}} with (1) fusion of vision, sonar, and contact sensory modalities in perceiving obstacles and targets, (2) arbitration of sensing and acting at reactive and deliberative levels, and (3) integration of asynchronous instruction taking and communication. Following a discussion of lessons learned we discuss architectural modules and issues that help standardize integration of sensor and acting modalities and solution across platforms. We have developed a robot assistant, which communicates in natural language and moves in a room using vision as its primary sensory mechanism. This system takes instruction from a supervisor to go to various agents {{in the room and}} <b>follow</b> them <b>along</b> <b>to</b> offer assistance. Our assistant uses a three tiered architecture which models: (a) knowledge representation and reasoning including natural language interactions, (b) routine interactions not explicitly controlled by the agent, and (c) reflexes. Our robotic assistant integrates (a) vision and sonar sensing in obstacle avoidance, (b) memory-based and reactive navigation (i. e., deliberative versus skill-based), (c) instruction taking and goal-driven behaviors, and (d) concurrent visual focusing behaviors. 1...|$|R

60|$|A {{consultation}} was {{now held}} {{as to the}} best plan to be pursued. It was finally agreed {{that one of the}} men should take the canoe and return to the village, which was but four miles away, and warn them to prepare for an attack that night. The stockades had already been strengthened, and if prepared, it was probable that the settlers would be able to beat off any attack. The scow was then put in motion again. It was felt that the three Indians on shore would have done nothing until they learned from the men in the canoe that the pursuit had failed, and that the settlers had been warned. They would probably have <b>followed</b> <b>along</b> the shore <b>to</b> see the result, and might either return, burn the cabin, and slaughter the cattle, or might go on and join the Indians who were doubtless gathered close to the village.

50|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States, Uhaa made his debut for Evolve on January 14, 2012, with a win over Pinkie Sanchez. When the {{following}} March, Akira Tozawa took over the leadership of Blood Warriors from Cima and renamed the group Mad Blankey, Uhaa Nation <b>followed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> the renamed stable. Uhaa made his first appearance representing Mad Blankey at a DGUSA event on March 29, when he and stablemates Akira Tozawa and BxB Hulk defeated Ronin (Chuck Taylor, Johnny Gargano and Rich Swann) and D.U.F. (Arik Cannon, Pinkie Sanchez and Sami Callihan) in a three-way trios match. However, during the match Uhaa suffered a knee injury, which sidelined him for a year. Uhaa returned to the ring on February 1, 2013, at Full Impact Pros Everything Burns iPPV, where he successfully defended the FIP Florida Heritage Championship against Chasyn Rance. On March 2, Uhaa returned to Japan and Dragon Gate, when he and BxB Hulk defeated Don Fujii and Masaaki Mochizuki for the Open the Twin Gate Championship. They lost the title to Shingo Takagi and Yamato on May 5. On May 11, Uhaa was pinned {{for the first time in}} a Dragon Gate ring, when he was eliminated by Jimmy Susumu in the first round of the 2013 King of Gate tournament. On July 28 at Enter the Dragon 2013, Dragon Gate USAs fourth anniversary event, Uhaa suffered his first pinfall loss in the promotion, when he was defeated by Anthony Nese. On August 9, Uhaa lost the FIP Florida Heritage Championship to Gran Akuma. Back in Dragon Gate, Mad Blankey turned on Uhaa Nation on August 30, after he refused to wrestle Akira Tozawa, who had recently been kicked out of the group. Uhaa then formed a new partnership with Tozawa and Shingo Takagi. On September 12, the three were joined by Masato Yoshino, Ricochet and Shachihoko Boy to form a new stable, which was on October 6 named Monster Express. On January 12, 2014, Uhaa received his first shot at Dragon Gate USAs top title, the Open the Freedom Gate Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Johnny Gargano. On March 6, Uhaa also received his first shot at Dragon Gates top title, the Open the Dream Gate Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Monster Express stablemate Ricochet.
