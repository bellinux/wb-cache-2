30|$|Today, the {{development}} of new technologies of in vivo video microscopy and its integration in easy-to-handle microscopes as in Sidestream <b>Dark</b> <b>Field</b> (SDF) <b>imaging</b> allow us to assess the (sublingual) microcirculation at the bedside, in a non-invasive way [13]. However, until 2015, data on microcirculatory alterations in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were restricted to small sample-sized studies in high-risk patients [7, 8, 14].|$|R
50|$|The SEM {{can also}} be used in {{transmission}} mode by simply incorporating an appropriate detector below a thin specimen section. Both bright and <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>imaging</b> has been reported in the generally low accelerating beam voltage range used in SEM, which increases the contrast of unstained biological specimens at high magnifications with a field emission electron gun. This mode of operation has been abbreviated by the acronym tSEM.|$|E
50|$|In <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>imaging</b> (also termed {{diffraction}} contrast imaging) researchers {{choose a}} desired diffraction spot {{and use a}} contrast aperture to pass only those electrons that contribute to that particular spot. In the image planes after the contrast aperture it is then possible to observe where the electrons originate from in real space. This technique allows scientists to study on which areas of a specimen a structure with a certain lattice vector (periodicity) exists.|$|E
50|$|In {{conventional}} dark-field imaging (in {{a parallel}} beam mode, not STEM), an objective aperture {{is placed in}} the diffraction plane so as to only collect electrons scattering through that aperture, avoiding the main beam. By contrast, in STEM mode the optics distinguishing between dark and bright field modes is positioned further downstream, after the converged beam has interacted with the specimen. Consequently, the contrast mechanisms are different between conventional <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>imaging</b> and STEM dark field.|$|E

His early work on inelastic scattering in electron diffraction and imaging establishes the theory of high-angle annular <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>imaging</b> (HAADF) (so called Z contrast) in {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM).|$|E
5000|$|An annular dark field {{detector}} collects electrons from {{an annulus}} around the beam, sampling far more scattered electrons than can pass through an objective aperture. This gives {{an advantage in}} terms of signal collection efficiency and allows the main beam to pass to an EELS detector, allowing both types of measurement to be performed simultaneously. Annular <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>imaging</b> is also commonly performed in parallel with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy acquisition, and can be also done in parallel to bright-field (STEM) imaging.|$|E
5000|$|Diffraction {{topography}} (short: [...] "topography") is an quantum beam {{imaging technique}} based on Bragg diffraction.Diffraction topographic images ("topographies") record the intensity {{profile of a}} beam of X-rays (or, sometimes, neutrons) diffracted by a crystal.A topography thus represents a two-dimensional spatial intensity mapping of reflected X-rays, i.e. the spatial fine structure of a Laue reflection.This intensity mapping reflects the distribution of scattering power inside the crystal; topographs therefore reveal the irregularities in a non-ideal crystal lattice.X-ray diffraction topography is one variant of X-ray imaging, making use of diffraction contrast rather than absorption contrast which is usually used in radiography and computed tomography (CT). Topography is exploited to a lesser extends with neutrons and other quantum beams. In the electron microscope community, such technique is called <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>imaging</b> or diffraction contrast imaging.|$|E

The access to spatially resolved small angle scattering information in neutron <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>imaging</b> provides information about structures beyond direct spatial image resolution. The dark field contrast modality is hence a valuable tool for materials science based on neutron imaging.

Orthogonal polarization spectral (OPS) and sidestream <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> (SDF) <b>imaging</b> devices both provide high-contrast images of underlying microvasculature [13]. Using these devices, investigators have reported that the microcirculation is markedly altered in sepsis, alterations are more severe in nonsurvivors, and persistent microvascular alterations are associated with development of multiple organ failure and death [14 – 17]. The sublingual microcirculation has been the most extensively studied in patients with critical illness and sepsis.|$|R
