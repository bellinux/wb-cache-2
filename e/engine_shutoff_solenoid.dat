50|$|Some {{vehicles}} have {{an additional}} autogas (LPG) tank. As {{the system was}} not built in, {{there is a risk}} of damaging the pipe which is often under the car, releasing the pressurised fuel. The risk of this is minimised by locating the line in a protected position during installation. Modern installations also have a <b>shutoff</b> <b>solenoid</b> at the tank so that rupture will only release the fuel in the line rather than allowing fuel {{to come out of the}} tank.|$|R
5000|$|The Motor Wheel had a 2 {{cycle engine}} which {{produced}} 1HP {{and had two}} flywheel magnetos, bronze bearings and a float feed carburetor. The complete kit came with a wheel, hub tire, shock-absorbing spring sprocket holder, wheel sprocket and chain, handlebar controls for choke, throttle and <b>engine</b> <b>shutoff,</b> three quart gas tank and gas line, and all necessary fittings to adapt the engine and rear wheel unit to any 26" [...] bicycle.|$|R

25|$|Toyota {{recalled}} {{and replaced}} 55,000 optional all-weather rubber floor mats from the Toyota Camry and ES 350 in September 2007, citing {{the risk of}} unsecured mats jamming the accelerator pedal. In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons near San Diego on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff's Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an unsecured SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised floor mat removal, shift to Neutral (N) gear in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for <b>engine</b> <b>shutoff.</b> On 29 November, the 2007–2010 MY floor mat recall was revised to add shorter accelerator pedals, thinner replacement mats, and a brake override feature which ignores accelerator input when the brake pedal is depressed.|$|R
50|$|The {{captain of}} Alaska Ranger {{died in the}} sinking so it is unknown why he did not stop the diesel engines. The Coast Guard had tested the <b>engine</b> {{emergency}} <b>shutoff</b> system {{a year before the}} sinking and reported that it functioned properly. The boat moving full astern meant that two of the three lifeboats were separated from the ship. This meant that 25 crew members that had jumped into the water never got to one of the three lifeboats.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} electronic control technology applied to diesel engines, commercially available injection sys tems for automotive diesel engines remain {{limited by the}} open loop mapplng of the injection pump. An initial calibration is relied upon to translate a fuel delivery command to an actual fuel quantity. In practice, however, these two variables may be sub stantially different due {{to the effects of}} mechanical wear, repair, and the wide range of operating conditions. Possible ramifications of this discrepancy are excessive exhaust smoke due to overfuel ing, increased fuel consumption, degraded driveability, and poor idle characteristics. The major obstacle to closing the fuel control loop is the lack of a suitable sensor for instantaneous fuel delivery from the injector. An indirect fuel delivery sensing mechanism based upon the use of the injector needle lift in conjunction with the fuel tempera ture is evaluated. An estimation of the injection rate characteristic is determined from real-time analysis of the needle lift signal using a high-speed sensor processor. Integration of the rate characteris tic and temperature correction yields a total mass delivery estimate for use as a feedback quantity for closed-loop fuel control. Signal processing algorithms are derived from computer modeling of the injector and verified experimentally. Possible long-term decalibra tion due to nozzle coking is studied. Advantages and limitations of the technique are identified. BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM DESCRIPTION Although diesel engines and lnjection systems represent a mature technology, it is only ln recent years that electronic con trols have been successfully applied. The majority of diesel appli cations are still mechanically controlled, with no electronics involved other than the fuel <b>shutoff</b> <b>solenoid</b> valve control. The potential benefits of microprocessor-based control applied to diesel engines have been well established [Reams 82...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an optimal Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for a low-cost mechanical-hybrid powertrain. It uses mechanical components only a flywheel, clutches, gears, and a continuously variable transmission for its hybrid functionalities of brake energy recuperation, reduction of inefficient part-load operation of the <b>engine,</b> and <b>engine</b> <b>shutoff</b> during vehicle standstill. This powertrain has mechanical characteristics, such as a relatively small energy storage capacity {{in the form of}} the compact flywheel and multiple driving modes to operate the powertrain because of the use of clutches. The optimization problem is complex because it is twofold: (i) to find the optimal sequence of driving modes and (ii) to find the optimal power distribution between the engine, flywheel, and vehicle. Dynamic programming is used to compute the globally optimal EMS for six representative driving cycles. The main design criterion is the minimization of the overall fuel consumption, subject to the systems kinematics, dynamics, and constraints. The results provide a benchmark of the fuel saving potential of this powertrain design and give insight in the optimal utilization of the flywheel system. In addition, the complexity (and computation time) of the problem is reduced by a priori (static) optimization of the power distribution for each driving mode. Static optimization of a dynamic optimization problem yields a sub-optimal solution; however, the results show that the consequences on the fuel saving are small with respect to the optimal one (the difference is 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 8...|$|R
50|$|Soon after lift-off, due to {{unexpected}} eddies and counter-currents at {{the base}} of Block A (the first stage), the N-1 experienced an uncontrolled roll beyond the capability of the control system to compensate. The KORD computer sensed an abnormal situation and sent a shutdown command to the first stage, but as noted above, the guidance program had since been modified to prevent this from happening until 50 seconds into launch. The roll, which had initially been 6° per second, began rapidly accelerating. At T+39 seconds, the booster was rolling at nearly 40° per second, causing the inertial guidance system to go into gimbal lock and at T+48 seconds, the vehicle disintegrated from structural loads. The interstage truss between the second and third stages twisted apart and the latter separated from the stack and at T+50 seconds, the cutoff command to the first stage was unblocked and the engines immediately shut down. The upper stages impacted about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from the launch complex. Despite the <b>engine</b> <b>shutoff,</b> the first and second stages still had enough momentum to travel for some distance before falling to earth about 9 miles (15 kilometers) from the launch complex and blasting a 50 ft crater in the steppe. This N1 had dummy upper stages without the rescue system. The next, last vehicle would have a much more powerful stabilization system with dedicated engines (in the previous versions stabilization was done by directing exhaust from the main engines). The engine control system would also be reworked, increasing the number of sensors from 700 to 13,000.|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of mining}} {{equipment}} fires from 1990 through 1999 reveals {{that there were}} 340 large mining equipment fires, resulting in 72 injuries and five fatalities. Many of the fires resulted {{in the loss of}} equipment and all posed potential or real risks to the operator. In 97 cases, the fires raged out of control due to engine shut 2 failure, even upon activation of the machine fire suppression system, due to the spraying of pressurized hydraulic flu 2 and fuel onto hot engine surfaces. In other cases, even after <b>engine</b> <b>shutoff,</b> the fires re-ignited, fueled by the contin 2 flow of flammable fluids remaining in the lines onto the hot engine surfaces. In many of the fires, flammable vapors evolved and penetrated the cab, violently igniting, forcing the operator to exit under very hazardous conditions. The use of emergency evacuation lines in the fuel and hydraulic fluid systems, and methods to reduce or prevent the spraying of pressurized fluids onto hot engine surfaces would greatly improve the chances of successfully suppressing large mining equipment fires. In addition, the use of systems for preventing the ignition of flammable vapors inside the cab, and detecting and suppressing fires originat 2 in the cab, would greatly enhance operator safety. The National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently conducted experiments on meth 2 to reduce the fire hazards associated with large mining equipment. These experiments evaluated the use of cab inerting systems to prevent the ignition of flammable vapors inside the cab and sup 2 fires originating in the cab, while maintaining a breathable atmosphere for the operator to bring the equipment to a stop and safely exit the cab...|$|R
40|$|A three-stage launcher, with solid-propellant {{first and}} second stage and a hybrid-propellant third stage is considered. The design of the hybrid-propellant upper stage and the whole ascent {{trajectory}} are simultaneously optimized {{by means of a}} nested direct/indirect procedure, while the characteristics of the {{first and second}} stages are assigned. Direct optimization of the parameters that affect the motor design is coupled with indirect trajectory optimization to maximize the launcher payload. A mission profile based on the Vega launcher is considered. The feed system exploits a pressurizing gas, namely helium, with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer, and polyethylene as the fuel. The simplest blowdown design is compared with a more complex pressurizing system, which has an additional gas tank that allows for a phase with constant pressure in the oxidizer tank. The optimization provides the optimal values of the main engine design parameters (pressurizing gas mass, nozzle expansion ratio, and initial values of tank pressure, mixture ratio and thrust), the corresponding grain and engine geometry, and the control law (thrust direction during the ascent trajectory and <b>engine</b> ignition and <b>shutoff</b> times). Results show that a hybrid-propellant third stage may be a viable option for small launchers, with improved performance and similar cost compared to an all-solid rocket. The results of the optimization also offer interesting theoretical insight into the problem...|$|R
