[...] The movement of the molecules characterizes the phenomena of adsorption. [...] Adsorption influences changes in surface tension and colloid stability. [...] Adsorption layers at the surface of a liquid dispersion medium may affect the interactions of the <b>dispersed</b> <b>particles</b> in the media and consequently these layers may play crucial role in colloid stability The adsorption of molecules of liquid phase at an interface occurs when this liquid phase is in contact with other immiscible phases that may be gas, liquid, or solid ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dispersed</b> <b>Particle</b> Resistance (DPR) is a {{measured}} parameter to characterize battery active materials. It {{is seen as}} an indicator of lithium-ion battery active material rate capability. It is the slope of voltage-current linear fit for active material samples in suspensions. It can be obtained by applying different voltages on a suspension and measure the currents, after which the data points are plotted. The slope of the plot is referred to as <b>Dispersed</b> <b>Particle</b> Resistance. It can also be done in the opposite way where different currents are applied and voltages are measured. The key advantage of this <b>Dispersed</b> <b>Particle</b> Resistance technique is fast and accurate comparing with the conventional characterization method for which batteries need to be fabricated and tested for a long time.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} colmatation regularities pertaining to high <b>disperse</b> <b>particles</b> from gas streams in various porous materials {{has been carried}} out in the paper. The paper reveals that under usual conditions the colmatation efficiency of high <b>disperse</b> <b>particles</b> having diameter 0. 5 microns and less basically depends on a stream velocity and size of  filter fibers that is higher velocity and larger fiber diameter entail lower colmatation efficiency. An increase in density of filter material packing makes insignificant impact on the rate of particles catching but leads to growth of resistance and correspondingly to reduction of the filter productivity.

2500|$|To a first approximation, {{the basis}} for {{determination}} of molecular weight according to Mark–Houwink relations {{is the fact that}} the intrinsic viscosity of solutions (or suspensions) of macromolecules depends on volumetric proportion of the <b>dispersed</b> <b>particles</b> in a particular solvent. [...] Specifically, the hydrodynamic size as related to molecular weight depends on a conversion factor, describing the shape of a particular molecule. This allows the apparent molecular weight to be described from a range of techniques sensitive to hydrodynamic effects, including DLS, SEC (also known as GPC), viscometry and diffusion ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DOSY). The apparent hydrodynamic size can then be used to approximate molecular weight using a series of macromolecule-specific standards. As this requires calibration, it's frequently described as a [...] "relative" [...] molecular weight determination method.|$|E

50|$|Depletion {{forces are}} used {{extensively}} {{as a method}} of destabilizing colloids. By introducing particles into a colloidal dispersion, attractive depletion forces can be induced between <b>dispersed</b> <b>particles.</b> These attractive interactions bring the <b>dispersed</b> <b>particles</b> together resulting in flocculation. This destabilizes the colloid as the particles are no longer dispersed in the liquid but concentrated in floc formations. Flocs are then easily removed through filtration processes leaving behind a non-dispersed, pure liquid.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{depletion}} {{forces to}} initiate flocculation {{is a common}} process in water treatment. The relatively small size of <b>dispersed</b> <b>particles</b> in waste water renders typical filtration methods ineffective. However, if the dispersion was to be destabilized and flocculation occur, particles can then be filtered out to produce pure water. Therefore, coagulants and flocculants are typically introduced to waste water which create these depletion forces between the <b>dispersed</b> <b>particles.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to enhance {{visualization}} of shock fronts associated with single explosive particle (diameter — 100 μm) detonation, a Fourier holographic recording technique has been developed which relies on film non-linearities to greatly increase phaseobject visibility. The driving force behind this work is the investigation of detonation dynamics in <b>dispersed</b> <b>particle</b> explosives. These explosives, used for mine neutralization, are comprised of a fine, solid particulate dust which is dispersed as a cloud in the atmosphere over a given area. When detonation is initiated in some portion of the cloud, the ensuing detonation wave propagates throughout the entire cloud and results in an explosion, generating a tremendous pressure which serves to destroy or render useless any land mines present.

50|$|In this {{proposed}} theoretical scheme, the active medium is a liquid dielectric (e.g. ordinary distilled water) in which <b>dispersed</b> <b>particles</b> are uniformly distributed. Means of electrolysis cause gas bubbles {{that serve as}} the <b>dispersed</b> <b>particles.</b> A pumped wave excited in the active medium produces a periodic variation of the volumes of the <b>dispersed</b> <b>particles</b> (gas bubbles). Since, the initial spatial distribution of the particles is uniform, the waves emitted by the particles are added with different phases and give zero on the average. Nevertheless, if the active medium {{is located in a}} resonator, then a standing mode can be excited in it. Particles then bunch under the action of the acoustic radiation forces.

PMMA/SAN and SAN/PBT blends show miscibility windows {{for a specific}} range of acrylonitrile (AN) content in the SAN copolymer. The phase diagram for both blends has been calculated using the interaction energy density parameter B as function of AN content in the SAN. A critical interaction energy density parameter, Bcrit, was also calculated to find the miscibility window for both SAN blends.
