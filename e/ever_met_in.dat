5|$|William Crabtree (1610–1644) was a cloth {{merchant}} from Broughton Spout, a hamlet in {{the township}} of Broughton near Manchester, {{which is now}} part of Salford. The son of John Crabtree, a Lancashire farmer of comfortable means, and Isabel Crabtree (née Pendleton), he was educated at a grammar school in Manchester– probably the forerunner of Manchester Grammar School, which was then situated between the Collegiate Church and what is now Chetham's School of Music. He worked in Manchester, married into a wealthy family and in his spare time studied mathematics and astronomy. He carefully measured the movements of the planets, undertook precise astronomical calculations and rewrote the existing Rudolphine Tables with improved accuracy. He maintained an active correspondence, much of it now lost, with Horrocks, two other young astronomers– William Gascoigne and Christopher Towneley– and Samuel Foster, Professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London and alumnus of Emmanuel College. It is not known whether Horrocks and Crabtree <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> <b>in</b> person but from 1636 they corresponded regularly, and, because of their shared interest in the work of Johannes Kepler, referred to themselves, along with William Gascoigne, as nos Keplari (we Keplarians).|$|E
25|$|Both {{countries}} {{had a successful}} World Cup in 1966, and met in the final played at Wembley on Saturday, 30 July 1966. This {{was and still is}} regarded by many as the most important match ever played between the two teams, and it was also the first time they had <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> <b>in</b> a competitive game, as opposed to the friendly matches they had played before. It was also a highly eventful and in some respects controversial game, which created the modern rivalry between the teams.|$|E

25|$|Williams flew 39 combat {{missions}} in Korea, earning the Air Medal with two Gold Stars {{in lieu of}} second and third awards, before being withdrawn from flight status in June 1953 after a hospitalization for pneumonia. This resulted in the discovery of an inner ear infection that disqualified him from flight status. During the Korean War, Williams also served in the same Marine Corps unit with John Glenn; the future astronaut described Williams {{as one of the}} best pilots he knew, while his wife Annie described him as the most profane man she <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> <b>In</b> the last half of his missions, Williams was flying as Glenn's wingman.|$|E
25|$|Higgins had a poor 2011/2012 season, {{reaching}} {{only two}} quarter finals of major ranking events. His season-best performance was reaching the semi-finals of the Masters, where he lost 4–6 to Shaun Murphy. Before {{the start of}} his World Championship title defence, he admitted that his performance levels had not been good enough and that he had not been trying hard enough, managing just one or two days of practice a week. In {{the first round of the}} tournament, he came from 6–8 down to defeat Liang Wenbo 10–9. He then played Stephen Hendry in the second round, the first time the two players had <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> <b>in</b> a World Championship, but Hendry thrashed the defending champion 13–4, with Higgins calling it the worst he had ever played at the Crucible. He finished the season ranked world number five.|$|E

Lu developed a strong admiration for Obama, {{of whom he}} said, [...] "With his quick and incisive mind, Obama is the most intelligent person that I have <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> (<b>in</b> the political arena)." [...] As legislative director, Lu led a 15-person group and was responsible for overseeing the drafting of all legislation and advising Obama on votes and policy decisions. When weighing difficult votes, Obama had Lu and his other staff members assemble together and argue about the issue in front of him. David Mendell, a Chicago Tribune reporter and Obama biographer, said Lu was among the [...] "moderate voices in this atmosphere of smart young staffers." [...] Lu advised Obama to {{vote in favor of}} the Military Commissions Act of 2006 because he felt it would have been politically wiser to support it, but Obama ultimately voted against it.|$|E

500|$|While {{aboard the}} ship Greyhound, Newton gained notoriety for {{being one of}} the most profane men the captain had <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> <b>In</b> a culture where sailors {{commonly}} used oaths and swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery. In March 1748, while the Greyhound was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before. After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, Newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being washed overboard, working for several hours. After proposing the measure to the captain, Newton had turned and said, [...] "If this will not do, then Lord have mercy upon us!" [...] Newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours. During his time at the wheel he pondered his divine challenge.|$|E
500|$|Affleck's poor {{critical}} notices {{continued in}} 2004 when he starred as a bereaved {{husband in the}} romantic comedy Jersey Girl, directed by longtime collaborator Smith. Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Affleck as an actor [...] "whose talent has curdled as his tabloid notoriety has spread". But Joe Leydon of Variety found his onscreen role as a father [...] "affecting". Later that year, he starred opposite James Gandolfini in the holiday comedy Surviving Christmas. Holden noted in The New York Times that the film [...] "found a clever way to use Ben Affleck's disagreeable qualities. The actor's shark-like grin, cocky petulance and bullying frat-boy swagger befit his character." [...] At this point, the quality of scripts offered to Affleck [...] "was just getting worse and worse" [...] {{and he decided to}} take a career break. The Los Angeles Times published a piece on the downfall of Affleck's career in late 2004. The article noted that, unlike film critics and tabloid journalists, [...] "few industry professionals seem to be gloating over Affleck's travails". Various producers and agents were interviewed, with Harvey Weinstein describing Affleck as [...] "one of the sweetest people I've <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> <b>in</b> this industry ... I think the sky's the limit when he wants to focus. And he will." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> <b>in</b> my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to put her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E
