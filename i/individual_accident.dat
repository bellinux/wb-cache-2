2500|$|While {{installation}} of a new cycle track in the city decreases the number of accidents along the cycle track itself beyond the expected number of accidents, a study of newly installed bicycle tracks in Copenhagen actually showed, taking into account correction factors for crash trends, traffic volumes and regression-to-the-mean, {{that the number of}} accidents increased by 9% compared to the expected number of accidents [...] (without new cycle path). There was a significant increase of accidents in intersections following the {{installation of}} cycle tracks at intersections. However, since the number of bicyclists increased by 18-20% following installation of the cycle tracks, <b>individual</b> <b>accident</b> rates actually dropped when bicycle infrastructure was added. Since its publication, the city has used the conclusions of the report to improve safety in intersections. Notable improvements include rebuilding dangerous intersections, pulling back stop lines for cars to improve visibility of cyclists, and expanding the use of bicycle traffic lights, to give pre-greens for cyclists.

60|$|From this {{advancing}} {{machine of}} millions, the slighter array of the Allies, {{and especially the}} British at their ultimate outpost, saved themselves by a succession of hair's-breadth escapes and what must have seemed to the soldiers the heartrending luck of a mouse before a cat. Again and again Von Kluck's cavalry, supported by artillery and infantry, clawed round {{the end of the}} British force, which eluded it as by leaping back again and again. Sometimes the pursuer was, so to speak, so much on top of his prey that it could not even give way to him; but had to hit such blows as it could in the hope of checking him for the instant needed for escape. Sometimes the oncoming wave was so close that a small <b>individual</b> <b>accident,</b> the capture of one man, would mean the washing out of a whole battalion. For day after day this living death endured. And day after day a certain dark truth began to be revealed, bit by bit, certainly to the incredulous wonder of the Prussians, quite possibly to the surprise of the French, and quite as possibly to the surprise of themselves; that there was something singular about the British soldiers. That singular thing may be expressed in a variety of ways; but it would be almost certainly expressed insufficiently by anyone who had not had the moral courage to face the facts about his country in the last decades before the war. It may perhaps be best expressed by saying that some thousands of Englishmen were dead: and that England was not.|$|E

For most models of this rather general class, answering these questions requires unfathomable manipulations.

60|$|All such {{property}} Socialism will ungrudgingly sustain, {{and it will}} equally sustain {{property in}} books and objects of æsthetic satisfaction, in furnishing, in the apartments or dwelling-house {{a man or woman}} occupies and in their household implements. It will sustain far more property than the average working-class man has to-day. Nor will it prevent savings or accumulations, if men do not choose to expend their earnings--nor need it interfere with lending. How far it will permit or countenance usury is another question altogether. There will no doubt remain, after all the work-a-day needs of the world have been met by a scientific public organization of the general property in Nature, a great number of businesses and enterprises and new and doubtful experiments outside the range of legitimate State activity. In these, interested and prosperous people will embark their surplus money as shareholders in a limited liability company, making partnership profits or losses in an entirely proper manner. But whether there should be debentures and mortgages or preference shares, or suchlike manipulatory distinctions, or interest in any shape or form, I am inclined to doubt. A money-lender should share risk as well as profit--that is surely the moral law in lending that forbids usury; he {{should not be allowed to}} bleed a failing business with his inexorable percentage and so eat up the ordinary shareholder or partner any more than the landlord should be allowed to eat up the failing tenant for rent. That was once the teaching of Christianity, and I do not know enough of the history or spiritual development of the Catholic Church to tell when she became what she now appears to be--the champion of the rent-exacting landlord and the usurer against Socialism. It is the present teaching of Socialism. If usury obtains at all under the Socialist State, if inexorable repayments are to be made in certain cases, it will, I conceive, be a State monopoly. The State will be the sole banker for every hoard and every enterprise, just as it will be the universal landlord and the universal fire and accident and old age insurance office. In money matters as in public service and administration, it will stand for the species, the permanent thing behind every <b>individual</b> <b>accident</b> and adventure.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} ability of {{automobile}} insurance prices to distinguish the 2 : 1 ratio of men's to women's annual mileage, which is linked to a similar ratio of accident involvement per year. Review of current price classes by driver sex and age, by future mileage, and by past driver record reveals severe limitations to their capacity to assess women's lower mileage exposure to risk of accidents. Accidents are modeled {{as a process of}} random sampling of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by cars in an insurance class. This analogy underscores 1) the impossibility of pricing by <b>individual</b> <b>accident</b> record and 2) the paramount importance of odometer-measured vehicle miles of on-the-road exposure for assessing <b>individual</b> <b>accident</b> risk in money terms. The need for risk classification as the essential complement to exposure measurement is shown by considering how a single insurance surcharge on gasoline ("pay at the pump " insurance) as an exposure measure would perversely affect incentives for risk control. Current risk classification is profoundly compromised because individual exposure is not measured. An efficient per-mile premium system combining exposure measurement and risk classification is described. Current flat premiums are compared to premiums that would increase in direct proportion to miles of driving exposure. This comparison shows how individuals, and also women and men as groups, would be affected by changing insurance from a fixed cost of car ownership to a per-mile operating cost of car use...|$|E
