He manages to shoot the chimera in time however, and they use its blood {{to find a cure}} for Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Anarchy Onlines story, {{from the}} player's point of view, began in 29,475, after {{the most recent}} peace treaty had been signed between Omni-Tek and the Clans. ICC {{peacekeeping}} troops later moved <b>into</b> <b>some</b> cities to protect neutral observers of the war who had rejected their contractual obligations with Omni-Tek, but did not align themselves with the Clans. Omni-Tek, the Clans, and the neutral observers make up the game's three playable factions and control much of Rubi-Ka's terraformed surface.|$|E
50|$|Squid, and {{all types}} of fish are common {{in the waters of}} Elis. Fishing is mainly done in the southeastern Ionian Sea and in the Bay of Patras.

60|$|From her work-basket in the window-seat {{the woman}} took a paper of pins, {{of the old}} long and yellow sort whose heads were {{disposed}} to come off at their first usage. These she began to thrust into the image in all directions, with apparently excruciating energy. Probably as many as fifty were thus inserted, <b>some</b> <b>into</b> {{the head of the}} wax model, <b>some</b> <b>into</b> the shoulders, <b>some</b> <b>into</b> the trunk, <b>some</b> upwards through the soles of the feet, till the figure was completely permeated with pins.|$|R
5|$|Down {{the street}} from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got <b>into</b> <b>some</b> legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24years out of shame. He was hidden until {{virtually}} forgotten; he died in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a mysterious}} {{telephone}} call directed Harvard official Charles R.

5|$|In later years, {{because it}} was {{impossible}} for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts of the parish, the church eventually had many chapels of ease, as the population of the parish grew. One example of the latter is All Saints Church, Llangorwen, which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided <b>into</b> <b>some</b> 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.|$|E

5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches <b>into</b> <b>some</b> temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was {{a major factor in the}} slow economic development of the American southern states.|$|E
5|$|Shards of Alara also debuted mythic rares (red-orange), which replace one {{in eight}} rare cards on average.

5|$|The King Caesar House {{passed to}} Dr. Hermon Carey Bumpus, former {{director}} of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Bumpus extensively restored the house which had fallen <b>into</b> <b>some</b> disrepair after the Knapps died. In 1945, Elizabeth Weber-Fulop, an accomplished Austrian painter, purchased the house. Finally, in 1965, the Duxbury Rural and Historical Society purchased the King Caesar House and converted it into a museum dedicated to Duxbury's maritime era. The King Caesar House museum is located at 120 King Caesar Road in Duxbury, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|These {{concerns}} were further magnified in late 2006, when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs {{in the first}} two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia. Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies, Pathan was dropped {{for the rest of the}} tournament. He appeared to have run <b>into</b> <b>some</b> form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches.|$|E
5|$|After 1143 the war ground on, but {{progressing}} {{slightly better}} for Stephen. Miles of Gloucester, {{one of the}} most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of the pressure in the west. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during an attack on Burwell. The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the King recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, but then in 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first inviting Ranulf to court, before arresting him and threatening to execute him unless he handed over a number of castles, including Lincoln and Coventry. As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen. By this point, however, Stephen's practice of inviting barons to court and arresting them had brought him <b>into</b> <b>some</b> disrepute and increasing distrust.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surfaceâ€”many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped <b>into</b> <b>some</b> of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E

5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends <b>into</b> <b>some</b> of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E
5|$|By mid-2011, Arafiles {{had moved}} his {{practice}} to East Texas and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in Grand Saline. A hospital administrator there {{said that she}} had looked <b>into</b> <b>some</b> of the allegations against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about the doctor. In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|Crazy Kong {{was officially}} {{licensed}} from Nintendo and manufactured by Falcon for some non-US markets. Nevertheless, Crazy Kong machines {{found their way}} <b>into</b> <b>some</b> American arcades, often installed in cabinets marked as Congorilla.

Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under the Crazy Kong, Konkey Kong or Donkey King names. The 1982 Logger arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of Donkey Kong, with a large bird standing in for the ape and rolling logs instead of barrels.|$|E

The constituency since 2010 once again covers exactly {{the city of}} Bath (it is co-extensive with the unparished area), and is currently represented by Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse who beat Conservative Ben Howlett at the 2017 general election. Howlett had replaced the retiring Liberal Democrat Don Foster at the 2015 general election. Foster's election was a notable result of the 1992 general election, as Chris Patten, the previous Member (and Cabinet Minister) played a major part, as Chairman of the Conservative Party, in re-electing the government of John Major, but failed to defend his marginal seat.|$|E
5|$|The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial {{site was}} officially opened, and the {{memorial}} unveiled, by Field Marshal Earl Haig on 7 June 1925.

The site had fallen <b>into</b> <b>some</b> disrepair during the German occupation of France in the Second World War and following confederation the replacement of the original site cabin with a modern building as well as some trench restoration work was undertaken in time for the 45th anniversary of the battle. The memorial site was established as one of only two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside of Canada by the then Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps on 10 April 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} released for Microsoft Windows {{at the start}} of 2011 via Zachtronics' own website. Though it was initially rejected for sale on the Steam platform, Valve later offered to sell the game after it received high praise from game journalists; further attention came from the game's release alongside one of the Humble Indie Bundles. The game has since been ported to other computing platforms and mobile devices. Reviewers found the game's open-ended problem-solving nature as a highlight of the title.
