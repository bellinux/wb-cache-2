5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E
25|$|Significantly, it was {{not until}} the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began {{training}} Palestinians. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.|$|E

40|$|Most economists {{believe that}} wage-setting is very {{important}} for understanding macroeconomic behavior, but the form of wage equations commonly estimated suffer from problems of identification. The aim {{of this paper is to}} consider whether these problems are inevitable and, if they <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> ways in whi ch one can estimate structural models of wage-setting. It is argued that if one confines attention to models of wage bargaining t hat are commonly used, identification of the parameters of wage-setting should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a problem and that the most appropriate form of an aggregate wage equation should be a Phillips Curve.

500|$|Wisemore is not {{the only}} one to serve as a means to comment on society; the {{characters}} Vermilia and Lady Matchless are used to discuss the proper role of females within society by serving as housewives. The dialogue between the two reveals that females are only in control of the domestic sphere because men have allowed them to dominate in the area. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Fielding supports the repression of females; instead, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans including both emotions and morality. However, feminist critic Jill Campbell points out that Fielding does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality in order to dominate and assume power. Tiffany Potter, another feminist critic, sees gender within the play in a different light; Merital's actions and words show a moderate approach to females, and [...] "Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them." ...|$|E

As underlined by Lester and colleagues [1], replication cohorts are of primary importance in genetic association studies. With regard to primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS), however, {{it is difficult to}} collect a very large group of patients and our cohort of pSS patients, even though it comprised 281 patients, remains somehow of moderate size when compared with other cohorts of patients with closely related auto-immune diseases such as lupus. This observation leads us all to be very careful with the reported findings from pSS genetic association studies.

50|$|Censustaking {{was not yet}} {{an exact}} science.
