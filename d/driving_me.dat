500|$|... "You're <b>Driving</b> <b>Me</b> Crazy", The Temperance Seven (25 May 1961, #1) ...|$|E
500|$|... "This {{loneliness}} is <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> crazy. [...] To {{be able to}} live in {{the first}} place, I must have alcohol. Wine or whisky. That’s the matter. Abused, alone, and all my real friends are dead. My current prestige here at home is rock-bottom. Impossible to work. If only there were a solution." ...|$|E
500|$|The Pac-10 conference {{suspended}} the entire officiating crew, including both on-field and instant-reply officials, for one game. [...] The replay official, Gordon Riese, requested and {{was granted a}} leave of absence {{for the remainder of the}} season. [...] Reise was quoted as saying, [...] "I feel so bad I missed that call, it's <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> crazy," [...] and that he was [...] "struggling" [...] with his mistake. [...] On-field official David Cutaia had his suspension delayed so that he could officiate the September 23rd game between the University of Southern California and the University of Arizona due to a shortage of Pac-10 conference officials.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad news! Is that {{an excuse}} for <b>driving</b> over <b>me?</b> You hope he caught it? I hope he's thrown himself out. The ruffian! I hope he's killed himself." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour we were off. It was only when the great car swung from the avenue into the country lane that Jacky, who was <b>driving,</b> turned toward <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You've seen <b>me</b> clumsy, in <b>driving.</b> You taught <b>me</b> to {{get over}} it. Perhaps I can teach you some things. And we'll study--together--evenings! I'm a {{thoroughly}} ignorant parasite woman. Make me become real! A real woman!" ...|$|R
500|$|Despite his {{successful}} media career, Icke wrote that 1989 {{was a time}} of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said he began to feel a presence around him. He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: [...] "If there is anybody here, will you please contact me because you are <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> up the wall!" [...] Days later, in a newsagent's in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.|$|E
500|$|Writing in Rolling Stones Harrison {{commemorative}} issue, in January 2002, Mikal Gilmore recognised his {{incorporation of}} dissonance on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] {{as having been}} [...] "revolutionary in popular music" [...] in 1966. Gilmore considered this innovation to be [...] "perhaps more originally creative" [...] than the avant-garde styling that Lennon and McCartney took from Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgar Varese and Igor Stravinsky and incorporated into the Beatles' work over the same period. According to musicologist Dominic Pedler, the E79 chord that Harrison introduced in the song became [...] "one of the most legendary in the entire Beatles catalogue". Speaking in 2001, Harrison said: [...] "I'm really proud of that as I literally invented that chord … John later borrowed it on I Want You (She's So Heavy): [...] 'It's <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> mad.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Along {{with his}} estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical {{competitiveness}} {{with him and}} kept an ear on his music. During his five-year career break he was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released [...] "Coming Up" [...] in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio and {{the last year of}} his life. [...] "It's <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> crackers!" [...] he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head. That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, [...] "I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ray Charles' second hit record, [...] "It Should Have Been Me" [...] (1954), {{uses the}} Dynaflow {{as a sign}} of wealth and class in the lyric, [...] "...It should have been <b>me,</b> <b>driving</b> that Dynaflow!" [...] The song was written by Memphis Curtis.|$|R
5000|$|Before the conference, Tubiana {{explained}} {{her views}} on global warming: [...] "It's a fascinatingly complex topic... Conditions today are unsustainable and unbalanced, favouring attitudes {{and levels of}} consumption which are harmful for us all. The <b>driving</b> force for <b>me</b> is {{the very idea of}} justice".|$|R
6000|$|That {{morning we}} trekked on fast, fearing lest a {{regiment}} searching for these [...] "thieves" [...] should strike and follow our spoor. Luckily the ox that the lion had killed {{was one of}} some spare cattle which I was <b>driving</b> with <b>me,</b> so its loss did not inconvenience us. As we went Umslopogaas {{told me that he}} had duly appointed Lousta and his wife Monazi to rule the tribe during his absence, an office which they accepted doubtfully, Monazi acting as Chieftainess and Lousta as her head Induna or Councillor.|$|R
500|$|The New York Dolls and Morton {{produced}} little original material {{together and}} had to record cover songs and re-recorded some of the band's earlier demos to complete Too Much Too Soon; [...] "Babylon", [...] "Who Are the Mystery Girls?", [...] "It's Too Late" [...] and [...] "Human Being" [...] had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, [...] "Teenage News" [...] and [...] "Too Much Too Soon", before working with Morton, but neither were considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling {{he had been in}} a rush: [...] "He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to tell me who had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> nuts." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} New York in October 1986. Madonna {{would ask for}} five minutes to study the script for the scene they were filming. For example, before {{a scene in which}} she needed to appear out of breath, she did a series of push-ups before going on set. Dunne {{observed}} that [...] " [...] likes her first take best. I think my best is around fourth. She always says, 'You got it, you got it,' and she was <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> crazy just like her character would. We had to make a compromise as to which take is the best." [...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know what she was doing, she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E
5000|$|Terry {{later told}} police, [...] "They got {{everything}} they had, {{put it in}} the car and drove off, and me too, and they drove me back home. While we were <b>driving</b> they told <b>me</b> that they were Satan worshippers and they had to do it Peter Aston for the sacrifice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nor did I find a maiden till {{one night}} {{coming back from}} the fishing. The {{sunlight}} was lying, so, low and full in the eyes, the wind free, and the kayacks racing with the white seas. Of a sudden the kayak of Unga came <b>driving</b> past <b>me,</b> and she looked upon me, so, with her black hair flying like a cloud of night and the spray wet on her cheek. As I say, the sunlight was full in the eyes, and I was a stripling; but somehow it was all clear, and I knew it to be the call of kind to kind.|$|R
5000|$|In mid July 1877 {{his work}} on the sex life of plants culminated in the {{publication}} of The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species, dedicated to Asa Gray. He could not [...] "endure being idle" [...] and turned to his next book, on plant movement. Emma got him away for his autumn break to Abinger on the North Downs, and though Wallace now lived only a few miles away, Darwin avoided him, diplomatically writing that he [...] "wished to come over to see you, but <b>driving</b> tires <b>me</b> so much that my courage failed." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the scenes. Actor Markinson, upon seeing the costume, said [...] "this is what's <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> crazy?" [...] Director Kim Manners was highly critical of the monster and later told people that after the episode would air, his career would be [...] "over". Gilligan attributed the problems due to the episodic work schedule, he noted, [...] "we're usually on such a short schedule {{that there has to be}} a weak link somewhere". Gilligan also stated that the [...] "over engineered" [...] aspects of the suit made it somewhat comical. To fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the filmed footage to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who [...] "took the footage with the monster in it, erased the monster completely, took the monster to a different screen [...] animated it, and added speed blur". The effects took a large amount of time to complete. They were only finished at 7:30 the morning the episode was scheduled to air. In the end, the monster is not clearly visible in the installment, which allowed the scariness of the episode to be more real, according to Gilligan.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "North Hollywood" [...] is an affectionate ode to Hunt's {{community}} at the time. Its lyrics portray the district as the [...] "crown jewel of saboteurs" [...] and reference its population of misfits and low-lifes, including evicting landlords and conniving starlets. The song features abrasive funk, distorted guitar, {{and a heavy}} beat. [...] "Watching You Go Crazy Is <b>Driving</b> <b>Me</b> Insane" [...] features a melodic punk and garage rock style, with dark humor in its lyrics. It is about a couple whose financial difficulties affect their relationship. [...] "Designer Jeans" [...] features lyrics with psychedlic musings on the contemporary social climate, including criticism of [...] "mass production and consumption of opinions" [...] and the erasure of independent thought. [...] "Plum" [...] is an ode to a lover's posterior. [...] "Falls (Violet)" [...] is a ballad with a sketchy country music feel. Its narrator expresses support to a woman he is infatuated with as she dates someone else. [...] "Moving Targets" [...] is a bedroom ballad with sparse, 1980s-styled percussion and an Isley Brothers influence. Its lyrics use warfare imagery in detailing a romance. [...] "Eyes Like Pearls" [...] features hard rock guitar and earnest, romantic lyrics, which Hunt explained to The Huffington Post: [...] "It's a very passionate love, one that's rarely known in one's life. They're obviously tears of joy, but it's a passion beyond anything I've ever known. It's a relationship where somebody understands me and who I understand." ...|$|E
500|$|Kubica {{clinched}} the first pole position {{of his career}} {{with a time of}} 1:33.096. Massa qualified less than 0.03seconds behind the BMW and joined Kubica on the front row of the grid. Hamilton took third place, using his team's spare chassis; Räikkönen was next quickest, and despite being critical of his car's set-up was confident in its racing ability. Kovalainen would line up fifth on the grid alongside Heidfeld, who had trouble maximising performance from his tyres. Trulli took seventh place, ahead of Rosberg and Honda driver Jenson Button. Renault driver Fernando Alonso was the last driver to make the third session; Webber missed out on the top ten by 0.009seconds and would start the race in 11th position. Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello took 12th place after a gearbox problem interrupted his second session laps, ahead of Timo Glock of Toyota, Nelson Piquet of Renault and Toro Rosso driver Sébastien Bourdais. Nakajima was the slowest of the second session drivers, and took 16th. Coulthard qualified 17th, ahead of Giancarlo Fisichella of Force India. Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel took 19th, and blamed his set-up: [...] "I felt it was more a case of the car <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> than me driving the car." [...] Fisichella's teammate Adrian Sutil qualified 20th, ahead of Anthony Davidson of Super Aguri. Davidson's teammate Takuma Sato spun out and crashed into the barriers. Sato's accident damaged his rear wing and suspension and left him unable to continue in the session.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very," [...] {{he replied}} quietly. [...] "I know my {{drawbacks}} {{and they must}} be removed. I have inherited the responsibilities of an embarrassed house. My job's to repair its credit, wipe out debts, and make Wyndhams' respected, as it was respected once. A big job, but the ambition behind it gives <b>me</b> <b>driving</b> force." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I knew as {{much about}} driving as I like it," [...] said she, [...] "I should be a famous whip. Before we go, I am going to ask Miriam to take me out with her, two or three times, and give <b>me</b> lessons in <b>driving.</b> She told <b>me</b> that you had taught her a great deal." ...|$|R
60|$|Hope {{made the}} race seem different. Something stirred and beat warm within <b>me,</b> <b>driving</b> out the chill in my marrow. I {{leaned over the}} neck of the great bay horse, and called to him and cheered him on. Then I saw he was deaf and blind to me, for he was wild. He had the bit between his teeth, and was running away.|$|R
500|$|Her {{marriage}} to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897, when Victoria {{returned home from}} a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst {{in bed with a}} male servant. She did not make her accusation public, but told a niece that [...] "no boy was safe, from the stable hands to the kitchen help. He slept quite openly with them all." [...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came to believe it was the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. If I had not loved her so, I would have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe. Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than [...] "the general disgrace of a divorce." ...|$|E

2500|$|Melvin Howard Tormé {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, to {{immigrant}} Russian Jewish parents whose surname had been Torma. A child prodigy, he first performed professionally at age 4 with the Coon-Sanders Orchestra, singing [...] "You're <b>Driving</b> <b>Me</b> Crazy" [...] at Chicago's Blackhawk restaurant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Nora," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{not quite}} so bad as that! But for many years I have had a great, <b>driving</b> impulse inside <b>me,</b> and {{at the back of}} it the most {{wonderful}} incentive in all the world. You know what that is, Nora--or perhaps you don't. To a woman it would be love, I suppose. To a man it is hate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I war {{a walking}} along quiet wi' t' dogs," [...] he said, [...] "when I hears a cart a coming from Stokebridge. I looks round and seed they two chaps, but didn't mind no further about it till {{as they came}} oop that sandy-haired chap as was a <b>driving</b> lets <b>me</b> and Bess ha' one which made me joomp, I can tell 'ee. Bess she pinned the horse, and Juno {{she tried to get}} into t' cart at 'em. They were joost frighted, they hollers, and yawps, and looks as white as may be. I fastens Juno oop wi' a strap and they houlds Bess while I poot some snoof t' her nose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, my dear young friend, my child, I {{will still}} say," [...] said the cardinal. [...] "Nothing {{can be more}} reasonable than what you suggest. No doubt our friends {{may be a little}} too anxious about you, but they are the best people in the world. You appear to me to be quite well enough now to make more exertion than hitherto they have thought you capable of. They see you every day, and cannot judge so well of you as I who have been absent. I will charge myself to effect all your wishes. And we will begin by my taking you out to-morrow and your <b>driving</b> with <b>me</b> about the city. I will show you Rome and the Roman people." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 28 July 2007, Bond {{appeared}} in a special celebrity version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? with Michael Buerk {{to raise money for}} NCH, the children's charity (now called 'Action for Children'). In a combined effort, they raised £64,000. On 22 August 2007, she presented an episode of <b>Driving</b> <b>Me</b> Crazy which saw her investigating whether the authorities are giving motorists excessive penalties through speeding fines and parking tickets.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2007 CPAC, Coulter said, [...] "I do want {{to point}} out one thing that has been <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> crazy with the media—how they keep {{describing}} Mitt Romney's position as being pro-gays, and that's going to upset the right wingers," [...] and [...] "Well, you know, screw you! I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against." [...] She added, [...] "I don't know why all gays aren't Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays {{make a lot of money}} and they're victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "From a {{child who}} grew up partly in England writing prose, Thakore evolved into a {{teenager}} who explored Braj lyrics, which he had to sing as a student of music. His love for poetry took him to literary greats who lived in Mumbai such as Adil Jussawalla, Dom Moraes and Gieve Patel who guided him through the jungle of words. But he considers Hart Crane {{as one of his}} earliest poetic influences... The metre and discipline of traditional verse forms helped Thakore find a 'deeper integration of ideas and meanings.' [...] "Free verse," [...] he says, [...] "was <b>driving</b> <b>me</b> crazy. There was too much linguistic and cultural chaos in my head'." [...] - Anupama Raju, The Hindu.|$|E
5000|$|Twelve {{years after}} her initial break, Segal {{dramatically}} entered another phase of her experience, centered around a sense of unity of perception between herself and the world: [...] "In {{the midst of a}} particularly eventful week, I was driving north to meet some friends when I suddenly became aware that I was driving through myself. For years there had been no self at all, yet here on this road everything was myself, and I was <b>driving</b> through <b>me</b> to arrive where I already was. In essence, I was going nowhere because I was everywhere already. The infinite emptiness I knew myself to be was now apparent as the infinite substance of everything I saw." [...] This sense of cognitive and spiritual oneness remained with Segal for two years, up through the publishing of Collisions in 1996.|$|R
60|$|I lighted {{the lamps}} of my carriage; I wrapt her in furs, and placed her along the seat; then taking the reins, made the horses go forward. We {{proceeded}} through the snow, which lay in masses impeding the way, while the descending flakes, <b>driving</b> against <b>me</b> with redoubled fury, blinded me. The pain occasioned by the angry elements, {{and the cold}} iron of the shafts of frost which buffetted me, and entered my aching flesh, were a relief to me; blunting my mental suffering. The horses staggered on, and the reins hung loosely in my hands. I often thought I would lay my head close to the sweet, cold face of my lost angel, and thus resign myself to conquering torpor. Yet I must not leave her a prey to the fowls of the air; but, in pursuance of my determination place her in the tomb of her forefathers, where a merciful God might permit me to rest also.|$|R
500|$|In a 2016 video {{documentary}} by Noclip's Danny O'Dwyer, Creative Director of Doom (2016) Hugo Martin {{described the}} [...] "Hell on Earth" [...] premise as: [...] "It was like Robert Zemeckis. See Contact, like, if this really happened. Now let's be clear: it was awesome. But {{it was more}} realistic. It was about the global impact of a Hellish invasion." [...] The creative director of the Doom 4 prototype, Kevin Cloud, said in the same interview, [...] "As far as the upper-level creative direction, that was <b>me</b> <b>driving</b> that. And honestly, again, taking it in a direction I don't think the fans would have enjoyed." ...|$|R
