40|$|Three {{populations of}} Drosophila melanogaster from {{northern}} California were surveyed for {{the ability to}} produce and resist gonadal dysgenesis in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis. Males from all three populations produced low to moderate levels of gonadal dysgenesis in crosses to Oregon-R M females. Most females had the P cytotype, but the M cytotype occurred occasionally. The three populations could not be statistically differentiated from one another, but were easily distinguished from populations from Australia and Wisconsin {{on the basis of}} gonadal dysgenesis potential. The California populations had higher levels of M cytotype than did the Wisconsin population. Thirteen X chromosomes and 11 pairs of autosomes were extracted from one of the California populations, using a modification of the standard balancer chromosome technique to suppress hybrid dysgenesis during <b>extraction.</b> All <b>lines</b> produced strongly skewed sterility distributions in crosses to M-strain females, and mean levels of sterility were less than 50 %.
