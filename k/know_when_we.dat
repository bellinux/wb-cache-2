You <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> hear a concept or a title that we like—no matter if it's ours or somebody else's—both Anders and I {{get a feel for the}} song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song. We played around with the melody, put down the demo, and it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} nine {{seasons with}} Cleveland, Doby was traded on October 25, 1955, to the Chicago White Sox for Chico Carrasquel and Jim Busby. Chicago {{was looking for}} a consistent home run hitter after finishing the season with 116 home runs as a team. [...] "The search is over for a long ball hitter. We've certainly needed a consistent one—and we've been eying Doby for some time", said White Sox vice president Chuck Comiskey. White Sox manager Marty Marion believed Doby's bat would be a welcome addition to his club when he said, [...] "The guy used to murder us when we played Cleveland. He'll {{make a big difference in}} the number of one-run and two-run decisions we might lose." [...] After winning a doubleheader against the Yankees on June 22, 1956, Doby and the White Sox swept New York, the first time since the 1945 season the Yankees had been swept in a four-game series. The White Sox won eight straight games, the longest winning streak in the AL to that point in the season, and had done so with the help of Doby's six home runs during the eight-game stretch. [...] "You <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> dealt for Doby, we weren't worried about Larry. We knew he'd come through", Comiskey said. Doby finished the season with a [...]268 batting average and led the team with 24 home runs and 102 RBIs. Chicago finished 1956 in third place in the AL with an 85–69 record.|$|E
500|$|Galaxy had a {{characteristic}} cover {{style in the}} 1950s with an inverted white [...] "L" [...] shape (Greek gamma) framing the cover art; this style was copied by several magazines, including Authentic Science Fiction and Startling Stories. [...] When Astounding followed suit in late 1951, Gold commented sarcastically in an editorial that Galaxy [...] "would like to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> may have it [...] back again". The first variation came with the September 1956 issue, which widened the left hand strip of white to allow room to print story titles and author names. [...] The December 1961 issue {{was the first to}} eliminate the strip on the left, and until July 1969 the magazine varied between this layout, the inverted [...] "L", and a version with no white at all, first used on the August 1965 issue. [...] Another change visible in that issue is the reversal of the title coloring to white lettering on a block of red; this was used from August 1963 to December 1965. [...] In August 1969 the title was enlarged to fill the width of the magazine; this issue had the white inverted [...] "L", but it was the last one to do so till 1980. After August 1969 the cover paintings spanned the entire cover, though with some minor variations in layout such {{as can be seen in}} the October 1976 issue. [...] Then in September 1978 (undated on the cover, but numbered vol. 39 no. 7) the original typeface for [...] "Galaxy" [...] was abandoned for the last few issues. [...] The final issue, edited by Kemske, returned to the previous layout and typeface, although with a magazine twice the size of the original digest. [...] When E. J. Gold revived Galaxy in 1994, he restored the inverted [...] "L" [...] and employed a predominantly black-and-white look for the eight issues he published.|$|E

500|$|In the Protestant Christian tradition, Martin Luther insisted in the Diet of Worms {{that his}} {{conscience}} was captive to the Word of God, {{and it was}} neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere. John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: [...] " [...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein". Many Christians regard following one's conscience as important as, or even more important than, obeying human authority. A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us {{that we need to}} repent.' This can sometimes (as with the conflict between William Tyndale and Thomas More over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: [...] "Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?" [...] Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the Ten Commandments or of Jesus as the highest authority in any situation, regardless {{of the extent to which}} it involves responsibilities in law. In the Gospel of John (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: [...] "'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one" [...] (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the Gospel of Luke (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.|$|E

Motion of the fluid tells us if we are moving. [...] The vestibule is {{the region of the}} inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the cochlea (the hearing organ). The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. [...] This is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).|$|E

2500|$|Chesterton died of {{congestive}} heart failure on the morning of 14 June 1936, at his home in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. His last known words were a greeting spoken to his wife. The homily at Chesterton's Requiem Mass in Westminster Cathedral, London, was delivered by Ronald Knox on 27 June 1936. Knox said, [...] "All of this generation has grown up under Chesterton's influence so completely that we do not even <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are thinking Chesterton." [...] He is buried in Beaconsfield in the Catholic Cemetery. Chesterton's estate was probated at £28,389, approximately equivalent in 2012 terms to £1.3million.|$|E
2500|$|Garner has {{campaigned for}} laws {{to protect her}} {{children}} from paparazzi. [...] "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it.

So the guys <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids." [...] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers. The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{research}} by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness {{may not be}} what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it easy to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the introspection illusion. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to [...] "veto" [...] an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.|$|E
