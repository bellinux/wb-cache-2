25|$|Two rookies faced off in Game1 for {{the first}} time in history: Anthony Reyes for St. Louis and Justin Verlander for Detroit. It looked like the Tigers were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Reyes early in the bottom of the first, when Craig Monroe doubled and Magglio Ordóñez walked. Carlos Guillén singled Monroe in, giving the Tigers a 1–0 lead. However, in the top of the second, Scott Rolen hit a long home run to left field, tying the score at 1–1. Rolen was 0-for-15 in his career in the World Series before hitting the home run. The {{previous}} mark had been 0-for-13, set by Benny Kauff of the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series. In the third inning the Cards broke through, first when Chris Duncan's RBI double scored Yadier Molina to give the Cardinals the lead. On Verlander's next pitch, 2005 National League MVP Albert Pujols banged a two-run home run, punishing the rookie who elected to pitch to the dangerous Pujols, rather than walk him with first base open and two outs and pitch to Jim Edmonds.|$|E

500|$|... 52 was {{promoted}} as a comic that {{would attempt to}} incorporate as many DC Comics characters as possible. In a Q session hosted by Newsarama.com, 52 editor Michael Siglain answered {{a series of questions}} regarding which characters fans wanted to see in the series. Question No.19 asked [...] "We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52. Could you please tell us when we can expect his appearances?" [...] Siglain's simple response to readers was, [...] "check back in the late 40s." [...] Speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue No.48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication. [...] On the cover, the circle-A could be seen as a minor element in the background. In a review for [...] "Week 48", Major Spoilers considered the absence of Anarky a drawback: [...] "It's too bad we didn't see the return of Anarky as hinted by this week's cover" [...] Pop culture critic, Douglas Wolk, wrote, [...] "I guess this issue's cover is the closest we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Anarky after all (and by proxy as close as we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Haunted Tank).

500|$|Movement by {{the astronauts}} was {{detected}} by the spacecraft's inertial measurement unit and the astronaut's biomedical sensors, and also indicated by increases in oxygen spacesuit flow, and sounds from Grissom's stuck-open microphone. There was no evidence to identify the movement, {{or whether it was}} related to the fire. [...] The stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew, the Operations and Checkout Building, and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The poor communications led Grissom to remark: [...] "How are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?" [...] The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem. All countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6:20pm, but at 6:30 the count remained on hold at T minus 10 minutes.|$|E

500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E

She is a star and that's why people love her. She's also really entertaining with her visual as well as her lyrics, and she has a great melody." [...] The singer continued to reveal how she was impressed with Minaj's songwriting abilities, saying [...] "I'm really amazed that she can write like that. [...] not only raps but she can write songs too... It was really easy actually. We were going back and forth with the texts on how we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do it because we were in two different places and had two opposite schedules." [...] In an interview with DJ Semtex for BBC Radio, Minaj explained how the concept for her rap verse developed, revealing [...] "I just wanted to be crazy, I wrote that track in bed actually. I had an off day, they sent me a record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote." [...] With regard to the original, [...] "It's Raining Men", Minaj stated that she wanted to make [...] "Raining Men" [...] "more melodic and crazy." [...] "Raining Men" [...] was sent for urban radio adds as the third single from Loud on December 7, 2010. On January 25, 2011, the song was re-released for urban radio adds.|$|E

And then it jumped into 2015, where we were going to shoot Clerks and then hopefully ‘Mallrats’ {{before the end of the}} year. But now, based on a fucking mall that we all dig that will be going away, the priority has become Mallrats. So the next fucking movie I’m making is Mallrats 2." [...] In June 2016, Smith {{announced that}} the plans for a Mallrats sequel had been turned into plans for a 10-episode TV series.|$|E
2500|$|By 1977, the show's {{ratings were}} declining and Newhart {{wanted to end}} it, but was under {{contract}} to do one more season. The show's writers tried to rework the sitcom by adding a pregnancy, but Newhart objected: [...] "I told the creators I didn't want any children, because I didn't {{want it to be}} a show about 'How stupid Daddy is, but we love him so much, let's {{get him out of the}} trouble he's gotten himself into'." [...] Nevertheless, the staff wrote an episode that they hoped would change Newhart's mind. Newhart read the script and he agreed it was very funny. He then asked, [...] "Who are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> play Bob?" [...] Coincidentally, Newhart's wife gave birth to their daughter Jenny late in the year, which caused him to miss several episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Moffat {{had always}} {{intended}} for Amy and Rory {{to get married}} [...] "from the off". Gillan stated, [...] "What I love about that relationship is that we really saw it develop {{to get to the}} stage where they were happy together. Because we started off at a point where Amy didn't want to be committed to him, and he absolutely did, and that just gave us somewhere to go with it, rather than just them being happy together. So it was interesting, and it evolved, and Rory really became a hero in the process". She was pleased that the audience was able to see Amy's life [...] "pan out", starting {{when she was a child}} and through her marriage and daughter. Gillan stated that the aftermath of [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] would [...] "change her in a big way for the long run and I think we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see Amy in a really different light". According to Moffat, by the seventh series, Amy and Rory had become [...] "a crack team"; so used to being the Doctor's companions that instead of marvelling at him they [...] "treat him like a big kid they have to look after".|$|E
2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. leans over to me and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And I remember when I finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you your big break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E
