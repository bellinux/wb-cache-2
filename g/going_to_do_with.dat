5|$|When Echo & the Bunnymen {{entered the}} studio to record What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> Your Life?, bassist Les Pattinson {{received}} news {{that his mother was}} unwell. That, coupled with Pattinson's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way, led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band. McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined to continue as Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Olympic Studios, Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London.|$|E

In a CNN interview about the show, he told Larry King [...] "no one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead. And that was what I said I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Phenomenon.

500|$|After working {{together}} as Electrafixion, McCulloch, Sergeant and Pattinson regrouped in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen with the UK Top 10 hit [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever". An album of new material, Evergreen, was greeted enthusiastically by critics {{and the band}} made a successful return to the live arena. Though Pattinson left the group for a second time, McCulloch and Sergeant continue to record as Echo & the Bunnymen, releasing What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> Your Life? (1999), Flowers (2001), Siberia (2005), The Fountain (2009), and Meteorites (2014).|$|E
500|$|What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> Your Life? was {{released}} on 16 April 1999 through London Records following {{the release of the}} first single from the album, [...] "Rust", the previous month. One further single, [...] "Get in the Car", followed the album's release. The album received mixed reviews from the music press, being described as both flawless and having no appeal. The album was not as popular with the public as earlier releases from Echo & the Bunnymen; the album peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E

500|$|Labyrinth {{took five}} months to film, {{and was a}} {{complicated}} shoot due to the myriad of puppets and animatronic creatures involved. In the making-of documentary Inside the Labyrinth, Henson stated that although Jim Henson's Creature Shop had been building the puppets and characters required for around {{a year and a}} half prior to shooting, [...] "everything came together in the last couple weeks." [...] Henson noted, [...] "even if you have the characters together, the puppeteers start working with them, they find problems or they try to figure out what they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> these characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Released in March 1999, [...] "Rust" [...] was {{the first}} single to come from What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> Your Life?. The single peaked at number twenty-two on the UK Singles Chart, and NME {{magazine}} named it their Single of the Week. The album was released the following month on 16 April and, having failed {{to appeal to the}} public as much as the band's previous albums, peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart. [...] "Get in the Car", one of the tracks recorded with Fun Lovin' Criminals, was later released as a single.|$|E
500|$|Newman was, {{according}} to Nilsson, [...] "tired {{of the album}} when we were finished making it." [...] "For him it was just doing piano and voice... over and over." [...] Nilsson explained [...] "once I got the take down, I knew what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it later. He didn't." [...] Newman said of his experience that he [...] "was honored that a writer with Harry's talent would choose to do an album of someone else's songs." [...] Newman continued, [...] "he {{was such a great}} singer, a virtuoso singer, really, and he could do so many things as a vocalist that I couldn't do—like hold a note." ...|$|E

500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' and we had no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. What are they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> all this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony. People will say they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> Your Life? is {{the eighth}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. The album saw the {{departure}} of bassist Les Pattinson from the group, partly due to disagreements with vocalist Ian McCulloch; McCulloch and the remaining band member, guitarist Will Sergeant, subsequently recorded the record with session musicians. The London Metropolitan Orchestra provided backing music and the American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals appeared as guest musicians on two tracks. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and it was recorded at various locations throughout England. Feeling sidelined during the recording of the album, Sergeant described it as [...] "probably the worst time in my whole life".|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} <b>with</b> it that I like a sight {{better than}} that. Poor Moses won't come any more, I guess.

5000|$|Lainson {{declared}} his victory a {{win for the}} party's moderates and Keegstra's supporters vowed to continue the fight. Green said of Lainson after his victory, [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stonewall this guy. There's no way we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business <b>with</b> him. As far as we're concerned, this bunch {{is part of the}} conspiracy." ...|$|R
50|$|Drummer Alan Waddington {{stated in}} an May 24, 1985 {{interview}} at Madame Wong's West in Santa Monica: It's great to know you're wanted, and that you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>with</b> a major label. The label has sunk {{a lot of}} money into us just trying to get a record made. Right now, that's their main concern.|$|R
500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E
500|$|Near the novel's conclusion, Judd {{refuses to}} honor his {{agreement}} with Marty {{because there was no}} witness. When Marty asks his mother what a witness is, she responds: [...] "Somebody who knows the Lord Jesus and don't mind tellin' about it." [...] Despite Judd's refusal to honor the agreement, Marty persistently maintains his part of it. He decides: [...] "I got no choice. All I can do is stick to my side of the deal and see what happens. All in the world I can do." [...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> that dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him." [...] Scholar Claudia Mills noted that: [...] "The resolution of the stand-off comes when Marty, in essence, stands witness, in his mother's religious sense of witness, for an ethic of love, crystallized in his love for Shiloh." ...|$|E
500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to get that out of my system." ...|$|E

60|$|THE {{ship out}} of the way, we were quite anxious {{to know what was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> us.

However, he never put us to bed any more; and we had everything our own way.|$|R
500|$|O'Malley was {{characterized}} a [...] "hapless naif". On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's {{going to be very}} interesting to see is what he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I think George has a lot of growing up to do. Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's been pretty sheltered." ...|$|E
500|$|By this time, Nixon {{campaign}} headquarters was receiving {{a flood of}} messages, calling on the senator to resign from the ticket. When Eisenhower's train stopped for the candidate to make speeches, he faced protesters with signs reading [...] "Donate Here to Help Poor Richard Nixon". The influential Washington Post and New York Herald-Tribune both called for Nixon to leave the ticket, facts which Chotiner did not tell his candidate; [...] Nixon learned them from a questioning reporter. Over 100 newspapers would editorialize about the Fund {{on the morning of}} September 20, opinion running two to one against Nixon. As his train stopped in Eugene, Oregon, Nixon was met with protestors signs referencing his wife: [...] "Pat, What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>With</b> the Bribe Money?" [...] and [...] "No Mink Coats for Nixon—Just Cold Cash". He angrily responded with a phrase which would be echoed in the Checkers speech. After stating that there were no mink coats for the Nixons, the candidate said that he was [...] "proud of the fact that Pat Nixon wears a good Republican cloth coat, and she's going to continue to." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E
