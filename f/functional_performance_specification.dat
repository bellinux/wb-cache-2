40|$|The {{briefing}} {{process is}} critical to the successful delivery of construction projects. Although a number of briefing guides have been developed, attempting to address the problems of briefing, they are often criticized as being too general and implicit. This paper describes a structured framework for identifying and representing client requirements (CRs) in the briefing process. It integrates the value management (VM) methodology with function analysis system technique (FAST) and <b>functional</b> <b>performance</b> <b>specification</b> (FPS) to enable the client organization and project team to systematically identify, clarify and clearly represent CRs in the briefing process. It comprises four interrelated phases: preparation, information, analysis and evaluation. This paper starts with a critical review of previous work in briefing and function analysis, followed by an introduction to the research methodology and detailed illustration of the proposed framework. The use of this framework can facilitate and lead to systematic identification and clarification of client requirements and the formation of a more precise and explicit representation of these requirements. The limitations of the approach are also discussed in the paper. Briefing, value management, client requirements, function analysis, <b>functional</b> <b>performance</b> <b>specification,...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{introduce}} FPS, {{a mechanism}} to define performance measures for stochastic process algebra models. FPS is a <b>functional</b> <b>performance</b> <b>specification</b> language which describes passagetime, transient, steady-state and continuous state space performance questions. We present a generalisation of stochastic probes, a formalismindependent specification of behaviour in stochastic process algebra models. Stochastic probes select the performance-critical paths for which the measures are required; increasing their expressiveness in turn gives us greater expressive power to represent performance questions. We end by demonstrating these tools on an RSS syndication architecture of up to 1. 5 × 10 51 states. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Specification</b> (FPS) is a {{structured}} requirement analysis process, in which client requirements are firstly defined with functions and relevant evaluation criteria-functional performance. This paper describes a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) system recommending functions and functional performance {{to facilitate the}} use of FPS in the briefing of building projects. It begins with {{an introduction to the}} briefing practice and the problems of using FPS in briefing, followed by proposing a structural job plan of FPS. Next, the CBR system design is described and how it supports the use of FPS is illustrated. Finally, the competence of the system is evaluated with two experiments, which demonstrate that the CBR system is a highly promising tool for facilitating the use of FPS. The future research work concerning addressing the shortcomings of the CBR system identified in the experiments is also noted. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E

A large camera {{which will take}} line by line pictures of the earth from a geostationary satellite {{in the same manner}} as a TV picture using both the spin of the spacecraft and the tilt of a telescope is included. The scanning mechanism provides the + or - 9 degrees tilt angle of the telescope through 2, 500 elementary steps of 1. 256 0. 0001 radian. As the radiometer image quality is closely dependent on the characteristics of the scanning law, the mechanism is required to fulfill <b>functional</b> <b>performances</b> <b>specifications</b> particularly severe in terms of linearity of the scan curve, accuracy of each step as well as repeatability of the short-term scanning. The focusing mechanism allows + or - 12 millimeters shift of the telescope focus by step increments of 0. 140 mm.

40|$|Project Briefing {{is carried}} out after Strategic Briefing in the {{feasibility}} stage of the development project and is {{the second stage of}} the briefing process. The primary objective of Project Briefing is to develop a project brief which forms the basis of design for construction projects. The lack of formal assessment of client’s needs and requirements in the briefing process has been identified as an issue of concerns during an international research project into current briefing practice. A methodology which utilises a Value Management (VM) approach to systematically identify and clarify client’s requirements in the briefing process is developed successfully in this study. The focus of this paper is on how this method can be used for Project Briefing. This methodology comprises eight main activities, Time/Cost/Quality Analysis, User Flow Analysis, Functional Space Analysis, Adjacency Matrix, Outline Room Data Sheets and <b>Functional</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Specification,</b> Creativity Session, Outline Budget Guidelines and Procurement Route Analysis. Whilst the benefits of using the recommended methodology have been confirmed through a focus group meeting, further research work is needed to verify the benefits of this methodology in practice and to make further improvements. The authors sincerely hope that the recommended methodology will be tested in a number of real life projects in the near future.

40|$|The Information System of Building Components -ISBC, {{consists}} {{of a set of}} activities to control the graphic data operation procedures of building plans and its storage in a data base. The system is specially prepared to be used by architects, engineers and cad operators who are dealing with a continuous flow of design problems, regarding the permanent adaptation and modification of office's layout in a great amount of buildings around the country. These constant changes bring out several types of architectural design problems that should be taken into consideration by the proposed system, particularly the reallocation of office furniture and the modification of building components. Therefore, the principal goal of the system is based on the inquiry and permanently updating of the data base composed by: furniture, technical equipment (computers and telecommunications networks), lights, air-conditioning, sanitary equipments and any other equipment that can be inventoried. The generation and operation of great amount of graphics and alphanumerical information bring out severe data inconsistency problems, particularly when graphic data is envolved. The task of "feeding" and modifying a data base produces errors that aren't easy to solve, even when specific consistency procedures are used. The ISBC provides the computer routines for the initial task of building up the required data base of each building, allowing to use an interactive algorithm among the digitized plans of each office and the data base of the enquiry system.

Symptom burden was measured using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS), and the <b>functional</b> <b>performance</b> was measured using the <b>Functional</b> <b>Performance</b> Inventory-Short Form (FPISF). Findings revealed that participants experienced a median of 13 symptoms. The most burdensome symptoms were shortness of breath, lack of energy, difficulty sleeping, worrying, dry mouth, feeling nervous, feeling irritable, and feeling sad. Participants with very severe COPD had the greatest symptom burden, followed by those with severe COPD, moderate COPD, and mild COPD. Symptom burden was higher for the psychological symptoms compared to the physical symptoms. Participants with mild COPD had the highest <b>functional</b> <b>performance,</b> followed by those with moderate COPD, very severe COPD, and severe COPD. Twenty symptoms were negatively correlated with overall <b>functional</b> <b>performance,</b> indicating that high symptom burden for those symptoms was associated with low overall <b>functional</b> <b>performance.</b> Moderate, negative, statistically significant correlations were found between the total symptom burden and overall <b>functional</b> <b>performance,</b> physical symptom burden and overall <b>functional</b> <b>performance</b> and psychological symptom burden and overall <b>functional</b> <b>performance.</b> A negative linear relationship was found between total symptom burden and overall <b>functional</b> <b>performance</b> among all stages of COPD except the mild group.

40|$|One goal of {{synthetic}} biology is {{to design and}} build genetic circuits in living cells {{for a range of}} applications with implications in health, materials, and sensing. Computational design methodologies allow for increased performance and reliability of these circuits. Major challenges that remain include increasing the scalability and robustness of engineered biological systems and streamlining and automating the synthetic biology workflow of “specify-design-build-test. ” I summarize the advances in microfluidic technology, particularly microfluidic large scale integration, {{that can be used to}} address the challenges facing each step of the synthetic biology workflow for genetic circuits. Microfluidic technologies allow precise control over the flow of biological content within microscale devices, and thus may provide more reliable and scalable construction {{of synthetic}} biological systems. However, adoption of microfluidics for synthetic biology has been slow due to the expert knowledge and equipment needed to fabricate and control devices. I present an end-to-end workflow for a computer-aided-design (CAD) tool, Fluigi, for designing microfluidic devices and for integrating biological Boolean genetic circuits with microfluidics. The workflow starts with a ``netlist" input describing the connectivity of microfluidic device to be designed, and proceeds through placement, routing, and design rule checking in a process analogous to electronic computer aided design (CAD). The output is an image of the device for printing as a mask for photolithography or for computer numerical control (CNC) machining. I also introduced a second workflow to allocate biological circuits to microfluidic devices and to generate the valve control scheme to enable biological computation on the device. I used the CAD workflow to generate 15 designs including gradient generators, rotary pumps, and devices for housing biological circuits. I fabricated two designs, a gradient generator with CNC machining and a device for computing a biological XOR function with multilayer soft lithography, and verified their functions with dye. My efforts here show a first end-to-end demonstration of an extensible and foundational microfluidic CAD tool from design concept to fabricated device.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. An active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) involves the suspension of a rotor by means of electromagnetic actuators. An AMB system comprises actuators, position sensors, a controller and power amplifiers. Conventional position sensors for rotor position sensing are expensive. The McTronX Research Group at the North-West University is currently conducting research on self-sensing, a method of extracting rotor position from the current and voltage actuation signals of the AMB. It was deemed necessary to develop a complete platform that will enable the implementation of self-sensing algorithms. The platform incorporates analogue circuitry, embedded devices and switching power amplifiers. The system will thus integrate all the electronics required for AMB suspension, and is thus dubbed: an Integrated Controller. The development of the integrated controller presented unique design challenges not yet faced by the McTronX group. To increase the chances of success and minimize some of the risks, the integrated controller was developed in collaboration with an industry partner. The collaboration required a systems engineering approach to the project. A detail type B specification was drawn up {{to aid in the}} project management process. The specification includes important detail such as the functional architectures, <b>functional</b> capabilities, <b>performance</b> <b>specifications</b> and physical constraints of the integrated controller. Some self-sensing algorithms can be implemented by means of analogue circuitry, and some can only be implemented in the digital domain. These digital algorithms are computationally intensive and require powerful processors. Digital signal processors (DSPs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) both exhibit unique architectures ideal for digital signal processing. Both these devices were implemented in the integrated controller, with the DSP as the main processor and the FPGA the co-processor. Although the integrated controller can operate as a stand-alone system, it has several communication interfaces (RS 485, USB and RS 232). This allows the system to work in conjunction with other integrated controllers, to be controlled by a master controller or to communicate to a personal computer (PC). Testing the integrated controller involved the closed loop current control of an AMB power amplifier, facilitating all critical functional aspects. The integrated controller's performance meets the required specifications and is expected to successfully facilitate future self-sensing investigations. Master...|$|R
