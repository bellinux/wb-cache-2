In two ODP sites (863 B and 1109 D), MLP's predictions are compared to conventional 'mixing' methods. Although this latter technique gives reliable results provided that rocks description is precise enough, the MLP is more straightforward, does not need any extra parameter and makes predictions in good agreement with the experimental trends.

TITLE: GEOPHYSICAL STUDIES OF THE HERALD-PHILLIPSTOWN FAULT AND OTHER SHALLOW STRUCTURES NEAR CARMI, ILLINOIS. MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr John L. Sexton 	Four seismic reflection profiles from the Wabash Valley area of southeastern Illinois successfully imaged the Herald-Phillipstown fault. From the reflection profiles and <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logs,</b> it was interpreted that the Herald-Phillipstown fault is an inverted flower structure. The main {{fault of the}} group is a steeply dipping normal fault with associated splay faults that are reverse in character. All the faults of this inverted flower structure are basement penetrating. Structural contour maps as well as maps of various reflector surfaces are prepared using two way travel {{time as well as}} depth. These maps show that the reflectors are undulating in character. Also distinct east-west rotational movements of the reflectors are observed along these faults and the main fault shows a curved geometry from south to north. The combination of the rotational movement, the curved nature of the fault plane and the undulating reflectors resulted in variation of offsets along these faults. The nature of faults of the inverted flower structure as observed on the seismic reflection profiles also indicates {{that there has been a}} change in the stress regime from extensional to compressional. Structural cross sections were generated using <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> from drill holes located along these seismic lines to analyze the nature of these faults at shallower depths. From these cross sections numerous shallow faults were observed and many of them can be correlated with those observed on seismic records indicating upward migration of basement penetrating faults into shallow younger sediments.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [65]- 66) Identification of hydraulically significant fractures {{is critical}} to groundwater investigations in fractured rock because of the important role fractures play in contaminant transport. In this study, cluster analysis is applied to <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> to identify hydraulically significant fractures. Cluster analysis is a multivariate technique for the simultaneous analysis of several <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> over a wide depth range. In this study, 16 " normal resistivity, natural gamma, and tube-wave amplitude logs from the Maynardville Limestone on the Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee, were examined. The logs show decreases in both 16 " normal resistivity and sonic tube-wave amplitude near fractures. The natural gamma log identifies clay-rich zones that exhibit geophysical response similar to fractures {{and can be used}} to discriminate these zones from fractures. Second derivatives of the resistivity log and tube-wave amplitude log were calculated prior to cluster analysis in order to enhance anomalous response attributed to fractures and suppress long wavelength responses caused by changes in lithology and water chemistry. Clusters associated with fractures are characterized by a high 16 " normal resistivity second derivative, a high second derivative of the tube-wave amplitude, and low natural gamma radiation. The cluster analysis results were calibrated by comparing cluster distribution to the distribution of fractures that had be 5 h previously identified by core analysis and drilling records in two wells. The calibration was verified by successfully identifying fractures in a third corehole using the characteristics of the fracture clusters from the other wells. The cluster analysis method used in this study is capable of distinguishing wide-aperture fractures or small cavities from other smaller fractures. This method provides a quick and simple way of locating fractures in the vicinity of a borehole, particularly where core or other data are not available, and this technique adds to a growing number of log interpretation techniques for hydrogeologic investigations.

Additionally, the near-surface geology includes an upper layer of pure limestones overlying marly limestones and marls (Upper Cretaceous). These materials lie on top of Low Cretaceous siliciclastic sediments (sandstones, clays, gravels). In any case, a layer with reduced velocity is expected. The geophysical data sets {{used in this study}} include sonic and gamma-ray logs at two boreholes and passive seismic measurements: three arrays and 224 seismic stations for applying the horizontal-to-vertical amplitude spectra ratio method (H/V). Well-logging data define two significant changes in the P -wave-velocity log within the Upper Cretaceous layer and one more at the Upper to Lower Cretaceous contact.

Compared to the Longmaxi shale, the Lower Cambrian Niutitang shale, which has a greater deposition thickness and wider distribution area, is another significant stratum for China's shale gas. <b>Geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logging</b> {{is one of the}} most significant methods used for identification and evaluation of shale gas reservoirs throughout the process of shale gas exploration and development. In this paper, the logging response of the Niutitang shale is summarized to “four high and four low”, this was determined through a comparative analysis of three shale gas wells in the Cen'gong block. The Geochemical logging (GEM) data shows that as the depth goes deeper the content of Si (quartz) increases and the content of Al, Fe, K (Potassium), and Clay minerals decreases. In addition, the Niutitang shale mainly has the feature of a single peak or two continuous peaks in T 2 spectrum on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging response. This has a longer T 2 time and greater amplitude than normal shales. The logging response of various lithology and preservation is summarized by overlapping and a cross-plot analysis with the spectral gamma-ray, resistivity, density, acoustic, and compensated neutron logging data, which are sensitive to organic-rich shales. Moreover, the resistivity and acoustic logging data are sensitive to gas content, fluid properties, and preservation conditions, which can be used as indicators of shale gas content and preservation...|$|R
40|$|Interpretation {{problems}} are {{commonly associated with}} calculating water saturation in nonhomogenous shaly sand reservoirs. Redefining petrophysical properties based on <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> in shaly sand reservoirs by using fundamental geologic attributes is an important tool in developing subsurface hydrocarbon resources. Studies of the electrical anisotropy of shaly sands {{have shown that the}} level of our understanding and our ability to correctly evaluate low resistivity and low contrast pay can be greatly improved. The model developed in this thesis is similar in form to the shaly sand Dual Water model by Clavier et al. (1984). It is an experiment based model designed to directly assess and quantify the mineralogical and electrical effects of clay minerals in heterogeneous reservoirs. Clay minerals usually have multiple effects on petrophysical properties obtained from <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>log</b> measurements. The total expansible clay model evaluates these effects via direct measurement of independent mineralogy and conductivity of clay minerals within reservoir sands. This model integrates the following as an effective basis for characterizing shaly sand reservoirs: &# 149; Rietveld based Siroquant assay for quantitative X-ray diffraction, used in determining mineral percentages from standard XRD trace patterns, &# 149; Cation exchange capacity, used to determine the quantity of cations involved in the exchange at the shale-water interface, &# 149; Porosity, permeability, density and resistivity measurements, &# 149; Thin section petrography, used in identifying mineral patterns, visible porosity and reservoir quality. Overall, application of correlations drawn from the model yields improved results for water saturation which appeared consistent with those earlier calculated using known water saturation models (Clavier et al Dual Water model, 1984, Juhasz, 1981).
