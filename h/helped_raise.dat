Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the Ptolemy rulers <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it allowed}} the militia men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the battle was {{inconclusive}} with respect to its original purpose of stopping the Native American raids in the area. The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> public opinion towards the militia. After the disastrous defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E

5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately {{had little}} to do with the end of the violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E
5|$|Cal Poly Pomona {{financial}} endowment was valued at $85.6 million as of June 30, 2016. In fall 2010, Cal Poly embarked {{on its first}} comprehensive fundraising campaign. Early major donors <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> {{more than half of}} the campaign's goal of $150 million before its formal launch. They included an anonymous benefactor who pledged $12 million, and $2 million from 1980 alumni Mickey and Lee Segal. Just before the campaign launch, on July 26, 2010, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation awarded a $42 million challenge grant to the university to increase educational access to underrepresented communities, making it the largest cash gift in the history of the CSU system. On February 28, 2011, Panda Express founders Andrew and Peggy Cherng announced a $2.5 million pledge to Cal Poly's Collins College of Hospitality Management. The university expects that its permanent endowment at the conclusion of its first comprehensive campaign will top $100 million.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros {{grew up in}} a well-off {{ranching}} {{family from}} Los Indios, Texas, and was married to David Cisneros, a surgeon from Brownsville. They had five children. She was a well-respected volunteer in the local medical community, and was president of the southern chapter of the Cameron-Willacy Counties Medical Society. The association where she volunteered <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> funds for medical scholarships. In addition, people close to Cisneros said she was a practicing Catholic and that she cared a lot for her family. She volunteered at St. Joe, and was well-liked in the social group she was part of. Since Los Indios was mostly a ranching community close to the U.S.-Mexico border, Cisneros's religiosity was heavily influenced by curanderismo, a practice of religious and folk medicine healing rooted in ancient Mexican culture.|$|E

5|$|Early {{sources on}} Richard Neville {{fall into two}} categories. The first are the {{sympathetic}} chronicles of the early Yorkist years, or works based on these, such as the Mirror for Magistrates (1559). The other category originates with chronicles commissioned by Edward IV after Warwick's fall, such as the Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV, and take a more negative view of the earl. The Mirror portrayed Warwick as a great man: beloved by the people, and betrayed by the man he <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> to the throne. The other perspective {{can be found in}} Shakespeare's Henry VI trilogy: a man driven by pride and egotism, who created and deposed kings at will.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, after {{selling his}} share of the law practice, Malone {{returned}} to Stratford. He started his own law firm in partnership with another practitioner. With a reduced work load, he began focus on his other interests, which included the military. Malone participated in New Zealand's militia, the Volunteer Force. In 1900, he <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> the Stratford Rifle Volunteers, one of many units formed in the enthusiasm for the military during the Second Boer War, with himself as its captain. When he moved to New Plymouth in 1903, he relinquished his command. As a result of a request by his Volunteer Force battalion commander, Malone was made adjutant of the 4th Battalion of the Wellington (Taranaki) Rifle Volunteers. In 1905 he was second-in-command and by 1910, and now a lieutenant-colonel, he was the commander of the battalion.|$|E
5|$|In article {{published}} by the Guardian newspaper, the community importance of pirate radio was highlighted. Sanjae a young girl {{at the age of}} 3 was told she had just weeks to live due to a rare lung tissue disease. It would require at least £50.000 to send Sanjae to the US to have a life or death operation. A weekly popular talk show entitled the 'Nubian Forum talk show' which took place on the now deceased radio station, Power Jam FM raised awareness and began raising money. Within days two other pirate radio stations, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM joined forces to help; both of which <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> thousands of pounds each. With the exception of the Hackney Gazette, no other mainstream media was interested. It is therefore argued that {{had it not been for}} Power Jam FM, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, Sanjae would have died.|$|E

5|$|Late in 1315 or in 1316, Harclay {{was taken}} captive by the Scots, who demanded 2000 marks in ransom. His {{meteoric}} rise {{over the previous}} years had made him some enemies in local society, who now {{took the opportunity to}} spread slanderous rumours about him at court. The king nevertheless <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> the necessary money to secure Harclay's freedom, but {{for the next few years}} he seems to have been out of royal favour. It was not until 1319 that he once more was appointed sheriff, and at the same time made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles, and Warden of the West Marches. In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament.|$|E
5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12. Y-12 {{initially}} enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos laboratory in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. The rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts <b>helped</b> <b>raise</b> production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By April 1945 K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.|$|E
