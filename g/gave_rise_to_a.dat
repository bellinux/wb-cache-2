Its commander preferred to surrender to Géza instead of the king and the Byzantine envoys who arrived in the Hungarian camp {{after the fall of}} Belgrade only negotiated with Géza. The division of the booty also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new conflict between Solomon and Géza. Although Géza accompanied the king on a new campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1072, but his brother, Ladislaus stayed behind with half of the troops of their duchy.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} from Byzantine sources that the Rus' caught Constantinople unprepared, while the empire was preoccupied by the ongoing Arab–Byzantine wars {{and unable to}} deal with the Rus' threat. After pillaging the suburbs of the Byzantine capital, the Rus' retreated, {{although}} the nature of this withdrawal, and indeed which side was victorious, is subject to debate. The event <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> later Orthodox Christian tradition, which ascribed the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous intervention by the Theotokos.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Alexander the Good in 1432 <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{succession}} crisis that {{lasted more than}} two decades. Stephen's father seized the throne in 1449 after defeating one of his relatives {{with the support of}} John Hunyadi, Regent-Governor of Hungary. Stephen was styled voivode in his father's charters, showing that he had been made his father's heir and co-ruler. Bogdan acknowledged the suzerainty of Hunyadi in 1450. Stephen fled to Hungary after Peter III Aaron (who was also Alexander the Good's son) murdered Bogdan in October 1451.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and {{the signing}} of the CFE Treaty <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{requirement}} for Germany {{to reduce the size of}} its armed forces, including the number of combat aircraft. To meet this need, one of the Marinefliegers Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing. The second wing was enlarged and continued in the anti-shipping, reconnaissance and anti-radar roles until it was disbanded in 2005 with its aircraft and duties passed on to the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} {{has long been}} {{depicted}} in Chinese and Japanese art, often on a plant spray or in a flying flock, and representations by oriental artists including Hiroshige have featured on the postage stamps of Antigua and Barbuda, Central African Republic, China and the Gambia.

5|$|Bohemond {{forced the}} Armenian rulers of Cilicia {{to accept his}} {{suzerainty}} in the late 1180s. He also secured the County of Tripoli for his second son, Bohemond, in 1187. However, Saladin occupied almost the whole Principality of Antioch {{in the summer of}} 1188. To preserve the peace with Saladin, Bohemond did not provide military assistance to the crusaders during the Third Crusade. Leo of Cilicia's expansionist policy in the 1190s <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lasting conflict between Antioch and Cilicia. Bohemond was captured in 1194 by Leo, who tried to seize Antioch, but the burghers formed a commune and expelled the Armenian soldiers from the town. Bohemond was released only after he acknowledged Leo's independence.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{independence}} from the United Kingdom grew gradually {{over the course of}} many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. World War I and World War II, in particular, <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established {{with the passage of the}} Statute of Westminster 1931, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982. Canada's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's modern {{commercial}} centre lies {{close to}} the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused urbanisation along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread outwards {{into the rest of}} the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> densely populated, industrial landscape of factories and rows of terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The soils of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay and gravel.|$|E

5|$|However, his {{attitude}} {{could not be}} maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness {{of the government to}} use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, {{as a result of the}} Banca Romana scandal.|$|E
5|$|However, wall {{construction}} continued {{regardless of}} court politics during this time. The Ordos walls underwent extension, elaboration, and repair {{well into the}} 16th century. Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the wall building material, because they offered better protection and durability. This change in material <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of necessary accommodations with regard to logistics, and inevitably a drastic increase in costs. Instead {{of being able to}} draw on local resources, building projects now required brick-kilns, quarries, and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the work site. Also, masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for the level of sophistication that brick constructions required. Work that originally could be done by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men to do in stone.|$|E
5|$|In August 1591, Maximilian of Habsburg, {{who still}} claimed Poland and Lithuania, sent his envoy to Andrew seeking Transylvanian support against Sigismund III. Andrew {{emphasized}} that being under Ottoman suzerainty, Transylvania could not openly support Maximilian, {{but he also}} promised that Sigismund Báthory would not prevent the mustering of Transylvanian soldiers to fight in Poland. In the same month, Sigismund Báthory's plan to enable the Jesuits to return to Transylvania <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> serious family conflict, because both Andrew and Balthasar refused to support the prince at the Diet. According to contemporaneous gossips, Andrew and his two brothers decided to dethrone Sigismund, replacing him with Balthasar. Pope Clement VIII sent a papal nuncio, Attilio Amalteo, to Transylvania to mediate a reconciliation.|$|E

Mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide. The Mesoamerican area <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> series of cultural developments that included complex societies, agriculture, cities, monumental architecture, writing, and calendrical systems. The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge, blood and human sacrifice, and a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.|$|E
5|$|Tsar Ivan IV of Russia {{undertook}} in 1577 hostilities in the Livonian region, {{which resulted}} in his takeover {{of most of the}} area and caused the Polish–Lithuanian involvement in the Livonian War. The successful counter-offensive led by King Báthory and Jan Zamoyski resulted in the peace of 1582 and the retaking of much of the territory contested with Russia, with the Swedish forces establishing themselves in the far north (Estonia). Estonia was declared a part of the Commonwealth by Sigismund III in 1600, which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> war with Sweden over Livonia; the war lasted until 1611 without producing a definite outcome.|$|E
5|$|West Germans {{were able}} {{to cross the border}} {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E
