5|$|Capybaras are gregarious. While they {{sometimes}} live solitarily, {{they are more}} commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist {{of as many as}} 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general <b>group</b> <b>consensus.</b> They can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.|$|E
5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the <b>group</b> <b>consensus</b> is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
5|$|The {{baguette}} sandwiches {{were introduced}} to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the baguette sandwiches were well received {{and continue to be}} sold, several red flags have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the healthiness of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British Food Standards Agency (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt baguette and chided BK for backing out of an agreement to help make the company's products healthier. In 2007 the private public interest <b>group</b> <b>Consensus</b> Action on Salt and Health, abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT Baguette sandwich, when paired with fries and a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK.|$|E
50|$|When an {{individual}} finds {{themselves in a}} position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the <b>group's</b> <b>consensus,</b> they are experiencing compliance or acquiescence. In turn, conversion, otherwise known as private acceptance, involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.|$|R

[...] This person would {{act in the}} best interest of his family and make decisions based on the <b>group</b> <b>consensus</b> of the family he represented. The siy̓ám̓ has been described as [...] "...the best talker – not chairman, (our people) have no chairman – but man who says the most wise things". The siy̓ám̓ was usually chosen by factors which included his status and respect within the community, the village and other indigenous nations, and how much he exemplified the characteristics of a noble person, such as humility, respect, generosity, and wisdom.|$|E
