40|$|Machine grading systems operate {{according}} to similar principles; one or more strength related properties of the timber to be graded are measured non-destructively by the machine and based on these measurements a population of un-graded timber is subdivided into sub-populations of graded timber material. The grading acceptance criteria are formulated in form of boundary values for the indicating property {{that have to be}} matched to qualify a piece of timber to a certain grade. These boundaries are termed grading machine settings. The performance, i. e. the statistical characteristics of the output of grading machines strongly depends on these settings, and in general very much attention is kept on how to control them. Currently applied procedures to control the grading machine settings are either machine controlled or output controlled, however, both procedures do not facilitate the efficient use of information which is gained prior and during the operation phase of the <b>grading</b> <b>facility.</b> This presentation will highlight the existing methods for the control of grading machine settings {{according to}} the European standard EN 14081. Moreover an alternative approach for the control of grading machine settings will be presented. This approach is based on Bayesian regression analysis and allows a probabilistic modeling of timber material properties. It {{can be seen as a}} combination of the machine control and output control approach. The alternative approach facilitates the consistent consideration of new information gained during the whole grading process and will be summarized in a coherent and implementable format. Possible benefits of its application in practice are discussed. ...|$|E
