25|$|During this period, the {{differences}} in ceramics from different regions become increasingly more noticeable, suggesting further degradation of trade at this time. Other than a brief 'renaissance' period that took place mid-twelfth century that brought some developments, the pottery begins to deteriorate. This decline continues {{until the end of}} LH IIIC, where there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go but up in terms of technical and artistic pottery.|$|E
500|$|The Obama {{family has}} {{attended}} several different Protestant churches since moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees {{to advocate for}} political awareness, saying, [...] "To anyone who says that church <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> talk about these issues, you tell them {{there is no place}} better– no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues– they are moral issues, they're issues {{that have to do with}} human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of Luce's famously acid wit ("No {{good deed}} goes unpunished", [...] "Widowhood is a fringe benefit of marriage", [...] "A {{hospital}} <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> be sick") {{can be traced}} back to the days when, as a wealthy young divorcee in the early 1930s, she became a caption writer at Vogue and then, associate editor and managing editor of Vanity Fair. She not only edited the works of such great humorists as P. G. Wodehouse and Corey Ford but contributed many comic pieces of her own, signed and unsigned. Her humor, which she retained into old age, was one of the pillars of Clare's character.|$|E

60|$|If {{he asked}} her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a more {{impossible}} task to bashful Beth, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> run <b>to,</b> <b>no</b> Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try.|$|R
2500|$|Another reason Tillich criticized {{theological}} theism {{was because}} it placed God into the subject-object dichotomy. This is the basic distinction made in Epistemology, that branch of Philosophy which deals with human knowledge, how it is possible, what it is, and its limits. Epistemologically, God cannot be made into an object, that is, an object of the knowing subject. Tillich deals with this question {{under the rubric of}} the relationality of God. The question is [...] "whether there are external relations between God and the creature". Traditionally Christian theology has always understood the doctrine of creation to mean precisely this external relationality between God, the Creator, and the creature as separate and not identical realities. Tillich reminds us of the point, which can be found in Luther, that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> which man can withdraw from the divine thou, because it includes the ego and is nearer to the ego than the ego to itself".|$|E

50|$|Reason for Loss: They did not hit the mark, {{and once}} the top cover was flipped over, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go and <b>no</b> {{slide-in}} features, and the product was too big.|$|R
50|$|North of Chengyang {{lies the}} tiny village of Linxia which is {{interesting}} {{because of the}} local market. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> stay in Linxia, but a taxi from Sanjiang or Chengyang brings you there easily.|$|R
60|$|Grahame reluctantly agreed. He knew {{something}} about malaria and Walthew did not look fit for work; but every man was needed, and this foul swamp <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ill. The sooner they got out the better.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Charlotte, {{shaking her}} head gravely. [...] "I should like to run away {{but it would be}} of no use, because there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> run to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> unmask, friend, {{even though}} we only wear our disguises in pleasantry. Tarry here, and at my return I will conduct thee to a more fitting spot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> sleep.' The old man {{was used}} {{to the order of}} his monastery, and though he slept on the ground, as the Rule decrees, {{preferred}} a decency in these things.|$|E
60|$|Had she hidden away? There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> hide in. But Grimes looked about, and Tom also, {{for he was}} as puzzled as Grimes {{himself at}} her disappearing so suddenly; but look where they would, she was not there.|$|R
50|$|After a {{turbulent}} period, with the attachment {{of their old}} stadium due to an accident involving a fan and successive poor results in the field, the Gaucho <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> send their games and {{was in danger of}} closing its activities.|$|R
5000|$|Vice Admiral Roberto Cesaretti went on {{to state}} [...] "Although this event relates to criminals, {{there is also a}} message for the terrorists here - we are looking for you, and when we find you - there will <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> hide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! I don't think I'll {{want to run}} away," [...] grumbled the prisoner. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> run to in this forsaken {{section of}} the country. What you folks can find here to make it {{pleasant}} is a mystery to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, baas, {{before the}} time?" [...] asked the Hottentot, {{shrinking}} back a little. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> visit till one is obliged.

50|$|In October 2016, the 261 {{operated}} three round trips from Minneapolis on the Twin Cities and Western Railroad, {{running on}} former Milwaukee Road tracks.

50|$|As rifle regiments {{travelled}} in dispersed {{formation and}} specifically did not carry Colours there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> carry their battle honours. Initially {{they did not}} carry drums either but now these are carried and battle honours are placed on them instead. Battle honours may also appear on the cap badges.|$|R
60|$|But it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> work in, {{because one}} is {{outside of it}} all the time, while {{the sun and the}} moon are on duty. Outside of it in the loggia, where the breezes blow and the tall arches divide up the scenery and frame it.|$|E

60|$|So {{they went}} on till {{they came to the}} grove. The grove proved to be a very pretty one, though it {{consisted}} of only four or five trees; but unfortunately there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> sit down in it. Rollo looked about for some time in vain, and seemed quite disappointed.|$|R
50|$|Virtus applies {{exclusively}} to a man's behaviour {{in the public}} sphere, i.e. to the application of duty to the res publica in the cursus honorum.

60|$|They {{returned}} to camp, disheartened and depressed. This new loss had something terrible in it. What it meant {{no one could}} conjecture. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> reason why Maka should run away, for there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> run to, and it was impossible that any wild beast should have removed the oars and carried off the negro.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well-a-day, sir, {{the house}} of the Duke of York <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> stint in.

6000|$|Herbert, however, {{answered}} nothing. He merely turned angrily to Ronald. 'I won't bandy words,' he said constrainedly in his coldest tone, 'with this infamous {{woman whom}} you have brought here on purpose to insult me; but I must request {{you to ask}} her to leave the house immediately. Your mother's home <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> which to bring people of such a character.' ...|$|E

60|$|Wakura, indeed, was the {{one thing}} in Noto, except the charcoal, which had an ultra-Noto-rious reputation. Rumors of it had reached us as far away as Shinshiu, and with every fresh inquiry we made as we {{advanced}} the rumors had gathered strength. Our informants spoke of it with the vague respect accorded hearsay honor. Clearly, it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> pass by.|$|R

50|$|Hideie {{eventually}} outlived {{his wife}} {{and all of the}} Sengoku Jidai era samurai except Nobuyuki Sanada. He was offered a conditional pardon after Ieyasu's death, but declined and never returned to the mainland. His wife had died, the Toyotomi were defeated, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> return to, his sons had fathered children on Hachijojima, and the Shogunate was to be inherited by members of the Tokugawa clan.|$|R
