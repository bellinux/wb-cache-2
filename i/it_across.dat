5|$|The {{increase}} in private automobile ownership and {{growing popularity of}} Delaware's beach resort towns {{during the first half}} of the 20th century led Delaware to construct the Ocean Highway (present-day DE 1 and now known as Coastal Highway) between Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach. Completed in 1933, the Ocean Highway lacked a link to carry <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the Indian River Inlet.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{security}} zone, the Schutzstreifen, a further 743people (15%) were {{arrested by the}} guards. 48people (1%) were stopped– i.e. killed or injured– by landmines and 43people (0.9%) by SM-70 directional mines on the fence. A further 67people (1.35%) were intercepted at the fence (shot and/or arrested). A total of 229people– just 4.6% of attempted escapees, representing less than one in twenty– made <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the fence. Of these, the largest number (129, or 55% of successful escapees) succeeded in making <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the fence in unmined sectors. 89people (39% of escapees) managed to cross both the minefields and the fence, but just 12people (6% of the total) succeeded in getting past the SM-70s booby-trap mines on the fences.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the French {{government}} made an official investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced the theory that the two aviators made <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the ocean, but crashed and perished in the woods of Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around the north slope of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, more allied guns were in line and the fire intensified. In desperation, Cornwallis {{attempted}} to evacuate his troops across the York River to Gloucester Point. At Gloucester Point the troops {{might be able to}} break through the allied lines and escape into Virginia and then march to New York. One wave of boats made <b>it</b> <b>across</b> but a squall hit when they returned to take more soldiers across, making the evacuation impossible.|$|E

5|$|The Dakotas, who {{had volunteered}} 150 warriors {{to fight against}} the Sauks and Meskwakis, also arrived too late to {{participate}} in the Battle of Bad Axe, but they pursued the members of the British Band who made <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the Mississippi into Iowa. On about August 9, in the final engagement of the war, they attacked the remnants of the British Band along the Cedar River, killing 68 and taking 22 prisoners. Ho-Chunks also hunted survivors of the British Band, taking between fifty and sixty scalps.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} pranking war was instigated in April 2005, when Caltech {{students}} pulled multiple pranks during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend for prospective freshmen. MIT students responded {{a year later}} by stealing Caltech's antique Fleming Cannon and transporting <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the country to MIT's campus. Subsequent pranks have included fake satirical school newspapers distributed by Caltech students at MIT {{and the appearance of}} a TARDIS device on top of Caltech's Baxter Hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E

5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5|$|As the cyclone {{reached the}} western {{periphery}} of the ridge that steered <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the Atlantic for much of its existence, it began yet another period of intensification, and once again attained a peak intensity as a Category2 hurricane. Passing northwest of Bermuda, Danielle weakened to Category1 hurricane strength, but for a final time intensified into a 105mph (165km/h) tropical cyclone thereafter. As the cyclone passed over increasingly cool sea surface temperatures and became intertwined in a baroclinic zone, it began to undergo an extratropical transition. At 0000UTC on September4, Danielle was no longer considered a tropical cyclone, despite retaining hurricane-force winds. Several days later, the remnants of Danielle merged with a larger extratropical low and became indistinguishable. As a tropical cyclone, it produced heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, leading to flooding. Tropical storm-force winds were observed in Bermuda even though the cyclone passed well northwest of the island. During Danielle's transition to an extratropical cyclone, it produced light rain and led to minor beach erosion in Newfoundland. The larger extratropical low that merged with the system resulted in large waves {{off the coast of}} the United Kingdom, leading to major beach erosion and coastal flooding. Overall, no fatalities were reported with the system and it caused an estimated $50,000 (1998 USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|Hardee {{regularly}} {{appeared in}} his own shows at the Edinburgh Fringe. The Greatest Show on Legs debuted there in 1982. Arguably his most infamous confirmed stunt there was in 1983 when, performing at The Circuit venue – {{a series of three}} adjoining tents in a construction site with a different show in each tent – he became annoyed by what he regarded as excessive noise emanating nightly from Eric Bogosian's neighbouring performance tent. Hardee obtained a nearby tractor and, entirely naked, drove <b>it</b> <b>across</b> Bogosian's stage during his performance. Rivalling this stunt in Fringe infamy, in 1989, Hardee and Arthur Smith wrote a rave 5-star review of Hardee's own Fringe show and successfully managed to get it printed in The Scotsman under the byline of the influential newspaper's comedy critic. At the Fringe in 1996, The Independent reported that he attempted to sabotage American ventriloquist David Strassman's Edinburgh show by abducting the act's hi-tech dummy, holding it to ransom and sending it back to Strassman piece by piece in return for hard cash. The plan failed.|$|E
5|$|Having blocked Jourdan, Archduke Charles {{began moving}} troops south {{to oppose the}} Army of Rhin-et-Moselle as early as 21 June. He {{received}} the news that Moreau was across the Rhine on the 26th. Leaving 25,351 foot and 10,933 horse under Wartensleben and 27,000 more around Mainz, the archduke raced south. The last units of the Moreau's army made <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the Rhine on 29 June, though Delaborde remained guarding {{the west bank of}} the Rhine for a time. For a few days the French enjoyed a numerical superiority of 30,000 to 18,000 over their opponents. Moreau then made the remarkable decision to switch the positions of two of his wings; Desaix now led the Left Wing while Saint-Cyr commanded the Center. He also reorganized his army, reassigning some regiments that got lost in the confusion of the river crossing. Army of Rhin-et-Moselle expanded its bridgehead in a semicircle. Desaix moved downstream (north), Ferino moved upstream (south) and Saint-Cyr operated in the hills, ready to support either wing. The French irruption caused Fröhlich and Condé to retreat up the Rhine and Kinzig Rivers while Sztáray and the Swabians fell back to Freudenstadt.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down at its 25-yard line. After a rushing play was stopped for a loss and Paci was forced {{to throw the ball}} away to avoid a sack, Indiana punted {{for the first time in}} {{the second quarter}}. Tech resumed offense at its 41-yard line. DeShazo completed a pass to the Indiana 47-yard line, then a 25-yard toss to Cornelius Wright, who carried it to the Indiana 22. Swarm carried the ball for a first down inside the Indiana 10-yard line, and two plays later, he carried <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the goal line for Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech took a 147 lead with 11:14 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures {{carved into the}} English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is often thought of as an ancient creation. However, as {{with many of the}} other figures, its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods {{difficult}} to demonstrate. Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle. Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer to the giant, suggesting that it might not have been there at the time. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse {{has been shown to be}} 3,000 years old, and there are references to <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the ages.|$|E
5|$|On 29 July 1781 Sérurier {{was awarded}} the Order of Saint-Louis. On 10 May 1782 he assumed the rank of captain commandant and on 1 June 1783 he took command of the regiment's Chasseur company. Irked {{by the lack of}} promotion, he asked to retire on pension on 8 September 1788. His {{commanding}} officer argued to retain such a good officer and Sérurier transferred into the Médoc Regiment as a major on 17 May 1789. He became lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1791. Since the French Revolution the garrison at Perpignan became agitated so the regiment was sent there to calm down the other troops. Instead, the Médoc Regiment itself became affected by the troubles. On 23 July 1791, fearing that Sérurier was about to leave the country with the regiment's colors, a body of soldiers removed them from his quarters. In January 1792, 19 officers from the regiment emigrated to Spain. A story existed that Sérurier and a companion tried to flee to Spain but were nearly caught by a patrol and only his companion made <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the border. In June 1792 the Médoc, renamed the 70th Infantry Regiment, marched to the Camp of Tournoux in the Alps. Sérurier became the commanding officer of the 70th with the rank of colonel on 7 August 1792.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate <b>it</b> <b>across</b> the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
