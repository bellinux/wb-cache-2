The headwaters of the Current River begin at the confluence of Pigeon Creek and Montauk Springs in Montauk State Park. Other notable springs along its course include Welch Spring, Cave Spring, Pulltite Spring, Round Spring, Fire Hydrant <b>Spring,</b> <b>Ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Spring,</b> Blue Spring, Big Spring, and Gravel Spring. The park contains the United States' largest concentration of first magnitude springs, (which are defined as having average flow of more than [...] in dolomite rock. The only comparable spring collections are the limestone springs of North Florida near Gainesville and the igneous-based springs of Idaho's Snake River.|$|R

The purpose {{of this research was}} to design an <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> hydroponics system with many quantity of plants but low in manufacturing cost and to test its performance. This research was conducted at the Laboratory of Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural Engineering Department, University of Lampung. The research procedures included several stages : design, assembly, testing, observation and data analysis. The <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> hydroponics system was designed with the spesification of 200 cm length, 150 cm width, and 285 cm height and equipped with multi-span roof and screen wall. The planting tray has 13 furrows with 200 cm length, 15 cm width and 15 cm depth and 9 holes of planting aech row, so there are 117 plants on the tray. The manufacturing cost of <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> hydroponics system was lower than hydroponics kits available in market. The obsevations showed that temperature inside greenhouse was lower than outside with a difference of 1, 58 °C. Humidity inside greenhouse was higher than outside with a difference of 4, 3 %.
