5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or <b>forward</b> <b>price)</b> is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of <b>forward</b> <b>price.</b> It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
25|$|In words, the {{standardized}} moneyness {{is the number}} of standard deviations the current <b>forward</b> <b>price</b> is above the strike price. Thus the moneyness is zero when the <b>forward</b> <b>price</b> of the underlying equals the strike price, when the option is at-the-money-forward. Standardized moneyness is measured in standard deviations from this point, with a positive value meaning an in-the-money call option and a negative value meaning an out-of-the-money call option (with signs reversed for a put option).|$|E
40|$|Logistic {{regression}} {{is employed}} to analyse the factors which {{influence the decision}} {{of whether or not}} the respondent used <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> methods during the 2004 / 05 maize production season. <b>Forward</b> <b>pricing</b> methods include cash forward contracting and hedging with futures contracts and/or options, through the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX). Based on the results, the use of <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> is associated with lower levels of risk aversion and higher levels of human capital. Factor analysis is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the personal reasons which help to interpret the underlying, common factor of the personal reasons why farmers are reluctant to use <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> methods. Three factors were extracted and were labelled “Lack of capacity”, “Distrust of the market”, and “Bad experiences”. The results from the factor analysis confirm the finding that farmers need higher levels of human capital to use <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> methods and that farmers do not believe that the <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> market is effective.

40|$|Price risk {{associated}} with maize production became a reason for concern in South Africa only after the deregulation of the agricultural commodities markets in the mid- 1990 s, when farmers became responsible for marketing their own crops. Although farmers can use, inter alia, the cash forward contracting and/or the derivatives market to manage price risk, few farmers actually participate in <b>forward</b> <b>pricing.</b> A similar reluctance to use <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> methods is also found internationally. A number of different model specifications {{have been used in}} previous research to model <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviour which {{is based on the assumption}} that the same variables influence both the adoption and the quantity decision. This study compares the results from a model specification which models <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviour in a single-decision framework with the results from modelling the quantity decision conditional to the adoption decision in a two-step approach. The results suggest that substantially more information is obtained by modelling <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviour as two separate decisions rather than a single decision. Such information may be valuable in educational material compiled to educate farmers in the effective use of <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> methods in price risk management. Modelling <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviour as two separate decisions  is thus a more effective means of modelling <b>forward</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviour than modelling it as a single decision...|$|R
25|$|A forward {{contract}} is {{an agreement between}} two parties to exchange at some fixed future date a given quantity of a commodity for a price defined when the contract is finalized. The fixed price {{is known as the}} <b>forward</b> <b>price.</b> Such {{forward contract}}s began as a way of reducing pricing risk in food and agricultural product markets, because farmers knew what price they would receive for their output.|$|E
25|$|In {{different}} deregulation processes {{the institutions}} and market designs were often very different {{but many of the}} underlying concepts were the same. These are: separate the potentially competitive functions of generation and retail from the natural monopoly functions of transmission and distribution; and establish a wholesale electricity market and a retail electricity market. The role of the wholesale market is to allow trading between generators, retailers and other financial intermediaries both for short-term delivery of electricity (see spot price) and for future delivery periods (see <b>forward</b> <b>price).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Arbitrage {{arguments}} ("Rational pricing") apply {{when the}} deliverable asset exists in plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created. Here, the <b>forward</b> <b>price</b> represents the expected future value of the underlying discounted at the risk free rate—as any deviation from the theoretical price will afford investors a riskless profit opportunity and should be arbitraged away. We define the <b>forward</b> <b>price</b> to be the strike K such that the contract has 0 value at the present time. Assuming interest rates are constant the <b>forward</b> <b>price</b> of the futures {{is equal to the}} <b>forward</b> <b>price</b> of the forward contract with the same strike and maturity. It is also the same if the underlying asset is uncorrelated with interest rates.

2500|$|In finance, a futures {{contract}} (more colloquially, futures) is a standardized forward contract, a legal agreement {{to buy or}} sell [...] something at a predetermined price at a specified time [...] in the future. The asset transacted is usually a commodity or financial instrument and the transaction is usually done on the trading floor of a futures exchange. [...] The predetermined price the parties agree to buy and sell the asset for [...] is known as the <b>forward</b> <b>price.</b> The specified time in the future -- which is when delivery and payment occur -- is known as the delivery date.

This quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the relative volatility surface: the implied volatility in terms of moneyness, rather than absolute price. The most basic of these measures is simple moneyness, which is the ratio of spot (or forward) to strike, or the reciprocal, depending on convention. A particularly important measure of moneyness is the likelihood that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure. It can be measured in percentage probability of expiring in the money, which is the forward value of a binary call option with the given strike, ...|$|E
