40|$|AbstractCorporate {{governance}} {{practices have}} been a concerned issue by many Asian countries after the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 including Malaysia. Due to the crisis, Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) has been introduced {{as part of the}} Bursa Malaysia (BMB) listing rules. This study hence focuses on corporate governance practices among Top 100 public listed companies in Bursa Malaysia and the relationship between corporate governance practices with firm performance. Two corporate governance's indicators (Board size and Board Independence) were chosen in testing the hypothesized relationship between corporate governance practices with firm performance, which was measured by return on asset (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Descriptive and correlation analysis were used to examine the hypotheses in this study. The result showed that board size has significantly weak negative relationship with ROA but it was found to be insignificant to ROE. The other finding indicated that there was no relationship between board independence and firm performance.

40|$|This paper aims at {{examining}} {{corporate governance}} practices of China s private enterprises, which have fundamental implications {{for building a}} strong private sector in China. Specifically, this paper locates this investigation {{in the context of}} economic globalization in which China has been increasingly participating and the country s transition to a market economy. The primary finding of this paper is that although Chinese private enterprises have outperformed their state-owned counterparts {{over the past two decades}} and gradually become more competitive to meet the challenge of globalization, their corporate governance structures have displayed some worrying signs of inefficiency. Main examples of such corporate governance deficiencies include the lock-up pattern of family business and the phenomenon of founder s dictatorship. This paper also points out that although the removal of red hats from many Chinese private enterprises is a significant improvement on their corporate governance structures, the problem of lax internal controls has increasingly become a serious impediment to the future growth of these private firms. In addition, the prevailing bureaucracy-business complex, in which many Chinese private enterprises have stranded themselves, is frequently manifested in the practice of private entrepreneurs paying for a government identity card. This practice has a pervasive negative impact on the building of market basics and a healthy commercial environment in China s localities, and should be curbed effectively before it evolves into a new variety of cronyism, Chinese style. The paper concludes by proposing future reform strategies for <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> regime for Chinese private enterprises, which would emphasize the importance of complementary or supporting reforms in other related areas, including government and administrative reforms...|$|E

The financial crisis of 2007 - 2008, the most severe financial crisis after the Great Depression, prompted politicians and regulators both in the U. S. and Europe to redesign the financial system. The unregulated hedge fund industry heavily criticized for contributing or even causing the financial crisis {{was one of the first}} to come under the regulator?s ambit. The result was the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act in the U. S. and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive in the European Union. These two pieces of legislation are the first ever attempt to directly regulate the hedge fund industry. Taking into account the exponential growth of the hedge fund industry, its beneficial effects and its importance for certain countries such as U.

A comparative and critical examination of these major pieces of regulation and their potential impact on the hedge fund industry in Europe and the U.

In other words, I am trying {{to find out if the}} institutional investors are able to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> in Malaysia in 1 year time. With the help of Kruskal-Wallis test (one-way ANOVA), I find that there are very big differences of the percentage shareholdings of the institutional investors among different ownership structure companies (Government-Linked Company, Family-Controlled Company, Multinational Company and Others), the specialty of this study from others is that I divide the 100 companies into 4 groups, and testify the effect of institutional investors (domestic plus foreign) on <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> separately via Spearman’s order correlation test. Moreover, the extent of the impact of institutional investors on <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> is also attempted to be evaluated. Besides, the impact of institutional investors on <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> also depends on the nature of them. Therefore, I classified the domestic and foreign institutional 7 investors into 2 groups: one is pressure insensitive investors (domestic and foreign long-term and stated-owned institutional investors) and another is pressure sensitive investors (domestic and foreign short-term and private institutional investors). Finally, the foreign institutional investors are extracted from the total shareholdings, and its impact on improvement of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> will also be investigated in more detail. In addition, beyond the univariate and bivariate analysis to test of differences and association between variables, the multiple regression as the extension of the correlation will be used to represent the best prediction of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> score from 2 independent variables (ownership structure and shareholdings of institutional investors).

40|$|China’s {{financial}} system {{has experienced a}} series of major reforms in recent years. Efforts have been made towards introducing the shareholding system in state-owned commercial banks, restructuring of securities firms, re-organising equity of joint venture insurance companies, further <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> structure, managing financial risks and ultimately establishing a system to protect investors (Xinhua, 2010). Financial product innovation, with the further opening up of financial markets {{and the development of}} the insurance and bond market, has increased liquidity as well as reduced financial risks. The U. S. subprime crisis indicated the benefit of financial innovations for the economy, but without proper control, they may lead to unexpected consequences. Kirkpatrick (2009) argues that failures and weaknesses in corporate governance arrangements and insufficient accounting standards and regulatory requirements attributed to the financial crisis. Similar to the financial crises of the last decade, the global financial crisis which sparked in 2008, surfaced a variety of significant corporate governance failures: the dysfunction of market mechanisms, the lack of transparency and accountability, misaligned compensation arrangements and the late response of government, all which encouraged management short-termism, poor risk management, as well as some fraudulent schemes. The unique characteristics of the Chinese banking system are an interesting point for studying post-crisis corporate governance reform. Considering that China modelled its governance system on the Anglo-American system, this paper examines the impact of the financial crisis on corporate governance reform in developed economies, and particularly, China’s reform of its financial sector. The paper further analyses the Chinese government’s role in bank supervision and risk management. In this regard, the paper contributes to the corporate governance literature within the Chinese context by providing insights into the contributing factors to the corporate governance failure that led to the global financial crisis. It also provides policy recommendations for China’s policy makers to seriously consider. The results suggest a need for the re-examination of corporate governance adequacy and the institutionalisation of business ethics. The paper’s next section provides a review of China’s {{financial system}} with reference to the financial crisis, followed by a critical evaluation of a capitalistic system and a review of Anglo-American and Continental European models.

The paper closes by reflecting the need for Chinese policy makers to continually develop, adapt and rewrite corporate governance practices capable of meeting the new challenge, and to pay attention to business ethics, an issue which goes beyond regulation...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the large}} number of {{corporate}} collapses around the world and their profound impact on investors, most research on corporate governance has focused on the mature market situations of developed countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, investigating whether a control mechanism promotes accountability. Remarkably, there is a dearth of studies on corporate governance in developing countries, such as Bangladesh. Although, there is no serious corporate scandal in Bangladesh to undermine investors 2 ̆ 7 confidence, corporate governance issues have still been prevalent in Bangladesh for few reasons. For example, the existing corporate governance best practices are not comprehensive and adequate. There is no legislative guidelines for controlling share ownership, no legislative guidelines for the directors 2 ̆ 7 duties even legislative guidelines for the appointment of independent directors. Therefore, the company directors are sometimes found to be involved in malpractice and the firm level poor corporate governance practices was identified. This study aims at examining the relationship between various corporate governance mechanisms (such as, ownership structure, board practices, compensation and capital structure) and firm performance. While doing so, this study explains the alternative corporate governance models around the world and attempts to frame a theoretical model of corporate governance in Bangladesh. It is revealed that, similar to corporations in Germany, Japan and East Asia, the corporate control mechanisms in Bangladesh are mostly insider oriented; such as ownership structure and in general, the board of directors. Some of the important external control mechanisms, such as market for corporate control or takeovers are largely absent in Bangladesh corporate sector. Due to the absence of a liquid capital market some other dominant control mechanisms, such as compensation in the form of stock options, debt covenant and effects of dividend policy in corporate monitoring are also absent in Bangladesh corporate sector. However, similar to corporate boards in Anglo-American countries, there is the representation of the outside independent directors on the corporate boards in Bangladesh. Pursuant to the control mechanisms identified in this study, it is further investigated whether these control mechanisms influence the firm performance (promotes accountability) in Bangladesh. More specifically, by using 2 -Stage Least Square (2 SLS) regression analysis, this study investigated whether different control mechanisms, such as ownership structure, board practices, executive compensation and capital structure influence the firm economic performance in Bangladesh. The empirical findings suggest that firms with majority ownership by insiders are over performing than any other ownership group. A significant positive relationship is found between the blockholding by directors and/or managers and firm performance. However, no significant relationship is found between the institutional ownership and firm performance and outsider ownership and firm performance. It is further revealed that the firm performance enhances within a certain level of insider ownership, implying that a certain level of insider ownership is good for the overall health of the company. These findings suggest that the effective owners 2 ̆ 7 involvement in the firms may reduce the agency conflict and may enhance firm performance. The empirical findings of the relationship between board composition and firm performance suggests that the board composition in the form of proportion of outside independent directors can not influence the firm performance. The empirical finding of the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance suggests that the CEO duality does not influence the firm performance. The empirical findings {{of the relationship between the}} ownership structure, firm size and executive pay suggest that there is a significant positive relationship between ownership structure and executive pay; executive pay and firm size. However, there is no conclusive evidence of pay-performance sensitivity. The significant relationship between executive pay and firm performance is found only under the Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s Q performance measure. The weak association between pay and performance suggests that executive compensation as a governance mechanism may not be suitable in the context of Bangladesh. This is probably due to the absence of a liquid capital market in Bangladesh. The empirical findings of the relationships between the capital structure and agency cost, and capital structure and firm performance suggest that capital structure can not reduce the agency cost. However, capital structure can influence the firm performance only under the market based performance measures. It implies that the lenders have very little role in firm governance in Bangladesh. Although this study supports the number of earlier studies, it could not provide the conclusive evidence on some important issues. The differences in the results from earlier studies suggest that corporate governance problem in Bangladesh may not be similar to that of other countries. The diversity of this study with the earlier studies implies that the 2 ̆ 7 one size does not fit all 2 ̆ 7 or one set of governance arrangements maynot be suitable for every country. Based on both the theoretical discussions and empirical investigations, it is apparent that the corporate governance practices need to be improved in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study finally seeks to assist the regulatory body in framing and/or <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> best practice/guidelines for Bangladeshi firms...|$|E
40|$|Many {{emerging}} markets {{have started a}} continuous process of developing their stock markets {{with the goal of}} deepening these markets and <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> within, in the belief that such developments will ultimately improve productivity and the rate of economic growth as well as attract foreign investments. The ability of financial market development to deliver these benefits depends mainly on their 'efficiency'. Egypt and Saudi Arabia are two leading {{emerging markets}} in the Arab region which are closely examined in this study, with a view to answer two key questions: Have the measures adopted by these two markets {{over the past ten years}} been effective in increasing their efficiency and thus are these markets actually starting to behave like the more developed markets? If this is not true, did mutual fund investors in either market achieve positive abnormal performance over this period? This study first examines the extent to which the Capital Market Authorities in these markets are achieving their goal of effectively developing the Egyptian and the Saudi capital markets. The main laws and regulations governing their performance and how effective the changes and amendments are in enhancing the efficiency of these two markets under study are also presented (chapter 2). Second, an event study is carried out to test for semi-strong informational efficiency in the two markets at the time of the 2008 global financial crisis. The chapter concludes that the two markets did not show the characteristics of semi-strong form I' efficiency (chapter 3). Thirdly, the study examines the performance of a sample of mutual funds from each market for the period starting December 31 st, 2001 and ending December 31 S 2009, utilizing Capital Asset Performance evaluation measures to see if any of the funds were able to realize abnormal returns, since the presence of abnormal returns may be a symptom of the markets' continued immaturity. The results suggest that none of the funds was able to achieve positive abnormal return. On the contrary, inferior Performance was frequently witnessed specifically in the Egyptian market (chapter 4). Market timing and security selection tests are then adopted. Henrikson Merton (1981) and Treynor Mazuy (1966) models in addition to the Fama (1972) net selectivity measures are all utilized to examine the presence of market timing and security selection abilities, if any, for the sampled mutual funds in the two markets under study. Mixed results are reported but concluded that on average Egyptian mutual funds do not possess market timing skills but showed very weak evidence of security selection skills unlike the Saudi market funds which showed weak market timing and security selection abilities (chapter 5). Finally, tests of performance evaluation based on downside CAPM are then presented resulting in different rankings for mutual funds and concluding with a recommendation in favour of the use of downside beta and down side performance evaluation measures instead of the traditional CAPM performance evaluation measures (chapter 6). The study concludes that despite the fact that the two markets are informationally inefficient and there is a possibility of realising abnormal returns, mutual funds sampled in the two markets were unable to grasp this opportunity or to pass some of the benefits in the form of positive performance to their investors. The results show that this poor performance is not only caused by weaknesses in the Capital Asset Pricing model as a framework for evaluating mutual funds' performance in emerging markets but there are several factors combined together causing this unsatisfactory performance. There is a problem in the level of the investor's appropriate knowledge and investment background. There are problems on the part of the capital market authorities of the two markets, the level of corporate governance, the enforcement of laws and regulations, the level of foreigners' participation, and other structural rigidities that exist therein. An these need rapid and effective improvement. This is in addition to the effect of the bank-based system in trading that actually hinders the development of the two markets. The main implications of this study are that the underperformance reported for mutual funds is not only due to the unsuitability of the CAPM model and its performance evaluation measures but also a direct result of true unsatisfactory performance on the part of fund managers and a highly volatile stock market. investors do not seem to realise that they do not have the appropriate investment background. Some mutual funds especially in Egypt with persistent underperformance should be liquidated as their investors would be better off investing in treasury bills. More importantly, all the reforms, amendments to laws. and regulations as well as other efforts made by the capital market authorities in the two markets under study are still ineffective in enhancing the markets' efficiency and thus, there is still a long way for these two markets to go to increase efficiency, productivity and economic growth. The study concludes with the following recommendations: • Institutional strengthening is essential for both markets to reduce bubbles, increase stability and increase the depth of the market. • Larger scale foreign investment is needed and this requires the removal of any existing restrictions. • An increase in the number of listed companies and more independence from the central bank (especially for the Saudi market) are needed, as well as an improvement in the channels for disseminating information in both markets to provide for fair, timely and cost effective access. • More investment alternatives for investors such as derivatives and options are required. • More enforcement of laws and regulations especially with respect to information transparency and disclosure requirements would improve performance. There remains a need for future research to examine fund performance using other models as the arbitrage pricing theory, other indices such as medium and small cap indices, and an examination of the performance of the newer and relatively more popular Islamic funds as opposed to the conventional funds.

40|$|Throughout the 1990 s, we have {{witnessed}} a wave of publications on <b>the</b> Codes of <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance</b> in different countries. The main objective of these codes is to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance</b> of firms by providing recommendations for companies. One of the frequent recommendations {{is to create an}} audit committee within the company, with a view to guaranteeing the independence of the auditors, as well as the integrity and reliability of accounting information. Among other reasons, the lack of the auditors' independence, managers' negligent behaviour, the publication of fraudulent financial information, the loss of the shareholders' confidence in this information, as well as the lack of adequate internal control systems, has given rise to the establishment of audit committees in the countries of the Anglo-Saxon environment. The objective {{of this article is to}} emphasise the role that audit committees play in companies and how this results in better quality information and fraud avoidance. Althoug,n theory, audit committees are conceived as effective, some empirical studies seem to suggest that this effectiveness is not really found in practice. In this way, the study of previous literature allows us to analyse to what extent the effectiveness of audit committees can be questioned...|$|R

One of the many and conceptually very different measures proposed is to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> of banks by setting qualification standards for banks’ non-executive directors. To explore the rationale of such a regulation implemented in Germany, we conducted a detailed survey among supervisory board members of German banks covering their educational background, professional status and experience, as well as non-occupation related activities. We document that general education among supervisory board members is high, but very few board members can rely on a professional background in banking and finance. This is especially true for chairpersons. A higher share of professionals among board members primarily reflects the presence of employee representatives. The majority of board members reports leadership experience, chairpersons more often than ordinary members. Some of these findings strongly depend on the bank’s legal form, its size and business model, suggesting that both market forces and institutional characteristics of banking markets are important determinants of the qualification level of non-executive directors.

Starting from these first works on {{enhancing}} <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> of Audit firm the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) published the Audit Firm Governance Code. The Code supports firms in their objectives of performing high quality work that gives confidence to shareholders.

On the basis of these motivations, this study looks at whether or not, and if so, in the UK Market <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> of <b>the</b> audit firms is correlated with the market share of audit firms in order to support the efforts of standard setters to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> of audit firms and to enrich the academic literature on this topic.

40|$|In view {{of recent}} {{corporate}} scandals, {{we argue that}} <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> can learn from public governance. Institutions devised to control and discipline the behavior of executives in the political sphere can give new insights into how to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> governance of firms. We discuss proposals in four specific areas: manager compensation, the division of power within firms, rules of succession in top positions, and institutionalized competition in core areas of <b>the</b> corporation. <b>The</b> <b>corporate</b> world recently has experienced a sobering up. The stock market has crashed, and <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> sector {{has been plagued by}} huge scandals relating to excessive manager compensation and fraudulent bookkeeping. There is widespread concern that <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> mechanisms have failed to prevent these scandals. As a consequence, improvements in <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> are being sought, like those embodied in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and regulators are considering further changes to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> system. <b>The</b> weaknesses and failures of actual <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> practice suggest that it might be useful to approach the issue from a new perspective.

30|$|In {{spite of}} these limitations, our results can still have some {{practical}} implications: We show that companies can receive valuable insights from embedded directors. A company with a more embedded board has an advantage over a company without an embedded board for several reasons: As previous studies have shown, knowledge and experience are important resources for directors to fulfill the tasks they are employed to carry out (Ahern and Dittmar 2012; Haunschild and Beckman 1998). We can now extend the benefits of embeddedness with the potential reduction of discrimination. Our empirical results allow the presumption that embedded directors base their decisions about appointments and compensation contracts less on stereotypes. In turn, they offer suitable candidates more competitive compensation contracts and therewith increase the firms’ chances of attaining and retaining capable and competent executives. These benefits are not restrained to management compensation, however: They are possible on all hierarchical levels. Knowledge and experience might help to reduce presumptions of language barriers and therewith stereotypes about minority groups among the majority workers of a company. One possibility for companies to establish an environment of reduced stereotypes and equal opportunities is, therefore, the creation of alternative knowledge sources such as trainings or cross-mentoring programs. Implementing such trainings to professionalize the board might be beneficial if its members are not yet embedded in networks. This is also a possible lever for regulators: Pushing for such trainings to be mandatory could <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> of <b>the</b> country as a whole.|$|R
40|$|When the Cyprus {{economy was}} booming in the 1990 s, key issues emanating from sound <b>corporate</b> <b>governance,</b> such as accountability, {{transparency}} and effective independent boards were not deemed important. However, {{largely as a}} result of the Cyprus stock exchange collapse of 2000, this view changed. In September 2002, due to the collapse, the Cyprus Stock Exchange implemented a <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance</b> Code predicated largely on Anglo-Saxon principles of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance.</b> This paper reports the result of a study into levels of compliance with the Code by companies listed on the Cyprus Stock Exchange. The findings indicate that only a small minority complied with all significant aspects of the Code, and the vast majority did not comply with any. While the Code was well intended, the intended reforms do not appear to have significantly improved <b>corporate</b> <b>governance.</b> This is perhaps not surprising, given that the Cyprus equity markets and corresponding legislative support pertaining to <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> are in their infancy. In addition, some typical free market controls (e. g. low degree of concentration of ownership, reliable and timely information flows and opportunities for investor diversification) that facilitate international institutional investment do not exist in Cyprus. This suggests that the introduction of a <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance</b> Code in Cyprus, or other developing economies, is likely to have only minimal impact unless it is supported by other initiatives. However, recent developments in Cyprus relating to greater education as to <b>the</b> benefits of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance,</b> as well as more stringent listing rules for companies lacking aspects of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance,</b> suggest that Cyprus is making serious endeavours to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> of its listed companies...|$|R

40|$|In Germany exist a {{large number}} of co-operatives that are engaged in a broad variety of {{business}} activities. Their organisational structure is determined by co-operative law and to a lesser degree by statutes or by-laws. As has been shown for German rural co-operatives by applying property rights theory <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> structure as determined by law is formally still in existence, while it actually has been shifted in favour of the executive board. This has created an imbalance where on the one hand no longer any <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> is actually taking place while on the other hand members' interests may easily be neglected, because it is the executive board that determines the members' interests and also whether they have benefited from the cooperatives activities. In theory, suitable instruments to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> structure within such co-operative are the promotion plan and the promotion report as developed by Boettcher. However, for transaction cost reasons and due to the current attenuation of property rights, it is unlikely that these instruments will be implemented without outside pressure, e. g. through a change in cooperative law. A superior alternative to promotion plan and promotion report may be a combination of promotion task controlling and member oriented quality management. While such instruments would indeed improve members' ability to execute co-operative governance, managers' willingness to submit themselves to stronger governance may well be assumed to be very low. Taking into account the current distribution of property rights in big German co-operatives, managers will accept stronger governance structures only if some other incentives exist. An ongoing research project indicates that such incentives might exist in <b>the</b> realm of <b>improved</b> business opportunities due to better information about members' aims and needs.

Generally, the Chinese financial system is bank-oriented. The property rights structure, led by state-owned banks, is the prominent feature of the Chinese banking system. Equity, bond, money, currency and real estate markets have been developing rapidly; however, the development rate of these markets varies, and institutional construction generally falls behind the market development. China’s financial decision-making authority belongs to the State Council, and the financial supervision system adopts the mode of “separate regulation. ” China’s state-driven, progressive financial reforms have promoted {{the formation of the}} government-led financial structure, which is composed of three parts: first, monetary policy, balancing both inflation control and economic growth; second, bank credit expansion under the implicit guarantee of the state; and third, the adjustable pegged exchange rate system based on capital controls. The next phase of financial reform in China will mainly focus on the following four key goals: first, to further <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> and <b>the</b> mixed operation of financial institutions; second, to construct the institution of a financial market system and <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of the financial markets; third, to re-integrate regulatory resources, combine macro- and micro-prudent views, and establish a comprehensive framework for financial stability; fourth, to promote the liberalization of interest rates, marketization of the exchange rate and the opening of capital accounts based on a progressive approach and to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> openness of the financial system based on macroeconomic stability. ...|$|R
