5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent <b>intensity</b> <b>scale.</b> Optimizing the <b>intensity</b> <b>scale</b> is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E

5|$|By 2January, {{the weak}} low moved over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf where it slowly {{developed}} over the following day. Once over water, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system as Tropical Depression 09S. As organisation improved, a mid-level subtropical ridge over Western Australia pushed the system westward, away from the Kimberley coast. Steadily strengthening, the low attained gale-force winds near its centre during the morning of 4January and was subsequently named Helen by the Bureau of Meteorology. Shortly thereafter, a strong westerly monsoon flow to the north caused Helen to turn eastward, back towards land. Intensification continued up until landfall, by which time Helen had attained Category2 status on the Australian tropical cyclone <b>intensity</b> <b>scale.</b> Maximum ten-minute sustained winds reached 95km/h (60mph) and the storm's barometric pressure decreased to 975mbar (hPa; 28.79inHg).

5|$|Cyclone Amara brought stormy {{conditions}} to Rodrigues in December2013. Amara {{was the first}} named storm in the southwest Indian Ocean during the later half of 2013, and developed from a disturbance within the monsoon trough on December14. The following day, the system attained tropical depression status. Despite its ill-defined organization, the depression was able to continue strengthening, reaching moderate tropical storm status on December16 as it tracked southwest. Situated in a favorable atmospheric environment, a period of rapid intensification ensued after Amara reached tropical cyclone status on December18. After fluctuating in strength, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 933mbar (hPa; 27.55inHg) on December21, making it an intense tropical cyclone based on the <b>intensity</b> <b>scale</b> utilized by Météo-France. Shortly after, wind shear strengthened as Amara tracked southeast, resulting in a weakening phase. The shearing effects caused the cyclone to rapidly decay, and by December23, Amara degenerated into a remnant low.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Arthur (RSMC Nadi designation: 08F, JTWC designation: 09P) was {{the eighth}} {{tropical}} depression and fourth tropical cyclone of the 2006–07 South Pacific cyclone season.

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the storm to have peaked as a minimal Category 1 cyclone. Shortly after peaking in intensity, the cyclone began to deteriorate due to unfavorable conditions. Quickly moving towards the east-southeast, the Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition. After turning towards the southeast, the center of circulation was almost fully exposed due to strong wind shear. However, Arthur briefly re-strengthened late on January26 before becoming extratropical the next day. Tropical Cyclone Arthur affected several small islands during its existence. French Polynesia observed the most noteworthy effects from the storm, where several landslides damaged a few homes.|$|E

40|$|Earthquakes {{could cause}} {{enormous}} human casualties, {{and it is}} crucial to reduce their risks through anti-earthquake procedures.
