40|$|Because energy {{reserves}} limit flight range, wind assistance {{may be of}} crucial importance for migratory birds. We tracked eight Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>swans</b> Cygnus columbianus bewickii, using 95 -g satellite transmitters with altimeters and activity sensors, during their spring migration from Denmark to northern Russia in 1996. During the 82 occasions where a swan 2 ̆ 7 s location was recorded in flight, average flight altitude was 165 m a. s. 1. with a maximum of 759 m a. s. 1., despite winds often being more favourable at higher altitudes. We also counted Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>swans</b> departing from the Gulf of Finland and subsequently passing an observatory in the next major stop-over area 800 km further north in the White Sea, northern Russia, during the springs of 1994, 1995 and 1996.

40|$|Deep burial in the {{sediment}} of tubers of fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) has been {{explained in terms}} of avoidance by escape against consumption by Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>swans</b> (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) in autumn. We therefore expected changes in foraging pressure to ultimately result in a change in the tuber distribution across sediment depth. A trade-off underlies this idea: deep tubers are less accessible to swans but must be larger to meet the higher energy demands of sprouting in spring. To test this prediction, we compared tuber burial depth over a gradient of foraging pressure both across space and across time. Tuber samples were obtained after aboveground plant senescence but before arrival of Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>swans.</b> First, we compared the current tuber bank depth profile in a shallow lake with high foraging pressure, the Lauwersmeer, with that in two wetlands with moderate and low foraging pressure. Second, we compared the current tuber burial in the Lauwersmeer with that in the early 1980 s when exploitation by swans had just started there. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found significantly deeper burial of tubers under high consumption risk compared to low consumption risk, both when comparing sites and comparing time periods. Since tubers in effect only survive to the next spring, the observed differences in burial depth among sites and over time cannot be a direct result of tuber losses due to consumption by swans. Rather, these observations suggest adaptive responses in tuber burial related to foraging pressure from Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>swans</b> in the recent past. We thus propose that fennel pondweed exhibits flexible avoidance by escape, of a kind rarely described for plants, where both phenotypic plasticity and genotype sorting may contribute to the observed differences in tuber burial. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{vertebrate}} herbivores exploitatively compete for the same food plant may depend {{on the level of}} compensatory plant growth. Such compensation is higher when there is reduced density-dependent competition in plants after herbivore damage. Whether there is relief from competition may largely be determined by the life-history stage of plants under herbivory. Such stage-specific compensation may apply to seasonal herbivory on the clonal aquatic plant sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.). It winters in sediments of shallow lakes as tubers that are foraged upon by Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Swans</b> (Cygnus columbianus bewickii Yarrell), whereas aboveground biomass in summer is mostly consumed by ducks, coots, and Mute Swans. Here, tuber predation may be compensated due to diminished negative density dependence in the next growth season. However, we expected lower compensation to summer herbivory by waterfowl and fish as density of aboveground biomass in summer is closely related to photosynthetic carbon fixation. In a factorial exclosure study we simultaneously investigated (1) the effect of summer herbivory on aboveground biomass and autumn tuber biomass and (2) the effect of tuber predation in autumn on aboveground biomass and tuber biomass a year later. Summer herbivory strongly influenced belowground tuber biomass in autumn, limiting food availability to Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Swans.</b> In contrast, tuber predation in autumn by Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Swans</b> had a limited and variable effect on P. pectinatus biomass in the following growth season. Whereas relief from negative density dependence largely eliminates effects of belowground herbivory by swans, aboveground herbivory in summer limits both above- and belowground plant biomass. Hence, there was an asymmetry in exploitative competition, with herbivores in summer reducing food availability for belowground herbivores in autumn, but not the other way around. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Deeper {{burial of}} bulbs and tubers has been {{suggested}} as an escape against below-ground herbivory by vertebrates, but experimental evidence is lacking. As deep propagule burial can incur high costs of emergence after dormancy, burial depth may represent a trade-off between sprouting survival and herbivore avoidance. We tested whether burial depth of subterraneous tubers is a flexible trait in fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), facing tuber predation by Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>swans</b> (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) in shallow lakes in winter. In a four-year experiment involving eight exclosures, winter herbivory by swans and all vertebrate summer herbivory were excluded in a full-factorial design; we hence controlled for aboveground vertebrate herbivory in summer, possibly influencing tuber depth. Tuber depth was measured each September before swan arrival and each March before tuber sprouting. In accordance with our hypothesis, tuber depth in September decreased after excluding Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>swans</b> in comparison to control plots. The summer exclosure showed an increase in tuber biomass {{and the number of}} shallow tubers, but not a significant effect on the mean burial depth of tuber mass. Our results suggest that a clonal plant like P. pectinatus can tune the tuber burial depth to predation pressure, either by phenotypic plasticity or genotype sorting, hence exhibiting flexible avoidance by escape. We suggest that a flexible propagule burial depth can be an effective herbivore avoidance strategy, which might be more widespread among tuber forming plant species than previously thought. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Some {{migratory birds}} refuel at {{stopover}} sites that they by-pass {{on the return}} trip. In theory, this skipping behaviour is only expected in time-selected migrants when the overflown site is of a lower quality than the departure site. We provide empirical evidence that quality differences in stopover sites are the cause for skipping in Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Swans</b> Cygnus bewickii tracked by satellite telemetry. Two and five complete tracks were recorded in spring and autunm, respectively, showing that the White Sea was visited for c. 2 weeks in spring, but by-passed (or visited {{for a few days}} at the most) in autumn. Skipping of the White Sea in autumn was predicted by a dynamic programming model which was based on calculated gain rates during stopover in the Pechora Delta and the White Sea. This prediction was not sensitive to plausible variations in gain rates. Relative to the Pechora Delta the White Sea is a poor site because a large tidal amplitude precludes foraging on the beds of the submerged macrophyte Fennel Pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus during high tide. The dynamic programming model predicted a fast autunm migration. However, the phenology of autunm arrival dates of Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Swans</b> on the wintering grounds revealed that only in three out of ten years a significant number of birds was able to reach the wintering grounds without refuelling.

Delacour (1954) suggested the comprehensive vernacular name 2 ̆ 7 northern swans 2 ̆ 7 to distinguish 2 ̆ 7 the various knobless white swans which breed in or near the Arctic parts of the northern hemisphere 2 ̆ 7 from the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) and the three southern hemisphere swans. The northern swans have generally (e. g. Stejneger, 1882; Wetmore, 1951; Vaurie, 1965) been regarded as constituting four separate species, although as early as 1832 Yarrell questioned whether the smaller North American (Whistling) swan should be regarded as specifically distinct from the comparable Eurasian (Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s)</b> <b>swan.</b> Yarrell 2 ̆ 7 s observations on the Trumpeter Swan 2 ̆ 7 s tracheal anatomy did convince him that it should be regarded as a species distinct from both the Whooper Swan and from the two smaller northern swans.

Thus, two different taxonomic approaches to the group have gradually emerged as shown in Table 1. A fifth described form, jankowskii, is now believed to be invalid (Vaurie, 1965), as is a supposed Islandic race (islandicus) of the Whooper Swan. Two major taxonomic questions are present. First, how many species of northern swans should be recognized in order best to illustrate their probable degree of phyletic distinction, and second, if fewer than four are to be recognized, what forms should be merged with what other forms...|$|R

40|$|The {{extent to}} which animal migrations shape {{parasite}} transmission networks is critically dependent on a migrant 2 ̆ 7 s ability to tolerate infection and migrate successfully. Yet, sub-lethal effects of parasites can be intensified through periods of increased physiological stress. Long-distance migrants may, therefore, be especially susceptible to negative effects of parasitic infection. Although {{a handful of studies}} have investigated the short-term, transmission-relevant behaviors of wild birds infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), the ecological consequences of LPAIV for the hosts themselves remain largely unknown. Here, we assessed the potential effects of naturally-acquired LPAIV infections in Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>swans,</b> a long-distance migratory species that experiences relatively low incidence of LPAIV infection during early winter. We monitored both foraging and movement behavior in the winter of infection, as well as subsequent breeding behavior and inter-annual resighting probability over 3 years. Incorporating data on infection history we hypothesized that any effects would be most apparent in naïve individuals experiencing their first LPAIV infection. Indeed, significant effects of infection were only seen in birds that were infected but lacked antibodies indicative of prior infection. Swans that were infected but had survived a previous infection were indistinguishable from uninfected birds in each of the ecological performance metrics. Despite showing reduced foraging rates, individuals in the naïve-infected category had similar accumulated body stores to re-infected and uninfected individuals prior to departure on spring migration, possibly as a result of having higher scaled mass at the time of infection. And yet individuals in the naïve-infected category were unlikely to be resighted 1 year after infection, with 6 out of 7 individuals that never resighted again compared to 20 out of 63 uninfected individuals and 5 out of 12 individuals in the re-infected category. Collectively, our findings indicate that acute and superficially harmless infection with LPAIV may have indirect effects on individual performance and recruitment in migratory Bewick 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>swans.</b> Our results also highlight the potential for infection history {{to play an important role}} in shaping ecological constraints throughout the annual cycle...|$|R
