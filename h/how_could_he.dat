500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. Smith says that as soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and so <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> know that? The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". Smith says he laughed out loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I saw what happened. That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". Smith says he left the room [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could have {{a key role in the}} running of football in this country".|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale of the New York Times was {{critical}} of the episode, discussing the show's [...] "increasingly rapid march toward Hallmark country." [...] He commented that while [...] "Acafellas" [...] did not match the standard of the pilot episode, it was funnier than [...] "Showmance", and praised the return of Stephen Tobolowsky as Sandy Ryerson. Hale called Groban's cameo the [...] "most fun of all" [...] in the episode, but overall noted that: [...] "The humor can’t {{make up for the}} lack of big production numbers [...] The problem for this show {{is always going to be}} how to fill the gaps between songs. A lot of the current plot lines, like Will and his wife's phantom baby, are already getting old, so it would behoove the producers to keep those gaps as short as possible." [...] Rachel Ray, reviewing the episode for The Independent deemed Glee [...] "overhyped [...] uninspired, confusing and with a simple plot to boot." [...] Ray wrote, Glee [...] "upbeat message" [...] was [...] "overridden by the show's attempt to be darker than the run-of-the mill high school drama." [...] As with Hale, Ray commented that: [...] "Music should be the redeeming feature of Glee but it's not, because the viewer never gets a satisfying taste of the cast members' musical talents". Shawna Malcom criticized Terri and Will's characterization in the episode, deeming Terri [...] "beyond annoying", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Of Will, Malcom posed the question: [...] "didn’t it feel as though his commitment to the glee club melted away rather quickly? [...] <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> turn his back so easily?" [...] More positively, Malcom called Kurt's coming out scene [...] "lovely". She wrote that Groban's appearance was [...] "laugh out loud" [...] funny, while Stack commented: [...] "It was a little random, but it's all worth it for the scene when Groban was hitting on Will's mom." ...|$|E
500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E

[...] Moffat later said that he believes the Doctor remembers all 4.5 billion years he spent dying and recreating himself in [...] "Heaven Sent", and that the confession dial extracts the Doctor's memories of each iteration, feeding them back to him as a means of torture.|$|E

2500|$|... {{affirmed the}} prophecies of {{salvation}} with their end-time imagery Zion and the temple—belonging to the eschatological themes that the [...] "pilgrimage of the peoples" [...] evoked. But {{contrary to the}} common expectation of his contemporaries, Jesus expected {{the destruction of the}} temple in the coming eschatological ordeal (Mark 13:2=Matt 24:2=Luke 21:6). The combination seems contradictory. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> simultaneously predict the ruin of the temple in the ordeal and affirm the end-time fulfilment of promise and prophecy on Zion and temple? The paradox is irresolvable until one takes note of another trait of Jesus' words on the imagery of Zion and temple, namely, the consistent application to his own disciples of Zion- and temple-imagery: the city on the mountain (Matt 5:14; cf. Thomas, 32), the cosmic rock (Matt 16:18; cf. John 1:42), the new sanctuary (Mark 14:58; Matt 26:61). The mass of promise and prophecy will come to fulfilment in this eschatological and messianic circle of believers.|$|E

In one incident, a vehicle carrying rockets and missiles travelled undetected through 23 Baghdad checkpoints equipped with the ADE 651. The {{false sense of security}} provided by the device had catastrophic effects for many Iraqi people, hundreds of whom were killed in bombings that the ADE 651 failed to prevent. The victim of one such bombing, 21-year-old Haneen Alwan, told the BBC that her life had been destroyed after she was caught in a bomb attack which caused injuries that killed her unborn child and prompted her husband to divorce her because of her extensive burns, which have so far required her to undergo 59 operations. She said: [...] "When people passed through checkpoints using these devices, they thought they would be safe. But they are useless. The man who sold them has no conscience.

2500|$|In 2008, {{when it was}} {{announced}} that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as [...] "a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show". Other media sources branded them two of [...] "the most popular characters on the soap" [...] and an [...] "iconic couple". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, [...] "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect to see {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] I sense friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (<b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he?).</b> All very well thought through and positive.

However, Charlie agrees with Megan in wanting to help Larry and personally vouches for him. Eppes' words and affiliation with the NSA gets him back on the mission, thus, repaying a debt as Larry helped launch him into the academic firmament.

2500|$|On an {{occasion}} in 628, Wang was attending a feast held by Emperor Taizong, when a beautiful concubine of Emperor Taizong's, who was originally a concubine of Li Yuan the Prince of Lujiang {{and who was}} taken into Emperor Taizong's palace after Li Yuan was executed, was attending to Emperor Taizong.

[...] Wang instead responded, [...] "Does Your Imperial Majesty believe that the Prince of Lujiang was correct in seizing this woman?" [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Why do you ask me whether it is correct to kill a woman's husband and seize her?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I had once read from the writings of Guan Zhong, which stated, 'When Duke Huan of Qi visited the land of Guo , he asked the seniors of Guo, [...] "Why was Guo destroyed?" [...] The seniors stated, [...] "The lord of Guo knew right from wrong." [...] Duke Huan responded, [...] "If you are correct, then he was an intelligent ruler. [...] Why was he destroyed?"

[...] Emperor Taizong became angry and rebuked Wen and Wang. [...] Wen bowed and begged for forgiveness, but Wang refused to do so, stating to Emperor Taizong that the rebuke to him and Wen was not warranted as they were reporting what was true.
