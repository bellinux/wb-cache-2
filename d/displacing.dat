5|$|Most high-energy particles, beside <b>displacing</b> carbon atom {{from the}} lattice site, also pass it enough surplus energy for a rapid {{migration}} through the lattice. However, when relatively gentle gamma irradiation is used, this {{extra energy is}} minimal. Thus the interstitials remain near the original vacancies and form vacancy-interstitials pairs identified through optical absorption.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{document}} the post-displacement employment patterns observed between 1979 and 2004 for <b>displaced</b> workers aged 50 to 54. We uncover four key patterns. First, we detect no upward {{trend in the}} re-employment rates of male <b>displaced</b> workers in the aggregate, in manufacturing or outside manufacturing. Second, we show that re-employment rates of <b>displaced</b> women generally increased over time. Third, we find substantial evidence that median and average earnings losses of males <b>displaced</b> from manufacturing in recent years (i. e. between 2000 and 2004) were {{higher than those of}} comparable cohorts <b>displaced</b> during the 1980 s. Part of this increase is related to the lower re-employment rates observed in recent years for males <b>displaced</b> from manufacturing. These lower re-employment rates suggest that, following displacement, aggregate working hours likely fell for males <b>displaced</b> from manufacturing. Finally, we show that median and average earnings losses of women <b>displaced</b> from non-manufacturing firms fell over time. Layoffs, Job security, Job loss, Job stability, Labour turnover...|$|R
5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven enemy of the Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for <b>displacing</b> him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had family ties to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the Santa Fe {{encountered}} capacity {{problems on}} the San Francisco Chief, which ran between Chicago and San Francisco. Unlike the El Capitan, the Chief carried a mix of sleeping cars and coaches. To augment capacity, the Santa Fe ordered an additional 24 coaches in 19631964; 12 step-down and 12 standard. This was the final major order for new long-distance passenger equipment before the coming of Amtrak. Each San Francisco Chief carried four Hi-Level coaches, <b>displacing</b> six single-level coaches.|$|E
5|$|Following minor {{events in}} 1917, 1927, 1931, and 1939, {{threatening}} activity resumed {{in the late}} 1950s, when, in 1957, an earthquake near Birmingham extended from northern Alabama to Georgia and Tennessee, cracking and <b>displacing</b> small objects. A 1959 event in Huntsville, although smaller, damaged chimneys, wrecked plaster, and threw objects from shelves and tables. More recently, events occurred in Escambia County in 1997 and in 2003 in Fort Payne, registering magnitudes of 4.9 and spawning shaking. The Fort Payne earthquake spread over 13 states and wrought structural cracks.|$|E
5000|$|When any boat <b>displaces</b> {{a weight}} of water equal {{to its own}} weight, it floats. This is often called the [...] "principle of flotation": A {{floating}} object <b>displaces</b> a weight of fluid equal to its own weight. Every ship, submarine, and dirigible must be designed to <b>displace</b> a weight of fluid at least equal to its own weight. A 10,000-ton ship's hull must be built wide enough, long enough and deep enough to <b>displace</b> 10,000 tons of water and still have some hull above the water {{to prevent it from}} sinking. It needs extra hull to fight waves that would otherwise fill it and, by increasing its mass, cause it to submerge. The same is true for vessels in air: a dirigible that weighs 100 tons needs to <b>displace</b> 100 tons of air. If it <b>displaces</b> more, it rises; if it <b>displaces</b> less, it falls. If the dirigible <b>displaces</b> exactly its weight, it hovers at a constant altitude.|$|R
50|$|Classification of development-induced <b>displaced</b> persons (DIDPs), refugees and internally <b>displaced</b> persons rests on {{fundamental}} {{differences in the}} type of assistance provided to each category. Refugees and internally <b>displaced</b> persons typically need international protection and assistance as a result of fleeing violence and persecution. Development-induced <b>displaced</b> persons require the restoration of their capacity to generate income and protection from the state. While people <b>displaced</b> as a result of development have similar experiences to refugees (as defined by the UNHCR) in terms of economic and social loss, they are not protected by international law.|$|R
40|$|People often <b>displace</b> their {{aggression}} against innocent targets. Notwithstanding {{the merits of}} previous research on <b>displaced</b> aggression, critical gaps remain. First, {{it is unclear whether}} and how situational and dispositional factors interact to influence <b>displaced</b> aggression. Moreover, it is unclear whether engaging in direct aggression increases or decreases <b>displaced</b> aggression. To address these gaps, the present experiment investigated how situational factors (provocateur availability, provocation intensity) and dispositional factors (callousness, trait aggressiveness) jointly influence <b>displaced</b> and direct aggression in male adolescents. Participants (N = 175, Mage = 13. 1 years) completed a personal profile that was allegedly evaluated by peer judges. After randomly receiving mild or strong negative feedback, participants could aggress against these peer judges as well as against other innocent peers (direct and <b>displaced</b> aggression) or against innocent peers only (<b>displaced</b> aggression). Results showed that <b>displaced</b> aggression occurred only when the negative feedback was strong and participants could not retaliate directly. Higher levels of callousness specifically predicted more <b>displaced</b> (but not direct) aggression. However, the potentiating effects of callousness emerged only when the negative feedback was strong. This finding highlights the importance of examining disposition by situation interactions in <b>displaced</b> aggression research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) ...|$|R

50|$|Atoms {{can only}} be <b>displaced</b> if, upon bombardment, the energy they receive exceeds a {{threshold}} energy Ed.
