50|$|On 13 November 2012, Lukić {{resigned}} {{his post}} as club president. He was temporarily {{replaced by the}} working <b>group</b> (<b>commission</b> for stabilization) formed on the initiative of deputy prime minister Aleksandar Vučić and headed by Nebojša Čović whose goal {{was to determine the}} financial situation in the club and organize the elections for the next club president. In mid-December 2012, Dragan Džajić was elected new club president (he was the only candidate after Branko Tekić's bid got rejected) while Čović's working group announced its findings of the club's financial analysis from 1996 until 2012 - pertaining to Lukić's tenure as club president, when he took over in late May 2009 the club debt was reported to be €22,398,806 and reportedly grew to €44,109,565 by November 2012 when Lukić left.|$|E
40|$|In this research, we {{show that}} the {{interaction}} between territory allocation and sales force compensation—two key drivers of sales productivity—strongly affects the firm's profitability. We analyze an agency-theoretic model that jointly considers the degree of negative or positive correlation across territory outcomes, differences in territories' sales potentials, the agency problem with risk-averse salespeople, {{and the availability of}} both own-territory compensation elements, such as commission, and elements dependent on the performance of others, such as group commissions or tournaments. We find that allocating salespeople to negatively correlated sales territories beneficially diversifies each salesperson's portfolio of sales outcomes when this allocation includes a <b>group</b> <b>commission</b> pay component, and can improve profitability even with a decrease in average territory sales performance. In a larger sales force, a balanced allocation of salespeople, coupled with a <b>group</b> <b>commission,</b> dominates an imbalanced allocation. Comparing piece-rate compensation (with or without a <b>group</b> <b>commission</b> component) to tournaments alongside the allocation problem, we find that tournaments are favored over piece-rate plans when territories are highly positively correlated, territory sales potentials are similar, and salespeople have a low disutility for effort and are not very risk-averse. A piece-rate plan conversely dominates a tournament when these conditions are reversed. agency theory, channels of distribution, compensation, sales force...|$|E

40|$|A multitarget visual {{cancellation}} {{test was}} administered to patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Attentional loads—physical similarity (number of features shared by target and distractors; 3 levels) and density (number of items per page; 3 levels) —were varied systematically. As physical similarity increased, both groups slowed their search, but whereas the HC group maintained accuracy, the AD group increased commission errors and tended to miss more targets. Increased density yielded slower search and more target omissions in the AD <b>group.</b> <b>Commission</b> errors are additional indicators of higher order attentional deficits, especially in early disease. The findings suggest that patients with AD may rely increasingly on physical features of stimuli during a search, leading to inefficient bottom-up processing strategies. Impairment of visual selective attention in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was not initially recognized as a criterion for diagnosis of the disease (American Psychiatric Association, 1987) but has since been acknowledged as a compromised area in the AD cognitiv...|$|E
40|$|Addictive {{behaviors}} {{are accompanied by}} a lack of inhibitory control, specifically when individuals are confronted with substance-related cues. Thus, we expected women with symptoms of food addiction to be impaired in inhibitory control, when confronted with palatable, high-calorie food-cues. Female college students (N = 50) where divided in low and high food addiction groups based on the symptom count of the Yale Food Addiction Scale. Participants performed a Go/No-Go-task with high-calorie food-cues or neutral pictures presented behind the targets. Self-reported impulsivity was also assessed. The high food addiction group had faster reaction times in response to food-cues as compared to neutral cues and reported higher attentional impulsivity than the low food addiction <b>group.</b> <b>Commission</b> and omission errors did not differ between groups or picture types. Hence, women with food addiction symptoms reported higher attentional impulsivity and reacted faster in response to food-cues, although neither increased self-reported motor impulsivity nor impaired behavioral inhibition were found. Food addiction symptoms seem to be related to attentional aspects of impulsivity but not other facets of impulsivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} on a learning-set task of 20 normal and 20 brain-damaged 5 s of comparable verbal intelligence was contrasted. An analysis of variance showed that the normals were superior to the brain damaged in improvement over repeated trials of the same problem and over blocks of similar problems. The normals made fewer errors of perseverative type, repetitive type, and made fewer incorrect choices after a rewarded correct choice. In the normal <b>group,</b> <b>commission</b> of the latter 2 errors was related to verbal intelligence, with no such relationship being found for the brain-damaged Ss. An explanation in terms of conceptual functioning is presented. Evidence adduced to support Harlow's hypothesis that learning-set (LS) learning is dependent upon some capacity factor or factors transcending those needed for intraproblem learning of equivalent problems (Harlow, 1959, p. 504) comes from four sources, (a) Phylogenetically more advanced species evidence greater LS learning than less advanced species (e. g., Harlow, 1959). (b) Infant animals perform poorer on LS problems than more mature animals (e. g., Harlow, 1959). (c) In human children, those of normal intelligence solve LS problems more efficiently than retardates (e. g., Ellis, 1958; Kaufma...|$|E
