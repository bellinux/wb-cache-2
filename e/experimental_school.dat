Ross moved back to Chicago and led the mathematics department at an <b>experimental</b> <b>school</b> started by Ph.D.s during the Great Depression, People's Junior College, where he also taught physics. Ross became an assistant professor at St. Louis University in 1935 and stayed for about 11 years. In an interview, he said he advocated for a student who became the first black woman in the South to receive a master's degree in mathematics. This exception led the university to admit black students despite the idea's widespread unpopularity. During World War II, Ross served as a research mathematician for the U.S. Navy. He befriended Hungarian mathematician Gábor Szegő while in St. Louis, who recommended Ross for a 1941 Brown University summer school that prepared young scientists to assist in the war, a program Ross attended. He occasionally worked on proximity fuzes for Stromberg-Carlson's laboratory from 1941 to 1945 before accepting a position as head of University of Notre Dame's mathematics department in 1946. He set out to change the school's research climate by inviting distinguished mathematicians including Paul Erdős, whom Ross made a full professor.|$|E

The thesis traces the lives of several teachers. As sources were used not only archives but also a series of interviews with graduates of these schools.

50|$|Another {{important}} issue which is causing disturbance in many Greek families is {{the existence of}} paid private classes named frontistiria (φροντιστήρια) whose attendance by the Greek students has become a necessity {{in order for them}} to be able to achieve high grades and succeed in their exams. This is a phenomenon noticed especially as the student approaches the 3rd grade of upper high school because of the high difficulty of the Panhellenic Examinations. It has been an object of criticism due to the high fees that most Greek families are called to pay, thus deviating from the concept of a free and accessible education for everyone. Furthermore, in 2012 the Greek government introduced a regulation that changed the regime which the selection of the students who wished to be registered in the <b>Experimental</b> <b>Schools</b> was done with. Before 2012, those students were picked from a lottery, whereas the regulation established a system of entrance exams for <b>Experimental</b> <b>Schools</b> which occurred in the 1st grade of lower and upper high school that the students had to pass in order to be selected. This incident reinforced the presence of frontistiria, as some parents started sending their children there, even while at primary-age, so as to prepare them for the entrance exams. The regulation also renamed the <b>Experimental</b> <b>Schools</b> to Exemplar <b>Experimental</b> <b>Schools.</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vending {{machines}} {{account for}} food sales and revenue in schools. We examined 3 strategies for promoting {{the sale of}} lower-calorie food products from vending machines in {{high schools in the}} Netherlands. METHODS: A school-based randomized controlled trial was conducted in 13 <b>experimental</b> <b>schools</b> and 15 control schools. Three strategies were tested within each experimental school: increasing the availability of lower-calorie products in vending machines, labeling products, and reducing the price of lower-calorie products. The <b>experimental</b> <b>schools</b> introduced the strategies in 3 consecutive phases, with phase 3 incorporating all 3 strategies. The control schools remained the same. The sales volumes from the vending machines were registered. Products were grouped into (1) extra foods containing empty calories, for example, candies and potato chips, (2) nutrient-rich basic foods, and (3) beverages. They were also divided into favorable, moderately unfavorable, and unfavorable products. RESULTS: Total sales volumes for <b>experimental</b> and control <b>schools</b> did not differ significantly for the extra and beverage products. Proportionally, the higher availability of lower-calorie extra products in the <b>experimental</b> <b>schools</b> led to higher sales of moderately unfavorable extra products than in the control schools, and to higher sales of favorable extra products in <b>experimental</b> <b>schools</b> where students have to stay during breaks. Together, availability, labeling, and price reduction raised the proportional sales of favorable beverages. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that when the availability of lower-calorie foods is increased and is also combined with labeling and reduced prices, students make healthier choices without buying more or fewer products from school vending machines. Changes to school vending machines help to create a healthy school environment...|$|R

This combined with income from the Maharaja of Tripura, sales of jewelry owned by him and his late wife, his bungalow at the seaside Puri, and mediocre royalties (Rs.2,000) gleaned from the licensed publishing of thousands of copies of his works.|$|E
25|$|Margaret wanted time to {{consider}} his proposition and thus began an uncomfortable dance between them, which contributed to Ramsey's depressive moods in early 1924; as a result he travelled to Vienna for psychoanalysis. He, {{like many of his}} contemporaries, including his Viennese flatmate and fellow Apostle Lionel Penrose (also in analysis with Siegfried Bernfeld), was intellectually interested in psychoanalysis. Ramsey's analyst was Theodor Reik, a disciple of Freud. As one of the justifications for undertaking the therapy, he asserted {{in a letter to his}} mother that unconscious impulses might even affect the work of a mathematician. While in Vienna, he visited Wittgenstein in Puchberg, was befriended by the Wittgenstein family and visited A.S. Neill's <b>experimental</b> <b>school</b> four hours from Vienna at Sonntagsberg. In the summer of 1924, he continued his analysis by joining Reik at Dobbiaco (in South Tyrol), where a fellow analysand was Lewis Namier. Ramsey returned to England in October 1924; with John Maynard Keynes's support he became a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. He joined a Psychoanalysis Group in Cambridge with fellow members Arthur Tansley, Lionel Penrose, Harold Jeffreys, John Rickman and James Strachey, the qualification for membership of which was a completed psychoanalysis.|$|E

500|$|Goodman sees {{schools as}} {{mechanisms}} for adjusting youth to an automated society increasingly absent [...] "any human values". Goodman disagrees {{with those who}} say public schools teach middle class values, as he sees schools as more petit bourgeois than bourgeois, favoring [...] "bureaucratic, time-serving, grade-grind-practical, timid, and nouveau riche climbing" [...] over [...] "independence, initiative, scrupulous honesty, earnestness, utility, [...] respect for thorough scholarship". In this way, schooling {{is not a good}} use of student time, and students are right to quit and avoid the psychological and professional damage. More important is the disintegration of social class segregation. Goodman then asserts that lower- and middle-class kids would be better off without public or any schooling altogether. He proposes several alternatives to formal schooling, such as divvying up the high school's public funds directly amongst its students, and advocates for a variety of <b>experimental</b> <b>school</b> alternatives: [...] "no school at all, the real city as school, farm schools, practical apprenticeships, guided travel, work camps, little theaters and local newspapers, [...] community service". Other proposals include making class non-compulsory (such that attendance will reflect student interest without [...] "trapping" [...] children), requiring students to wait two years before applying to the most elite colleges, eliminating grades so the burden of testing for required skills falls on companies, and letting students quit and resume freely. He proposes Danish folk school-style education for those uninterested in academics. Goodman's foremost intention was to stimulate new educational paradigms. He acknowledges that his specific proposals may be unpopular or ignored.|$|E
