The enclosed design of the Lo Trau means complete combustion of the fuel, better use of the heat that it generated and thus reduce the fuel consumption by its furnace-like burning generated by the updraft through the chimney. Due to its furnace-like operation, most fuel will burned thoroughly into fine ashes with almost no waste. <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> <b>test</b> findings showed that it took only 5 minutes to boil water using an approximate 180g of rice husk.

40|$|Geotechnical ground {{investigation}} {{is important in}} all construction works particularly, land reclamation projects. The Changi East reclamation project is a mega project that involves creation of land space as large as 3, 000 hectares in multiple phases between 1991 and 2005. Ground investigation plays {{a critical role in}} the Changi project which involved substantial amount of ground improvement works after reclamation by sand filling. One important aspect of the investigation was to evaluate the geotechnical characteristics of the underlying compressible soils beneath the original seabed for the selection of suitable methods of ground improvement. The other important aspect of the investigation was to characterize and verify the compactness of the reclaimed sand fill. Many types of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>tests</b> were extensively used in the project. The field vane shear test provides correlations between the undrained shear strength and depth for the upper and the lower marine clay strata in the Northern part and the Southern Part of the reclaimed site. Combined with laboratory undrained shear strength tests, the field vane strength profiles allow the derivation of the undrained shear strength over effective stress ratios for the upper and the lower marine clays. In addition, results from three other <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>tests,</b> the piezocone cone penetration test, the flat dilatometer test, and the self boring pressuremeter test provided useful verification of these correlations.

Opalinus clay is a stiff, strongly bedded, Mesozoic clay of marine origin. When subjected to thermal loading, saturated stiff clays exhibit a strong pore pressure response that significantly affects the hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of the material. The observations gathered in the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>test</b> have provided an opportunity to examine the integrated thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) response of this sedimentary clay. Coupled THM numerical analyses {{have been carried out}} to provide a structured framework for interpretation, and to enhance understanding of THM clay behaviour. Numerical analyses have been based on a coupled theoretical formulation that incorporates a constitutive law especially developed for this type of material. The law includes degradation of bonding by damage. By performing three-dimensional computations, it has been possible to incorporate anisotropy of material parameters and of in situ stresses. The 3 D simulation has proved able to furnish a satisfactory representation of the development of the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>test</b> and of the main observed patterns of behaviour. A sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to examine the potential effect of various key or uncertain parameters.

40|$|Currently, {{can be seen}} a {{new trend}} in {{engineering}} geological survey, where laboratory analysis are replaced by <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>testing</b> methods, which are more efficient and cost effective, and time saving too. A regular engineering geological survey cannot be provided by simple core drillings, macroscopic description (sometimes very subjective), and then geotechnical parameters are established based on indicative standardized values or archive values from previous geotechnical standards. The engineering geological survey is trustworthy if is composed of laboratory and in-situ testing supplemented by indirect methods of testing, [1]. The prevalence of rotary core drilling for obtaining laboratory soil samples from various depths (every 1 to 3 m), cannot be a more enhanced as continues evaluation of strata and properties e. g. by CPT Piezocone (every 1 cm). Core drillings survey generally uses small amounts of soil samples, but this is resulting to a lower representation of the subsoil and underestimation of parameters.
