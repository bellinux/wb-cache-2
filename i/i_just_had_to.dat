Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. I was very happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E

Jane Austen was my destiny. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> overcome the cultural barrier."Because Thompson and Doran had worked on the screenplay for so long, Lee described himself at the time as a [...] "director for hire", as he was unsure of his role and position.

500|$|While still {{performing}} as the vocalist of Icelandic alternative rock group the Sugarcubes, Björk approached both Ásmundur Jónsson of Bad Taste and producer Derek Birkett of One Little Indian Records with a demo cassette {{of her own}} songs on which she had been working. These demos included versions of songs that would appear on Debut, including [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] and [...] "Aeroplane". After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, she moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked {{on the details of}} what would become Debut. Björk has admitted that The Sugarcube's music was not her taste, and that her contact with London's underground club culture of the late 1980s/early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity. She said: [...] "...as a music nerd, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> follow my heart, and my heart was those beats that were happening in England. And maybe what I'm understanding more and more as I get older, is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me. Brian Eno. Acid. Electronic beats. Labels like Warp." ...|$|E
500|$|Explaining that {{he wrote}} it as per his whim, and not {{according}} {{to the need to}} have more philosophy or love or war, Tripathi was sure that The Oath of the Vayuputras would have a tragic ending. During an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Tripathi explained that he had purposefully used the modern terms for the different historical locations described in the book, including calling India by its name, rather than its ancient name, Jambudweep. He did not believe that India could be represented as a political concept in his book, since at the timeline followed in the Shiva trilogy, India was still a cultural concept. Since some of the characters have their mythological names, but do not follow the characteristic traits, Tripathi believed that such development was spontaneous and did not question his writing further. Giving an example, the author said: [...] "When I was writing the first book, I was struggling with the Naga, because I wanted to desperately change his character – that he should be jovial and happy. But he kept ending up as a tormented and troubled a guy who was suffering. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> surrender" ...|$|E

500|$|Root came {{to realise}} {{that while the}} novel's {{narrative}} style allowed Anne's thoughts to come through, the film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue.

I couldn't even think about technique, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep looking at the [...] and then somehow radiate the feelings". Persuasion was shot in chronological order, which allowed Root to see [...] "what a difference [...] sense of unhappiness can create", as {{by the end of}} the film Anne is [...] "happier and looks better". Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth. The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds, who depicted Frederick Wentworth, commented that Austen [...] "understands a man's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes". He also appreciated that, though Wentworth was a [...] "competent leader of men in his profession", he was [...] "socially inept" [...] in Anne's presence. Susan Fleetwood, the actress who played Lady Russell, had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia. She died soon after filming; Persuasion was her last film role.|$|E

My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying.
