2500|$|A tribute of 3,000 gold pieces {{each year}} must have proven {{too much for}} the {{revenues}} of the Empire, because either John or David approached their relative by marriage Uzun Hasan about transferring the allegiance of Trebizond from the Ottomans to him. Uzun Hasan agreed to this, and sent envoys to Mehmed II. However, these envoys not only asked for the tribute to be transferred to the Aq Qoyunlu, they demanded on behalf of their master that Mehmed resume payment of tribute Mehmed's grandfather was said to have sent to the Aq Qoyunlu. The sources disagree on exactly how Mehmed II answered, but both versions were ominous. In one version, he told the envoys [...] "that it would not be long before they learned what they ought to expect from him." [...] In the other, Mehmed's response was, [...] "Go in peace, and next year <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> these things with me, and I will clear up the debt." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} Rabbi Simai deduced from the {{similarity}} of the phrases [...] "And I {{will take you to}} me for a people" [...] and [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> you in to the land" [...] in [...] that the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt occurred under circumstances similar to their entry into the Land of Israel. Rabbi Simai thus deduced that just as only two out of 600,000 (Caleb and Joshua) entered the Promised Land, so only two out of every 600,000 Israelites in Egypt participated in the Exodus, and the rest died in Egypt. Rava taught that it will also be so when the Messiah comes that {{only a small portion of}} Jews will find redemption, for [...] says, [...] "And she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the days when she came up out of the land of Egypt," [...] implying that circumstances upon the coming of the Messiah will be similar to those upon the Israelites' entry into the Land of Israel.|$|E
