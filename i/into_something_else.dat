[...] "Their biggest fear, and why {{it was kind of}} a stepchild project, [...] they were afraid of their core {{audience}} hating the film and not coming." [...] To convey Burton's' involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that,"...it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> which I'm not quite sure about." [...] The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, and was given a limited release on October 15, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29.|$|E
500|$|During the mid 1960s, {{pop music}} made {{repeated}} forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word [...] "progressive" [...] was frequently used, {{and it was}} thought that every song and single was to be a [...] "progression" [...] from the last. The Beatles' Paul McCartney intimated in 1967: [...] "we [...] got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, so we tried to get <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Then came [...] Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys.... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing." [...] Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. The Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson is credited for setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{intended}} to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, [...] "Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E

The heterogenous learning capacity is crucial because even if the innovation problem is framed as a commons scenario, the performance differences that actors will exhibit in the medium- or long-run will be a direct function of their capabilities.

500|$|In 1966, {{the level}} of social and artistic {{correspondence}} among British and American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Byrds who fused elements of cultivated music with the vernacular traditions of rock. Progressive rock was predicated on the [...] "progressive" [...] pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. The Beatles' Paul McCartney said in 1967: [...] "we [...] got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, so {{we tried to get}} <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Then came Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys. ... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing." [...] Rock music started to take itself seriously, paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as swing gave way to bop, a move which did not succeed with audiences). In this period, the popular song began signalling a new possible means of expression that went beyond the three-minute love song, leading to an intersection between the [...] "underground" [...] and the [...] "establishment" [...] for listening publics.|$|E
500|$|The film's story {{originated}} from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind {{over a period}} of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only [...] "a feeling" [...] and the title Blue Velvet, Lynch told Cineaste in 1987. The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. [...] "I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else...</b> The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect," [...] Lynch remarked in an interview. The third idea was Bobby Vinton's classic rendition of the song Blue Velvet and [...] "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time." [...] Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that [...] "there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Home and Away {{producers}} {{introduced a}} storyline that saw Charlie begin {{a relationship with}} another woman. Producers hoped the plot would boost the shows ratings. Over five weeks, the storyline would see Charlie realise that her friendship with Joey Collins (played by Kate Bell) is beginning to develop <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> As they fall for each other, Charlie and Joey share intimate kissing and dance scenes. Anderson explained that the producers came to her about the storyline {{and asked if she}} was okay with it, as it was to be emotional and it required commitment. Anderson told them that she was okay with it and she said she was pleased to be given the storyline as it showed more of Charlie's vulnerable side. This was Anderson's first big storyline in the show and she was required to work more hours. Anderson explained that she and Bell formed a trust early on, which helped them to portray the story in the right light. Anderson spoke with gay friends, so she could form an accurate portrayal of her character's feelings. The storyline [...] "throws [...] world upside down" [...] and changes her whole identity; it surprises her.|$|E

These shifters literally shed their skins to assume new identities, although the original Alpha Shapeshifter can change appearance far more quickly, and can take on the memories of the person whose appearance they assume. Like the Alpha Shapeshifter, some shapeshifters have the ability to instantaneously transform into a different person. Their eyes show a retinal flare on cameras and they have a crippling weakness to silver. The series also features [...] "the trickster", who often changes form to trick the main protagonists <b>into</b> hunting down <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{discussion}} {{around the}} impact of information communication technologies in human social interaction has been the centre of many studies and discussions. From 1960 until 1990, researchers, academics, business writers, and futurist novelists have tried to anticipate {{the impact of}} these technologies in society, in particular, in cities and urban centres (Graham, 2004). The views during these three decades, although different in many aspects, share in common a deterministic view of the impact of ICT on cities and urban centres. They all see ICT influence as a dooming factor to the existence of cities. These authors have often seen ICT as a leading factor in the disappearance of urban centres and/or cities (Graham; Marvin, 1997; Negroponte, 1995). According to Graham, these views tend to portray ICT impact without taking into consideration the fact that old technologies are not always replaced by newer ones; they can also superimpose and combine <b>into</b> to <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> These views also have generally assumed that the impact of ICT would be the same in all places and have not accounted for geographic differences that could affect the use of information communication technologies...|$|R
500|$|When [...] "talkies" [...] {{began to}} gain {{momentum}} in the film industry, the Hollywood studios recruited the best talent from Broadway to make musical films. These films included Broadway Melody, which was promoted as the first [...] "all singing, all talking, all dancing" [...] film and had music by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, and Berkley's 42nd Street, his first major success. These films established the backstage musical, a subgenre in which the plot revolves around a stage show and {{the people involved in}} putting on the show. These first musicals set the standard for the genre, placing their musical numbers either {{within the context of a}} stage performance or tacked on and gratuitous, without furthering the story or developing the characters. Donen stated that he disliked them and that his own films were [...] "a reaction against those backstage musicals." [...] Donen credits producer Freed as the driving force behind the transition, adding that Freed [...] "had some sort of instinct to change the musical from a backstage world <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> He didn't quite know what to change it into, just that it had to change." [...] Kelly stated that Donen was the only person he knew that understood how musicals could progress and better suit the film medium.|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all {{fans were}} {{happy with the}} {{direction}} the Fallout series was taken in since its acquisition by Bethesda Softworks. Notorious for their support of the series' first two games, Fallout and Fallout 2, members centered {{around one of the}} oldest Fallout fansites, No Mutants Allowed, have criticized departures from the original games' stories, gameplay mechanics and setting. Criticisms include the prevalence of unspoiled food after 200 years, the survival of wood-framed dwellings following a nuclear blast, and the ubiquity of Super Mutants at early levels in the game. Also criticized are the quality of the game's writing, its level of verisimilitude, the switch to a first-person action game format, and the level of reactiveness of the surrounding game world to player actions. In response, Jim Sterling of Destructoid has called fan groups like No Mutants Allowed [...] "selfish" [...] and [...] "arrogant"; stating that a new audience deserves a chance to play a Fallout game; and that if the series had stayed the way it was back in 1997, new titles would never have been made and brought to market. Luke Winkie of Kotaku tempers these sentiments, saying that {{it is a matter of}} ownership; and that in the case of Fallout 3, hardcore fans of the original series witnessed their favorite games become transformed <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

50|$|It is {{difficult}} for children to regulate their emotions. This is why whenever a child needs or wants something they often cry or throw temper tantrums until they get it. As children get older the frequency and intensity of these outbursts decline. When children learn to talk {{it gives them a}} different way to regulate their emotions. The child can now talk about what is bothering him instead of only being able to communicate through expressions or actions. Being able to talk about emotional issues may also {{have a major impact on}} the relationship between child and parent. And as children mature they begin to argue instead of using physical violence, wait rather than wail, and contain their emotions instead of exploding <b>into</b> emotional rage. <b>Something</b> <b>else</b> that factors <b>into</b> this is the development of mobility, because along with walking comes the child's ability to satisfy some of his own desires without parental involvement. This acquired autonomy also lessens the child's need for an intense signaling system.|$|R
5000|$|Takahashi {{had always}} been {{interested}} in games, claiming to have been obsessed as a kid and is still interested in them as an adult. In a game, he considered the player to become a hero. He decided to base the Yu-Gi-Oh! series around such games and used this idea as the premise; Yugi was a weak childish boy, who became a hero when he played games. With friendship being one of the major themes of Yu-Gi-Oh!, he based the names of the two major characters [...] "Yūgi" [...] and [...] "Jōnouchi" [...] on the word yūjō (友情), which means [...] "friendship". Henshin, the ability to turn <b>into</b> <b>something</b> or someone <b>else,</b> is <b>something</b> Takahashi believed all children dreamed of.

500|$|This [...] "new way" [...] {{of telling}} a story in Finnegans Wake {{takes the form of}} a {{discontinuous}} dream-narrative, with abrupt changes to characters, character names, locations and plot details resulting in the absence of a discernible linear narrative, causing Herring to argue that the plot of Finnegans Wake [...] "is unstable in that there is no one plot from beginning to end, but rather many recognizable stories and plot types with familiar and unfamiliar twists, told from varying perspectives." [...] Patrick A. McCarthy expands on this idea of a non-linear, digressive narrative with the contention that [...] "throughout much of Finnegans Wake, what appears to be an attempt to tell a story is often diverted, interrupted, or reshaped <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> for example a commentary on a narrative with conflicting or unverifiable details." [...] In other words, while crucial plot points – such as HCE's crime or ALP's letter – are endlessly discussed, the reader never encounters or experiences them first hand, and as the details are constantly changing, they remain unknown and perhaps unknowable. Suzette Henke has accordingly described Finnegans Wake as an aporia. Joyce himself tacitly acknowledged this radically different approach to language and plot in a 1926 letter to Harriet Weaver, outlining his intentions for the book: [...] "One great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutanddry grammar and goahead plot." [...] Critics have seen a precedent for the book's plot presentation in Laurence Sterne's famously digressive The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, with Thomas Keymer stating that [...] "Tristram Shandy was a natural touchstone for James Joyce as he explained his attempt [...] "to build many planes of narrative with a single esthetic purpose" [...] in Finnegans Wake".|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
