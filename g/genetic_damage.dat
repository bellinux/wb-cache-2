40|$|SUMMARY: Determination {{has been}} made by the {{technique}} of abortive trans-duction of the functional relationships of over 200 Salmonella typhimurium histidine mutant alleles. The results are compared with those obtained by genetic recombina-tion (Hartman, Loper & german, 1960) and enzyme studies (Ames, Garry & Her-zenberg, 1960). The results indicate that abortive transduction tests can be used to position rapidly sites of mutation on a chromosome map within the region of a single gene. The tests for genetic complementation reveal that some genes behave as single functional units, while other genes are composed of two, and some of four, functional subunits (complementation units). The existence of mutants with overlapping, intra-genic non-complementing patterns may allow crude mapping, solely by complementa-tion, of some mutational sites within certain single genes. In gene D, the ordering of mutational sites by this technique so far conforms with that obtained by the more classic methods of map construction based on inferences derived from recom-bination analyses. Data are presented bearing on the individuality of the gene and the effect of mutation thereon. It is concluded that some <b>genetic</b> <b>damages,</b> localize...|$|R

A mutation in a haploid individual, on the other hand, is more likely to become resident, as the DNA repair machinery has no way of knowing what the original undamaged sequence was. The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.|$|E

Perhaps the most important research undertaken by the ABCC was the genetics study, which focused its study on the uncertainties surrounding the possible long-term effects of ionizing radiation in pregnant women and their unborn children. The study did not find evidence of widespread <b>genetic</b> <b>damage.</b> It did, however, find increased incidence of microcephaly and mental retardation in children most proximally exposed in utero to the bombs' radiation.

25|$|Though {{the idea}} is controversial, some {{evidence}} suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome dysfunction. In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity. Also, naked mole rats, rodents {{about the size of}} mice, live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules. Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a 'Vicious Cycle'); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the cytosol. A decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic efficiency. However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the 'Vicious Cycle' hypothesis. Supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial DNA, some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial DNA and the longevity of species. Extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat aging. Presently, gene therapy and nutraceutical supplementation are popular areas of ongoing research. Bjelakovic et al. analyzed the results of 78 studies between 1977 and 2012, involving a total of 296,707 participants, and concluded that antioxidant supplements do not reduce all-cause mortality nor extend lifespan, while some of them, such as beta carotene, vitamin E, and higher doses of vitamin A, may actually increase mortality.|$|E

40|$|Almost all {{mammalian}} cells carry one primary cilium that {{functions as}} a biosensor for chemical and mechanical stimuli. <b>Genetic</b> <b>damages</b> that compromise cilia formation or function cause a spectrum of disorders referred to as ciliapathies. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} some pharmacological agents and extracellular environmental changes can alter primary cilium length. Renal injury is a well-known example of an environmental insult that triggers cilia length modification. Lithium treatment causes primary cilia to extend in several cell types including neuronal cells;this phenomenon is likely independent of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β inhibition. In renal epithelial cell lines, deflection of the primary cilia by fluid shear shortens them by reducing the intracellular cyclic AMP level, leading to a subsequent decrease in mechanosensitivity to fluid shear. Primary cilium length is also influenced by the dynamics of actin filaments and microtubules through the levels of soluble tubulin in the cytosol available for primary cilia extension. Thus, mammalian cells can adapt to the extracellular environment by modulating the primary cilium length, and this feedback system utilizing primary cilia might exist throughout the mammalian body. Further investigation is required concerning the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the control of primary cilium length in response to environmental factors...|$|R

2500|$|Carbon {{tetrachloride}} [...] is {{an example}} of a probable nongenotoxic carcinogen to aquatic vertebrates. Historically, carbon tetrachloride has been used in pharmaceutical production, petroleum refining, and as an industrial solvent. Due to its widespread industrial use and release into the environment, carbon tetrachloride has been found in drinking water and therefore, has become a concern for aquatic organisms. Because of its high hepatotoxic properties, carbon tetrachloride could potentially be linked to liver cancer. Experimental cancer studies have shown that carbon tetrachloride may cause benign and malignant liver tumors to rainbow trout. carbon tetrachloride works as a nongenotoxic carcinogen by formulating free radicals which induce oxidative stress. It has been proposed that once carbon tetrachloride enters the organism, it is metabolized to trichloromethyl and trichloromethyl peroxy radicals by the CYP2E1 enzyme. The more reactive radical, trichloromethyl peroxy, can attack polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cellular membrane to form fatty acid free radicals and initiate lipid peroxidation. The attack on the cellular membrane increases its permeability, causing a leakage of enzymes and disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis. This loss of calcium homeostasis activates calcium dependent degradative enzymes and cytotoxicity, causing hepatic damage. The regenerative and proliferative changes that occur in the liver during this time could increase the frequency of <b>genetic</b> <b>damage,</b> resulting in a possible increase of cancer.|$|E

The series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. particle deposition, impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments. Therefore, the observations of cancer in animals were considered, by IARC, as relevant to people doing jobs with exposures to titanium dioxide dust. For example, titanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations during packing, milling, site cleaning and maintenance, if there are insufficient dust control measures in place. However, the human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer. The safety of the use of nano-particle sized titanium dioxide, which can penetrate the body and reach internal organs, has been criticized. Studies have also found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles cause inflammatory response and <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> in mice. The mechanism by which [...] may cause cancer is unclear.

Whole-chromosome aneuploidy (as opposed to breakage-derived aneuploidy) might come about secondarily from crossover depression, or could follow damage to the meiotic spindle or to kinetochores. For simplicity, the event-by whichever of the mechanisms- is referred to as meiotic nondisjunction (ND). A genetic method has been devised which is based on the facts that ND involving the sex chromosomes produces mostly viable mice, and that such exceptional animals can be externally recognized by the use of appropriate markers. The method is compared with the following other ND indicators: univalent and/or chiasma frequencies at M I; number of dyads at M II; extra sex chromosomes in spermatids; karyotypes in cleavage, morula, or blastocyst metaphases; and chromosome constitution of mid-gestation embryos. Some of the cytological endpoints are found to be unreliable. Various biological variables (germ-cell stage, sex, age) are examined with a view toward maximizing the chances for detecting induced nondisjunction. While experimental evidence on this question is equivocal, a consideration of the probable ND mechanisms suggests that the early spermatocyte (in stages including the premeiotic S phase) may be a favorable test object.
