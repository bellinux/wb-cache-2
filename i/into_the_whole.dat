5|$|When the {{initiating}} computer {{sends the}} complete instructions, or job, for processing to the controller, the controller splits the task up into these small instruction packets, known as tasks. The {{design of the}} Xgrid system consists of these small packets being transferred to all the Xgrid-enabled computers on the network. These computers, or nodes, execute the instructions provided by the controller and then return the results. The controller assembles the individual task results <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> job results and returns them to the initiating computer.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E

25|$|Peer {{mentoring}} {{takes place}} in learning environments such as schools, usually between an older more experienced student and a new student. Peer mentors appear mainly in secondary schools where students moving up from primary schools may need assistance in settling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life. Peer mentoring is also used in the workplace {{as a means of}} orienting new employees.

25|$|During the 1830s and 1840s the British Museum {{had been}} {{extensively}} re-built to designs approved by trustees and {{built by the}} architect, Sir Robert Smirke. However, as work progressed it became evident that public interest in the museum's collections and library could not be adequately accommodated within the designs that had been approved. A Royal Commission was appointed in 1848 to look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> question, and various schemes to convert the open inner courtyard into exhibition space were submitted during 1849, including one by Hosking for a circular gallery modeled on the Pantheon in Rome.|$|E

25|$|Jews {{from both}} the Islamic world and Byzantium {{are known to have}} {{migrated}} to Khazaria during periods of persecution under Heraclius, Justinian II, Leo III, and Romanus Lakapēnos. For Simon Schama, Jewish communities from the Balkans and the Bosphoran Crimea, especially from Panticapaeum, began migrating to the more hospitable climate of pagan Khazaria in the wake of these persecutions, and were joined there by Jewish refugees from Armenia. The Geniza fragments, he argues, make it clear the Judaising reforms sent roots down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the population. The pattern is one of an elite conversion preceding large-scale adoption of the new religion by the general population, which often resisted the imposition. One important condition for mass conversion was a settled urban state, where churches, synagogues or mosques provided a focus for religion, as opposed to the free nomadic lifestyle of life on the open steppes. A tradition of the Iranian Judeo-Tats claims that their ancestors were responsible for the Khazar conversion. A legend traceable to the 16th-century Italian rabbi Judah Moscato attributed it to Yitzhak ha-Sangari.|$|E
25|$|Male territories {{occur in}} light {{gaps in the}} forest, {{including}} treefalls and trails, and are almost nonexistent in areas of uninterrupted forest. Approximately half of these territories are solitary, of which males tend to be attracted to treefalls which have more potential territory sites. Each territory usually consists of a perch on {{the trunk of a}} tree about 0.5 to 1.5 m above the ground, on which the male is displayed, and a route which the male “patrols” to and from the perch. Perches are normally located on tree trunks located on the edge of treefalls. Patrol routes normally extend out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> open treefall space. However, it has been noted that territories don’t contain flowering plants, sources from which to collect aromatic material (such as tree wounds), nest sites, or nest-building materials. Males also had a preference for use straight, smooth-barked trees about 5 to 10cm in diameter, with an unobstructed view from the perch site. Studies have also shown that perches for E. imperialis were almost always in the shade receiving between 27.8 and 92.9 lux on sunny days and 14.8 to 46.4 lux on overcast days.|$|E
25|$|Golden {{is part of}} {{the network}} of the Regional Transportation District which {{provides}} bus and light rail service throughout the Denver metropolitan area. Its bus routes 16, GS, and SkyRide F (once a day) connect Golden with other points of the Denver metropolitan area and Boulder. The West Corridor (W line) of the FasTracks light rail line, which parallels 6th Avenue into Golden to its terminal at the Jefferson County Government Center, opened to the public April 26, 2013. This is a modern version of the historic trolley line that Golden interests spearheaded in the 1890s. At the same time the W Line opened, a Community Call-n-Ride bus launched in Golden offering flexible service along with regular stops within the city itself. The new bus system was designed to complement the light rail, extending the transit service <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> community, including the downtown corridor. Although passengers are no longer served by heavy rail, Golden continues to be served by railroad transportation for cargo, and has been continuously since 1870. These lines are owned by the BNSF railroad and serve business interests in the northeastern end of the city. Within the Coors Brewery grounds it becomes the brewery's own in-house railroad.|$|E

While {{the rest of the world}} followed feudalistic warrior development during the medieval period throughout Europe and Asia, Tibet uniquely established Lamaism. This was centered around a Buddhist social revolution originating distinctly from India's Hinduism and finding root in Tibet. The Lama (teacher) is a living Buddha for Tibetans who provides a powerful bridge between real and imaginary consciousness worlds, where the self is methodically dissolved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole's</b> benefit by tantra practice.|$|R

She made her first appearance in the season seven opener, [...] "Image in the Sand", for which she was required for only half a day, as she was in only one scene. [...] "I came in and I had one line — that's it, I hadn't even moved to L.A. yet and I hadn't found a place to live." [...] She began {{to understand what was}} required of her from her second episode onwards. She later explained that [...] "I never really got too freaked in the beginning.

He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd like to be in that Spanish market. I got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> reggaeton thing when it came out, so I always wanted to get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol.

The review described [...] "Piper Maru" [...] as featuring [...] "a tough and sentimental Scully", noting that [...] "action-packed detective work by Mulder enhance an already crackling scenario." [...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode eight out of ten, and complimented the introduction of the black oil, writing [...] "this episode is a good introduction to the black oil virus, providing a bridge from the mythology elements earlier in the season to the larger scope of the conspiracy to be revealed."

500|$|In {{his review}} for TV Squad, writer Richard Keller gave the episode a mixed to {{positive}} review, calling the installment [...] "pretty unique", {{but that it}} also had its flaws.

He also enjoyed the [...] "fleshing out" [...] of Gus's character, that [...] "we now see Gus as quite the brainiac" [...] and [...] "rather than saying nothing but 'No, Shawn'... Gus actually contributes quite a bit to this episode". However, Keller also criticized parts of the episode, saying that he disliked the [...] "whole fake psychic concept". Keller also criticized Timothy Omundson's character Carlton Lassiter, saying [...] "he just doesn't fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> show", and [...] "Omundson's makes Lassiter look like a cartoon character". In a comment for TV Guide, the show was called [...] "a diamond in the rough", and writer Matt Roush called star James Roday [...] "a delight". The episode was included in Yahoo!

Reviewer Tucker Cummings said that [...] "the wordplay in this episode great" [...] and that [...] "it gives you a great insight into how Gus and Shawn's friendship has functioned (or dysfunctioned) over the years". In addition, she said that the episode's murder-mystery plot [...] "is actually really engrossing" [...] when compared to later episodes of the show.|$|E
