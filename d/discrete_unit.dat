5|$|The main or primary bronchi {{enter the}} lungs at the hilum and {{initially}} branch into secondary bronchi {{also known as}} lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and arterial supply. Segments for {{the left and right}} lung are shown in the table. The segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs. A segment is a <b>discrete</b> <b>unit</b> that can be surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each <b>discrete</b> <b>unit</b> of text.|$|E
25|$|In 1812, {{the best}} French and Italian units from the French Army of Italy were {{assigned}} to the IV Corps for the French invasion of Russia. The troops fought well under the command of Eugène de Beauharnais but only about 3,000 soldiers survived the campaign. To rebuild his army in Germany for the 1813 campaign, Emperor Napoleon transferred four more divisions from the garrison of Italy to join the newly established IV and XII Corps. The emperor then gave his stepson Eugène permission to organize a new army out of French and Italian draftees to defend the Kingdom of Italy. By May 1813, the new army began forming around the French 46th, 47th, and 48th Divisions, the Italian 49th Division, and one cavalry division. In fact, only 13,000 French conscripts joined the army and the so-called French divisions were largely recruited from areas of Italy that had been annexed by France. Since military equipment was scarce, some soldiers were sent to the front dressed in police uniforms. Nevertheless, the army continued to expand and Eugène eventually renumbered his divisions 1 through 6, with the Italian Royal Guard kept as a <b>discrete</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

2500|$|As {{represented}} {{within the}} greater Yasna liturgy, the Yasna Haptanghaiti are placed (and recited) {{between the first}} and second Gathas. Unlike the Gathas however, which are in verse, the Yasna Haptanghaiti is in prose. Analysis of the texts suggests that the hymns of the Yasna Haptanghaiti were composed as a <b>discrete</b> <b>unit.</b> The last verse of the last chapter suggests that the seven chapters represent the historical Yasna liturgy, around which the other chapters of the present-day Yasna were later organized. In that verse (41.6), the Yasna Haptanghaiti is personified as [...] "the brave Yasna" [...] and [...] "the holy, the ritual chief." ...|$|E
2500|$|The word quantum {{derives from}} the Latin, meaning [...] "how great" [...] or [...] "how much". In quantum mechanics, it refers to a <b>discrete</b> <b>unit</b> {{assigned}} to certain physical quantities such as the energy of an atom at rest (see Figure 1). The discovery that particles are discrete packets of energy with wave-like properties led to the branch of physics dealing with atomic and subatomic systems which is today called quantum mechanics. It underlies the mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry, including condensed matter physics, solid-state physics, atomic physics, molecular physics, computational physics, computational chemistry, quantum chemistry, particle physics, nuclear chemistry, and nuclear physics. Some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied.|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of measurement and {{units of measurement}} is important in mathematics and science. However, children in the United States perform very poorly on measurement items on standardized mathematics tests compared to students in other countries. We examine {{understanding of}} linear measurement and units of measurement in 2 nd grade students and carry out a training study aimed at improving their understanding, drawing on research showing that structural alignment is important in promoting learning. We find that students do not improve when training consists of measuring items aligned with a ruler, either when <b>discrete</b> <b>units</b> are coordinated with this activity by overlaying them on the ruler or when students engage in aligned ruler measurement and measurement with <b>discrete</b> <b>units</b> separately. However, we do find significant improvement when children measure objects that are misaligned and then aligned with {{the start of the}} ruler and <b>discrete</b> <b>units</b> are coordinated with ruler use...|$|R
2500|$|Stieglitz {{arranged}} the photographs he called Equivalent into several different groups when he exhibited or published them, and often he inscribed the mounted prints {{on the back}} {{with one or more}} letters to further identify what he called [...] "sets". These groupings are not sequential, and Stieglitz did not consider any single series or set as a <b>discrete</b> <b>unit.</b> Some of the individual prints are included in more than one series or set, and some copies of the same print are inscribed with different identifications. In general, his sets should be seen as [...] "totally artificial constructions which mirror, not the passage of real time, but the change and flux of Stieglitz’s subjective state." ...|$|E

During World War I, he was the lieutenant colonel commanding the Irish Rangers regiment. Trihey resigned his commission and returned to Montreal in 1917 after the British army reversed its earlier promise to send the Rangers into battle as a <b>discrete</b> <b>unit,</b> instead choosing to plug them into the front line as reinforcements, and in the wake of unrest over the Easter Rising in Ireland in 1916. Later in life, he was a partner in the law firm of Plimsoll and Coonan from the 1920s to 1932, and served as a Port Commissioner of the Montreal Harbor Commission.|$|E
