Access to the global markets was facilitated by the Japanese companies and by the American importers, who wanted a direct relationship with the Taiwanese brands. No big multinational corporations were created (like in Singapore), or huge national conglomerates (like South Korean chaebols), but some industrial groups, {{with the support of}} the government, grew, and became in the 90's huge companies totally internationalized.|$|E
25|$|Markets {{of varying}} types can spontaneously arise {{whenever}} a party has {{interest in a}} good or service that some other party can provide. Hence {{there can be a}} market for cigarettes in correctional facilities, another for chewing gum in a playground, and yet another for contracts for the future delivery of a commodity. There can be black markets, where a good is exchanged illegally, for example markets for goods under a command economy despite pressure to repress them, and virtual markets, such as eBay, in which buyers and sellers do not physically interact during negotiation. A market can be organized as an auction, as a private <b>electronic</b> <b>market,</b> as a commodity wholesale market, as a shopping center, as a complex institution such as a stock market, and as an informal discussion between two individuals.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>markets</b> {{have been}} a {{prominent}} topic of research for the past decade. Moreover, {{we have seen the}} rise but also the disappearance of many electronic marketplaces in practice. Today, <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> are a firm component of inter-organisational exchanges and can be observed in many branches. The Research Symposium on Emerging <b>Electronic</b> <b>Markets</b> is an annual conference bringing together researchers working on various topics concerning <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> in research and practice. The focus theme of the 13 th Research Symposium on Emerging <b>Electronic</b> <b>Markets</b> (RSEEM 2006) was ?Evolution in <b>Electronic</b> <b>Markets?.</b> Looking back at more than 10 years of research activities in <b>electronic</b> <b>markets,</b> the evolution can be well observed. While electronic commerce activities were based largely on catalogue-based shopping, there are now many examples that go beyond pure catalogues. For example, dynamic and flexible electronic transactions such as electronic negotiations and electronic auctions are enabled. Negotiations and auctions are the basis for inter-organisational trade exchanges about services as well as products. Mass customisation opens up new opportunities for <b>electronic</b> <b>markets.</b> Multichannel <b>electronic</b> commerce represents today?s various requirements posed on information and communication technology as well as on organisational structures. In recent years, service-oriented architectures of <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> have enabled ICT infrastructures for supporting flexible e-commerce and e-market solutions. RSEEM 2006 was held at the University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany in September 2006. The proceedings show a variety of approaches and include the selected 8 research papers. The contributions cover the focus theme through conceptual models and systems design, application scenarios as well as evaluation research approaches...|$|R
30|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>markets</b> {{are often}} {{discussed}} {{in terms of}} their transformation power and can be considered a convergence of the market towards a perfect market [13]. With respect to higher accessibility, lower entry barriers, and their ubiquity, <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> carry a high advantage over traditional markets [31]. Given their higher transparency, <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> are usually attributed an improved allocation coordination [31]. These advancements give <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> an advantage over traditional forms of market organization. Especially transaction cost theory asserts that by implementing an electronic infrastructure the transaction costs become negligible, improving the competition and almost completing the conversion towards a perfect market [34].|$|R

40|$|This article asks which {{institutional}} structure {{is required for}} <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> to emerge. It proposes {{the adoption of a}} rather narrow concept of <b>electronic</b> <b>markets,</b> one which requires that <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> support the negotiation phase of a business process in order to identify those preconditions that are specific to <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> as compared to other interorganisational systems. A theoretical framework is elaborated which distinguishes between the institutional regime shaping market participants' transaction behaviour, a set of meta-activities which establish and maintain the institutional regime, and, a generative regime, which is the group of actors performing or promoting meta-activities. All three components constitute the notion of non-market preconditions of <b>market</b> systems, whether <b>electronic</b> or conventional. This theoretical concept is then used to identify the specific non-market preconditions of <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> {{in each of the three}} distinct categories. In the c [...] ...|$|R

An intensity that makes the teaching of <b>electronic</b> <b>marketing</b> somewhat challenging and specific when compared with other disciplines.

However, this carries risks and further challenges, resulting from difficulties in obtaining positive results whenever learning is supported by e-learning platforms.
