The river basin, or watershed, was discretized with a square grid, where each square carried morphological data about {{a portion of}} the watershed, the vegetation, the soil composition, the <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>layer,</b> and the like. The effect of weather stations was defined by Thiessen polygons, including correction for altitude. The hydrological model was continuous, with a one-day time step. It was partitioned into three reservoirs: vegetation, snow and soil. The snow reservoir was defined using the degree-day and temperature index methods.

40|$|For the {{implementation}} of the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD), technological and scientific support are required. This paper presents a methodology to support a first step of {{the implementation}} of WFD, which is the delineation of groundwater bodies. The methodology consists of (1) the development of a complete and generally-accepted hydrogeological classification system for Flanders, named the HCOV code, (2) the development of a geographic information systems (GIS) -managed borehole database, and (3) the development of aquifer and aquitard models by means of a solid modeling approach. For each unit of the hydrogeological classification code for Flanders unit, GIS maps are generated for the three basic characteristics of hydrogeological layers: extent, base level and thickness, such that combined, the volume and extent of a <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>layer</b> is unambiguously defined.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is the {{comparison}} of input options of river boundary condition of MODFLOW - three-dimensional numerical simulation model of groundwater flow. The water level in stream flowing through territory of <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>layer</b> can be computed via three built-in modules: River, Stream and Streamflow-Routing. In this study the code MODFLOW is used to simulate idealized aquifer and stream. The differences between computed groundwater table showed to be minimal, thus in case of modules Stream and Streamflow- Routing they are equally usable as using module River with external one or two-dimensional simulation of surface water flow, which is more time-consuming process. However, this applies only to idealized, simplified conditions of the modeled environment. For more complex simulation of flow in streams with irregular structure of the streambed is necessary to use either an external simulation or use the Streamflow-Routing module, which includes the possibility to enter more complex hydraulic flow parameters in the model...|$|E

40|$|Uncertainty {{quantification}} is {{very much}} needed to support decision making related to e. g. environmental impact assessment for waste disposal sites. A probabilistic result provides a much stronger basis for decision making compared to a single deterministic outcome. Accurate posterior exploration of high-dimensional and CPU-intensive models, which are often used for environmental impact assessment, is however a challenging task. To quantify the uncertainty associated with solute transport {{in the framework of}} a near surface radioactive waste disposal in Mol/Dessel, Belgium, we investigate combining the adaptive Metropolis (AM) McMC algorithm for updating the global model parameters, and adaptive spatial resampling (ASR) for updating of the spatially distributed model parameters, by block sampling. The forward model used is a groundwater flow model conditioned on borehole and direct push data, that accounts for non-stationary heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity. The obtained flow solutions are used for solute transport simulations, and the results are compared with a different groundwater flow model parameterization, that makes use of homogeneous <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>layers.</b> Moreover, a number of simulations is performed to assess the effect of realistic dispersivity, which is derived from outcrop investigations. The obtained results indicate that the combination of AM and ASR using block sampling seems not to be very efficient for McMC sampling with the forward model used in this study. However, using the algorithm in optimization mode seems to work fine, and provides an alternate way for exploring the parameter space and the prediction uncertainty...|$|R
30|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate a new approach for spatiotemporal groundwater monitoring network optimization using hydrogeological modeling to improve monitoring strategies. Unmonitored concentrations were incorporated at different potential monitoring locations into the groundwater monitoring optimization method. The proposed method was applied in the contaminated megasite, Bitterfeld/Wolfen, Germany. Based on an existing 3 -D geological model, 3 -D groundwater flow was obtained from flow velocity simulation using initial and boundary conditions. The 3 -D groundwater transport model was used to simulate transport of α-HCH with an initial ideal concentration of 100  mg/L injected at various <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>layers</b> in the model. Particle tracking for contaminant and groundwater flow velocity realizations were made. The spatial optimization result suggested that 30 out of 462 wells in the Quaternary aquifer (6.49  %) and 14 out of 357 wells in the Tertiary aquifer (3.92  %) were redundant. With a gradual increase in {{the width of the}} particle track path line, from 0 to 100  m, the number of redundant wells remarkably increased, in both aquifers. The results of temporal optimization showed different sampling frequencies for monitoring wells. The groundwater and contaminant flow direction resulting from particle tracks obtained from hydrogeological modeling was verified by the variogram modeling through α-HCH data from 2003 to 2009. Groundwater monitoring strategies can be substantially improved by removing the existing spatio-temporal redundancy as well as incorporating unmonitored network along with sampling at recommended interval of time. However, the use of this model-based method is only recommended in the areas along with site-specific experts’ knowledge.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time a {{comprehensive}} investigation has been carried out to quantify the possible effects of dredging a navigable canal on the hydrogeological system underlying a coastal lagoon. The study is focused on the Venice Lagoon, Italy, where the port authority is planning to open a new 10  m deep and 3  km long canal to connect the city passenger terminal to the central lagoon inlet, thus avoiding the passage of large cruise ships through the historic center of Venice. A modeling study has been developed to evaluate the short (minutes), medium (months), and long (decades) term processes of water and pollutant exchange between the shallow aquifer system and the lagoon, possibly enhanced by the canal excavation, and ship wakes. An in-depth characterization of the lagoon subsurface along the channel has supported the numerical modeling. Piezometer and sea level records, geophysical acquisitions, laboratory analyses of groundwater and sediment samples (chemical analyses and ecotoxicity testing), and the outcome of 3 -D hydrodynamic and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models have been used to set up and calibrate the subsurface multi-model approach. The numerical outcomes allow us to quantify the groundwater volume and estimate the mass of anthropogenic contaminants (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se) likely leaked from the nearby industrial area over the past decades, and released into the lagoon from the canal bed by the action of depression waves generated by ships. Moreover, the model outcomes help to understand the effect of the <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>layering</b> on the propagation of the tidal fluctuation and salt concentration into the shallow brackish aquifers underlying the lagoon bottom...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUntil recently, {{aquifers}} {{located in}} hard rock formations (granite, gneiss, schist) were {{considered as a}} highly heterogeneous media, and no adequate methodology for groundwater management was available. Recent research {{studies have shown that}} when hard rocks are exposed to regional and deep-weathering processes and when the geology is relatively homogenous, a typical hard rock aquifer is made of two main superimposed <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>layers</b> each characterized by quite homogeneous specific hydrodynamic properties: namely the saprolite and the fissured layers. Therefore, for these cases, hard rock aquifers can be considered as a multi-layered system. Based on these works, an operational decision support tool (DST-GW) designed for the management of groundwater resources in hard rock area under variable agro-climatic conditions has been developed. The tool focuses on the impact of changing cropping pattern, artificial recharge and rainfall conditions on groundwater levels at the scale of small watersheds (10 to about 100 km 2 in case well-developed weathering profile). DST-GW is based on the groundwater balance and the ‘water table fluctuation method', which are well-adapted methods in hard rock and semi-arid contexts. Based on field data from an overexploited South Indian watershed (58 km 2), the model allows calibrating, at watershed scale, the variation in specific yield of the aquifer with depth, as well as the rainfall-aquifer recharge relationship. Seasonal basin-scale piezometric levels are computed with an average deviation of ± 0 · 56 m compared to measurements from 2001 to 2005. The model shows that, if no measure is taken, the water table depletion will induce the drying-up of most of the exploited borewells by the year 2012. Scenarios of mitigation measures elaborated with the tool show that change in cropping patterns could rapidly reverse the tendency and lead to a sustainable management of the resource. This work presents the developed tool and particularly the hydraulic model involved in and its application to a case study.

40|$|Direct push (DP) {{technologies}} are typically used for cost-effective geotechnical characterization of unconsolidated soils and sediments. In more recent developments, DP technologies {{have been used}} for efficient hydraulic conductivity (K) characterization along vertical profiles with sampling resolutions of up to a few centimetres. Until date, however, {{only a limited number of}} studies document high-resolution in situ DP data for three-dimensional conceptual hydrogeological model development and groundwater flow model parameterization. This study demonstrates how DP technologies improve building of a conceptual hydrogeological model. We further evaluate the degree to which the DP-derived hydrogeological parameter K, measured across different spatial scales, improves performance of a regional groundwater flow model. The study area covers an area of ~ 60 km² with two overlying, mainly unconsolidated sand, aquifers separated by a 5 - 7 m thick highly heterogeneous clay layer (in north-eastern Belgium). The hydrostratigraphy was obtained from an analysis of cored boreholes and about 265 cone penetration tests (CPTs). The hydrogeological parameter K was derived from a combined analysis of core and CPT data and also from hydraulic direct push tests. A total of 50 three-dimensional realizations of K were generated using a non-stationary multivariate geostatistical approach. To preserve the measured K values in the stochastic realizations, the groundwater model Krealizations were conditioned on the borehole and direct push data. Optimization was performed to select the best performing model parameterization out of the 50 realizations. This model outperformed a previously developed reference model with homogeneous K fields for all <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>layers.</b> Comparison of particle tracking simulations, based either on the optimal heterogeneous or reference homogeneous groundwater model flow fields, demonstrate the impact DP-derived subsurface heterogeneity in K can have on groundwater flow and solute transport.

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} regarding hydrogeological {{models that}} have been proposed for describing active volcanoes results from the difficulty of prospecting deep groundwater bodies. In {{the case of the}} Piton de la Fournaise volcano located in Reunion Island, recent geophysical exploration using deep electromagnetic (EM) prospecting tools has provided new geostructural and hydrogeological information. This paper introduces yet a new hydrogeological model, using a direct modeling approach, which then serves as a numerical tool for testing our most recent geological findings and for consolidating our understanding of the hydraulic behavior of the massif. For this purpose, the 3 D Femwater finite element code has been implemented. The model is built to represent the global structure of the volcano defined by four main volcanic units as <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>layers.</b> While each layer is characterized by an average homogeneous hydraulic property, the boundary conditions correspond to the yearly groundwater recharge spatially distributed into homogeneous recharge zones, and constant head conditions correspond to the sea or rivers which form the edge of the modeled area. The numerical flow simulation provides piezometric heads reaching a height of 1800 m a. s. l. {{in the vicinity of the}} volcano summit. The computed piezometric surface is consistent with the shape of the saturated zone inferred by geophysical soundings, and the model simulated groundwater discharge is consistent with the observed main spring discharge identified within the deepest valleys or along the shoreline. This simulation gives hydraulic confirmation of a continuous aquifer conceptual model. High water levels in active volcanoes are thus not necessarily a result of perched or dike confined aquifers. These results indicate the presence of a central groundwater dome similar to those observed in the Canary or Azores islands, where volcanic terrains are much older. Our model implies potentially new kinds of interactions between groundwater and volcanic activity. In particular, we focus on the importance of water pressure distribution within the volcano. By itself, the three-dimensional groundwater model provides a guide for a better understanding of the structure and the eruptive dynamics of active volcanoes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract: Jurassic and Triassic {{reservoirs}} in the Central North Sea {{are highly}} overpressured (> 40 MPa above hydrostatic pressure). Simulation of {{the interplay between}} rapid Tertiary subsidence, seal permeability and fluid flow allows insight into the geological controls on the distribution and magnitude ofthe overpressure. One-dimensional models demonstrate that, unlike other basins, the overpressure d veloped in the Graben is not determined by the thickness and permeability ofthe shale pressure seal. A two-dimensional model simulating lateral flow beneath the pressure seal provides an accurate simulation of the overpressure distribution. Disequilibrium compaction of shale-dominated off-structure regions forms the principal overpressuring mechanism. Lateral flow in the permeable Fuhnar sandstones leads to high overpressure and focused vertical escape on an axial high, where the seal is thinner above a subcropping Fulmar Fm. A <b>layered</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> regime is suggested, with shallow Tertiary pressure cells separated from deep Cretaceous-Triassic pressure cells by normally pressured, permeable Palaeocene sandstones. The pre-Cretaceous rift-associated configuration of the Graben, in combination with 3 km of Tertiary subsidence, controls the distribution of overpressure.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{geophysical}} {{methods have been}} used in groundwater exploration in Cyprus. Of these, electrical resistivity has found the widest application in the investigation of the mostly unconsolidated extensive aquifers of the Mesaoria Plain and the alluvial aquifers of the rivers draining the Troodos massif. Special emphasis has been given in this study on the detailed investigation by means of electrical resistivity of the aquifers of Western Mesaoria, Central Mesaoria and the three main Paphos rivers of Dhiarizos, Xeros and Ezusa where the nature of the deposits and the scarcity of exposures diminish the effectiveness of conventional hydrogeological methods. Existing hydrogeological information and specially conducted resistivity measurements of the magnitude and extent of lateral and orientational resistivity variations indicate that conditions in Western Mesaoria, the Paphos rivers and the larger part of Central Mesaoria are on the main suitable for the application of the electrical sounding technique. Over 120 correlation soundings measured in these areas show close correspondence between <b>hydrogeological</b> and electrical <b>layers</b> and enable the establishment of working geoelectrical models according to which the rest of the 904 soundings have been interpreted. In Western Mesaoria subsurface conditions are fairly simple and laterally persistent and two subaquifers to the Western Mesaoria Upper Aquifer are indicated by the electrical and hydrogeological results. In Central Mesaoria subsurface conditions are more variable while groundwater salinity variations complicate the picture. Interpretation of sounding measurements has been based on several geoelectrical models. In the Paphos rivers subsurface conditions are simple and the basic geoelectrical model assumes the presence of two alluvial layers with different physical properties. Aquifer geometry and configuration are accurately defined by the electrical-hydrogeological results. The electrical properties of the aquifers and associated rocks are derived while aquifer potential and hydraulic transmissivity appear to be related directly to the aquifer transverse resistance...|$|R
