5|$|David Cameron criticised the Labour Government's {{criminal}} justice system {{and the absence of}} father-figures in ethnic minority cultures, which he claimed as causes in the murder of Pryce. Cameron stated that lack of strong deterrent sentences for knife crimes and the failure of police to stop prolific criminals had played a role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> Pryce. He insisted that parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.|$|E

5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly being involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> twenty-six civilians, and {{he was sentenced to}} five life terms.|$|E
5|$|The Villalba attack inaugurated a {{long series}} of Mafia attacks in Sicily on {{political}} activists, trade union leaders and ordinary peasants resisting Mafia rule.

The Portella della Ginestra massacre was attributed to the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano. Nevertheless, the Mafia was suspected of involvement in the bloodbath and many other attacks on left-wing organisations and leaders.|$|E

5|$|Al Dawasir {{attacked}} Shia {{villages of}} Barbar and A'ali, while the Khalids attacked Sitra island. The attacks resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> 12 villagers, burning of several houses and raping of women. The violence settled after Colonel Knox, the British acting Political Resident arrived in Bahrain in two gunships. Knox forced Isa bin Ali to abdicate {{in favor of}} his elder son, Hamad. The Khalids had agreed {{to reduce taxes on}} residents of Sitra following the visit. However, as soon as Knox left, taxes were increased again, and Shia residents continued to be subjected to forced labor. The situation prompted some 500 Shia to hold a protest in front of the British Agency demanding a solution to the situation and equal taxation of citizens (taxes were only imposed on the Shia).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{accounts}} of the Irish annals, English and Scandinavian writers appear to see Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray: this is clear from their descriptions of the meeting with Cnut in 1027, before the death of Malcolm mac Máil Brigti. Malcolm was followed as king or earl by his brother Gillecomgan, husband of Gruoch, a granddaughter of King Kenneth III. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad {{was responsible for the}} killing of Gille Coemgáin in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had a cause for feud <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> his father in 1020, Malcolm too had reason to see Gille Coemgáin dead. Not only had Gillecomgan's ancestors killed many of Malcolm's kin, but Gillecomgan and his son Lulach might be rivals for the throne. Malcolm had no living sons, and the threat to his plans for the succession was obvious. As a result, the following year Gruoch's brother or nephew, who might have eventually become king, was killed by Malcolm.|$|E

They were remanded in custody together with Sason Barashi {{as a result}} of a request by law enforcement in the United States for their extradition. The indictment includes four different crimes that are attributed to Yitzhak Abergil: involvement together with Malul in the murder of Atias in California in 2003, trade in Ecstasy, extortion and violence against businessmen, and money laundering and fraud. The inquiry into the case had lasted for six years, involving the FBI, tax authorities and law enforcement officials in more than ten countries in America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The British troops remained, however, and {{tensions}} between soldiers and civilians eventually resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> five {{civilians in the}} Boston Massacre of March 1770. Hancock {{was not involved in}} the incident, but afterwards he led a committee to demand the removal of the troops. Meeting with Bernard's successor, Governor Thomas Hutchinson, and the British officer in command, Colonel William Dalrymple, Hancock claimed that there were 10,000 armed colonists ready to march into Boston if the troops did not leave. Hutchinson knew that Hancock was bluffing, but the soldiers were in a precarious position when garrisoned within the town, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Hancock was celebrated as a hero for his role in getting the troops withdrawn. His reelection to the Massachusetts House in May was nearly unanimous.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan {{pursued a}} hard line {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming it to be puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters – in August 1981 the US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country {{to reduce the number of}} American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several Libyan ships.|$|E
