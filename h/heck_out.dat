[...] Sharon Knolle of AOL TV said, [...] "I'd say overall this ep ranks with some of the better Sideshow Bob eps, if not the very best.

500|$|After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain {{decided to}} compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain {{described}} the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first songwriting effort since her separation from Lange. She had to [...] "find [...] as a songwriter" [...] and become independent again. [...] "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years since I had written by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared the <b>heck</b> <b>out</b> of me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment. And it has evolved with it all along the way." ...|$|E

An Orlando Sentinel article stated [...] "muggles will love their Harry Potter adventure" [...] but identifies {{the need for the}} park to offer Universal Express Passes due to large crowds. It also stated Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a truly one-of-a-kind experience that cannot easily be described. Lisa Minot, from The Sun, stated [...] "after a sneak peek, I can say it is the most faithful recreation of JK Rowling's books and movies ever seen. Fans will be in heaven." [...] Leigh Caldwell from Traveling Mamas noted that although The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is ideal for the whole family, it's not designed for anyone under 3 years old." [...] She went on to consolidate others' comments about the area: [...] "there is no doubt that fans of the Harry Potter books and movies are going to enjoy the <b>heck</b> <b>out</b> of a visit to the Wizarding World". Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, criticized the fact that the park was chosen to be in Orlando, rather than in London, stating that it was [...] "utterly mad" [...] to leave it to the Americans [...] "to make money from a great British invention." ...|$|E
5000|$|Happy talk, {{also called}} banter, is the {{additional}} and often meaningless commentary interspersed into television news programs by news anchors {{and others on}} set. It may consist of simple jokes or simply a modified wording in asking a question of another reporter. For instance, instead of a simple handoff to a sportscaster, an anchor might say, [...] "So, Dave, what the <b>heck</b> happened <b>out</b> on that field today? Is our team going down the tubes?"

Chaney was not so pleased with [...] "We Found Love", to which she gave a [...] "C". She wrote that it was [...] "part old Esther Williams movie, part classic 'SNL' sketch with Harry Shearer and Martin Short and part music video for 'Magic' by the Cars. In short, {{it was kind of}} a train wreck." [...] However, she and Stanhope, who said it was [...] "way too fast-paced", were in the minority. Lynch called it [...] "sheer pleasure" [...] and gave it an [...] "A−", and Slezak was even more enthusiastic with an [...] "A+" [...] grade and described it as a [...] "sublimely, ridiculously, excessively terrific production number" [...] which he placed [...] "in the show's all-time Top 10". VanDerWerff praised the [...] "nice sense of visual spectacle", and Hankinson called it [...] "really fantastic" [...] and [...] "something different".

5000|$|Hamilton {{was born}} in Gilbertfield, Cambuslang, Scotland. In the Familiar Epistles he {{exchanged}} with Allan Ramsay, he modestly acknowledges the limitations of his own muse.

Ramsay's Epistles in return are certainly more skillful, more self-consciously Scots and with lots more allusions to other authors, Ancient and Modern, but they are consequently, less direct than those of Hamilton. Another of Hamilton's poems, Willie was a Wanton Wag, - about a young man who appears at a wedding feast, and enraptures bride and bridesmaids by his [...] "leg" [...] at dancing - appeared in Ramsay's Tea-Table Miscellany.|$|R

Lauren Chval of Chicago Tribune remarked that what is great about Vause is [...] "she knows who she is and what she wants", trusts her instincts and has [...] "never flipped on her feelings for Chapman". Chval praised Prepon in the role, and remarked that Vause is [...] "always more interesting in her scenes without Chapman".Perri Nemiroff of Collider said Prepon has been successful [...] "taking Alex from a strong inmate you don’t want to mess with to someone super vulnerable who’s fearing for her life."Rick Porter of The Hollywood Reporter praised Prepon's performance as Vause, in the season finale, encounters the hitman sent to kill her, writing, [...] "Prepon sells the <b>heck</b> of <b>out</b> Alex's disbelief and fear in the scene." ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{signed to}} drive the No. 36 M's-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for MB2 Motorsports. In his first year of competition, Schrader had two top 10s and {{finished}} 18th in the standings. He posted five top 10s in 2001, but dropped to 19th in the standings. While competing in the Daytona 500, {{he was involved in}} a final-lap crash where Dale Earnhardt crashed into the wall and died. The image of Schrader peering into Earnhardt's car, only to jump back and frantically signal for assistance, is etched into the minds of many racing fans; his interview with Jeanne Zelasko during Fox Sports' post-race show was the first sign to many that something was wrong with the seven-time Winston Cup champion, as he appeared visibly shaken and upon being asked if Earnhardt was okay, he said [...] "I don't really know. I'm not a doctor. I got the <b>heck</b> <b>out</b> of the way as soon as they got there." [...] In 2002, Schrader did not finish in the top 10 in a single race, the first time since 1984.

50|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, Alfons Heck {{remained}} silent about his wartime activities and {{his involvement in}} the Hitler Youth, but he read hundreds of books about the Third Reich, tracing the lives of surviving Nazi leaders and maintaining an interest in West German politics. He came to feel that his generation of young Germans had been callously betrayed by brutal Nazi strategists. Of the nine and a half million German war dead, two million were teenagers, both civilians and Hitler Youth. In 1971, at the age of 43, he became disabled by heart disease.

5000|$|Detective Sergeant Mark Heckenberg, or [...] "Heck", is a British Police Officer and {{a member}} of the fictional National Crime Group based at New Scotland Yard.

In the first book - Stalkers - they investigate the [...] "Nice Guys Club"; a highly secretive organised crime group that provide highly unpleasant sexual services to the very rich. Stalkers became a number one e-book bestseller, selling almost 150,000 copies across e-book and paperback.

50|$|Herbivorous megafauna are {{considered}} important tools of nature conservation {{in maintaining the}} biodiversity of open or park-like landscapes without human interference. Therefore, it is planned to reintroduce large game in several reserves to recreate the natural dynamics of the European ecosystems. The aurochs {{was one of the}} most important European ungulates but was hunted to extinction over most of Europe in the Middle Ages. Despite attempts at conservation, the last known pure-bred aurochs died in Jaktorów Forest, Poland in 1627. Thus, so-called rewilding has to work with its domesticated descendants, of which several breeds are hardy and robust enough to fill this gap. In many grazing projects, especially in Germany, Heck cattle are used, together with Galloways and Highland cattle. Heck cattle originated in the 1920s as an attempt by Lutz and Heinz Heck to breed an aurochs look-alike from several cattle breeds. <b>Heck</b> cattle turned <b>out</b> to be a hardy breed, but are found to be considerably different from the aurochs in several aspects.|$|R
