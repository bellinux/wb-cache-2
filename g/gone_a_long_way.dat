25|$|Sussex won the toss at the Oval {{and elected}} to bat. Mark Ramprakash captained Surrey as Mark Butcher {{has still not}} {{recovered}} from the injury that saw him miss England's winter tour. Only 49 overs could be bowled on the first day, as rain delayed the start till after lunch, and bad light brought an early conclusion. Cloud cover helped the bowlers, but Sussex, thanks to Michael Yardy's 44 not out, finished the day on 171 for 4. The second day saw 61 overs. Yardy, again under cloud-covered skies, progressed to 111, which will have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to helping him cement a regular first team place. Rikki Clarke, who took 4 for 91, appears a yard quicker than last season, and to have improved after his poor season last year. Sussex finished the second day on 370, and Surrey on 6 for 1.|$|E

[...] However, he stated that the decision to keep many of the design choices intact from the original was both refreshing and a hindrance; he highlighted examples from the campaign, such as infinitely-spawning enemies, and similarly condemned infamous perks and a lack of killstreak-countering in the multiplayer that had not been removed or fixed, finding it [...] "extremely outdated". Despite this, he complimented the multiplayer as feeling fresh, saying [...] "After years of over-the-top killstreaks, wall-running, and other crazy antics, it's nice {{to get back to the}} basics". He heavily praised the visual enhancements on display, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered is the most extensive visual upgrade any remaster has ever received yet, being more in line with a remake than an actual remaster. [...] It's a stunning overhaul." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "What Raven has accomplished is impressive, but it has its limits. A few tweaks would have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to fixing some balancing issues, but for those looking for a blast from the past, this works just fine".|$|E

Hoerburger expressed the view that tracks such as [...] "Nasty" [...] and [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] erased the former [...] "pop-ingénue image" [...] of Jackson's first two albums, and that [...] "Control is a better album than Diana Ross has made in five years and puts Janet in a position similar to the young Donna Summer's—unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it." [...] Steven Ivory of Billboard expressed [...] "ocally, Jackson is more aggressive than ever. Indeed, her exhibition of sass and funkiness is certainly more provocative" [...] in comparison to her previous work. NME wrote: [...] "Jackson has <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> in shaking off the experience of being a shadow Jackson child. She is an artist in her own right." [...] Newsweek stated [...] "n an era of big-voiced pop-soul divas... her current hit album, is taut, funky, hard as nails, an alternative to the sentimental balladry and opulent arrangements of Patti LaBelle and Whitney Houston." [...] Robert Christgau [...] "scoffed at Janet's claims of autonomy", but gave the album a B rating based on [...] "its entertainment value". Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson wrote: [...] "Though still a teen-ager, this singer's stance is remarkably nervy and mature. She has a snotty sort of assurance that permeates several cuts, plus the musical muscle to back it up." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes Control takes obvious influence from Prince, describing [...] "he album's pacing, its clipped vocal lines—even the spoken introduction that starts things off" [...] as pure Minneapolis sound; he adds [...] "ut where the Prince style is usually connected with heavy-breathing come-ons, Miss Jackson is cheerfully standoffish." ...|$|E
