5000|$|By {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, major {{advances}} in design theory, graphic statics, and knowledge of material strengths had been achieved. As the nineteenth century neared its end, the major factor contributing to the need for scientific design of bridges was the railroads. Engineers had to know the precise levels of stresses in bridge members, in order to accommodate the impact of trains. The first design solution was obtained by Squire Whipple in 1847. His major breakthrough was that truss members could be analyzed as a system of forces in equilibrium. This system, known as the [...] "method of joints," [...] permits the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> in all known members of a truss if two forces are known. The next advance in design was the [...] "method of sections," [...] developed by Wilhelm Ritter in 1862. Ritter simplified the calculations of forces by developing a very simple formula for determining the forces in the members intersected by a cross-section. A third advance was a better method of graphical analysis, developed independently by J.C. Maxwell (UK) and Karl Culmann. (Switzerland).|$|E

40|$|Abstract The state <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> in the {{vicinity}} of the crack tip changes from plane strain at the tip to plane stress at a critical distance (about half the specimen thickness) from the tip through an intermediate region where the state <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> is three-dimensional. In the optical method of caustics, the caustic is the image of a circle on the specimen centered at the crack tip, and, therefore, yields information on the stress state along this circle. In the method conditions <b>of</b> plane <b>stress</b> are assumed along this circle. This condition imposes restrictions on the geometrical dimensions of the optical arrangement, specimen thickness, crack length and applied loads for the correct <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> intensity factors. In the present work the limits of applicability of the method of caustics are studied. The use of optically anisotropic materials is introduced to obtain a double caustic which provides the correct state <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> (plane strain, plane stress or three-dimensional) along the initial curve. When the state <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> is known the proper values of stress-optical constants can be used for the correct <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> intensity factors...|$|R
