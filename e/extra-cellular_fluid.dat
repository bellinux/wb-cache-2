5000|$|The kidney filters 250 mmol {{of calcium}} ions {{a day in}} pro-urine (or glomerular filtrate), and resorbs 245 mmol, leading to a net average loss in the urine of about 5 mmol/d. The {{quantity}} of calcium ions excreted in the urine per day is partially {{under the influence of}} the plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) level - high levels of PTH decreasing the rate of calcium ion excretion, and low levels increasing it. However, parathyroid hormone has a greater effect on the quantity of phosphate ions (HPO42−) excreted in the urine. Phosphates form insoluble salts in combination with calcium ions. High concentrations of HPO42− in the plasma, therefore, lower the ionized calcium level in the <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>fluids.</b> Thus, the excretion of more phosphate than calcium ions in the urine raises the plasma ionized calcium level, even though the total calcium concentration might be lowered. The kidney influences the plasma ionized calcium concentration in yet another manner. It processes vitamin D3 into calcitriol, the active form that is most effective in promoting the intestinal absorption of calcium. This conversion of vitamin D3 into calcitriol, is also promoted by high plasma parathyroid hormone levels. (See below.) ...|$|R

Although their function remains enigmatic, exo-somes {{are a source}} of antigen and trans-fer functional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) –I/peptide complexes to dendritic cells (DCs) for CD 8 T-cell acti-vation. Here we demonstrate that exo-somes also are internalized and pro-cessed by immature DCs for presentation to CD 4 T cells. Endocytosed exosomes are sorted into the endocytic compart-ment of DCs for processing, followed by loading of exosome-derived peptides in MHC-II molecules for presentation to CD 4 T cells. Targeting of exosomes to DCs is mediated via milk fat globule (MFG) –E 8 / lactadherin, CD 11 a, CD 54, phosphatidyl-serine, and the tetraspanins CD 9 and CD 81 on the exosome and v/ 3 integrin, and CD 11 a and CD 54 on the DCs. Circulat-ing exosomes are internalized by DCs and specialized phagocytes of the spleen and by hepatic Kupffer cells.

Methods: The total phenolics content of the extract was estimated using Folin-Ciocalteu method. The probable cytotoxicity of O. persica extract and also its cytoprotective effect on HUVEC cells against oxidative stress was assessed using 3 -(4, 5 - Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The intra and extra-cellular hydroperoxides concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were determined in pretreated cells. Results: Total phenolics content {{was found to be}} 42. 41 ± 0. 1 mg tanic acid equivalent/g of thedried extract. No cytotoxic effect was observed from O. persica extract in the range of 25 - 250 µg/mL.

Although CSF dynamics has been studied for an entire century, many of its aspects are still insufficiently understood. Today there are two hypotheses (1, 2) on CSF physiology: a) traditional hy-pothesis and b) microcirculatory/microvessel hypothesis. According to the traditional hypothesis, CSF is formed inside the brain ventricles, mostly by secretion from the choroid plexuses, and it circulates along the ventricles and subarachnoid space to be absorbed across the arachnoid villi into the dural venous sinuses, and/or viacranial and spi-nal nerves paraneural sheaths into the lymphatic system.

40|$|Biological cells {{stressed}} by external electric fields undergo mechanical deformation and remodeling caused by electro-mechanical Maxwell stresses. These stresses {{appear at the}} internal and external membrane interfaces due to differences in dielectric properties of the biological membrane and the surrounding and internal fluids. Electro-mechanical loading of the cells results in the reversible or irreversible development of pores in the membrane. This could cause disruption in normal functioning of the cell and even leads to cell death. Such a phenomenon has several practical applications including pulsed electric field (PEF) processing of fluids. In the PEF process liquids and pumpable products are subjected to short high electric field pulses that lead to non-thermal inactivation of bacteria. In the present paper the dynamics of electromechanical loading of spherical cells in external pulsed electric fields has been considered. The cell was modeled as a simple insulating dielectric shell containing a conducting fluid. Cells were suspended in a second conducting fluid. For a single spherical cell electrical fields and electro-mechanical forces have been calculated both analytically and using finite-element software. The transient electrical fields induced in a cell membrane subjected to a high- field step pulse are increased due to Maxwell-Wagner polarization effects at the membrane/conductive fluid interfaces. The electro-mechanical forces acting on the cell also grow during this transient polarization process, the duration depending on the conductivities and permittivities of the inter-cellular and <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>fluids.</b> As a result the electro-mechanical stresses in the membrane reach a maximal value up to three orders of magnitude higher than the initial stress. This maximum value occurred in a time comparable to the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation time of the conducting fluid. In the case of two spherical cells located near to each other the finite difference software was used to calculate the induced stresses. It was shown that the field and electro-mechanical stresses in the two-cell model were practically identical to the single sphere model...|$|R

In the present study, the protective and antioxidant effects of anthocyanin-rich E. amoenum extract were evaluated on human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) under oxidative stress. Materials and Methods: Cell viability and oxidative status were assessed on H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress (0. 5 mM H 2 O 2 for 2 h) in HUVECs pretreated by anthocyanin-rich extract from the petals of E. amoenum (25 - 1000 µg/ml). Cytoprotective effect of the extract was evaluated by 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The hydroperoxides concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were assessed in intra- and <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>fluid</b> of pretreated cells. Results: Pretreatment of HUVECs with E. amoenum extract at the concentrations of 100 - 1000 µg/ml reduced the cell death resulted from the exposure to H 2 O 2 in a concentration-dependent manner. E. amoenum extract decreased hydroperoxides concentration and increased FRAP value in both intra- and <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>fluid</b> at different concentration ranges.

The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the ability of bioimpedance monitoring to describe morphology and physiology of non-treated cancerous tissue and mapping radiosensitivity of tumors with different type, size and pathobiology. A model with xenografts established from the human colorectal cell line HT 29 were grown from implanted tumor tissue into immune-deficient GBNIH nude mice. Laboratory animals of male sex were anaesthetized with katte-zoletilmix and tumor size monitoried continuously. The mice were divided into three dose groups each given 0, 5, and 15 Gy with an 60 Co source, respectively. Impedance measurements were performed with a 4 -electrode probe. Tumor was compressed between the two electrodes to get full contact with surfaces. Impedances were recorded at frequencies between 1 Hz and 1 MHz with a Solartron 1260 gain-phase analyzer and Solartron 1294 impedance unit. Electrical impedance monitoring, as applied in this study, was evaluated as a measurement technique for radiation response prediction. The preclinical study, conducted on nude mice implanted with a human colorectal cancer, revealed the ability of bioimpedance monitoring method to detect radiation-induced electrical changes of growing tumors on an individual subject basis. There are two components of our study, electrical impedance monitoring and histological assessment. Impedance results are presented as a function of time. Impedans and phase data for irradiated and non-irradiated tumour are plotted as a function of necrosis fraction and tumor volume.

40|$|Diffusion {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (dMRI) provides a unique tool for noninvasively probing the microstructure of the neuronal tissue. The NODDI model has been a popular approach to the estimation of tissue microstructure in many neuroscience studies. It represents the diffusion signals with three types of diffusion in tissue: intra-cellular, <b>extra-cellular,</b> and cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> compartments. However, the original NODDI method uses a computationally expensive procedure to fit the model and could require {{a large number of}} diffusion gradients for accurate microstructure estimation, which may be impractical for clinical use. Therefore, efforts have been devoted to efficient and accurate NODDI microstructure estimation with a reduced number of diffusion gradients. In this work, we propose a deep network based approach to the NODDI microstructure estimation, which is named Microstructure Estimation using a Deep Network (MEDN). Motivated by the AMICO algorithm which accelerates the computation of NODDI parameters, we formulate the microstructure estimation problem in a dictionary-based framework. The proposed network comprises two cascaded stages. The first stage resembles the solution to a dictionary-based sparse reconstruction problem and the second stage computes the final microstructure using the output of the first stage. The weights in the two stages are jointly learned from training data, which is obtained from training dMRI scans with diffusion gradients that densely sample the q-space. The proposed method was applied to brain dMRI scans, where two shells each with 30 gradient directions (60 diffusion gradients in total) were used. Estimation accuracy with respect to the gold standard was measured and the results demonstrate that MEDN outperforms the competing algorithms. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures.

However, {{it is essential}} to be able to ascertain whether the sampling used provides the full biochemical information relevant to the disease and is free from artefacts. A multi-modal micro-spectroscopic approach, including FTIR imaging and PIXE elemental mapping, has been used to study the molecular and elemental profile within cryofixed and formalin-fixed murine brain tissue sections. The results provide strong evidence that amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, phosphates, proteins and ions, such as Cl(-) and K(+), leach from tissue sections into the aqueous fixative medium during formalin fixation of the sections. Large changes in the concentrations and distributions of most of these components are also observed by washing in PBS even for short periods. The most likely source of the chemical species lost during fixation is the <b>extra-cellular</b> and intra-cellular <b>fluid</b> of tissues. The results highlight that, at best, analysis of formalin-fixed tissues gives only part of the complete biochemical "picture'' of a tissue sample. Further, this investigation has highlighted that significant lipid peroxidation/oxidation may occur during formalin fixation and that the use of standard histological fixation reagents can result in significant and differential metal contamination of different regions of tissue sections.

This coupling links the mechanical forces that influence cell growth and emergent behaviors in cell assemblies. We illustrate our approach by showing how mechanical interactions can impact the dynamics of bacterial collectives growing in microfluidic traps. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Extracellular ionic {{homeostasis}} in {{an insect}} {{central nervous system}} involves a peripheral intercellular diffusion barrier, an extracellular matrix and neuroglial cation transport. The peripheral location of the barrier in the superficial neuroglia is confirmed by intracellular recording from glial cells identified by peroxidase injection. This barrier protects the underlying neurones from large changes in ionic composition of the blood-plasma, but renders them more susceptible to fluctuations in ion composition resulting from neuronal signalling within the very restricted extracellular system. Because of the peripheral inter-cellular barrier, sodium movements between the blood and the <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>fluid</b> are largely transcellular and are mediated by ion pumps on the perineurial and underlying glial membranes. It is suggested that the homeostatic role of the neuroglial ion pumps is augmented by an anion matrix which functions as an extracellular sodium reservoir. It is proposed that during depletion of extracellular sodium, this cation is released by the matrix to maintain the sodium activity in the fluid at the axon surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{conditions}} {{which lead to}} a plaque of demyelination in the retrobulbar optic nerve are discussed. Growth of the plaque occurs along venules as small fingerlike sleeves which develop outwards from the contour of the plaque. This occurs slowly and at intervals; the very gradually expanding lesion remain {{for a long time}} clinically silent. It is here postulated that the change to clinical disease is induced if cells digesting myelin debris settle in a more distal part of the perivascular space of a vein, than during the subclinical phase. In sufficient numbers these cells will impede the movement of molecules from <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>fluid</b> surrounding nodes of Ranvier into cerebrospinal fluid. A restriction in this vital drainage pathway results in oedema causing distrubed signal transmission in neurons passing through the veins drainage territory. Depending on intensity this can induce the characteristics symptom of blurred vision. These concepts have been used to speculate on sequential changes in neurons and to relate them to various phases of the disease. This seems to be justified as the pattern evolved corresponds well with the clinical symptomatology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Plasma {{concentrations}} of human {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (99 - 126) are elevated in patients with end-stage chronic renal failure and on haemodialy-sis. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentra-tions change with extracellular fluid volume, suggesting that ANP continues to {{have a role in}} chronic renal failure. We have studied the effects of an infusion (5 pmol/kg per min) in subjects with chronic renal failure (CCr < 30 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2). Glomerular nitration rate and effective renal plasma flow increased by 23 % (P < 0. 01) and 27 % (P < 0. 01) respectively and sodium excretion more than doubled. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 14 (SD 1. 6) and 6 (SD 0. 8) mmHg respectively (P < 0. 001), and plasma renin activity declined (P < 0. 01). Plasma ANP concentra-tions were elevated compared to normal subjects and reached a peak of 224 (SD 87) pmol/ 1 {{at the end of the}} infusion. Plasma half-life was 4. 8 (SD 2. 7) min. Plasma concentrations are elevated in chronic renal failure and ANP may play a physiological role in controlling <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>fluid</b> volume and blood pressure...|$|E
