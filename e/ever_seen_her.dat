500|$|The New York Daily Mirror critic wrote, [...] "Programmed as {{a musical}} play, South Pacific is just that. [...] It boasts no ballets and no hot hoofing. It has no chorus in the {{conventional}} sense. Every one in it plays a part. It is likely {{to establish a new}} trend in musicals." [...] The review continued: [...] "Every number is so outstanding {{that it is difficult to}} decide which will be the most popular." [...] The review in New York World-Telegram found the show to be [...] "the ultimate modern blending of music and popular theatre to date, with the finest kind of balance between story and song, and hilarity and heartbreak." [...] Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times especially praised Pinza's performance: [...] "Mr. Pinza's bass voice is the most beautiful that has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two. He sings... with infinite delicacy of feeling and loveliness of tone." [...] He declared that [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", sung by Pinza, [...] "ought to become reasonably immortal." [...] Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Post focused on Mary Martin's performance, writing, [...] "nothing I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> do prepared me for the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush... who is so shocked to find her early racial prejudices cropping up. Hers is a completely irresistible performance." ...|$|E

Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> open her little child's eyes wide and look at it, and feel so proud of what she had done already that she wanted to do more? Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> steady her pretty little hand, and hold her innocent breath, and put one other card on the top, and lay the whole house, the instant afterward, a heap of ruins on the table? Ah, you have <b>seen</b> that. Give <b>her,</b> if you please, a friendly message from me. I venture to say she has built the house high enough already; and I recommend her to be careful before she puts on that other card." ...|$|R

Richard Watts Jr. of the New York Post wrote: [...] "nothing I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> do prepared me for the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush....

2500|$|Varro {{explains}} {{the exclusion of}} men from Bona Dea's cult {{as a consequence of}} her great modesty; no man but her husband had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> or heard her name. For Servius, this makes her the paragon of chaste womanhood. Most likely, once Fauna's mythology seemed to offer an explanation for Bona Dea's mysterious cult, the myth developed circumstantially, to fit what little was known of the practice. In turn, the cult practice may have changed to support the virtuous ideological message required of the myths, particularly during the Augustan religious reforms that identified Bona Dea with the empress Livia. Versnel (1992) notes the elements common to the Bona Dea festival, Fauna's myths, and Greek Demeter's Thesmophoria, as [...] "wine, myrtle, serpents and female modesty blemished".|$|E
2500|$|As {{the decade}} carried on, Hepburn {{appeared}} in {{an assortment of}} genres including the heist comedy How to Steal a Million (1966) where she played {{the daughter of a}} famous art collector, whose collection consists entirely of forgeries. Fearing her father's exposure, she sets out to steal one of his priceless statues {{with the help of a}} man played by Peter O'Toole. It was followed by two films in 1967. The first was Two for the Road, a non-linear and innovative British dramedy that traces the course of a couple's troubled marriage. Director Stanley Donen said that Hepburn was more free and happy than he had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> and he credited that to co-star Albert Finney. The second, Wait Until Dark, is a suspense thriller in which Hepburn demonstrated her acting range by playing the part of a terrorised blind woman. Filmed on the brink of her divorce, it was a difficult film for her, as husband Mel Ferrer was its producer. She lost fifteen pounds under the stress, but she found solace in co-star Richard Crenna and director Terence Young. Hepburn earned her fifth and final competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; Bosley Crowther affirmed, [...] "Hepburn plays the poignant role, the quickness with which she changes and the skill with which she manifests terror attract sympathy and anxiety to her and give her genuine solidity in the final scenes." ...|$|E
