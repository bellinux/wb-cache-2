40|$|We {{compared}} five {{subgroups of}} aggressive youth (n = 1, 723, Grades 5 through 10) {{on a number}} of adjustment correlates. The subgroups were determined by the self-reported functions (i. e., “why”) of their aggressive behavior: (a) an “instru-mental ” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> were high on instrumental reasons only; (b) a “reactive” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> were high on reactive reasons only; (c) a “both ” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> were high on both dimensions; (d) a “typical ” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> were moderate on both dimen-sions; and (e) a “neither ” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> were low on both dimensions. The reactive and both groups showed consistent maladaptive patterns across the adjustment correlates. The instrumental and typical groups both showed generally adaptive and well-adjusted patterns. Surprisingly, the neither group revealed high levels of aggressive acts and showed consistent maladaptive patterns on the correlates. These distinct profiles highlight the utility of a typological approach to classifying aggressive youth and have implications for both assessment and intervention. Antisocial and aggressive behaviors are a leading cause of referral to inpatient and outpatient clinics during adolescence, accounting fo...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the state of long-term care service use by individuals certified as requiring lower care and, from the viewpoint of their relationship with society, to clarify why individuals do not use services. A questionnaire using un-named, individually filled-in forms via mailing was administered targeting 2, 355 elderly people who maintain an at home lifestyle and receive approved Needing support 1 and 2 and Long-term care 1 and 2. We have received the following results. ① Participants not using had higher IADL scores. Also, the <b>group</b> <b>who</b> need support showed a significantly higher rate in living alone, and the <b>group</b> <b>who</b> need long-term care had a lower average age and showed a significantly higher rate in residency of 10 years or more. ② The <b>group</b> <b>who</b> need support responded, “Having discussion with family members” while the <b>group</b> <b>who</b> need longterm care responded, “no discussion with family members and other people. ” Thereby, showing a relation to unused long-term care service. From the above results, we have determined that the <b>group</b> <b>who</b> need support and the <b>group</b> <b>who</b> need long-term care have different backgrounds, revealing the possibility that the groups require separate support measures. Moreover, there is a possibility that those not using but belonging to the <b>group</b> <b>who</b> need long-term care may be isolated from family and neighbors. Hence it may be required to create a mechanism in which we can gain an understanding of their situation and build an individual relationship with them through house-calls, etc...|$|R
