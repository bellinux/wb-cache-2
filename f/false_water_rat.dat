5000|$|There {{are several}} predators to the <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> {{including}} foxes, cats, carpet pythons, rough-scaled snakes, tawny frog mouths, and pigs. [...] However, {{the biggest threat}} to the <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> is man. Due to man, their habitat is severely fragmented and less than 2,000 km. The quality of their habitat and area of occupancy continue to decline primarily due to the development of mangrove areas. Increasing development creates oil pollution, wastewater and acid sulphate contamination, alteration of natural hydrology, and increasing infections from chemicals and waste. [...] Overall, the habitat is being destroyed because of water quality changes due to agriculture, livestock grazing, urbanisation, and swamp drainage. [...] Because of all of these circumstances, they are classified as vulnerable.|$|E
5000|$|False water rats do {{not appear}} to {{negatively}} affect man or our economy and they have no known positive economic importance for man other than playing a role in maintaining the ecological stability of the marine population it feeds on, indirectly affecting local marine-related industries and the land. [...] Through the years, man has been careless with the release of pollutants and other waste products thereby causing a decrease in the habitat for these animals. Paying particular attention, creating, promoting and maintaining environmental safe processes surrounding excavation and construction, garbage and waste products elimination, chemicals and extracts usage, as well natural and unnatural predators will increase the survival chances of the <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat.</b> In addition, conservation of the wetlands and mangroves will not only prevent extinction of the <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> and other animals but it will protect our shores from wave action, reduce the impacts of floods and absorb natural pollutants and provide habitat for animals and plants.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> (Xeromys myoides) {{lives in}} Australia and Papua New Guinea. [...] Though {{originally}} {{believed to be}} restricted to Southeast Queensland and the Northern Territory, the <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> has subsequently {{been found in the}} central and southern parts of Queensland, North Stradbroke Island off the coast of Southeast Queensland, Melville Island, and southwest Western Province, Papua New Guinea. [...] False water rats primarily live in mangrove communities and shallow areas surrounding lagoons, swamps, and lakes. [...] Their nests are made at the base of mangrove trees. Their nests are very similar to termite mounds. They are made of leaves, mud, and may be as high as 60 centimetres. There is usually one opening and on the inside it is a complex system of tunnels which connects to multiple chambers. Since the tunnels are very complex sometimes the homes can overlap. [...] This behaviour shows that they are social and very friendly.Because of their lack of webbed feet and their inability to swim, their nests are generally built near shallow water. [...] This allows them to wade in water instead of swimming and diving in search of their food.|$|E
5000|$|<b>False</b> <b>water</b> <b>rats</b> {{appear to}} depend on {{mangrove}} and intertidal salt marsh habitats for food. [...] Their diet consists of invertebrates such as crabs, small mud lobsters, marine shellfish, snails and worms. They generally eat during the night and rest during the day. [...] Their estimated home range used for foraging is 0.8 ha for males and 0.6 ha for females, however they can forage up to 2.9 km distances at night.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{range of}} {{threatened}} and endemic species on the Tiwi Islands. Thirty-eight threatened species have been recorded, {{and a number of}} plants and invertebrates are found nowhere else, including eight plant species and some land snails and dragonflies. [...] Threatened mammals include Brush-tailed rabbit rats, northern brush-tailed phascogales, <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rats</b> and Carpentarian dunnarts. [...] The islands host the world's largest breeding colony of crested terns and a large population of the vulnerable olive ridley turtle; a sea turtle conservation program commenced on the islands in 2007. The seas and estuaries around the islands are home to several species of shark and saltwater crocodiles.|$|R
5000|$|<b>False</b> <b>water</b> <b>rats</b> have {{markedly}} long, flattened {{heads with}} small eyes and short, rounded ears. These rats possess just two molars {{on each side}} of the upper and lower jaw. Their upper incisors are yellow or orange and the lower incisors are white. The head and body length is approximately 100 mm characterised by a hunched body shape. [...] The tail length is 85-100 mm and the hind-foot length is 23-26 mm. [...] The body fur is water-resistant and dark gray, which gradually blends into the white underside. The hands and feet are covered with fine, white hairs. Their feet are not webbed like other <b>water</b> <b>rats</b> (Hydromys chrysogaster), which gives it their common name [...] "false" [...] <b>water</b> <b>rat.</b> The tail is sparsely haired and lacks the white-tip found in the more common <b>water</b> <b>rat.</b> In addition, the tails of these rats, are scaled. The average weight is 42 grams.|$|R
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about the life cycle and {{breeding}} patterns of this species. [...] Since their food and nutrients are generally found amongst the mangroves, the lifespan of the <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> is highly dependent upon the preservation of the mangrove forest. It is believed that they breed throughout the year with only two young per litter. [...] Up to eight individuals of various ages (young and old) and either sex live in a nest, with usually only one sexually active adult male present and several females.|$|E
5000|$|A {{conservation}} area {{is located on}} the southern bank of the river at its junction with Moreton Bay, bordering the Southern Moreton Bay Island National Park and the RAMSAR wetland site. [...] The Pimpama River wetlands has mangroves, saltmarshs and marine flats providing protected breeding grounds for marine species including four frog species and the vulnerable <b>False</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Rat</b> (Xeromys myoides). The wetlands are an important {{conservation area}} for a recorded 184 species of native plants, 134 vertebrate fauna species including 13 species of mammals, 108 species of birds and nine species of reptiles.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{species in}} the reserve include the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), greater long-eared bat (Nyctophilus timoriensis), <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> (Xeromys myoides), {{humpback}} whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and the dugong (Dugong dugon). Both the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) are flagship species in Australia, receiving {{a great deal of}} conservation attention from the public. In comparison, species like the greater long-eared bat (Nyctophilus timoriensis) and the false water-rat (Xeromys myoides) are unknown to most of the public, but are nationally vulnerable species, with current studies indicating both require the same level of conservation attention to prevent further decline in abundance and distribution. Even megafauna species dugong (Dugong dugon) numbers are also in steady decline, with extinction forecast for this vulnerable species within this century.|$|E

50|$|Hydromys chrysogaster, {{commonly}} known as rakali, rabe or water-rat, is an Australian native rodent first described in 1804. The change to the aboriginal name Rakali was intended to foster a positive public attitude by Environment Australia. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Hydromys with a range extending beyond Papua New Guinea and Indonesian West Papua. Having effectively adapted and colonised a unique niche of semi-aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle, this species lives in burrows on the banks of rivers, lakes and estuaries and feeds on aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs and water birds. Rakali have a body 231 - 370 mm in length, weigh, 340 - 1275 g and have a thick tail measuring around 242 - 345 mm. Females are generally smaller than males but tail lengths are normally the same.They have partially webbed hind legs, waterproof fur, a flattened head, a long blunt nose, many whiskers and small ears and eyes. The body is streamlined with a skull that is large, flat and elongated, with two molars on the upper and lower jaw, similar to the <b>False</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> Xeromys meroides. They are black to brown in colour with an orange to white belly, and dark tail with a white tip.|$|E
50|$|German's one-toothed moss mouse (Pseudohydromys germani) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Muridae which occurs in the {{mountains}} of southeastern New Guinea. It has only one molar and only one incisor in each jaw quadrant for a total of eight teeth, less than any other rodents except for its close relative, the one-toothed moss-mouse (P. ellermani) and the recently described Paucidentomys, which lacks molars entirely. It is known from only one specimen, an adult male which was caught at an altitude of 1300 m in the village of Munimun, Milne Bay Province, southeastern Papua New Guinea in August 1992. P. germani was first described in 2005 by biologist Kristofer Helgen and named after Pavel German, who caught the specimen. It was first described in the genus Mayermys, but this genus, which only included the two one-molared species, has since been synonymised under Pseudohydromys because of the close morphological resemblances among Mayermys and the other species now placed in Pseudohydromys. As a member of the Xeromys division within the subfamily Murinae, P. germani is related to the <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> (Xeromys myoides) of Australia and southern New Guinea and to the three species of Leptomys, another New Guinean genus, and more distantly to other New Guinean and Australian rodents, including the water rat.|$|E
40|$|Identification {{of habitat}} {{variables}} {{that are associated}} with patch occupancy can provide a solid foundation for conservation, especially when habitats and landscapes are affected by human activities. As a case study to investigate the importance of landscape complementation and habitat quality for conservation, we examined the habitat preferences of a vulnerable native rodent, the <b>false</b> <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> (Xeromys myoides Thomas). In this study, results from surveys for animal presence and recording of habitat attributes in localities in south-east Queensland showed that X. myoides prefers a habitat with a wide mangrove zone of short mangroves and a high percentage of relatively tall vegetation cover in the sedge/saltmarsh zone. The absence of X. myoides from areas of likely habitat at a large scale can be attributed, at least in part, to the local habitat variables that overrode predictions based at a large scale. The findings suggest that availability of suitable habitat is a factor limiting the distribution and abundance of X. myoides. It is clear that landscape complementation influences patch occupancy and should be an essential consideration for conservation programs...|$|E
