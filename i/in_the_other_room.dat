25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of}} the bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|Unanimously {{approved}} by music critics, [...] "Almost Blue" [...] was noted {{for being a}} highlight on Imperial Bedroom; Emerick's production on the track was also singled out by reviewers, who acclaimed his [...] "aftermath" [...] approach towards its composition. The song was covered by several performers, notably Chet Baker in 1987, Gwen Stefani in 1998, and by Costello's wife Diana Krall for her seventh studio album, The Girl <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Room</b> (2004).|$|E

Feeling sorry for Jerome, Lois invites him to stay at their home, with Peter reluctantly agreeing, before suddenly being cut off mid-sentence by the Mac OS X spinning wait cursor. The next day, after Jerome decides to cook for Lois, Peter and Chris, sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room,</b> overhear Lois passionately complimenting Jerome, and believe they are having sex. Racing to the kitchen, the two discover that she was only complimenting his food, with Don Knotts as Ralph Furley from the sitcom Three's Company also appearing.|$|E

This is easy {{to do if you}} have TRVs (thermostatically-controlled radiator valves) fitted to your radiators but, if you don't have TRVs, you should be sure to open the IN-FLOW valves fully in all living rooms and turn them almost fully off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> (Keeping them open just an eighth- to a quarter- turn usually works.) ...|$|R

500|$|Lennon and Ono co-produced {{the song}} and album with Phil Spector, who commented on the track: [...] "We knew {{what we were going}} to do ... It was going to be John making a {{political}} statement, but a very commercial one as well ... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem." [...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that— and Phil will just sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'... I'll get the initial idea and ... we'll just find a sound from [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Costello's wife, Canadian singer Diana Krall, {{recorded}} {{a cover of}} [...] "Almost Blue" [...] for her seventh studio album, The Girl <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Room</b> (2004). Both Krall and Tommy LiPuma produced the track, which is over a minute longer than Costello's original rendition. An accompanying music video to Krall's version was created and released in 2004, and eventually uploaded onto her official Vevo account on October 6, 2009. The visual was selected by the singer to appear on her greatest hits album, The Very Best of Diana Krall, in 2007. In her review of the video's inclusion on the aforementioned album, Shackleton mentioned the [...] "wintry outdoor scenes from Diana's native Vancouver Island" [...] as a highlight.|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} gain more space, Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach had four massive marble pillars {{constructed}} on the right-hand outer wall and had a loggia added on.

2500|$|After a brief conversation, Polanski {{had packed}} up his camera gear and Huston saw them drive {{off in his}} car. Huston told police the next day, after Polanski was arrested, that she [...] "had {{witnessed}} nothing untoward" [...] and never saw them together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> Gailey learned afterwards that Huston had recently broken up with Nicholson, but stopped by {{to pick up some}} belongings.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the incident, Nicholson was out of town making a film, but his steady girlfriend, actress Anjelica Huston, had dropped by unannounced to pick up some items. She heard Polanski <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> say [...] "We'll be right out." [...] Polanski then came out with Gailey and he {{introduced}} her to Huston, and they chatted about Nicholson's two large dogs which were sitting nearby. Huston recalled Gailey was wearing platform heels and appeared quite tall.|$|E

The {{music room}} returns to oak woodwork, and {{the dining room}} is walnut. The sliding (pocket) doors between the music room and dining room were crafted of two woods, each side matching the appropriate room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I expect {{they were}} nearer. Perhaps {{some of them}} were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms,</b> where they would be close to the openings. But they were {{probably}} scared too by the noise of the bats, and as the windows behind were too small for them all to fly out together, they made for the light instead." ...|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a central}} hallway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> home with a large parlor on either side. <b>The</b> walls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hallway are {{plastered}} but feature wainscoting on the lower portion. <b>The</b> plastered walls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> are lined with a molded chair rail. The open-string two flights staircase {{is on the left}} side of the main hallway. The staircase features curved brackets and square balusters. An enclosed staircase is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east end parlor.|$|R
2500|$|Listening to {{the backing}} track to [...] "With or Without You" [...] {{in the control}} room, Bono and Friday heard the {{sustained}} effect that the Edge was creating with the Infinite Guitar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> The {{combination of the two}} playing simultaneously caught their attention. According to Lanois, [...] "I said, 'That sounded pretty cool,' so we listened back and I said, 'Jesus it's better than I thought.'" [...] The Edge immediately recorded an Infinite Guitar part in two takes. The band considers the song's recording {{to be one of the}} album sessions' breakthrough moments, as it was recorded amidst concerns that they had run out of ideas.|$|E
2500|$|In the morning, Spade goes to Cairo's hotel, {{where he}} spots Wilmer (Elisha Cook, Jr.), {{a young man}} who had been {{following}} him earlier. He gives Wilmer a message for his boss, Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), the [...] "Fat Man". Spade meets Gutman, who begins to talk about the Falcon, but becomes evasive, causing Spade to storm out. Later, Wilmer takes Spade at gunpoint to see Gutman. Spade overpowers Wilmer, but meets with Gutman anyway. Gutman relates the history of the Maltese Falcon. He offers Spade $25,000 for the bird and a quarter of the proceeds from its sale. Then Spade passes out because his drink had been spiked. Wilmer, Gutman, and Cairo (who had been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room)</b> depart.|$|E
2500|$|The quoted {{fragments}} {{are often}} chosen because they bear a rhythmic or melodic likeness to Mahler's scherzo. For example, Berio uses a violin {{line from the}} second movement of Alban Berg's violin concerto with chromatically descending sixteenth notes two measures before a similarly descending line appears in Mahler's scherzo. This is then accompanied by another violin descent, taken from Johannes Brahms' violin concerto [...] The text from Beckett at this point begins, [...] "So {{after a period of}} immaculate silence there seemed", but, instead of continuing the quotation ("a feeble cry was heard by me"), Berio substitutes the words [...] "to be a violin concerto being played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> in three quarters" [...] and then, after the Berg quotation, alto 2 insists on [...] "two violin concertos", at the point where Berg is interrupted by Brahms [...]|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Lise," [...] she said, {{shifting}} the saucepan {{to another part}} of the stove, [...] "I guess if your father and I had put both you girls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mills and crowded into one room and cooked in a corner, and lived on onions and macaroni, and put four boarders each <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms,</b> I guess we could have had a house, too. We can start in right now, if you're willing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, señor," [...] he said, when in {{ten minutes}} he returned; [...] "none of the walls on this floor are built of stone like this. This was the grand chamber, the stones are all nearly one size, and so well fitted that you can hardly see where they join each <b>other.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> they are not so, but the stones are, as you noticed above, {{irregular}} in size, and although they fit closely, there is no attempt to conceal the cracks." ...|$|R
25|$|The entire play {{takes place}} in one room, “the living room of a large and {{well-appointed}} suburban house”. In that room is a bar, which is well stocked with bottles of liquor. Time changes from Friday night to Saturday evening, then later the same Saturday, and eventually to early Sunday morning, but the setting remains the same.

2500|$|The two undercrofts have {{walls of}} red {{sandstone}} rubble, with brick barrel vaults which were probably {{added in the}} 18thcentury. [...] Leading from the row level to the third storey is a Chinese Chippendale staircase. [...] In the third storey are two rooms. [...] The larger room has an ornate 17th-century plaster ceiling and a massive fireplace; {{it is thought that}} these were moved from the Bishop's Palace in Abbey Square after this was damaged in the Civil War. [...] The smaller room also has a plaster ceiling, less ornate than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> [...] This includes motifs including Tudor roses, horses, and starfish. [...] Around the room is a frieze containing sea-monsters. [...] In this room is a smaller fireplace in the overmantel of which is a carving of Cupid riding on a lion.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, a study {{approved}} by Iowa State University assessed whether prosocial games could promote helpful behavior in children. [...] In this study, children aged 9–14 years old played three {{different types of}} video games. They were first assessed for aggression {{in order to avoid}} confounding. [...] Afterwards, they completed a puzzle task with a partner and then assigned tangrams to a fictitious person in another room. [...] The participants were told that the person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room,</b> who they did not know was not actually real, had an opportunity to win a prize. [...] The children were told they were not eligible for the gift card. [...] The measure for helpful or hurtful behavior was based on how many easy or difficult tangrams they assigned to the fictitious person. [...] Results indicated that playing prosocial games significantly more helpful behaviors in children than those who played violent video games. [...] Conversely, playing violent video games had significantly more hurtful behaviors in children than the children who played prosocial games. [...] Deviations from the expected pattern were also non-significant. [...] The short-term effects observed after only thirty minutes of playing are substantial enough to consider the possibility that the longer amount of time a child plays a video game, the more effect it will have on their behavior. [...] The researchers concluded that playing prosocial games affects a child's social cognition, because it changes their attitudes and affect. [...] It is also important to note that outside the confines of a study, playing a video game may affect how a child acts, {{but it is not the}} only factor present that can affect this.|$|E

The chatting and the laughter died away. The sound of the rustling cards and of the clicking counters had ceased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> Everyone, men and women, had risen to their feet with a constrained expectant expression upon their faces.

50|$|If you’re allowed 60 percent lot {{coverage}} and 55 ft <b>in</b> height and <b>the</b> allowable floor {{area is a}} 2.0 FAR and that gives you three-and-a-half floors, {{what do you do}} with the extra height?

And you want that space <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living room and dining room and maybe the main bedroom, but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> (kitchens, baths, home office etc).
