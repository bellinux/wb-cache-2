5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, neptunium phosphates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste. Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized, both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, neptunium carbonates {{have been investigated}} to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment, where <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Voyagers {{exposure to the}} swarm, Kes (Jennifer Lien) begins eating abnormally, including insects and soil. In sickbay, she has a fever, a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure, and a tumorous growth on her back. She resists the ’s (Robert Picardo) treatment and locks herself in his office, finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she's undergoing the elogium: the Ocampa mating cycle. This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old—but Kes is not even two. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize over whether to have children and the ramifications of becoming parents. After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it. Ultimately, because the Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures' proximity to the ship, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> upon her again later in her life when she is ready.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

It may subsequently become frozen into pack ice (one form of sea ice).

25|$|While {{hydrophobic}} polymers beneficially repel {{water and}} contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the gum base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum {{toward the end of}} the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of the gum product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> in contact.|$|E
25|$|The celebration {{has been}} {{traced back to}} the 14th century but may have earlier, pre-Christian origins {{involving}} the celebration of the March equinox; The origins of the word dyngus are obscure; <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from the German Dingeier ("the eggs that are owed") or Dingnis ("ransom"). The occurrence of the celebration across the western Slav countries (plus Hungary, whose inhabitants' forebears conquered a region that was inhabited by Slavs) suggests a common origin in pagan mythology, most likely a link with the Slavic goddesses of fertility. It may possibly be related to the tradition of watering the Corn Mother, who made crops grow and was represented {{in the form of a}} doll or wreath made from corn. This would be symbolically drenched in water and kept over the winter until its grain was mixed with the seed corn in the spring to ensure a successful harvest. In time, the growing influence of Christianity in Poland incorporated the dyngus celebrations, along with other pagan practices, into Christian festivals like Easter Monday.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{difficulty}} whatsoever in obtaining models of static spherically symmetric stellar models, {{in which a}} perfect fluid interior is matched across a spherical surface, {{the surface of the}} star, to a vacuum exterior which is in fact a region of the Schwarzschild vacuum. [...] In fact, it is possible to write down all these static stellar models in a way which makes clear that they exist in plenitude. [...] Given this success, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> as a nasty shock that it seems to be very difficult, mathematically speaking, to construct rotating stellar models in which a perfect fluid interior is matched to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior.

2500|$|The Geordie word , {{meaning a}} toilet {{and place of}} need and {{necessity}} for relief or bathroom, has an uncertain origin, though some have theorised that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from slang used by Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall, which may have later become [...] in the Romanic Italian language (such as in the Westoe Netty, {{the subject of a}} famous painting from Bob Olley). However, gabbinetto is the Modern Italian diminutive of gabbia, which actually derives from the Latin [...] ("hollow", [...] "cavity", [...] "enclosure"), the root of the loanwords that became the Modern English cave, cage, and gaol.
