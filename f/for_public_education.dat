5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought up for a vote. The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term. Constitutional provision <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>education</b> was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 the RIAL was {{authorized}} to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This {{was a turning point}} <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>education</b> in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an important first step in the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Carroll {{increased}} funding <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>education</b> and promoted {{the use of}} coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016.|$|E
5|$|A Democratic-Republican, Garrard {{opposed the}} Alien and Sedition Acts and favored {{passage of the}} Kentucky Resolutions. He lobbied <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>education,</b> militia and prison reforms, {{business}} subsidies, and legislation favorable to the state's large debtor class. In 1798, the state's first governor's mansion was constructed, and Garrard became its first resident. Due {{in part to the}} confusion resulting from the 1795 election, he favored calling a constitutional convention in 1799. Because of his anti-slavery views, he was not chosen as a delegate to the convention. Under the resulting constitution, the governor was popularly elected and was forbidden from succeeding himself in office, although Garrard was personally exempted from this provision and was re-elected in 1799. During his second term, he applauded Thomas Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana from France as a means of dealing with the closure of the port at New Orleans to U.S. goods. Late in his term, his Secretary of State, Harry Toulmin, persuaded him to adopt some doctrines of Unitarianism, and he was expelled from the Baptist church, ending his ministry. He also clashed with the legislature over the appointment of a registrar for the state land office, leaving him embittered and unwilling to continue in politics after the conclusion of his term. He retired to his estate, Mount Lebanon, and engaged in agricultural and commercial pursuits until his death on January 19, 1822. Garrard County, Kentucky, created during his first term, was named in his honor.|$|E

25|$|The motives {{behind the}} strike were wages, {{establishment}} of a grievance process, reduced workloads and more funding <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>education.</b> However to win on these issues, Shanker and Cogen argued, the city's teachers {{had to be in}} one union. In early 1960 the Teachers Guild merged with a splinter group from the more militant High School Teachers Association to form the United Federation of Teachers (UFT).|$|E
25|$|Currently, the {{predominant}} languages in the Spanish Basque Country and French Basque Country are, respectively, Spanish and French.
