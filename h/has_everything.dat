5|$|Meera (Ayesha Takia), {{a simple}} Rajasthani Hindu woman, <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> {{in her life}} in {{accordance}} with customs and traditions: her formative years, her recent marriage into a traditional Rajasthani family and her daily chores {{within the walls of}} her haveli. Coincidentally, her husband, Shankar, is in Saudi Arabia, his new workplace. Meera finds it tough without her husband but they manage to stay in touch. Shankar regularly sends his wages home to support his family that includes his father, Randhir Singh (Girish Karnad), mother, Gowri Singh (Prateeksha Lonkar), his paternal grandmother (Uttara Baokar) and Meera. One day, Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar. Time passes and when there are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from her husband, Meera gets worried. When frantic inquiries are made, she is devastated to know that Shankar was killed in a freak accident that was allegedly caused by his Muslim roommate.|$|E
25|$|A {{handsome}} young prince {{lives in a}} luxurious castle in France. He <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> he ever wanted, and as a result, he is spoiled, selfish and unkind. One night, his kindness is {{put to the test}} when a beggar woman comes to the castle and asks for shelter from the freezing cold, with a single rose as payment. When he shuns the beggar for her repulsive appearance, she then reveals her true form as a beautiful enchantress. Seeing her beauty and realizing her power, the Prince tries to apologize but she transforms him into a terrifying beast-like creature for his arrogance. She also casts a spell on the entire castle, transforming it into a dark, foreboding place, its lush green grounds into dangerous immortal wolf-infested woods, and the good-natured servants into anthropomorphic household objects to reflect their different personalities. Ashamed of his new appearance, the Beast conceals himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world, and an enchanted rose that would act as the curse's timer which would bloom until he turns 21. If the Beast could learn to love a woman and earn her love in return before the final petal fell off the rose, the curse would be broken, but if not he would remain a beast forever. The Beast turns to despair as the years pass by, with little hope of achieving this.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of {{the game}} {{included}} complaints about the four-disc format {{of the game}}, which required players to swap out the installer disc {{with one of the}} other discs every time the player entered a new Age. GameSpot's Scott Osborne noted that due to the frame-by-frame nature of gameplay, it was occasionally difficult to discern where players were allowed to venture and what areas were unreachable. The Los Angeles Times reported that bugs including a lack of sound, incompatibility with certain graphics cards and system crashes were present in as many as 10 percent of the first shipment of discs.

Bhansali was impressed by Singh's performance in Band Baaja Baaraat and decided to cast him for the film. Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela generated positive reviews from critics, as did Singh's performance. Writing for India Today, Rohit Khilnani commented that [...] "Singh <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> going for him here. His Bollywood hero entry scene lying down on a bike in the song 'Tattad Tattad' is outstanding. He learnt a new language to better his performance for the character Ram and it paid off.

500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Talk, Jason Bovberg praised the episode for its [...] "spooky wonderfulness", {{stating that the}} episode scared his daughter. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "A fun, 'scary' (for little kids) SpongeBob that adults will appreciate, 'Graveyard Shift' uses the old standby of the headless/handless/legless (take your pick) killer-seeking-revenge stories we all told as kids, and cleverly grafts it onto a 'SpongeBob at work' storyline." [...] Mavis added, [...] "I always enjoy it when Rodger Bumpass, the voice actor for Squidward, gets quiet and {{manipulative}} when he's shining SpongeBob on, and here's {{one of the best}} examples of that." [...] He praised Count Orlok's cameo, [...] "especially when they animate the vampire's face into a goofy, giddy smile." [...] Mike Jackson of DVD Verdict said the episode is one of his [...] "personal faves." [...] He also said [...] " [...] <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> that makes the show great: funny dialogue (the whole story of the Hash-Slinging Slasher is hilarious), clever sight gags (especially SpongeBob's regenerating limbs), and that aforementioned outta-nowhere ending that made me bust a gut." ...|$|E

[...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that on the strength of the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will take a couple of episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade." [...] Morgan deemed Irving the star of the show, and commented: [...] "With Irving in the driving seat, Holby City looks like it is on the right track." ...|$|E

[...] Entertainment Wise reviewer Wil Jones also thought that [...] "Call My Name" [...] wasn't innovative, and compared it to other productions by David Guetta, saying, [...] "a bit of a drop there, the same old floor-to-the-floor beat here, a big synth-y chorus that’s meant to be anthemic but isn’t really, over-produced, bland vocals. 'Call My Name' is isn’t by no means terrible, it’s just very blah." [...] Similarly, Jenn Selby of Glamour noted that [...] "Call My Name" [...] bears resemblance to other productions by Harris, yet admitted that she was surprised with the result of their collaboration, while Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said that the song <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> to become the summer's hottest anthem.

[...] Carabott went on to praise the on-screen chemistry of Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond) and Sonya Walger (Penelope), stating that [...] "their on screen chemistry makes the love between the two characters real and makes their inevitable breakup that much harder to handle." [...] He also complimented the scene between Desmond and Charles, saying that [...] "it's hard not to feel Desmond's heart crushed when Widmore denies him Penelope's hand in marriage."

500|$|The episode {{received}} less positive reviews as well. Rahul Gairola of PopMatters wrote that while [...] "the pilot lays the usual groundwork by showing how the characters' lives are intertwined, it also demonstrates immediately the sitcom's major drawback, that the stereotypical gay character is the stand-out comic figure." [...] A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times said [...] "there's something {{not quite right}} about this show's approach to homosexuality... It <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> to do with Will's attitude. It approaches asexual, his gayness appearing to exist solely as a device {{to give him the}} moral authority to repeatedly ridicule the mincing manner of his bandanna-wearing homosexual friend, Jack, without being labeled homophobic." [...] Suite101.com's Hana Lewis thought it was [...] "regrettable" [...] that the pilot's jokes revolved [...] "solely around gay stereotypes and sexual innuendo". Some reviewers were also skeptical {{about the future of the}} show. [...] One such review said, [...] "If Will & Grace can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite football and Ally McBeal, it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little [...] — that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest in one another.

500|$|In the Grand Prix, Max Verstappen broke several records: {{apart from}} being the {{youngest}} ever driver to win a race at 18 years and 228 days, he also was the youngest to stand on a Formula One podium, in both instances breaking Sebastian Vettel's record set at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix by more than two years. Vettel had been 21 years and 2 months at the time. Verstappen also became the youngest driver to lead at least one lap of a Grand Prix, again overcoming a record set by Vettel, at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix. Verstappen also was the first driver born in the 1990s to win a Grand Prix.

500|$|Roger advises Lane {{about how}} to ensnare a client at dinner.

Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, {{but he wants to}} have some fun. The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete on the way home in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he <b>has</b> <b>everything,</b> and Don warns him not to throw it away.|$|E
500|$|David Lynch uses various {{methods of}} {{deception}} in Mulholland Drive. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, {{who seems to}} control film studios, is portrayed by dwarf actor Michael J. Anderson (also from Twin Peaks). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small. During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate [...] "cruel and manipulative" [...] act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only {{to see what she}} senses. In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: [...] "It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> under control, even if we (and Betty) do not." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, IGN named [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] {{the best}} {{episode of the}} third season.

[...] In Entertainment Weeklys 2003 list of the top 25 The Simpsons episodes ever, it was placed sixteenth. In 2003, Rich Weir of AskMen.com placed the episode in second on his list of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He wrote, [...] "As one of the early episodes that helped solidify the show's sharp wit and satirical ability, [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> a classic Simpsons episode should have: gut-busting humor, nifty parody, and some superstar cameos to seal the deal. [...] highlights include a performance by Aerosmith (in a guest-starring role), Bart actually apologizing to Moe for one of his infamous prank calls, and a memorable spoof of Cheers' theme song." [...] In 2003, executive producer Al Jean listed the episode as one of his favorites. Niel Harvey of The Roanoke Times called [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] a [...] "classic bit of Simpsonia." [...] AOL placed the episode sixth on their list of the top 25 Simpsons episodes. In 2006, the members of Aerosmith were collectively named the 24th best Simpsons guest stars by IGN.|$|E
