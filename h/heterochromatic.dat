5|$|Components of the RNAi pathway {{are used}} in many eukaryotes in the {{maintenance}} of the organization and structure of their genomes. Modification of histones and associated induction of heterochromatin formation serves to downregulate genes pre-transcriptionally; this process is referred to as RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS), and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex. In fission yeast this complex contains argonaute, a chromodomain protein Chp1, and a protein called Tas3 of unknown function. As a consequence, the induction and spread of <b>heterochromatic</b> regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins. Indeed, deletion of these genes in the fission yeast S. pombe disrupts histone methylation and centromere formation, causing slow or stalled anaphase during cell division. In some cases, similar processes associated with histone modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} with eyes included attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals {{into the eyes}} of living subjects and killing people with <b>heterochromatic</b> eyes so that the eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to the gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} generally includes 56chromosomes with a {{total of}} 54major arms (2n=56, FN=54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen seems to have a similar karyotype. In this karyotype, all autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and São Paulo, one pair of autosomes contains both an acrocentric and a metacentric chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the metacentric chromosome consists entirely of heterochromatin. Apparently, a whole <b>heterochromatic</b> arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents Peromyscus, Clyomys, and Thaptomys. Both sex chromosomes are acrocentric, and X is larger than Y. In addition to heterochromatin near the centromere, the Y chromosome contains two large blocks of heterochromatin on its long arm. The karyotype is closely similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
25|$|G-banding is {{obtained}} with Giemsa stain following digestion of chromosomes with trypsin. It yields {{a series of}} lightly and darkly stained bands — the dark regions tend to be <b>heterochromatic,</b> late-replicating and AT rich. The light regions tend to be euchromatic, early-replicating and GC rich. This method will normally produce 300–400 bands in a normal, human genome.|$|E
25|$|The genomic loci {{and length}} of certain types of small {{repetitive}} sequences are highly variable from person to person, which {{is the basis of}} DNA fingerprinting and DNA paternity testing technologies. The <b>heterochromatic</b> portions of the human genome, which total several hundred million base pairs, are also thought to be quite variable within the human population (they are so repetitive and so long that they cannot be accurately sequenced with current technology). These regions contain few genes, and it is unclear whether any significant phenotypic effect results from typical variation in repeats or heterochromatin.|$|E
25|$|The Malayan tapir, {{the species}} most {{isolated}} geographically {{from the rest}} of the genus, has a significantly smaller number of chromosomes and has been found to share fewer homologies with the three types of American tapirs. A number of conserved autosomes (13 between karyotypes of Baird's tapir and the Brazilian tapir, and 15 between Baird's and the mountain tapir) have also been found in the American species that are not found in the Asian animal. However, geographic proximity is not an absolute predictor of genetic similarity; for instance, G-banded preparations have revealed Malayan, Baird's and Brazilian tapirs have identical X chromosomes, while mountain tapirs are separated by a <b>heterochromatic</b> addition/deletion.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian species differ {{considerably}} in heterochromatin content and location. Heterochromatin {{is most often}} detected using C-banding. Early studies using C-banding showed that differences in the fundamental number (i.e., the number of chromosome arms) could be entirely due to the addition of <b>heterochromatic</b> chromosome arms. Heterochromatin consists {{of different types of}} repetitive DNA, not all seen with C-banding that can vary greatly between karyotypes of even closely related species. The differences of the amount of heterochromatin among congeneric rodent species may reach 33% of nuclear DNA in Dipodomys species, 36% in Peromyscus species, 42% in Ammospermophilus and 60% in Thomomys species where C-value (haploid DNA content) ranges between 2.1 and 5.6 pg.|$|E
2500|$|Cytogenetic {{preparations}} {{that have}} been stained by either Giemsa or C-banding techniques will show two characteristic chromosomal abnormalities. The first chromosomal abnormality is called premature centromere separation (PCS) and {{is the most likely}} pathogenic mechanism for Roberts syndrome. Chromosomes that have PCS will have their centromeres separate during metaphase rather than anaphase (one phase earlier than normal chromosomes). The second chromosomal abnormality is called heterochromatin repulsion (HR). Chromosomes that have HR experience separation of the <b>heterochromatic</b> regions during metaphase. Chromosomes with these two abnormalities will display a [...] "railroad track" [...] appearance because of the absence of primary constriction and repulsion at the <b>heterochromatic</b> regions. The <b>heterochromatic</b> regions are the areas near the centromeres and nucleolar organizers. Carrier status cannot be determined by cytogenetic testing. Other common findings of cytogenetic testing on Roberts syndrome patients are listed below.|$|E
2500|$|R-banding is {{the reverse}} of G-banding (the R stands for [...] "reverse"). The dark regions are {{euchromatic}} (guanine-cytosine rich regions) and the bright regions are <b>heterochromatic</b> (thymine-adenine rich regions).|$|E
2500|$|Maize is a diploid with 20 {{chromosomes}} (n=10). The combined {{length of}} the chromosomes is 1500 cM. Some of the maize chromosomes have {{what are known as}} [...] "chromosomal knobs": highly repetitive <b>heterochromatic</b> domains that stain darkly. Individual knobs are polymorphic among strains of both maize and teosinte.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the human}} genome has been {{completely}} sequenced for all practical purposes, there are still hundreds of gaps in the sequence. A recent study noted more than 160 euchromatic gaps of which 50 gaps were closed. [...] However, there are still numerous gaps in the <b>heterochromatic</b> parts of the genome which is much harder to sequence due to numerous repeats and other intractable sequence features.|$|E
2500|$|Differences {{in degree}} and {{distribution}} of <b>heterochromatic</b> regions. [...] Heterochromatin stains darker than euchromatin. [...] Heterochromatin is packed tighter. [...] Heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive DNA sequences as well as containing a larger amount of Adenine-Thymine pairs. [...] Euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the giemsa stain. Euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of Guanine-Cytosine pairs. The staining technique using giemsa staining is called G banding and therefore produces the typical [...] "G-Bands".|$|E
2500|$|Also, {{great variety}} {{is seen in}} the Aussie's eye color, and they are often <b>heterochromatic.</b> An early {{nickname}} for the breed was [...] "ghost-eye dog". Aussie eyes may be any shade of brown, or blue; they may have two differently colored eyes, or even have bicolored or [...] "split eyes" [...] (for example, a half-brown, half-blue eye), which appear to be linked to the merle coloration. Merled eyes occur, as well, where one color is mixed in and swirled with another. Any combination of eye color is acceptable in the breed standard, so long as the eyes are healthy. In general, however, black Aussies (self, bi-color, or tri-color) tend to have brown eyes, while red (self, bi-color, or tri-color) Aussies tend to have amber eyes, though these Aussies may also carry the blue-eyed gene. [...] These dogs are also brown in color.|$|E
2500|$|The genome of D. melanogaster (sequenced in 2000, and curated at the FlyBase database) {{contains}} four {{pairs of}} chromosomes: an X/Y pair, and three autosomes labeled 2, 3, and 4. The fourth chromosome is so tiny, {{it is often}} ignored, aside from its important eyeless gene. The D. melanogaster sequenced genome of 139.5 million base pairs has been annotated and contains around 15,682 genes according to Ensemble release 73. More than 60% of the genome appears to be functional non-protein-coding DNA involved in gene expression control. Determination of sex in Drosophila occurs by the [...] of X chromosomes to autosomes, {{not because of the}} presence of a Y chromosome as in human sex determination. Although the Y chromosome is entirely <b>heterochromatic,</b> it contains at least 16 genes, many of which are thought to have male-related functions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959 Susumu Ohno {{showed that}} the two X-chromosomes of mammals were different: [...] one {{appeared}} similar to the autosomes; the other was condensed and <b>heterochromatic.</b> [...] This finding suggested, independently to two groups of investigators, {{that one of the}} X-chromosomes underwent inactivation. [...] In 1961, Mary Lyon proposed the random inactivation of one female X chromosome to explain the mottled phenotype of female mice heterozygous for coat color genes. The Lyon hypothesis also accounted for the findings that one copy of the X chromosome in female cells was highly condensed, and that mice with only one copy of the X chromosome developed as infertile females. [...] This suggested to Ernest Beutler, studying heterozygous females for Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, that there were two red cell populations of erythrocytes in such heterozygotes: deficient cells and normal cells, depending on whether the inactivated X chromosome contains the normal or defective G6PD allele.|$|E

5000|$|R-banding is {{the reverse}} of G-banding (the R stands for [...] "reverse"). The dark regions are {{euchromatic}} (guanine-cytosine rich regions) and the bright regions are <b>heterochromatic</b> (thymine-adenine rich regions).|$|E
5000|$|Cohesin rings, {{especially}} in budding yeast, are also {{located in the}} region surrounding the centromere. Two hypotheses may explain this: the presence of repetitive <b>heterochromatic</b> DNA in centromeres {{and the presence of}} chromosome-associated proteins. For example, Schizosaccharomyces pombe have multiple copies of specific <b>heterochromatic</b> DNA whose involvement in cohesion binding has been proven. Budding yeast lacks repetitive sequences and, therefore, requires a different mechanism for cohesion binding. Evidence suggests that binding of cohesin to the budding yeast centromere region depends on chromosome-associated proteins of the kinetochore that mediate cohesion association to pericentric regions (the kinetochore is an enhancer of pericentric cohesin binding).|$|E

50|$|Studies in {{transgenic}} mice {{have shown}} that deletion of the β-globin LCR causes the region of chromosome to condense into a <b>heterochromatic</b> state. This leads to decreased expression of β-globin genes, which can cause β-thalassemia in humans and mice.|$|E

50|$|Bartel also {{discovered}} several {{other types of}} regulatory RNAs, including <b>heterochromatic</b> siRNAs, which silence DNA instead of RNA. In addition, Bartel is investigating the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and how the untranslated regions and tails of mRNAs recruit and mediate regulatory phenomena.|$|E
50|$|Heterochromatin mainly {{consists}} of genetically inactive satellite sequences, and many genes are repressed to various extents, although some cannot {{be expressed in}} euchromatin at all.

50|$|The {{primary role}} of CTCF {{is thought to}} be in {{regulating}} the 3D structure of chromatin. CTCF binds together strands of DNA, thus forming chromatin loops, and anchors DNA to cellular structures like the nuclear lamina. It also defines the boundaries between active and <b>heterochromatic</b> DNA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heterochromatic</b> {{brightness}} matching: Wyszecki {{and co-workers}} also added important experimental {{data to the}} luminance of equally bright stimuli. Many chromatic stimuli, when compared to achromatic ones of the same psychophysical brightness or lightness appear to be lighter or brighter, to be “glowing,” an effect known as the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to a very high mutation burden, MMR deficiencies result in an unusual distribution of somatic mutations across the human genome: this suggests that MMR preferentially protects the gene-rich, early-replicating euchromatic regions. In contrast, the gene-poor, late-replicating <b>heterochromatic</b> genome regions exhibit high mutation rates in many human tumors.|$|E

50|$|The genome of C. rhomboideum {{is smaller}} than that of C. annuum. In the {{specific}} differentiation, C. rhomboideum likely underwent genome size reduction. Approximately 5% of the genome is <b>heterochromatic.</b> The typical Capsicum has 2n=24, and since 2n=26 in C. rhomboideum , causing it to be reclassified from Capsicum ciliatum in 2001.|$|E
50|$|A {{common cause}} in females with {{heterochromia}} is X-inactivation, which {{can result in}} a number of <b>heterochromatic</b> traits, such as calico cats. Trauma and certain medications, such as some prostaglandin analogues, can also cause increased pigmentation in one eye. On occasion, a difference in eye color is caused by blood staining the iris after injury.|$|E
