40|$|Polarimeter is {{a device}} that uses the {{principle}} of polarization, ie a beam that is passed by the polarizer in various forms of polarized light. The polarized beam can be shaped linear polarization, circular polarization and elliptical polarization. Polarized light beam that has been passed to the analyzer. Analyzer {{is the recipient of}} a polarized light beam from the polarizer. Polarimeter in organic chemistry {{can be used as a}} tool to determine the optical rotation, concentration and composition of optical isomers in a solution or mixture rasemik. Castor oil is a vegetable oil obtained from Jatropha seed extraction (ricinus communis), in the field of pharmaceuticals is also known as castor oil. Gasoline is a non-polar solvent that dissolves the most perfect for a variety of oils including castor oil, and therefore gasoline is a solvent used in the lab this polarimeter. Practicum with a polarimeter performed by using a variable that is <b>fixed</b> <b>castor</b> oil 10 ml and 20 ml of castor oil as well as variables that change with the addition of gasoline each 1 ml, 2 ml, 3 ml, and 4 ml for kurvet I, while for kurvet II added each 2 ml, 4 ml, 6 ml and 8 ml. To kurvet I in one variable has an optical rotation of 104. 5 °, then the second variable optical rotation of 103 °, a third variable that has an optical rotation of 100. 5 °, all four variables had an optical rotation of 98. 5, while the fifth has a variable optical rotation of 95 °. To kurvet II on one variable has an optical rotation of 108 °, then the second variable has an optical rotation of 106. 5 °, the third variable has an optical rotation of 105 °, the fourth variable optical rotation of 102. 5 °, while the fifth has a variable optical rotation of 100. 5...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Comparative data on {{the species}} {{composition}} and species saprobic indicators of the psammon ciliates from Sumgait coast of the Caspian Sea are given. Methods. “Alive” samples were collected using a small clean plastic wide mouth bottles. Further processing was carried out under laboratory conditions. Small quantities of soil were examined under a binocular microscope MBS- 9. Ciliates detected microvessel caught and <b>fixed</b> <b>castors</b> for further impregnation kinetoma silver nitrate (Chatton et Lwoff, 1930) or silver proteinate.  To determine the keys for ciliates used Foyssner’s major publications (Foissner et al., 1991, 1992, 1999) and “Free-living ciliates Atlas” (Alekperov, 2005). Results. We observed 75 species of ciliates during the studies, which species composition and distribution of the collection points {{are shown in table}} 1. Diagrams with average data were made relations groups psammophilous ciliates indicators saprobity different zones for each of the sites investigated Sumgait coast. Main conclusions. Environmental analysis using benthic ciliates indicators saprobity different zones showed that as expected, the industrial zone of Sumgayit coast coast, despite the decline in recent years, the total amount of pollution that is still highly contaminated portion of the coastal zone of the Caspian Sea. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{n-hexane}} and aqueous extracts of {{the leaves}} ofAegle marmelos have been examined anti-pyretic andantidiarrhoeal activities, and phytochemical screening. Materials and methods: Yeast-induced hyperthermia test wasused for antipyretic activity. For both the extracts, rectaltemperatures were measured at <b>fixed</b> intervals. <b>Castor</b> oilinduceddiarrhoea test was used for antidiarrhoeal activity. Forboth the extracts, the droppings were collected at fixedintervals. The phytochemical screening was done according tothe methods described in the literature. Result: The results indicated good anti-pyretic activity for theaqueous extract and good antidiarrhoeal activity for the nhexaneextract of Aegle marmelos. Conclusion: The {{results of the study}} supported the traditionaluse of plant as a crude anti-pyretic and antidiarrhoeal drug...|$|R
40|$|Abstract− − A generic {{kinematic}} control, {{which is}} directly applicable to {{any type of}} wheeled mobile robot, is proposed in this work. Firstly, it is pre-sented the kinematic models of the four common types of wheels (<b>fixed,</b> centered orientable, <b>castor</b> and Swedish) a classification of wheeled mobile robots. Afterwards, it is proposed a kinematic control scheme with three nested loops: dynamic, kinematic and planning. In particular, it is studied in depth the kinematic loop through the position control and the inverse kinematics of wheels. It is also studied indi-rectly the planning loop through the characterization of the references that each type of mobile robot can track with no error. Finally, the kinematic control proposed is applied to an industrial forklift in simu-lation and in a real situation. Keywords− − Kinematic control, wheeled mobile robots, tracking references, nested loops. I...|$|R
