25|$|Modern {{nuclear reactor}} designs have had {{numerous}} safety improvements {{since the first}} generation nuclear reactors. Nuclear power plants cannot explode like a nuclear bomb because the fuel for uranium reactors is not enriched enough, and nuclear weapons require precision explosives to force fuel into a small enough volume to go supercritical. Most reactors require continuous temperature control to prevent a core meltdown, which has occurred on a few occasions through accident or natural disaster, releasing radiation and making the surrounding area uninhabitable. Plants must be defended against theft of nuclear material (for example to make a <b>dirty</b> <b>bomb)</b> and attack by enemy military (which has occurred) planes or missiles, or planes hijacked by terrorists.|$|E

500|$|After the American {{invasion}} of Afghanistan fails to uproot the alleged terrorist organisation, the Bush administration focuses inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist sleeper cells in America. In 2003, they extend the War on Terror {{to a war}} on general perceived evils with the {{invasion of}} Iraq. The ideas and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom, where Tony Blair uses {{the threat of terrorism}} to give him a new moral authority. The repercussions of the neoconservative strategy are also explored, with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in Guantanamo Bay, many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance without actual investigation {{on the part of the}} United States military, and other forms of [...] "preemption" [...] against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved had the potential to become a threat.
