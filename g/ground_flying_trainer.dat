50|$|The Fort was {{originally}} designed as an advanced <b>flying</b> <b>trainer</b> and in 1940 orders were placed for 200 {{to be built}} for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The Fleet 60 {{was designed as a}} monoplane with a low elliptical wing and a raised rear cockpit. An unusual feature was the fixed undercarriage. Although fixed, the undercarriage was fitted with a retractable fairing. This feature was intended to familiarize student pilots with an undercarriage retraction mechanism but without causing external damage by a forgetful student.|$|R

The Victoria continued in service until 1935, although many were converted to Valentias, which remained in use until well into the Second World War.|$|R
