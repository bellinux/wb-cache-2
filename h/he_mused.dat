25|$|Gould left an {{extensive}} {{body of work}} beyond the keyboard. After his retirement from concert performance, he was increasingly interested in other media, including audio and film documentary and writing, through which <b>he</b> <b>mused</b> on aesthetics, composition, music history, {{and the effect of}} the electronic age on the consumption of media. (Gould grew up in Toronto {{at the same time that}} Canadian theorists Marshall McLuhan, Northrop Frye, and Harold Innis were making their mark on communications studies.) Anthologies of his writing and letters have been published. Library and Archives Canada retains a significant portion of Gould's work called The Glenn Gould Archive.|$|E
25|$|Falcone {{received}} an effusive congratulatory {{phone call from}} Giulio Andreotti after the narrow escape. Falcone privately thought it odd that Andreotti, who he had never spoken to, would suddenly contact him, and <b>he</b> <b>mused</b> {{about the significance of}} the incident to a friend. Unknown to Falcone the efforts to kill him were suspended while the Maxi trial verdicts went through the appeals process that had often set convicted Mafia members free. Later investigations into the murders of two police officers, Antonino Agostino and Emanuele Piazza, who worked for the secret service, revealed that they had secretly defused the bombs that had been placed by a Mafia commando aided by other secret service men. Agostino and his wife were killed on 5 August 1989 outside their home, and Piazza on 15 March 1990.|$|E
25|$|Central to Billy Jaynes Chandler's {{analysis}} is Giuliano's personality and psychology. The bandit definitely {{saw himself as}} a romantic, heroic figure. <b>He</b> <b>mused</b> about his epitaph: “Here lies Giuliano, hero of Sicily.” He made photos of himself heroically astride a horse, labeled, “Robin Hood.” He cultivated his image carefully, {{with an eye on}} history. He was, according to Chandler, audacious (turning the tables on the Carabinieri Christmas Eve, 1943), intelligent and astute (when negotiating with EVIS and, later, with Sicily's power brokers). At the same time, he was unsophisticated and naive—an inexperienced village boy negotiating with far more worldly men when he played politics. Compounding his naivete' was his monumental ego and overly-grand self-conception. Maria Lombardo shared his conception—she told Michael Stern that the three outstanding personages of history were Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and her son, Turi. Eric Hobsbawm agrees with Chandler's assessment of the bandit, emphasizing the role of the MIS leaders in persuading Giuliano see himself as a major political player.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} the 1951–52 season with 41 points, Bentley contemplated his future in hockey.

[...] He only played in 36 games in 1952–53 after suffering a back injury, but reached 500 career points on November 5, 1952, with two goals against the Rangers.|$|E
500|$|Fermi wrote a paper [...] "On the Origin of Cosmic Radiation" [...] {{in which}} he {{proposed}} that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space, {{which led to a}} difference of opinion with Teller. Fermi examined the issues surrounding magnetic fields in the arms of a spiral galaxy. <b>He</b> <b>mused</b> about what is now referred to as the [...] "Fermi paradox": the contradiction between the presumed probability of the existence of extraterrestrial life and the fact that contact has not been made.|$|E

500|$|Producer No I.D. {{spoke about}} the history of the beat, and noted that it was offered to both Drake and Jay-Z before West finally decided to use it himself. According to him, {{producers}} RZA and Pete Rock had already recorded certain portions of the song, and that he and West recorded the chorus parts. Following that, <b>he</b> <b>mused</b> [...] "then Nicki did the intro and it went crazy. That’s one of my favorite records, just because of all the emotions that came with it.” ...|$|E
500|$|A year later, {{while working}} with Tin Machine on their second album, <b>he</b> <b>mused</b> on his {{previous}} few albums: [...] "You can tell I was terribly unhappy {{in the late}} '80s. ... I was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance. It was an awful trip. 1983, '84, '85, '86, '87 - those five years were simply dreadful. ... Never Let Me Down had good songs that I mistreated. I didn't really apply myself. I wasn't quite sure what I {{was supposed to be}} doing. I wish there had been someone around who could have told me." ...|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazines Ed Gonzales {{compared}} {{the film to}} Dario Argento's work, citing Raimi's [...] "unnerving wide angle work" [...] as an important factor to the film's atmosphere. <b>He</b> <b>mused</b> that Raimi possessed an [...] "almost unreal ability to suggest the presence of intangible evil", which was what prevented the movie from being [...] "B-movie schlock". BBC critic Martyn Glanville awarded the film four stars out of five, writing that for Raimi, it served as a better debut film than Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left. Glanville noted that other than the [...] "ill-advised trees-that-rape scene", the film is [...] "one of the great modern horror films, and even more impressive when one considers its modest production values." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Power" [...] {{marked a}} stylistic return to hip hop for West after the sparse electro of 808s & Heartbreak. It has been {{described}} as surreal, frightening, dark, and strange in nature. The production of [...] "Power" [...] centers on samples of [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] by English progressive rock band King Crimson, [...] "Afromerica" [...] by French disco act Continent Number 6, and [...] "It's Your Thing" [...] by American funk band Cold Grits. The song's production is reinforced with a vocal harmony provided by Dwele, with a line delivery mostly inspired by braggadocio rapping methods. The song {{has been described}} as dark thematically and was called [...] "apocalyptic". According to Alex Denney of NME, the track is the first moment of catharsis on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, stating that the track made use of [...] "tribal fanfare and supercharged lyrics". <b>He</b> <b>mused</b> that lines like “I guess every superhero need his theme music” appear to be West's imagining of a warm welcome to heaven. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal described West's delivery as urgent, summarizing the production; ...|$|E
500|$|Though Townsend {{was proud}} {{of what he had}} {{accomplished}} so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. [...] "I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality," [...] he later reflected. [...] "This combination was appalling." [...] He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music. [...] "I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve," [...] <b>he</b> <b>mused.</b> While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend {{received a phone call from}} an A representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as [...] "just noise".|$|E
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, <b>he</b> <b>mused</b> that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Katrina Trinko, of the National Review, wrote that, [...] "ultimately, Cain views {{himself as}} “Barack Obama’s worst nightmare!” <b>He</b> <b>muses</b> that perhaps his parents {{should have made}} his middle name David because that Biblical figure “defeated a giant against the odds.” For Cain, that’s the goal in 2012." ...|$|R

500|$|Ross favorably {{compared}} the recording sessions to his past in school. <b>He</b> <b>mused,</b> [...] "it's like everybody is a student: You {{walk into a}} session, and it's all about the subject at hand." [...] The remastered album version featured a new guitar solo, composed by producer Bink!. Bink! is most famous for his contributions to Jay-Z's album, The Blueprint, which has been described a [...] "pioneering album" [...] by Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal and was West's big break as a producer. West and Bink! originally became friends while producing another Jay-Z album, [...] in the late 1990s. Bink! described that the two producers quickly developed a mutual respect for each other. Bink! commented on {{the first time he}} showed the composition to West, saying [...] "the reaction I got from him after I played the beat for the first time was real intense." [...] Immediately Bink! knew that West was going to use the production. Initially, he wasn't sure whether or how West was going to use the song for his album, and expressed surprise that West dropped the song as a free track prior to the album's release.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Ricky Vela joined Selena y Los Dinos {{as their}} keyboardist. Although Vela was {{attracted}} to the group's drummer, Suzette Quintanilla, he kept his feelings to himself. When he confessed his feelings to Suzette's brother, group manager Abraham Quintanilla, III, he began teasing him about it. After Suzette's September 1993 marriage, Vela wrote [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] and {{it was given to}} Selena to record for Amor Prohibido. Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla did not find the song to have any potential; he has said that he later had a change of heart. Although the song was originally intended as a mariachi track, EMI Latin president Jose Behar believed that a mariachi recording would not appeal to the popular market. The group gave it to Argentine arranger Bebu Silvetti to rework into a pop-style track, and Behar asked Silvetti to [...] "sweeten" [...] the song to boost its airplay and chart performance. The result enhanced Selena's pop-radio success. Behar said in a Billboard interview that the song was [...] "internalized" [...] without affecting the originality of its recording. In a 2002 interview, A.B. said that during a recording session he had asked Selena to record the song for a fifth time. The singer replied, [...] "What you got there is what you got" [...] and left to go shopping. <b>He</b> <b>mused,</b> [...] "Now looking back, she really did a beautiful job when recording the song, she had so much passion. The song became a classic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cook {{occasionally}} {{called in}} to Clive Bull's night-time phone-in radio show on LBC in London. Using the name [...] "Sven from Swiss Cottage," [...] <b>he</b> <b>mused</b> on love, loneliness and herrings in a mock Norwegian accent. Jokes included Sven's attempts to find his estranged wife, in which he often claimed to be telephoning the show {{from all over the}} world, and his hatred of the Norwegian obsession with fish. While Bull was clearly aware that Sven was fictional he did not learn of his real identity until later.|$|E
50|$|Written in 1971, the {{coincidence}} with the Vietnam War {{has not been}} missed as it rails against the romanticising of war.

5000|$|This {{implication}} occurs {{specifically in}} the 1986 minicomic entitled [...] "The Search for Keldor", a story that involves Prince Adam and Randor searching for Randor's lost brother Keldor.

2500|$|Author Robert Lacey {{quotes a}} fatwa by bin Baz urging caution towards {{claims that the}} Americans had landed on the moon. [...] "We must make careful checks {{whenever}} the kuffar [...] or faseqoon [...] tell us something: we cannot believe or disbelieve them until we get sufficient proof on which the Muslims can depend." [...] Lacey states that [...] "after extensive research" [...] of bin Baz's fatawa, he (Lacey) had only {{been able to find}} this one fatwa on the subject, and no statement in it that the earth was flat. Lacey does however say that according to his source, Bin Baz gave an interview after publishing the article [...] "in which <b>he</b> <b>mused</b> on how we operate day to day on the basis that the ground beneath us is flat ... and it led him to the belief that he was not afraid to voice and for which he became notorious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Friedrich Solmsen, {{sometimes}} called [...] "Fritz" [...] {{by friends and}} intimates, was born and educated in Germany. He was among the [...] "Graeca" [...] of Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, the Graeca being a group of [...] "young scholars" [...] who met in his home during his last decade of life to read a Greek author with a view toward emending the text. In an essay fifty years later, Solmsen recalled those years and the legendary philologist in a biographical sketch that combines politico-historical perspective, sociology of academia, and personal, sometimes wry observations. [...] "I do not recall Wilamowitz ever laughing aloud," [...] <b>he</b> <b>mused</b> in a footnoted aside. [...] "Nor did he ever grin." [...] Solmsen was also a student of Eduard Norden, Otto Regenbogen, and Werner Jaeger, to the three of whom along with Wilamowitz he dedicated {{the first volume of}} his collected papers. He {{was one of the last}} people to whom the terminally ill Wilamowitz addressed correspondence.|$|E
2500|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} to observe the rings of Saturn in 1610 using his telescope, but was unable to {{identify}} them as such. He wrote to the Duke of Tuscany that [...] "The planet Saturn is not alone, but is composed of three, which almost touch one another and never move nor change with respect to one another. They are arranged in a line parallel to the zodiac, and the middle one (Saturn itself) is about {{three times the size of}} the lateral ones." [...] He also described the rings as Saturn's [...] "ears". In 1612 the Earth passed through the plane of the rings and they became invisible. Mystified, Galileo remarked [...] "I do not know what to say in a case so surprising, so unlooked for and so novel." [...] <b>He</b> <b>mused,</b> [...] "Has Saturn swallowed his children?" [...] — referring to the myth of the Titan Saturn devouring his offspring to forestall the prophecy of them overthrowing him. He was further confused when the rings again became visible in 1613.|$|E

5000|$|However, not all reviews were so complimentary. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk, in {{a review}} of the It Came From the Nightosphere DVD, called the episode [...] "primitive" [...] and noted that the episode [...] "has a sense of being locked to a {{traditional}} story structure", a structure that <b>he</b> <b>muses</b> later episodes do not have.|$|R
