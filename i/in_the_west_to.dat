5|$|Muqarnas are elaborately carved {{ceilings}} to semi-domes, {{often used}} in mosques. They are typically made of stucco (and thus {{do not have a}} structural function), but can also be of wood, brick, and stone. They are characteristic of Islamic architecture of the Middle Ages from Spain and Morocco <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>to</b> Persia in the east. Architecturally they form multiple tiers of squinches, diminishing in size as they rise. They are often elaborately decorated.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, or perceived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>to</b> be allied with communists.

Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} {{language has}} seven monophthong vowel phonemes. They are aligned into three vowel harmony groups by a parameter called ATR (advanced tongue root); {{the groups are}} ATR, +ATR, and neutral. This alignment seems to have superseded an alignment according to oral backness. However, some scholars still describe Mongolian as being characterized by a distinction between front vowels and back vowels, and the front vowel spellings 'ö' and 'ü' are still often used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>to</b> indicate two vowels which were historically front. The Mongolian vowel system also has rounding harmony.|$|E
