25|$|The true reason, then, why Hegelism {{can give}} {{no reason for}} the Time-process, i.e. {{for the fact that}} the world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, is that it was {{constructed}} to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' you can get it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will enable you to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience. And it is part of the price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset as irrelevant to a rational explanation.|$|E

According to the Chief Justice, [...] "The moment you change the criterion and distort the policy, it ceases to be FCFS policy. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> on making payment at the last minute after changing the cut-off date, then it is not FCFS, it is an out-of-turn policy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, and I think I said--didn't I? that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insisted</b> upon {{following}} these spiritual exercises, the result {{might be that}} they would return upon you in some concrete shape, and take possession of you, and lead you into company and surroundings which most of us think it wholesome to avoid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Challenger, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really <b>insist</b> upon {{being the}} first man in," [...] said Lord John, when every {{preparation}} was complete.|$|R
6000|$|He related what Scott had said, and added: [...] "Anyhow, let's {{go on for}} a fortnight. Then <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist,</b> we'll {{take the}} back trail." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Permit me,' Mrs Wilfer interposed, with outstretched glove. 'No. I think not. I drank to your papa. <b>If,</b> however, <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> on {{including}} me, I can in gratitude {{offer no}} objection.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And no wonder, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>insist</b> upon {{coming up}} ladders head downwards. Where's John? He {{will help you}} to your cabin; the deck one, next to mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I'll have to, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist.</b> If ever I'm the {{grasping}} {{owner of}} the biggest farm in this district I'll blame you," [...] he answered.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard from}} Aunt Bessie not long ago," [...] Helen stated. [...] "She is afraid {{that you will}} spoil your arms <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> upon so much practising." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stewart, {{certainly}} I cannot remain here longer <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> upon my going. But why {{not listen}} to me when I want so much to help you? Why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is no use {{addressing}} your absent aunt--if {{you have}} got one. What did <b>you</b> expect <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would <b>insist</b> on coming to a hell like this?" [...] I asked gloomily.|$|R
6000|$|... "I misdoubt {{the wisdom}} of the trip," [...] said he, [...] "but I'll go, of course, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> all <b>insist.</b> Over the Rocky Mountains and across the Great American Desert in an {{automobile}} doesn't sound very enticing, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cook,' {{said the}} lady abbess, with great dignity; 'don't answer me, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please. I <b>insist</b> upon your {{looking into the}} garden immediately.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will do {{her much}} more {{good if you}} sympathise with her in her {{innocent}} pleasures than <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> on dragging her into what she feels like privations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In that case, {{there is}} no more to be said. I'd much rather hang about and try to get adopted by a millionaire, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> on my working--Waiter!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{money can}} be raised," [...] Wisbech broke in quietly. [...] "I'll buy that stock for you, and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> on it, you can treat it as a loan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Harding {{answered}} shortly, [...] "I make none. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had <b>insisted</b> on Miss Mowbray's marrying Brand, I {{might have}} had something to say. All I ask is that you give her a free choice; if she uses it to take somebody else, I won't complain." ...|$|R
60|$|Secondly, he {{prevents}} a worse fraud, which is, {{the buying}} and selling such counterfeit money. This was a very wicked, but open trade, in former days, and may in time come to be so again: fellows went about the streets, crying 'Brass money, broken or whole;' that is to say, they would give good money for bad. It was at first pretended that they were obliged to cut it in pieces, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insisted</b> upon it, they would cut it in pieces before your face; but they as often got it without that ceremony, and so made what wicked shifts they could to get it off again, and many times did put it off for current money, after they had bought it for a trifle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose it}} did," [...] agreed Jane. [...] "Billy {{has always been}} far too shy to think of courting. But you might think it over, Anne. Billy is a good fellow. I must say that, if he is my brother. He has no bad habits and he's a great worker, and you can depend on him. 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.' He told {{me to tell you}} he'd be quite willing to wait till you got through college, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insisted,</b> though he'd RATHER get married this spring before the {{planting}} begins. He'd always be very good to you, I'm sure, and you know, Anne, I'd love to have you for a sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, well," [...] {{said the}} assenting Pitman, [...] "I rather counted on them; but of course, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist.</b> And at any rate, {{here is the}} cart at the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{make up your}} mind,' {{said the}} Ethiopian, 'because I'd hate to go hunting without you, but I must <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> on looking like a sun-flower against a tarred fence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have some whiskey," [...] {{returned}} Cronshaw, {{passing over}} the bottle. [...] "There's {{nothing like it}} for clearing the head. You must expect to be thick-witted <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> upon drinking beer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it is now}} evening," [...] the King {{reminded}} them, [...] "and {{you must}} stay with us until morning, anyhow.

6000|$|... "I am not," [...] she admitted. [...] "I {{would not}} have told <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had not <b>insisted.</b> It {{is the result of}} my own folly, and there is no use complaining." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vincy, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> on quarrelling with me, {{it will be}} {{exceedingly}} {{painful to}} Harriet as well as myself," [...] said Mr. Bulstrode, with a trifle more eagerness and paleness than usual.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> upon it," [...] Coleyard drawled out, with languid reluctance, [...] "I'll play, of course. I won't spoil your evening. But remember, I'm a poet; I have strange inspirations." ...|$|E
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE. Well, elegance if you like. Luxury, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>insist.</b> Call it {{what you}} please. A house that costs {{less than a hundred}} {{thousand}} dollars a year to run is intolerable to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no good saying 'Sir?' You know it was. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had not <b>insisted</b> on his {{going to}} that dance--a mad project, as I spotted from the first--this would not have happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gunch was roaring, [...] "Well, I'll take a chance--" [...] when Frink held up {{his hand}} and went on, [...] "So <b>if</b> Verg and <b>you</b> <b>insist,</b> Georgie, I'll park my car {{on the wrong side of}} the street, because I take it for granted that's the crime you're hinting at!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wall, stranger, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>insist</b> on knowin'," [...] said he, [...] "It's sympathy {{that makes}} me grin.

But you're wrong, stranger," [...] {{continued}} the driver, with a grave look, [...] "quite wrong in callin' me a koonisquat.
