5|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} position, the foramen {{is used as}} an anatomical landmark during neurosurgery. As a landmark, the foramen spinosum reveals the positions of other cranial foramina, the mandibular nerve and trigeminal ganglion, foramen ovale, and foramen rotundum. It may also be relevant in achieving <b>haemostasis</b> during trauma surgery.|$|E
5|$|When {{warfarin}} is newly started, it may promote clot formation temporarily. This {{is because}} the level of protein C and protein S are also dependent on vitamin K activity. Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead {{to a reduction in}} activity of protein C (for which it is the co-factor) and therefore reduced degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Although loading doses of warfarin over 5mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII, resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The <b>haemostasis</b> system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5mg per day, it is beneficial to co-administer heparin, an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, with warfarin therapy for four to five days, in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved.|$|E
25|$|This test mildly {{activates}} {{the contact}} phase of <b>haemostasis.</b> The result {{is influenced by}} coagulation factors, platelets, fibrinogen and heparin. Low molecular weight heparin is detected at higher concentrations. In the absence of heparin, INTEM is a screening test for the <b>haemostasis</b> system. It is used for therapeutic decisions regarding the administration of fresh frozen plasma, coagulation factors, fibrinogen or platelets.|$|E
25|$|In {{the revised}} system of {{classification}} again {{adopted by the}} Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and <b>Haemostasis,</b> type II antithrombin deficiency remains subdivided into three subgroups: the already mentioned type II PE, along with type II RS, where mutations effect the reactive site and type II HBS, where mutations effect the antithrombin heparin binding site. For the purposes of an antithrombin mutational database compiled {{by members of the}} Plasma Coagulation Inhibitors Subcommittee of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and <b>Haemostasis,</b> type IIa cases are now classified as type II PE, type IIb cases as type II RS and type IIc cases as type II HBS.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{claim that}} Ginkgo biloba extracts, which are co-administered with {{anticoagulant}} {{drugs such as}} warfarin (coumadin), increase the risk for bleeding because of their assumed antiplatelet activity. Concerns that standardized Ginkgo biloba preparations (GBE) significantly impact <b>haemostasis</b> or adversely affect the safety of anticoagulant drugs are however not supported by current medical literature.|$|E
25|$|Recently, It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the cooperation and interactions within the Von Willebrand factors enhances the adsorption probability in the primary <b>haemostasis.</b> Such cooperation is proven by calculating the adsorption probability of flowing vWF once it crosses another adsorbed one. Such cooperation is held within a wide range of shear rates.|$|E
25|$|This assay {{represents}} an INTEM assay {{performed in the}} presence of heparinase, a heparin (or LMWH) degrading enzyme. It allows the identification of <b>haemostasis</b> deficiencies even {{in the presence of}} heparin and {{represents an}} INTEM test without interference by heparin or heparin like anticoagulants. The difference between HEPTEM and INTEM CT-value comparison confirms the presence of heparin, e.g. accidental exposure.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Okamoto {{was granted}} a chair at Kobe Gakuin University. In 1980, she founded a local Committee for Projects on Thrombosis and <b>Haemostasis</b> with Shosuke, who also worked at Kobe. She retired from the University in 1990. After her husband died in 2004, she led the {{committee}} until 2014. She could never persuade obstetricians to trial the drug in post-partum hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|The host reacts {{against the}} tick lesion by <b>haemostasis,</b> {{inflammation}} and cell mediated immunity (CMI). An array of {{pharmacologically active substances}} is injected with the saliva of the tick, including anticoagulants, PGE2, prostacyclin, apyrase and in certain tick species antihistamines. PGE2 and prostacyclin inhibit platelet aggregation and dilate blood vessels. Feeding is almost continuous with pulses of salivation alternating with periods of feeding to ensure continued suppression of host defences.|$|E
25|$|The assays for ROTEM {{analysis}} {{help to get}} a rapid {{differentiation between}} various potential <b>haemostasis</b> defects or anticoagulant drug effects and allow for a rapid differential diagnosis. They form the base for selecting a therapeutic strategy. Several diagnostic algorithms have been proposed and were clinically validated. Application of this strategy helps to minimize the exposure of patients to allogeneic blood products which have certain risks; and it saves costs. Numerous research applications have used the technique as well.|$|E
25|$|Clarifications of the {{mesenteric}} anatomy have facilitated {{a clearer}} understanding of diseases involving the mesentery, examples of which include malrotation and Crohn's disease (CD). In CD, the mesentery is frequently thickened, rendering <b>haemostasis</b> challenging. In addition, fat wrapping—creeping fat—involves extension of mesenteric fat over {{the circumference of}} contiguous gastrointestinal tract, and this may indicate increased mesothelial plasticity. The relationship between mesenteric derangements and mucosal manifestations in CD points to a pathobiological overlap; some authors say that CD is mainly a mesenteric disorder that secondarily affects the GIT and systemic circulation.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnostic}} algorithm {{has been}} proposed by the International Society of Thrombosis and <b>Haemostasis.</b> This algorithm appears to be 91% sensitive and 97% specific for the diagnosis of overt DIC. A score of 5 or higher is compatible with DIC and {{it is recommended that}} the score is repeated daily, while a score below 5 is suggestive but not affirmative for DIC and it is recommended that it is repeated only occasionally: It has been recommended that a scoring system be used in the diagnosis and management of DIC in terms of improving outcome.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} <b>haemostasis</b> {{evaluating}} method, TEM (and thrombelastography) have limitations which {{need to be}} considered when interpreting the results. The typical assays are not responsive for the effect of von Willebrand factor or platelet antagonists such as aspirin or thienopyridines (e.g. clopidogrel), and only supratherapeutic doses of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists may influence results. The sensitivity for coagulation factor deficiencies, including those induced by oral anticoagulation, is less pronounced as compared to clotting assays. Therefore, TEM is not meant to replace laboratory assays such as prothrombin time (PT) or factor assays. However, due to the rapid availability of differential diagnostic information, TEM has become an established method in surgical procedures where blood losses can be expected.|$|E
25|$|Type I {{antithrombin}} deficiency is characterised by {{a decrease}} in both antithrombin activity and antithrombin concentration {{in the blood of}} affected individuals. Type I deficiency was originally further divided into two subgroups, Ia and Ib, based upon heparin affinity. The antithrombin of subgroup Ia individuals showed a normal affinity for heparin while the antithrombin of subgroup Ib individuals showed a reduced affinity for heparin. Subsequent functional analysis of a group of 1b cases found them not only to have reduced heparin affinity but multiple or 'pleiotrophic' abnormalities affecting the reactive site, the heparin binding site and antithrombin blood concentration. In a revised system of classification adopted by the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and <b>Haemostasis,</b> type Ib cases are now designated as type II PE, Pleiotrophic effect.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Lister is {{credited}} {{for being the}} first to use a tourniquet device to create a bloodless surgical field in 1864. He also recommended exsanguinations prior to tourniquet application by limb elevation. In 1873, Friedrich von Esmarch developed a rubber bandage that would both control bleeding and exsanguinate. This device is known as Esmarch's bandage for surgical <b>haemostasis</b> or Eschmarch's Tourniquet. At the time this device was superior to Petit’s device because Petit’s cloth bandages tore, the screw could untwist, and pressures that were very high, unknown and uneven were applied to the underlying limb, resulting in hazards and injuries. In 1881, Richard von Volkmann showed that limb paralysis can occur from the use of the Esmarch tourniquet. Many cases of serious and permanent limb paralysis were reported from the use of non-pneumatic Esmarch tourniquets.|$|E
25|$|While {{traditional}} thromboelastography is {{a global}} assay for blood clotting disorders and drug effects, TEM is primarily used in combination with appropriate differential assays. They allow testing {{in the presence of}} therapeutic heparin concentrations and provide differential diagnostic information to support decisions in therapy. In numerous publications the validity of the method is shown. Application of TEM at the point of care (POC) or in emergency laboratories is getting more and more popular. TEM detects both hypo- and hyperfunctional stages of the clotting process and is probably the only reliable rapid test for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast to standard clotting tests, the fibrin stabilizing effect of factor XIII contributes to the result. The rapid availability of results helps to discriminate surgical bleeding from a true <b>haemostasis</b> disorder and improves the therapy with blood products, factor concentrates, anticoagulants and protamine, hemostyptic and antifibrinolytic drugs. Several reports confirm that application of TEM is cost effective by reducing the consumption of blood products.|$|E
2500|$|TEM is {{successfully}} {{used in the}} near patient assessment of <b>haemostasis.</b> The method allows detection of complex <b>haemostasis</b> disorders (available in most coagulopathies) {{within a few minutes}} and thus enables rapid therapeutic intervention. Whole blood TEM is sensitive to <b>haemostasis</b> affecting agents such as plasma expanders or acidosis while the effects of these agents are hardly identified by plasma based laboratory tests.|$|E
2500|$|... test mildly {{activates}} <b>haemostasis</b> via {{the physiological}} activator tissue factor. The result {{is influenced by}} extrinsic coagulation factors, platelets and fibrinogen. EXTEM is a screening test for the (extrinsic) <b>haemostasis</b> system. This assay is not influenced by heparin (heparin inhibitor included in the EXTEM reagent). It is used for therapeutic decisions regarding the administration of fresh frozen plasma, coagulation factors, fibrinogen or platelets. EXTEM is also the base activator for FIBTEM and APTEM.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, thrombelastography {{was simply}} {{performed}} with whole blood without adding reagents (except calcium when citrate anticoagulated blood was used). This provides a global overview about {{all phases of}} clot formation, stabilization and degradation. In the case of monocausal <b>haemostasis</b> disorders, the resulting reaction curves may be quite typical; however, under most clinical conditions this approach has severe limitations. In reality various effects overlap, including haemodilution or application of high doses of parenteral anticoagulants. High doses of heparin often prevent clot formation at all. Absence of a controlled activation step leads to inferior reproducibility and very long test times which are not acceptable for POC applications.|$|E
2500|$|Putting a horse {{under general}} {{anaesthesia}} for castration is preferred by some veterinarians because [...] "surgical exposure is improved and it carries less (overall) risk for surgeon and patient." [...] For simple castration of normal animals, the advantages to recumbent castration {{are that the}} horse is prone, better asepsis (sterile environment) can be maintained, and better <b>haemostasis</b> (control of bleeding) is possible. In addition, there is significantly less risk of the surgeon or assistants being kicked. In a more complex situation such as castration of cryptorchid animals, the inguinal canal is more easily accessed. [...] There are several [...] different techniques (such as [...] "open", [...] "closed", and [...] "semi-closed") that may be employed, but the basic surgery is similar. However, general anaesthesia is not without risks, including post-anaesthetic myopathy (muscle damage) and neuropathy (nerve damage), respiratory dysfunction (V/Q mismatch), and cardiac depression. [...] These complications occur with sufficient frequency that castration has a relatively high overall mortality rate. [...] To minimize these concerns, the British Equine Veterinary Association guidelines recommend two veterinary surgeons should be present when an equine general anaesthetica is being performed.|$|E
