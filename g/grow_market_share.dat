The own-price elasticity is especially important because it will be used to determine if current pricing is revenue or profit-maximizing.

The research contained within the ambit of this thesis, has as its objective to establish the current position of performance measures utilised daily in the business activities by fast food franchisees, {{to raise awareness of}} future performance drivers (i. e. the critical success factors or non-financials aspects), and to highlight the importance of measuring the key performance areas of both financials and non-financial indicators as significant contributors to sustainability and growth of an enterprise. The challenge managers is currently faced with pertain to the managing of businesses for results i. e. identifying the drivers of financial success, finding a balance to measure financial and non-financial performances, appraising and compensating people’s performance. Lacking such tools, businesses have encountered difficulties managing what they could not describe or measure, or that are exposed to the risk of failure. Financial accounting (historic information) does not provide details about factors that actually help <b>grow</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and profits (the main drivers of future performance). The questions which should be asked, are: Are the managers of fast food franchisees able to identify critical information or articulate factors that are important to actually help <b>grow</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and profits? What tools are utilized to measure and drive value in real-time? To what level is performance measured, and what is the role and purpose of the utilised measures in the fast food franchisees? Most importantly, to what extent are franchisees in the fast food industry equipped by franchisors through a franchise “package”? This remains problematic as the need to identify and understand information critical for decision making in the fast food industry becomes imperative for the growth and sustainability of the organization. To answer these questions, the performance measures actually used by franchisees, will be surveyed. The proposed study will involve the collection, compilation, and analysis of both financials and non-financials performance measures using survey data from fast food franchisees within the Cape Metropolis. Quantitative data will be collected through opened and closed ended questionnaires (distributed to owners/managers of outlets) to document the existing performance measures and resulting perceived benefits. The outcome of this thesis will help franchisees to identify critical success factors and raise awareness with franchisors on inadequacies in the franchise package, so as to contribute to the effective management of small businesses. Furthermore, the research will be of importance in empowering the fast food sector to take advantages of alternative performance measures, improve their business efficiencies and increase their capacity to grow and be sustainable...|$|E

40|$|Across the country, {{significant}} issues {{threaten the}} ability of hospitals to meet their commitments to their communities. These issues include the problems of retaining qualified staff and identifying incompetent staff, increasing costs of staff and supplies, and public pressure. Institute of Medicine studies show that over half of medical deaths in hospitals are preventable, and statewide data reveal variability in hospital quality. The health care industry generates large amounts of patient-specific data. However, few hospitals can use the data to identify unusual variability in staff and physician performance, cost of care, and preventable incidents that affect {{the outcome of a}} patient’s care. SAS ® Performance Management for Healthcare provides the ability to access multiple data sources and create analysis-ready data; refer to SAS Institute Inc. (2009).

Recent research in the United States provides some evidence that the market does value investments in electronic commerce. Following research that suggests that, in certain circumstances, the market values noninnovative investments as well as innovative investments in new products, we partition electronic commerce investment project announcements into innovative and noninnovative to determine whether there are excess returns associated with these types of announcements. Apart from our overall results being consistent with the United States findings that the market values investments in electronic commerce projects, we also find that noninnovative investments are perceived as more valuable to the firm than innovative investments. On average, the market expects innovative investments to earn a return commensurate with their risk. We conclude that innovative electronic commerce projects are most likely seen by the capital market as easily replicable, and consequently have little, if any, competitive advantage period. On the other hand, we conclude from the noninnovative investment results that these types of investments are seen as being compatible with a firm 2 ̆ 7 s assets-in-place, in particular, its information technology capabilities, a view consistent with the resource-based view of the firm...|$|E
40|$|South African {{short-term}} insurers {{struggle to}} maintain and <b>grow</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> due to industry competitiveness and decreasing customer retention rates. One way of retaining customers is {{to establish and maintain}} long-term relationships with them. For relationships to last, customers should derive benefits from these relationships. It is furthermore professed that the relational benefits that customers gain from customer-business relationships positively impact customer satisfaction, which in turn enhances the quality of these relationships. This paper aims to determine whether relational benefits (confidence, social and special treatment benefits) predict customer satisfaction in the South African short-term insurance industry. Research focussing on customer relational benefits is limited, and such research has not been conducted within this industry or context. A quantitative, descriptive research design was undertaken and convenience sampling was used to select respondents. Data was collected by means of self-administered surveys from short-term insurance policy holders residing in Gauteng, South Africa. The results indicate that confidence benefits best predict customer satisfaction, followed by social and special treatment benefits. It is therefore recommended that, in order to improve customer satisfaction and maintain long-term relationships with customers, short-term insurers adapt their product and service offerings to include confidence, social and special benefits to customers.

Increasingly, these providers are assuming the form of business organizations with VET managers constituted as business managers responsible for delivering {{a certain level of}} activity against certain targets. Drawing on questionnaire, interview and case data collected from senior and frontline VET managers in five Australian states, the claim is made that a particular philosophy and practice of management has become popular in these providers: strategic management has been adopted as an adaptive response to the changing character of work within VET organizations. VET managers are required to design change agendas, produce enhanced outcomes, <b>grow</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and generally, act as educational entrepreneurs. This action is not necessarily the sum total of managerial activity, however. The press to practise commercially can coincide with a commitment to traditional educational values such as providing a second chance for ‘reluctant ’ learners or ensuring access to education by certain communities and social groups (eg. regional communities, minority groups). What might be called innovative VET management is directed to creating conditions for the convergence of commercial and social/community values.
