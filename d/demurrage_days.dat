50|$|In other cases, if {{the vessel}} is {{detained}} beyond the fixed number of <b>demurrage</b> <b>days,</b> the ship owner can recover damages for detention. Sometimes the charter-party defines no fixed time for loading or discharging. In such cases the charter-party is obligated to load or discharge {{as quickly as}} possible. If loading or discharging is not done in a reasonable time, the shipowner can claim damages for detention.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is {{undertake}} a review of the seaborne coal supply chains for two important Power Stations in the Mediterranean Sea. We are considered four different scenarios. An important aspect of this study has been the consultation with the coal supply chain participants, involving interviews, site visits and workshops, to share present information, medium term plans, objectives and expectations. The design of experiment (DOE) approach has been employed. DOE is important as a formal way of maximizing information gained by available resources. It has more to offer than “one change at a time” experimental methods because it allows a judgment on the significance to the output of input variables acting alone, as well as input variables acting in combination with one another. Using the results of the simulations, a regression analysis has been performed, providing multi-dimensional response surfaces expressing the dependency of throughput and <b>demurrage</b> <b>days</b> on the independent variables considered. The results of simulations are described at paragraph at the end of paper...|$|E

[...] "Sir," [...] says he, [...] "I shall be very sorry if what I have said gives you any offence."--"No, no," [...] said I, [...] "I am {{offended}} with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, {{not only to}} think that I should never take any notice of this before, but with reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now. You know, sir," [...] said I, [...] "what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom {{it would be an}} insufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the men lying all this while at victuals and wages on the owners' account. It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I stay more, I must pay three pounds sterling per diem demurrage; nor can I stay upon <b>demurrage</b> above eight <b>days</b> more, and I have been here thirteen already; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work unless I would suffer myself to be left behind here again; in which case, if this single ship should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I should be just in the same condition that I was left in here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully delivered." [...] He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience whether the blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all I had in the world for. I was not so sensible of that as he was. I replied to him thus: [...] "Why, sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, to be an instrument in God's hand to convert thirty-seven heathens to the knowledge of Christ: but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work, so it seems so naturally to fall in the way of your profession; how is it, then, that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it than to press me to do it?" ...|$|R

As for me, I had {{not so much as}} entertained a thought of this in my heart before, and I believe should not have thought of it; for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we any work for them to do, we would have used as such, or would have been glad to have transported them to any other part of the world; for our business was to get rid of them, and we would all have been satisfied if they had been sent to any country, so they had never seen their own. But to the case: I say I was confounded at his discourse, and knew not what answer to make him. He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder; [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "I shall be very sorry, if what I have said gives you any offence."--"No, no," [...] said I, [...] "I am offended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that I should never take any notice of this before, but with reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now.
