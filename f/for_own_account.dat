[...] The company maintained communication with the Central Bank of Cyprus to resolve the issue {{and at the same time}} took the decision to suspend marketing and sales activities in its Forex Trading business until April 2010 when it established a new subsidiary for this business. After changes in European regulation in 2009 and 2010 that brought margin FX trading under the supervision of the CySEC, TFI pcl formed a 100% wholly owned subsidiary entity, TFI Markets Ltd (TFM). TFM was approved by the CySEC as a CIF in April 2010 (license no. 117/10), which complies with Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). TFIM started operations as a CIF on May 10, 2010 with a paid up capital of $5 million offering the regulated services of receipt and transmission of orders (R&T), Dealing <b>for</b> <b>Own</b> <b>account</b> (DOA) and also acting as a payment service provider for its institutional clients.

The objective of this bachelor work is to evaluate conditions of development of guest-house Yetti, analyse position of this company in competition, analyse management system, evaluate possibilities of use of operating aids and suggest solutions of further development. Guest-house Yetti was founded in 2003 and is situated in Jizerské hory in a small village called Horní Maxov. When Yetti came to Horní Maxov its strategy was very well able to compete and {{had a lot of}} satisfied customers. But after few years the interest of customers began to fall down.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study working children and child labour among children in Uganda. The most important question paused was if children in child labour were orphans or not. This paper was based on secondary data from the 2005 / 6 Uganda National household survey. Overall, 36 percent of the children were involved in some kind of work whether for pay or on own. There are also children who worked for pay, worked <b>for</b> <b>own</b> <b>account</b> and worked for the household. The results further show that child labour accounted for almost one in five (19. 2 %). Despite Uganda being a signatory to the UN convention on the rights of children, one in three children is working and one in five is involved in child labour. In urban areas, the proportion of children working for money is also an indication of child labour. Whereas the pretext is that children involved in child labour are mainly orphans, results showed that orphans were not more vulnerable to child labour than the other children. Key words: Orphans, workloa...|$|E
40|$|Maybe {{tomorrow}} I’ll turn capitalist, ” Alejandro jokingly tells me, “today I’m staying home!” 2 Alejandro {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of licensed self-employed workers in Cuba, or “trabajadores por cuenta propia ” (workers <b>for</b> <b>own</b> <b>account).</b> Although legal in Cuba since 1993, trabajo por cuenta propia remains a controversial sector in the Cuban economy. As the first Cubans to shift from the centralized state sector to self-employment in the private sec-tor, cuentapropistas challenge the state socialist monopoly on labor and pro-duction. For a country whose Constitution states that it is a nation “composed of workers, peasants, and other manual and intellectual laborers ” (Constitu-tición de la República de Cuba 1992), the legalization of independent work-ers motivated by private gain is particularly contentious. Of course, trabajo por cuenta propia is not a unique change in the Cuban labor market, and the creation of joint-venture and “market-oriented ” state enterprises, as well as an active black market, pose equally strong challenges to the socialist labor regime. Yet cuentapropistas {{are one of the most}} potent symbols of Cuba’s changing economic, political and ideological character—in part because of the significance that outside observers have attached to their existence. 1.

40|$|Urban freight {{policy-making}} aims {{to improve}} the efficiency of freight movement in cities. Importantly, contemplated policies impact on complex pre-existent relationships among various agents operating in the distribution chain. The most relevant operators to study are: retailers, transport providers and own-account. There {{is a lack of}} knowledge concerning the specificities of these agent-types behaviour that calls for a more detailed analysis at the agent-specific level. This paper focuses on Urban Freight Transport (UFT) where an agent-specific policy analysis is carried out with specific attention to own account agents. Own account is, in fact, among the least studied agent-types in this context. This lack of attention is mainly due to the difficulty in acquiring data concerning their preferences and also to the widely accepted presumption concerning their relative inefficiency often giving rise to highly penalizing policies specifically aimed at this group. The empirical results reported are derived from a study conducted in the limited traffic zone (LTZ) in Rome's city centre in 2009. The analysis is based on a highly detailed and representative data set. This include both general information on the specific respondent involved along with company characteristics as well as stated ranking exercises (SRE) where interviewees are presented with alternative policy scenarios and asked to rank them according to their preference structure. The paper reports on the specific preference structure <b>for</b> <b>own</b> <b>account</b> operators. The paper proposes a systematic comparison, via WTP/WTA measures, between the potentially inaccurate estimates deriving from a simplistic analysis of preferences and those originating from an advanced treatment of preference heterogeneity. These considerations are prodromal to potentially distorted policy forecasts that, in turn, would be fed into micro simulation models to evaluate policy impacts. Various forms of heterogeneity are explored. The data allow the analysis, among other socioeconomic characteristics, of the impact that belonging to specific macro-freight-sectors has on the attributes used in the SRE. Furthermore, adopting a latent class (LC) specification, we test for the presence of respondent clusters in evaluating the policy mix considered for implementation. The paper addresses methodologically innovative issues; uses a new, detailed and significant data set; discusses a policy relevant issue and produces useful information from a policy-making perspective. The quantification of WTP and WTA measures for possible policies to be implemented provides an important benchmark both for policy makers as well as for researchers in this sector...|$|E
