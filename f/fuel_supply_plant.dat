50|$|DTE Stoneman {{directly}} employed {{over thirty}} people full-time, all local residents. The plant {{spent millions of}} dollars annually in maintenance costs, largely spent with local companies. Over fifty truck drivers and other personnel were indirectly employed to support the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> of the <b>plant.</b> Stoneman made charitable contributions spread out to over twenty-five different local organizations. Stoneman provided training and purchased equipment for the Confined Space Rescue Qualification program for the local fire department. This program benefited Cassville and surrounding communities in the event someone is trapped in a confined space, such as a grain silo or a mine.|$|R
40|$|In {{the face}} of an {{increasing}} world population and climate instability, the demands for food and fuel will continue to rise. Plant science will be crucial to help meet these exponentially increasing requirements for food and <b>fuel</b> <b>supplies.</b> Fundamental <b>plant</b> research will {{play a major role in}} providing key advances in our understanding of basic plant processes that can then flow into practical advances through knowledge sharing and collaborations. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has played a major role in our understanding of plant biology, and the Arabidopsis community has developed many tools and resources to continue building on this knowledge. Drawing from previous experience of internationally coordinated projects, The international Arabidopsis community, represented by the Multinational Arabidopsis Steering Committee (MASC), has drawn up a road map for the next decade of Arabidopsis research to inform scientists and decision makers on the future foci of Arabidopsis research within the wider plant science landscape. This article provides a summary of the MASC road map...|$|R
40|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> {{of forest}} chips has {{to adapt to}} the annual {{fluctuations}} of power and heat generation. This creates inefficiency and unbalances the capacity utilization of the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> fleet in the direct <b>fuel</b> <b>supplies</b> from roadside storages to power and heat generation. Terminals can offer an alternative approach for the fleet management of <b>fuel</b> <b>supplies</b> in terms of smoothing the unbalanced fleet use towards more even year-round operations. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the supply costs of a conventional direct forest chip supply to an alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> with the use of a feed-in terminal using the discrete-event simulation method. The influences of the terminal location, terminal investment cost, outbound terminal transport method, terminal truck utilization and quality changes of terminal-stored forest chips for the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> cost were studied in the case environment. By introducing a feed-in terminal and a shuttle truck for the transports of terminal-stored forest chips, the total supply cost was 1. 4 % higher than the direct <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> scenario. In terminal scenarios, the supply costs increased 1 – 2 % if the cost of the terminal investment increased 30 %, the distance to the terminal increased from 5 to 30 km or the total annual use of a terminal truck decreased 1500 h. Moreover, a 1 per cent point per month increase in the dry matter loss of terminal stored chips increased the total supply cost 1 %. The study revealed that with the relatively low additional cost, the feed-in terminal can be introduced to the conventional forest chip supply. Cost compensation can be gained through the higher annual use of a <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> fleet and more secured <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> to power <b>plants</b> by decreasing the need for supplement fuel, which can be more expensive at a time of the highest fuel demand...|$|R
40|$|There the {{experimental}} study of explosibility of coal dust under the rig conditions, the industrial experiment under the full-scale conditions of operating coal pulverization system have been executed. The new experimental data {{about the influence of}} solid inertial additions to the coal dust, about the influence of its humidity on the explosibility have been obtained. The coefficient to calculate the convective and radiant heat transfer have been obtained by experiment. The detailed heat balance of explosion process with regard to the explosion pressure, to its build-up has been formulated. The set of rebuilding merasures to provide for the explosion safety of coal pulverization systems of direct blow-in with hammer mills has been developed, has been realized and has been checked in the industrial experiment.

40|$|Utilization {{of empty}} fruit bunch (EFB) waste as a fuel for power {{electric}} generation {{is one of}} the options available for palm oil factory in the effort to reduce EFB waste. At the moment, there are several options to utilize EFB waste such as fertilization and composting. However, both ways show ineffective result, particularly in handling huge amount of EFB. Up to now, Indonesia only has a limited number of EFB fueled power plants. This paper explains technically and economically EFB <b>fueled</b> power <b>plant</b> <b>supplying</b> to PLN grid in Pinang Tinggi Palm Oil Factory located at Sei Bahar, Jambi Province. The economical feasibility is low, if the additional revenue generated from selling remnant oil, selling ash of EFB and selling credit carbon are not counted as an income. Using these additional revenues, the IRR project increased from 2. 03 % to 15. 12 %. The investment cost and the selling electricity price are critical sensitivity factors for project economics.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{experiments}} of {{the fuel}} economy performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine fueled with butanol diesel were performed on a dual-cylinder direct injection diesel engine at different <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> advance angles. The results showed that whether the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> advance angle is too large or too small, it will increase the fuel consumption. As the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> advance angle is 20 °CA, the brake specific fuel consumption {{is the best of}} the butanol diesel engine. When the supply advance angle becomes larger, the smoke and CO emissions can be reduced on the medium and high loads, but NOX emissions are significantly increased on a variety of load conditions. The engine will obtain the lowest HC emissions, as the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> advance angle is 20 °CA...|$|R
