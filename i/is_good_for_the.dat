25|$|Henry and Ellen Smith are {{a middle-aged}} married couple who have {{settled into a}} routine life {{in the suburbs of}} New York. Henry feels that the spice has gone out of their marriage, while Ellen is more content with their lot in life. When the couple comes into a {{financial}} windfall, Henry suggests that they take separate vacations. Reluctantly, Ellen agrees, and Henry departs to test the waters of New York City's nightlife. In the city, he meets up with Skeets, and the two go out on the town, eventually ending up pursuing Gloria Dawn and her friend Merle, Broadway dancers. After sitting at home and bemoaning her fate with her housekeeper, Whiffen, for a several days, eventually Ellen decides what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> goose <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gander, and she also departs to have some fun in New York.|$|E

25|$|In European {{history when}} child labour was common, {{as well as}} in {{contemporary}} child labour of modern world, certain cultural beliefs have rationalised child labour and thereby encouraged it. Some view that work <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> character-building and skill development of children. In many cultures, particular where the informal economy and small household businesses thrive, the cultural tradition is that children follow in their parents' footsteps; child labour then is a means to learn and practice that trade from a very early age. Similarly, in many cultures the education of girls is less valued or girls are simply not expected to need formal schooling, and these girls pushed into child labour such as providing domestic services.|$|E
25|$|Noddings {{tends to}} use unequal {{relationships}} {{as a model}} for understanding caring. Philosopher and feminist Sarah Lucia Hoagland argues that the relationships in question, such as parenting and teaching, are ideally relationships where caring is a transitory thing designed to foster the independence of the cared-for, and so end the unequal caring relationship. Unequal relationships, she writes, are ethically problematic, and so a poor model for an ethical theory. Hoagland argues that on Noddings' account of ethical caring, the one-caring is placed {{in the role of the}} giver and the cared-for in the role of the taker. The one-caring is dominant, choosing what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cared-for, but gives without receiving caring in return. The cared-for is put in the position of being a dependent, with insufficient control over the nature of the caring. Hoagland believes that such unequal relationships cannot be morally good.|$|E

Herrerra continued, [...] "Though 'Hard' doesn't find Rihanna in her typical comfort zone, the atypical is precisely what she has aimed for with her new material—and it works". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy" [...] the highlights of Rated R, and wrote, [...] "both of which exploit Rihanna's most appealing vocal style, a sulky, icy, monotone". Petridis {{also noted that the}} song [...] "undercuts the standard braggathon of Hard—'fan mail from 27 million.

Greenblatt wrote, [...] "Rihanna dons hip-hop swagger like borrowed armor, leaning heavily on her Caribbean accent and unleashing a string of baddest-bitch boasts via dancehall-riddim'd bangers like 'Hard,' 'G4L,' and 'Wait Your Turn. Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media wrote, [...] "the bulletproof guise <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> record's high point on 'Hard', a strutting statement of power bolstered by a roiling undertow of a beat from 'Umbrella' producer Tricky Stewart." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was against}} Derby County at the newly built Pride Park Stadium. They were awarded a penalty {{kick in the}} first half after Patrick Vieira was fouled by Lee Carsley; Wright hit the penalty, which ricocheted off the goal crossbar. Two goals by Paulo Wanchope and a late strike by Dean Sturridge {{condemned}} Arsenal to their first defeat of the league season. Arsenal played Manchester United on 9 November 1997 and needed a win to stay one point behind the league leaders. Wenger admitted in his pre-match comments that a second successive defeat would make it [...] "difficult" [...] for them to catch Manchester United, but not [...] "impossible". Striker Nicolas Anelka, standing in for Bergkamp, scored his first goal for Arsenal and Vieira added a second, leaving goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel rattled. Although Teddy Sheringham scored twice for Manchester United to level the score, midfielder David Platt headed into the far corner with seven minutes left of the match to score the winner for Arsenal. Wenger said of the win: [...] "This result <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> English game because it will stimulate interest in the Premier League" [...] and opposing manager Alex Ferguson half agreed: [...] "A one-horse race is not good for the game."
