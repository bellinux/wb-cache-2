500|$|He {{was often}} in {{conflict}} with his brothers regarding internal matters, with Nhu, Diệm's most influential adviser, controlling {{the southern part of}} the country. The brothers often competed with each other for U.S. aid contracts and the rice trade, but did not interfere with matters in one another's territorial zone. Cẩn had once tried to set up an office for his secret police in Saigon (which was in Nhu's southern region) by showing Diệm his long list of detained political opponents, but insisted that he not have to report to Nhu. He brutally suppressed dissent by using torture and re-education camps to achieve his aims. Comparing Cẩn to his brothers, Scigliano said that he was [...] "also considered the most severe, some would say primitive, member of the family and he rules his domain with a strict and sometimes brutal hand". Referring to his autocratic style, a Vietnamese critic said that unlike Diệm, Cẩn was consistent and left his followers in no doubt as to what he wanted: [...] "They are not confused by <b>double</b> <b>talk</b> about democratic ideals and institutions". His creation of a well-defined system of incentives and deterrence has been cited as one reason for his success.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} classifying language games is by their function. For example, Ubbi Dubbi, Bicycle, and [...] all work by inserting a code syllable before the vowel in each syllable. Therefore, {{these could be}} classified in the Gibberish family. Also, <b>Double</b> <b>Talk,</b> Língua do Pê, Jeringonza, and B-Sprache all work by adding a consonant after the vowel in each syllable, and then repeating the vowel. Thus, these could be classified in the <b>Double</b> <b>Talk</b> family. Another common type of language game is the spoonerism, in which the onsets of two words are exchanged. Using a standard word for each transformation gives another type, for example, the Finnish [...] "kontinkieli", where kontti is added after each word, and spoonerism applied (kondäntti koonerismspontti koppliedäntti).|$|E

The <b>double</b> <b>talk</b> policy of the government only exasperated young Moro and students and opting to join extremist group, such as the Abu Sayyaf to mount a violent attacks against the deceptive policy of the Philippine government.

2500|$|Slonim {{was viewed}} with caution by the American Esers. They {{investigated}} his REOD activity {{and concluded that}} he had shown callousness, and had mixed with NKVD envoys, but cleared him of allegations {{that he had been}} a spy himself. Following the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, Slonim and his colleagues, reunited in New York City, resumed the [...] "defensist" [...] line, unconditionally; Chernov took a more moderate stance. In February 1945, Slonim finally met Nabokov at a dinner party in New York. Nabokov dismissed him as a Soviet agent, and probably used him as an inspiration for the novella <b>Double</b> <b>Talk.</b> Nabokov's reading is dismissed by his exegetes: Vladimir E. Alexandrov speaks of Nabokov's [...] "unjustified suspicions, including his snubbing of Marc Slonim"; Brian Boyd also notes that Slonim [...] "was in fact firmly against Stalin and the Soviet system." [...] Before 1950, Slonim was again banned in the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc: copies of Le Bolchévisme vu par un russe were confiscated on sight by the Romanian Propaganda Ministry.|$|E
2500|$|Ramadan denies {{contacts}} with terrorists or other Islamic fundamentalists and {{the charges of}} anti-Semitism and <b>double</b> <b>talk,</b> attributing the charges to misinterpretation and an unfamiliarity with his writings. He stated: [...] "I have often been accused of this 'double discourse', and {{to those who say}} it, I say – bring the evidence. I am quite clear in what I say. The problem is that many people don't want to hear it, particularly in the media. Most of the stories about me are completely untrue: journalists simply repeat black propaganda from the internet without any corroboration, and it just confirms what they want to believe. Words are used out of context. There is double-talk, yes, but there is also double-hearing. That is what I want to challenge." [...] In answer to criticism of his response to 11 September, Ramadan replied that two days after the attacks he had published an open letter, exhorting Muslims to condemn the attacks and the attackers, and not to [...] "hide behind conspiracy theories." [...] and that less than two weeks after the attacks he had stated that [...] "The probability [...] is large, but some questions remain unanswered. ... But whoever they are, Bin Laden or others, it is necessary to find them and that they be judged", and that the interview had been conducted before any evidence was publicly available.|$|E

50|$|In the room, Malice {{finds the}} tentacle {{creature}} {{lying on the}} ground, seemingly dead. She angrily begins tearing the structure that held the creature apart, ultimately discovering a glowing version of herself within. The glowing <b>double</b> <b>talks</b> to Malice about a dream she had about “Dolls having a body like this,” to which Malice speaks of a dream she had about Dolls having their robotic bodies and unfeeling hearts. Malice begins to question {{whether or not she}} was truly a Doll or if that was a “dream” as well. She begins to fuse with the structure as Joe Admin, having been transformed into an organic being, walks in and tries to save her. The structure reforms around Malice, trapping her within, and Joe Admin kisses it.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{implementation of a}} long distance echo canceller, operating on full-duplex with hands-free and in real-time with a single Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The proposed solution is based on short length adaptive filters centered on {{the positions of the}} most significant echoes, which are tracked by time delay estimators, for which we use a new approach. To deal with <b>double</b> <b>talking</b> situations a speech detector is employed. The floating-point DSP TMS 320 C 6713 from Texas Instruments is used with software written in C++, with compiler optimizations for fast execution. The resulting algorithm enables long distance echo cancellation with low computational requirements, suited for embbeded systems. It reaches greater echo return loss enhancement and shows faster convergence speed when compared to the conventional approach. The experimental results approach the CCITT G. 165 recommendation levels...|$|R

40|$|The more {{researches}} done on Oct- 4 {{the more}} confusions researchers have on this “stemness ” marker. However, when researchers intentionally focused {{just on the}} “negative ” reports of Oct- 4 but overlooked their own “positive ” reports on the same factor, then even more chaos were created. Objectivity is an essential basis for scientific research and honesty is an ideal character for scientists. However, some researchers seem do not have either of them. The current chaos in understanding the exact roles of Oct- 4 have been hampered by the misleading reports and some times, intentional ignorance of inconsistent findings. A leading iPS cell research team recently reported some “negative ” findings on Oct- 4. But in their discussion {{of the role of}} Oct- 4 in stemness they completely avoided mention their contemporary “positive ” findings on Oct- 4 in “inducing ” stem cells from non-stem cells.

5000|$|The modern {{version of}} pig Latin {{appears in a}} 1919 Columbia Records album {{containing}} what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields. The song, called Pig Latin Love, {{is followed by the}} subtitle [...] "I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day". The Three Stooges used it on multiple occasions, most notably Tassels in the Air, a 1938 short where Moe Howard attempts to teach Curley Howard how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, Three Little Pigskins, Larry Fine attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, {{but it turns out that}} she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given. A few months prior in 1934, in the Our Gang short film Washee Ironee, Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin. [...] Ginger Rogers sang a verse of We're in the Money in pig Latin in an elaborate Busby Berkeley production number in the film Gold Diggers of 1933, (...)
