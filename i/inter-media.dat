However transfer of salience can also occur between media outlets, a phenomenon referred to as <b>inter-media</b> agenda setting. <b>Inter-media</b> agenda setting deals with instances where media agendas are shaped by other media (Lopez-Escobar et al., 1998; Reese 2 ̆ 6 Danielian, 1989) and traditional <b>inter-media</b> agenda setting studies have analyzed relationships between traditional news media sources like local and national TV news and local and national print media (McCombs 2 ̆ 6 Shaw, 1976, Protess and McCombs, 1991; Golan, 2006).

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{flexible}} implementation technique for integrating QoS guarantee facilities into SMIL language. In the proposed technique, {{we use a}} subclass of E-LOTOS (called real-time LOTOS) as an intermediate language since it can nicely treat timing constraints for actions and synchronization among parallel processes used in SMIL documents. We implement QoS control mechanisms using the constraint oriented style of real-time LO-TOS where a system is composed of a main process (e. g., video/audio playback) and several constraint processes (e. g., congestion detection, media scaling, <b>inter-media</b> synchronization and so on). Using the multi-way synchronization mechanism of real-time LOTOS, those processes run in parallel satisfying the specified constraints. There {{are a lot of}} QoS control mechanisms to be implemented such as dynamic media scaling and <b>inter-media</b> synchronization. Depending on implementation environments, we may have to select different combinations from such QoS control mechanisms. Also, for each QoS control mechanism, several implementations can be considered depending on the system resources. For rapid prototyping of the specified combination of QoS control mechanisms, the proposed technique seems to be flexible. We define QOS-SMIL as an example extension of SMIL where it has (1) dynamic media scaling and (2) explicit <b>inter-media</b> synchronization among objects, and show the applicability of our implementation technique. QOS-SMIL documents are converted to executable programs with our real-time LOTOS compiler. Through some experiments, we have confirmed that the proposed technique has some advantages w. r. t. development cost for QoS control mechanisms and the derived programs have relatively good performance for practical use. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters {{that are important}} in setting up multimedia calls in Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN). Unlike in traditional telecommunication networks, service providers of Broadband ISDN provide guaranteed Quality of Service. This requires a comprehensive QoS management framework. The users of B-ISDN are able to adapt the Quality of Service of multimedia to their requirements. The main adaptable QoS parameters include video parameters, audio parameters and synchronization parameters. Intra-media synchronization and <b>inter-media</b> synchronization are important aspects of overall QoS provision. The audio and video streams of a particular source can be transmitted in different paths as these streams may have varying QoS requirements. Thus the audio and video streams will incur different transfer delays. The encoder and decoder processing delays of audio and video are also different. When presenting audio and video, the video stream {{should not be allowed to}} lag or lead the audio stream beyond acceptable skew tolerances. In specialized applications, multiple audio and video streams have to be played out in synchrony at the receiver. Also the layers of a layered coding system may be transmitted in different paths and the layers should be perfectly synchronized at the receiver. Management of special resources such as layered encoders and decoders, media combiners code converters etc., ensures that intra-media and <b>inter-media</b> synchronization is maintained in isochronous communications. The different special resources and their relevance to QoS parameters such as intra-media and <b>inter-media</b> synchronization is discussed in detail. In this thesis, a comprehensive synchronization mechanism called Static Delay Compensation (SDC) is proposed to guarantee synchronization QoS. When synchronizing two or more media streams static delays are added to streams with lower end-to-end delays. It will be shown that SDC will satisfy almost all of the synchronization QoS requirements...|$|E

To enable large-scale <b>inter-media</b> retrieval, we propose a novel <b>inter-media</b> hashing (IMH) model to explore the correlations among multiple media types from different data sources and tackle the scalability issue. To this end, multimedia data from heterogeneous data sources are transformed into a common Hamming space, in which fast search can be easily implemented by XOR and bit-count operations. Furthermore, we integrate a linear regression model to learn hashing functions so that the hash codes for new data points can be efficiently generated.

The advantages of multi-media in design are well- known, and exemplified by the current interest in'hyper-media'approaches to knowledge exploration. A principal activity in working between views in one medium (e. g. plan, section and perspective drawings), or between different representations (diagrams, maps, graphs, pictures, e. g.) is extrapolating decisions made in one view or medium over to others, so that some consistency is maintained, and implications can be explored. The former kind of consistency maintenance (intra-medium) is beginning to be well understood techniques for constraint expression., satisfaction and propagation are starting to appear in'smart CAD'systems. The latter kind of consistency maintenance <b>inter-media.)</b> is different, less well understood, and will require new mechanisms for constraint management and exploration.
