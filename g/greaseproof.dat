50|$|<b>Greaseproof</b> {{paper is}} paper that is {{impermeable}} to oil or grease and is normally used in cooking or food packaging. Normally <b>greaseproof</b> paper {{is produced by}} refining the paper stock and thus create a sheet with very low porosity. This sheet is supercalendered to further improve the density, creating a paper called glassine. The glassine is treated with starches, alginates or CMC in a size press to fill pores or treat the paper chemically to make it fat repellent. Basis weights are usually 30-50 g/m².|$|E

50|$|Small {{containers}} such as plastic pudding containers, {{can be used}} in {{a pressure}} cooker, provided that the containers (and any covering used) can withstand temperatures of 130 C and are not placed directly on the interior base. The containers can be used for cooking foods that are prone to burning on the base of the pressure cooker. A lid for the container may be used, provided that the lid allows some steam to come into contact with the food and the lid is securely fitted; an example is foil or <b>greaseproof</b> paper, pleated in the center and tied securely with string. Containers that are cracked or have otherwise sustained damage are not suitable. Cooking time is longer when using covered containers because the food is not in direct contact with the steam. Since non-metal containers are poorer heat conductors, the type of container material stated in the recipe cannot be substituted without affecting the outcome. For example, if the recipe time is calculated using a stainless steel container and a plastic container is used instead, the recipe will be undercooked, unless the cooking time is increased. Containers with thicker sides, e.g., oven-proof glass or ceramic containers, which are slower to conduct heat, will add about 10 minutes to the cooking time. Liquid can be added inside the container when pressure cooking foods such as rice, which need to absorb liquid in order to cook properly.|$|E

Who was I to criticise them, hero as I was of a hundred [...] "Chinagraph wars" [...] of make-believe? Frederick Morgan In 1939, Morgan was promoted to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division. When the 1st Support Group was shipped to France in May 1940, following the outbreak of the Second World War, it had already been stripped of its two field artillery regiments and two infantry battalions. As a result, Morgan's command included only a force of Royal Engineers and a Territorial Army (TA) battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which was in the process of converting to an anti-aircraft/anti-tank regiment and armed only with anti-tank guns. His group was in no position to fulfil its normal role supporting the division's armoured brigades and so was sent to reinforce the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division south of the river Somme. During a confused retreat most of the Support Group was captured along with the 51st Division at Saint-Valery-en-Caux but the remainder, including Morgan, got away and were evacuated to England.|$|E
5000|$|In 1787 this mill {{was being}} run by Henry Brightly. John Hall was the owner in 1816. Charles Cowan {{was working at the}} mill in 1819, when the mill had two vats and was {{producing}} an estimated 1500 lb of paper a week. William Joynson took over in 1834. He had previously been at a paper mill in Snodland. Paper produced here bore the watermarks [...] "Joynson Superfine" [...] or [...] "WJ&S" [...] over [...] "St Mary Cray Kent". In 1839, Joynson was granted a patent for watermarking paper produced by machine. The waterwheel was of cast iron construction and may have been overshot, as the head was some 8 ft to 9 ft. The mill was expanded in 1853, when a second machine was installed, enabling the steam driven mills to produce 25 to 30 tons of paper a week. William Joynson died in 1874 and the mills were left in trust to his two grandsons. One of them, William, drowned in 1875 leaving Edmund Hamborough Joynson as sole heir. Cowan mentions that the mill was producing an estimated 70000 lb of paper a week in 1878. Some 700 people were employed at the mill in 1881 and E. H. Joynson took over the mill in September 1882, expanding it the following year with a new steam engine and machinery. An engraving of the mill in 1891 can be seen here. Joynson produced only high quality writing papers. In the late 1890s, a dryer was sold to Nash's and installed in their mill at St Pauls Cray. Edmund Joynson took his son into partnership shortly before World War One. The firm became William Joynson & Son. In 1914, Joynson's paper was used in the first £1 and 10/- banknotes issued by the Bank of England. Edmund H Joynson retired in 1930 and the mills were taken over by Messrs Wiggins Teape & Co. who promptly closed the mills in order to rebuild them. 350 people were made redundant, and only 200 were employed in the reopened factory. The paper factory made <b>greaseproof</b> and vegetable parchment paper. The mill reopened in April 1933 as the Vegetable Parchment Mills (Delcroix) Ltd. The production of [...] "vulcanised fibre" [...] began around 1943. In 1963 the mill was the home of the National Paper Museum The mill closed in 1967 and the paper museum collection was transferred to the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester.|$|E
40|$|Internal {{addition}} of fluorochemical <b>greaseproof</b> agent {{was applied to}} furnishes of different fibers, filler, binder types, and loadings to examine their effects under different degrees of refining on the <b>greaseproof</b> indicators such as air resistance, water absorption, and the Kit values of the resulting handsheets. The results showed that more refining tended to produce a tighter textured paper which was more suitable for the <b>greaseproof</b> purpose. The Kit values of the resulting handsheets were found to correlate with a polynomial regression equation of the Gurley air resistance (A) of the paper with an equation of Kit no. = 2. 51 + 0. 064 A – 0. 002 A 2. The results also showed that furnishes that blended northern softwood and Eucalyptus pulps at ratios from 25 : 75 to 75 : 25, depending on the strength requirements, had the best <b>greaseproof</b> performance. Among the fillers, sericite was superior to bentonite and PCC for contributing to <b>greaseproof</b> properties. However, filler loading exceeding 6. 1 % was undesirable. Soluble starch and polyvinyl alcohol were suitable binders for making <b>greaseproof</b> papers. Their dosages should be kept between 0. 4 to 1. 6 %...|$|E
40|$|The barrier {{properties}} of <b>greaseproof</b> paper are achieved by extensive beating of the fibres. This treatment results in high costs for energy, both as beating energy and drying energy. A full-scale trial has been performed {{to investigate the}} role of the pulp with respect to energy demand and the {{barrier properties}} of the final papers. The paper made of 100 % sulphite pulp with a low degree of beating showed the lowest energy consumption at a given level of barrier properties such as air permeance, grease resistance and water vapour transmission rate. The papers produced in the full-scale trial have been used as substrates for coating. <b>Greaseproof</b> paper has a closed surface and should therefore be a good base paper for barrier coatings. Chitosan {{has been used as a}} barrier coating because of its good oxygen barrier properties. Moreover, chitosan is a renewable material. Coating trials on a bench-scale showed that <b>greaseproof</b> paper can be upgraded to provide a good oxygen barrier. The oxygen barrier could not be achieved on a pilot-scale using the metered size press technique, because of the low coat weight applied. The influence of the base paper on the barrier properties of chitosan-coated paper has been investigated. It was found that <b>greaseproof</b> paper is better than a paper with a higher porosity. The coating seemed to stay more on the surface of the <b>greaseproof</b> papers and to form a continuous coating layer with better barrier properties...|$|E
40|$|<b>Greaseproof</b> {{paper has}} a dense {{structure}} and therefore provides a natural barrier against materials like fat and oils. The barrier is obtained by extensive refining of the pulp. This refining is however a costly operation, {{not only in}} terms of direct costs for the refining but also in terms of indirect costs because the energy consumption for the drying of the paper is affected by the refining. A full-scale trial was performed to investigate the role of the pulp with respect to the energy demand and the barrier properties of the final papers. Paper made of 100 % sulphite pulp with a low degree of refining exhibited the lowest energy consumption at a given level of air permeance. In addition, the effect of refining on the air permeance was compared with that of calendering. The calendering affected the air permeance less than the refining. The papers produced in the full-scale trial were later used as substrates for coatings and for detailed studies of the paper structure. Coating with chitosan was examined on a bench-scale and on a pilot scale. The studies showed that <b>greaseproof</b> paper can be upgraded with an oxygen barrier, but also that suitable coating techniques are lacking for the application of the coating in a sufficient amount. The influence of the base paper on the barrier properties of chitosan-coated paper was investigated in another study, in which it was found that <b>greaseproof</b> paper possesses a unique coating hold-out which cannot be met by other types of paper with a more open structure. It was also found that the coated paper had a lower oxygen permeability than the chitosan coating itself, and this indicates that the dense surface layer of <b>greaseproof</b> paper contributed to the oxygen permeability of the coated paper. The pore volume fraction of the <b>greaseproof</b> paper was found to be approximately 40 % and it is therefore surprising that its air permeance is so low. To bring understanding to this question, the structure of <b>greaseproof</b> paper was studied using several methods. It was found that the structure was dominated by very small pores with a median diameter of < 0. 3 µm. The fraction of closed pores was also substantial. A porosity gradient was also found, indicating that the papers used in the study had a closed surface. The hypothesis that the surface layer of the paper contributed to the oxygen barrier was tested in an experiment in which <b>greaseproof</b> paper was extrusion-coated with polyethylene. The oxygen permeability was measured at 0 %, 50 % and 90 % relative humidity, and the permeability was found to increase with increasing moisture content. Because only the cellulose layer in the paper and not the polyethylene layer in the coating is affected by moisture, this result supports the hypothesis that the surface layer of the paper contributed to the oxygen barrier properties of the coated paper...|$|E

40|$|Hibiscus cannabinus, Hibiscus sabdariffa, and Cannabinus sativa, {{which are}} {{renewable}} non-woody fiber resources having characteristics {{similar to that}} of softwood (bast fibers), when used together with hardwood (core fibers), gave higher pulp yield with good mechanical strength properties when using an alkaline sulphite-anthraquinone (AS-AQ) pulping process rather than a conventional kraft pulping process and bleached more readily than kraft and soda pulps with a CEHH bleaching sequence. A comparison of properties AS-AQ pulping processes with soda and kraft pulping processes of H. cannabinus, C. sativa, and H. sabdariffa was made. All the properties were found to be better than soda and kraft pulps except tear index. All of the mechanical strength properties of handsheets of AS-AQ pulp improved except tear index.

40|$|Cellulose {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in food packaging. Paper-based packaging, intended to be in contact with food, require specific properties to ensure food safety.

40|$|We do our thesis work on AF in the Karlstad at Nordic Paper in Säffle. Nordic Paper {{works with}} <b>greaseproof</b> paper and {{includes}} two large paper machines at its facility. Nordic Paper {{has built a}} new section of its facility consisting of six new motors. These engines have a voltage drop at the motor starter and {{our goal is to}} reduce this voltage drop as much as possible. This is to be reduced by means of capacitors. This voltage drop can in turn lead to that they charge too much reactive power on the network because the engines require very reactive power. This reactive power outtake in turn can lead to penalties from the network owner. The voltage drop can cause complications to the equipment. We have concluded that there are two good compensation methods to compensate the reactive power of these is by using power capacitors that are running all the time and starting battery which is running until the engine has started in the normal operating range. A calculation was made to the capacitors and placements to the capacitors were produced by hand. We should do the same calculations in Neplan but a license to the program was missing so we couldn’t do any calculations. The connection of the output capacitors reduced the voltage drop is not as much as was desirable when the simulation was done in Neplan Calculations for alternate starting methods were developed when the result was not what we had hoped for...|$|E
40|$|As {{mentioned}} in previous chapters, the benefits provided by {{innovation in the}} paper and board business are connected with the possible chemical modification of fibres, with coupling with other materials (composites), {{as well as with}} special surface treatments. Today paper and board can substitute polymers by virtue of their enhanced ability to act as barriers to gases, while displaying an active, antimicrobial, photocatalytic, etc. behaviour. The desired barrier effect is primarily against oxygen. Considerable interest was aroused in the past by substances like artificial or natural antioxidant additives, capable to act as a barrier to oxygen by preventing its action, as well as by solutions that prevent oxygen contact with food, such as vacuum and modified atmosphere. One interesting option today is nanocellulose, a strong barrier to oxygen and other gases that can truly compete with resins currently in use to produce composite materials. A water barrier is also required for paper and board. Surface treatments are therefore available for paper, enhancing its resistance to water contact without affecting its recyclability and biodegradability properties. Also important is the grease barrier. <b>Greaseproof</b> paper can be obtained through the enhanced disaggregation of the fibre mesh, which can be achieved either chemically or mechanically. Alongside mass treatment, surface coatings are also available. These act as a physical barrier to grease by means of paraffin, fluorinated emulsions, or silicone-based composites. Coatings based on polymer solutions have a severe drawback – they prevent paper recyclability. Therefore latest research in the paper and board packaging pipeline is aimed at producing new grease-barrier coating options, to be used without jeopardizing the medium’s recyclability. In these natural coatings, the “active” part, i. e. the fraction responsible for the desired barrier properties, is made up of biodegradable substances, including polysaccharides, proteins, and fatty acids. Microbial proliferation is another important cause for food decay. Bacterial contamination occurs, in particular, on the product’s surface, and incorporating antimicrobial agents in packaging allows {{to reduce the amount of}} preservatives added to food and to modulate their release. At present, research is carried out based on a variety of approaches: these range from a release mechanism, where the antimicrobial agent is incorporated in the material and migration to food occurs through diffusion and distribution with a decreasing effect in time, to a contact-based mechanism, where the antimicrobial agent is immobilized on the material and the antimicrobial action is displayed at the interface, thus ensuring a long-lasting effect. Abundant research is carried out on chitosan, another natural substance and a structural component of the shell of certain crustaceans. It is a biodegradable material with excellent antimicrobial properties. Lastly, several studies focus on titanium dioxide, which displays both an antibacterial and a photocatalytic action and is therefore applied in the paper and board sector on food packaging, as well as on other products, such as air purification devices...|$|E
