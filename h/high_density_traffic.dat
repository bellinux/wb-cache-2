40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problems of}} collision avoidance and coalition formation of multiple UAVs in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> environments, proposes simple and efficient algorithms as solutions, and discusses their applications in multiple UAV missions. First, the problem of collision avoidance among UAVs is considered and deconfliction algorithms are proposed. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is tested using simulations involving random flights in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic.</b> Further, the proposed collision avoidance algorithms are implemented using realistic six degree of freedom UAV models. The studies in this thesis show that implementation of the proposed collision avoidance algorithms leads to a safer and efficient operational airspace occupied by multiple UAVs. Next, coalition formation in a search and prosecute mission involving {{a large number of}} UAVs and targets is considered. This problem is shown to be NP-hard and a sub-optimal but polynomial time coalition formation strategy is proposed. Simulations are carried out to show that this coalition formation algorithm works well. The coalition formation algorithm is then extended to handle situations where the UAVs have limited communication ranges. Finally, this thesis considers some multiple UAV missions that require the application of collision avoidance and coalition formation techniques. The problem of multiple UAV rendezvous is tackled by using (i) a consensus among the UAVs to attain rendezvous and (ii) the collision avoidance algorithm previously developed for safety. The thesis also considers a search and prosecute mission where the UAVs also have to avoid collisions among one another. In summary, the main contributions of this thesis include (a) novel collision avoidance algorithms, which are conceptually simple and easy to implement, for resolving path conflicts – both planar and three dimensional – in a <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> airspace with UAVs in free flight and (b) efficient coalition formation algorithms for search and prosecute task with large number of UAVs and targets where UAVs have limited communication ranges and targets are maneuvering.

40|$|So Paulo is {{the largest}} city in Brazil and South America with about 20 million {{inhabitants}} in the metropolitan area, more than nine million motor vehicles and intense industrial activity, which are responsible for increasing pollution in the region. Nevertheless, little is known concerning metal and semi-metal content in the soils of this metropolitan region. This type of information could be extremely useful as a fingerprint of environmental pollution. The present study determined the elements As, Ba, Co, Cr, Sb, and Zn concentrations in soils adjacent to avenues of highly dense traffic in So Paulo city to assess their levels and possible sources. The analytical technique employed was Instrumental neutron activation analysis. The results showed, except for Co, concentration levels higher than the reference values for soils of So Paulo, according to the Environmental Protection Agency of the State of So Paulo guidelines. When compared to similar studies in other cities around the world, So Paulo soils presented higher levels, probably due to its <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> and industrial activity.

However, past evaluations of multicast routing protocols have utilized a single, simple mobility model, and thus do not capture the variety of mobility patterns likely to be exhibited by ad hoc applications. In this paper, we explore the impact of several different mobility models on multicast routing performance, using techniques that have been demonstrated to be effective for unicast routing protocols. We demonstrate that three key mobility metrics help to explain the performance variations that we observe for flooding, ODMRP, and ADMR.

The first part reports about operational aspects of integrating CDAs in an Amsterdam Airport Schiphol <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> scenario. The efficient CDA operation in such a busy traffic environment is promoted by the combined use of new and/or already available enabling airborne and ATM technology. This in-cludes airborne tools, such as FMS CDA functions, cockpit display cues, and im-proved ATC tools by means of accurate arrival management, air-ground data-link and controller sequencing aids. The simulations involved both flight crews and air traffic controllers showed promising results with respect to the feasibility of the concept to achieve high density CDA traffic flows. Whereas this kind of operation still puts some restrictions on aircraft flying the CDA and thus, do not allow for a fully optimised approach profile, the second part of this paper explains opera-tional concepts and airborne functions that will allow optimised CDAs in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> situations. It demonstrates that with the developed FMS functions an optimised CDA can be flown in 4 D so that e. g. in a “Late-Merging-Point” sce-nario, a given RTA can be met with high accuracy. Flight trials with DLR’s test aircraft ATTAS, a modified VFW 614 and with DLR’s Advanced Flight Man-agement System onboard, proved a highly accurate predictability of 4 D optimised CDA trajectories...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possibilities of automating vehicular traffic and decrease traffic congestion by developing an intelligent driver agent model that autonomously navigates through a computer simulated traffic network. The aim was to examine various path nding algorithms and cost evaluation functions through di erent traffic conditions so that a basic intelligent driver agent model is designed using the best combination of algorithms and cost functions found. A computer simulation of vehicular traffic has been implemented to study different agent models. The intelligent driver agents developed act as independent entities with their own emergent properties and individual behaviours. Each simulated vehicle was navigated through the traffic network to its destination using a user defined algorithm and cost function. The case studies conducted focused on measuring the travel times of each driver agent from the starting to the destination point. The results indicated that the agents traveled at higher average speeds under low density traffic conditions, while lowering their average speed as the traffic density increased. It was also discovered that hybrid cost evaluation functions (designed by combining two or more basic cost functions) perform better in low and medium density traffic, while basic cost functions perform better under <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. Finally, the results revealed that Dijkstra pathfinding using a hybrid combination of time and length cost functions should be used under low and medium density traffic conditions and D* pathfinding using congestion cost evaluation function under <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. The conclusion was that the intelligent driver agent model implemented is suitable to be used as a navigation model for self-driving vehicles in traffic simulation software, but also given the right technology and social acceptance it is suitable to be implemented as a navigation model for robot vehicles and deployed in real world traffic situations...|$|E

A visual, second-order display and a haptic force feedback gas pedal created the smallest errors in gas pedal usage and so maximized fuel efficiency. The visual display increased time spent looking away from the road, implying reduced driver safety. Participants were worse at eco-driving in more demanding, high traffic conditions. Drivers appeared to prioritize safety over eco-driving, however safety margins were shorter in the <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> condition, despite the degradation in eco-driving performance. The findings suggest which modality could be most appropriate for presenting in-vehicle eco-driving guidance, and hint that these systems should advise drivers based on the prevailing traffic conditions...|$|E
