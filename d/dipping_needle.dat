[A] The {{relative}} position {{of an electric}} current and a magnet is by [...] most persons found very difficult to remember, and three or four helps [...] to the memory have been devised by M. Ampère and others. I venture to [...] suggest the following as a very simple and effectual assistance in [...] these and similar latitudes. Let the experimenter think he is looking [...] down upon a <b>dipping</b> <b>needle,</b> or upon the pole of the north, and then [...] let him think upon {{the direction of the}} motion of the hands of a [...] watch, or of a screw moving direct; currents in that direction round a [...] needle would make it into such a magnet as the <b>dipping</b> <b>needle,</b> or [...] would themselves constitute an electro-magnet of similar qualities; or [...] if brought near a magnet would tend to make it take that direction; or [...] would themselves be moved into that position by a magnet so placed; or [...] in M. Ampère's theory are considered as moving in that direction in [...] the magnet. These two points of the position of the dipping-needle and [...] the motion of the watch hands being remembered, any other relation of [...] the current and magnet can be at once deduced from it.|$|E

"Well, Benjy, {{the famous}} Arctic discoverer, Sir James Ross, in 1832, {{discovered}} that the northern magnetic pole was situated in the island of Boothia Felix, in latitude 70 degrees 5 seconds and longitude 96 degrees 46 seconds West. It was discovered {{by means of an}} instrument called the <b>dipping</b> <b>needle,</b> which is just a magnetised needle made for dipping perpendicularly instead of going round horizontally like the mariner's compass. A graduated arc is fitted to it so that the amount of dip at any place on the earth's surface can be ascertained. At the magnetic equator there is no dip at all, because the needle being equally distant from the north and south magnetic poles, remains horizontal. As you travel north the needle dips more and more until it reaches the region of the north magnetic pole when it is almost perpendicular--pointing straight down.|$|E

Mr. Babbage and Sir John Herschel, on conjointly {{repeating the}} {{experiments}} in this country[A], could obtain the effects {{only with the}} metals, and with carbon in a peculiar state (from gas retorts), i.e. only with excellent conductors of electricity. They refer the effect to magnetism induced in the plate by the magnet; the pole of the latter causing an opposite pole in the nearest part of the plate, and round this a more diffuse polarity of its own kind (120.). The essential circumstance in producing {{the rotation of the}} suspended magnet is, that the substance revolving below it shall acquire and lose its magnetism in sensible time, and not instantly (124.). This theory refers the effect to an attractive force, and is not agreed to by the discoverer, M. Arago, nor by M. Ampère, who quote against it the absence of all attraction when the magnet and metal are at rest (62. 126.), although the induced magnetism should still remain; and who, from experiments made with a long <b>dipping</b> <b>needle,</b> conceive the action to be always repulsive (125.).|$|E

5000|$|William Gilbert's {{explanation}} {{was that the}} Earth itself was a giant magnet, and he demonstrated this by creating a scale model of the magnetic Earth, a [...] "terrella", a sphere formed out of a lodestone. Passing a small compass over the terrella, Gilbert demonstrated that a horizontal compass would point towards the magnetic pole, while a <b>dip</b> <b>needle,</b> balanced on a horizontal axis perpendicular to the magnetic one, indicated the proper [...] "magnetic inclination" [...] between the magnetic force and the horizontal direction.

50|$|Early dip circles {{were not}} {{accurate}} and gave poor results. Over the next 300 years many improvements were made, including reducing the {{friction between the}} needle and its pivot and encasing the circle in glass. Between the late 18th century and late 19th century the design approached its peak. Improvements which made the dip circle a practical aid for polar navigation were made by Robert Were Fox FRS, who developed in the 1830s the first dip circle {{that could be used}} on board a moving ship. Another important improvement to the instrument was developed in the 1830s by the Dublin Physicist Humphrey Lloyd, who devised a way of attaching a magnetic needle at right-angles to the <b>dip</b> <b>needle</b> in order to measure the intensity of force (by seeing {{the extent to which the}} right-angle needle deflected the dip-needle).|$|R

40|$|The {{rationale}} behind foliar urea spraying of Pinus radiata D. Don seedlings after conditioning was investigated. Field application of urea (5 % w/v) from the boom sprayer {{with and without}} surfactant resulted in inconsistent amounts of spray retained by the shoot, and surfactant additives gave no advantage.

Finally, Cooke proposed that they should enter into a partnership, but Wheatstone was at first reluctant to comply. He was a well-known man of science, and had meant to publish his results without seeking to make capital of them. Cooke, on the other hand, declared that his sole object {{was to make a}} fortune from the scheme. In May they agreed to join their forces, Wheatstone contributing the scientific, and Cooke the administrative talent. The deed of partnership was dated 19 November 1837. A joint patent was taken out for their inventions, including the five-needle telegraph of Wheatstone, and an alarm worked by a relay, in which the current, by <b>dipping</b> a <b>needle</b> into mercury, completed a local circuit, and released the detent of a clockwork.|$|R

In flight, the ADF's RMI or direction indicator will always point to the broadcast station regardless of aircraft heading, however a banked attitude can have a slight effect on the reading, the needle will still generally indicate towards the beacon, however it suffers from DIP error where the <b>needle</b> <b>dips</b> down {{in the direction of the}} turn.|$|R
50|$|The first type of {{modulation}} used {{to transmit}} sound over radio waves was amplitude modulation (AM), invented by Reginald Fessendon around 1900.

The amplitude of the DC varies with the modulating audio signal, so it can drive an earphone. Fessendon invented the first AM demodulator in 1904 called the electrolytic detector, consisting of a short <b>needle</b> <b>dipping</b> into a cup of dilute acid.

25|$|Elisha Gray {{recognized}} {{the lack of}} fidelity of the make-break transmitter of Reis and Bourseul and reasoned by analogy with the lover's telegraph, that if the current {{could be made to}} more closely model the movements of the diaphragm, rather than simply opening and closing the circuit, greater fidelity might be achieved. Gray filed a patent caveat with the US patent office on February 14, 1876, for a liquid microphone. The device used a metal needle or rod that was placed – just barely – into a liquid conductor, such as a water/acid mixture. In response to the diaphragm's vibrations, the <b>needle</b> <b>dipped</b> more or less into the liquid, varying the electrical resistance and thus the current passing through the device and on to the receiver. Gray did not convert his caveat into a patent application until after the caveat had expired and hence left the field open to Bell.|$|R
50|$|Right before {{reaching}} the monk, the people next in line to the one being tattooed will assist the monk with holding the one receiving the tattoo still. The monk uses a single long thin needle about 18 inches in length and about four millimeters in width. The tip of the spike is split into two (like a split cane), so that each stab of the spike produces two dots of ink in the skin. There are about 8 of these needles in a pot of a type of cleaning solution. Sometimes the monk will sharpen the needle with fine grade sandpaper before beginning. The monk will then select from several different rubber templates with the design of choice. He will apply the template to ink and then press {{it on to the}} recipients back to transfer the design. When ready to begin, he will dip the tip of the needle into a mix of oil, probably palm oil, Chinese charcoal ink, and possibly snake venom. He then begins to trace the pattern. The typical tattoo takes about 3,000 strikes to complete. The monk <b>dips</b> the <b>needle</b> into the ink about every 30 seconds. When complete, he blesses the tattoo and blows a sacred Kata (Ghata) on it to infuse it with power. For men, the monk uses the charcoal ink. For women he uses a transparent ink and will use a glove in order to not touch the female body.|$|R

A {{cylinder}} magnet, {{although it}} has great power of affecting the galvanometer when moving into {{or out of the}} helix, has no power of continuing the deflection (39.); and therefore, though left in, still the magnetic needle comes to its usual place of rest.

40|$|Summary: Isaria fumosorosea is a {{cosmopolitan}} fungal species {{with a large}} host range including insects which are economi-cally important pests in agriculture and forestry. In the current study the susceptibility of two forest pests Lyman-tria monacha and L. dispar to an isolate of the fungus Isaria fumosorosea obtained from Hyphantria cunea and re-isolates from L. dispar, L. monacha and Dendrolimus pini was investigated under laboratory conditions. Newly molted third instar larvae of L. monacha and newly molted second, third and fourth instar larvae of L. dispar were inoculated with fungal conidia by various methods: Larvae of L. dispar were either dipped directly into the co-nidia suspension (1 × 108 conidia/ml), or indirect methods were applied – by surface contact of larvae with conid-ial suspensions (1 × 108, 1 × 109, 3 × 107, 3 × 108, or 4 × 108 conidia/ml) placed on fi lter paper discs in Petri dishes or by contact with oak leaves or larch <b>needles</b> <b>dipped</b> in conidia suspension.

40|$|A {{survival}} response {{study was}} carried out by using D. melanogaster and the opportunistic pathogen B. cereus as the agent of selection. The spores of B. cereus, a gram-positive bacteria that can cause the human pathogen disease, were applied in our artificial laboratory selection. Selected lines were treated with B. cereus spores. Wound control lines were punctured with a <b>needle</b> <b>dipped</b> into sterile H 2 O. Control lines did not apply any treatment. Three different environmental treatments were used within each line type (autoclaved spores of B. cereus, sterile H 2 O and no treatment). The autoclaved spores were used as an inducer of the immune response in our study, with the purpose of boosting their innate immunity. Our hypothesis was that selected lines will live longer as they are immune to “B. cereus” spores. By comparing the average mortality rate of different line types, flies in selected lines were observed to die slowest, which was correspondent to our hypothesis. Selected and control lines were studied in different stress environment (starvation, desiccation, chill coma, oxidation) to investigate their survival response to stress. Those flies resistant to B. cereus spores in our selection were expected to survive longer than the flies in other line type under different stresses. To study the trade-off for these survival responses, energy components were measured. The result showed that there was a change in lipid and glycogen concentration in selected flies, which confirmed our trade-off hypothesis between survival responses and energy component.

30|$|As the {{dependent}} variable in our conceptual model, we use the cumulative area burned on the landscape over fire season (Figure 6). This is important because for almost all Canadian ecozones, vegetation burned {{early in the year}} is unlikely to re-burn later in the year, and forested vegetation types will sometimes not re-burn for several years (Lavoie and Alexander 2004). Cultural fires most commonly occur during two seasonal pulses—early and late in the fire season when vegetation is cured, ignition is easy, and fires have relatively low rates of spread and flame lengths (Lewis and Fergusson 1988, Boyd 1998, Kasischke and Turetsky 2006, Pyne 2007, Farukh et al. 2009; Figure 6 a, b). During years of moderate fire danger (Figure 6 a), the early season ignitions burn dormant vegetation on moist soils, smolder lightly, and usually go out over night as the relative humidity rises, or in a few days as vegetation greens up (Lewis 1980). In contrast, in dry years when soils have low moisture content or when spring rains do not occur, these early season burns can persist (Anderson 2010) and begin to spread (Figure 6 b), possibly well in advance of the lightning season (Granström and Niklasson 2008, Farukh et al. 2009). Significantly, these fires would then be active during the spring foliar moisture <b>dip</b> when conifer <b>needles</b> are highly flammable (Van Wagner 1977) and may thus burn large areas of conifer forests. Further, in dry years, existing spring-season or new cultural ignitions could continue into the summer (Figure 6 b), resulting in fires additional to those ignited by lightning, occurring during the main period of seasonal drought (Farukh et al. 2009). However, where cultural fire is uncommon, or is easily contained in moderate fire danger years, the area burned is less but occurs during a major pulse during summer when lightning occurs (Figure 6 d).|$|R
40|$|The {{earliest}} documented {{history of}} cleft lip {{is based on}} a combination of religion, superstition, invention and charlatanism. While Greeks ignored their existence, Spartans and Romans would kill these children as they were considered to harbour evil spirits. When saner senses prevailed Fabricius ab Aquapendente (1537 - 1619) was the first to suggest the embryological basis of these clefts. The knowledge of cleft lip and the surgical correction received a big boost during the period between the Renaissance and the 19 th century with the publication of Pierre Franco&#x 2032;s Petit Traite and Traite des Hernies in which he described the condition as "lievre fendu de nativite" (cleft lip present from birth). The first documented Cleft lip surgery is from China in 390 BC in an 18 year old would be soldier, Wey Young-Chi. Albucasis of Arabia and his fellow surgeons used the cautery instead of the scalpel and Yperman in 1854 recommended scarifying the margins with a scalpel before suturing them with a triangular <b>needle</b> <b>dipped</b> in wax. The repair was reinforced by passing a long needle through {{the two sides of the}} lip and fixing the shaft of the needle with a figure-of-eight thread over the lip. Germanicus Mirault can be credited to be the originator of the triangular flap which was later modified by C. W. Tennison in 1952 and Peter Randall in 1959. In the late 50 s, Ralph Millard gave us his legendary &#x 2032;cut as you go&#x 2032; technique. The protruding premaxilla of a bilateral cleft lip too has seen many changes throughout the ages - from being discarded totally to being pushed back by wedge resection of vomer to finally being left to the orthodontists...|$|R
40|$|D. melanogaster was {{developed}} {{as a model for}} resistance to Bacillus infection using B. cereus spores as an agent of artificial selection. Bacillus anthracis spores have been used as a terrorism weapon. Treatment after exposure to these spores is an important goal. B. cereus is a close relative of B. anthracis. Selection was carried out by puncturing adult flies with B. cereus spores and mating the surviving flies. Wound control lines (punctured with a <b>needle</b> <b>dipped</b> into sterile H 2 O), and a set of untreated control lines, were also generated and used with the selected lines to evaluate selection. The direct response to selection was an approximately 3. 3 -log {{increase in the number of}} spores required to kill half of the flies each generation. Life-history traits (life span, fecundity and developmental time) were investigated in the selected and control lines. There was no effect of selection on life span, but exposure to autoclaved spores reduced life span in all lines. Selected lines produced many more eggs than the other lines when untreated. The difference between lines vanished when they were exposed to autoclaved spore. The results were consistent with the hypothesis of a cost associated with heightened immune responses as a result of introduction of autoclaved spores. The selected line progeny developed relatively slowly which was consistent with the hypothesis of a cost associated with evolved resistance to spores. Or the delayed development could be recognized as an adaption. The selected and wound control lines exhibited an evolved increase in early-age mortality after exposure to autoclaved spores and wounding. This observation has implications for understanding constraints on selection. Respiration as a metabolic trait and movement as a behavioral trait were also investigated. An underlying hypothesis was that the evolution of increased survival after B. cereus infection exerts a metabolic cost, manifest as increased metabolic rate. Selected male flies appeared to have a higher respiration rate than that in control lines. Whereas, females showed a marked increase in respiration after mating, resulting from the provision of oocytes with yolk. Females also move less than males, perhaps due to sexual difference. ...|$|R
