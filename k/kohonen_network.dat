50|$|The Classification System for Serial Criminal Patterns (CSSCP) is an {{artificial}} intelligence computer system that assists {{law enforcement officials}} in identifying links between serial crimes. Working {{in conjunction with a}} neural network called a <b>Kohonen</b> <b>network,</b> CSSCP finds patterns in law enforcement databases by analyzing the characteristics of an offender, the criminal activities that have occurred, and the objects used in a crime. Once the links between crimes have been identified by CSSCP, law enforcement officials can then use the data that is produced to build leads or solve criminal cases. Through its capability to run autonomously, the CSSCP has proven that it can operate non-stop without any human interaction and can achieve results with much more accuracy and efficiency than a human.|$|E

The authors in [80] proposed a self-organized Kohonen network-based method to reduce big hydrographic data acquired {{from the deep}} seas.

40|$|Abstract:- One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} problems in fingerprint recognition has been that the recognition performance is significantly influenced by distorted fingertip surface condition, which may vary depending on environmental or personal causes. Addressing this problem, this paper presents the three-rate hybrid <b>Kohonen</b> neural <b>network</b> (TRHKNN) for distorted fingerprint image processing.

40|$|The {{issue of}} crack {{detection}} and diagnosis has gained wide spread industrial interest. Crack/damage affects the industrial economic growth. Generally damage in a structural element may occur due to normal operations, accidents, deterioration or severe natural {{events such as}} earth quake or storms. Damage can be analyzed through visual inspection or by the method of measuring frequency, mode shape and structural damping. Damage detection by visual inspection is a time consuming method and measuring of mode shape as well as structural deflection is difficult rather than measuring frequency. As Non- destructive method {{for the detection of}} crack is favorable as compared to destructive methods. So, our analysis has been {{made on the basis of}} non-destructive methods with the consideration of natural frequency. Here the crack is transverse surface crack. In the current analysis, methodologies have been developed for damage detection of a cracked cantilever beam using analytical, fuzzy logic, <b>kohonen</b> <b>network</b> as well as experimental. Theoretical analysis has been carried out to calculate the natural frequency with the consideration of mass and stiffness matrices. The data obtained from theoretical analysis has been fed to fuzzy controller as well as the kohonen competitive learning network. The Fuzzy Controller uses the different membership functions as input as well as output. The input parameters to the Fuzzy Controller are the first three natural frequencies. The output parameters of the fuzzy controller are the relative crack depth and relative crack location. Several Fuzzy rules have been trained to obtain the results for relative crack depth and relative crack location. <b>Kohonen</b> <b>network</b> is nothing but a competitive learning network is used here for the detection of crack depth and location.

40|$|Abstract Neural {{networks}} {{suffer from}} the requirement of needing to be completely retrained in order to add a new input to the network. The most severe impediment to this retraining is that if an additional input {{is found to be}} required, often the accompanying data required for retraining is not available in sufficient quantity.

These results indicate that further attention to this problem may result in a satisfactory algorithm. 1 Introduction Neural networks are deployed across a diverse set of problems, ranging from time-series problems such as predicting changes in the stock exchange[1], to controlling a robot[2], to predicting the presence of medical diseases[3]. Additionally, neural networks can take on many different forms, such as feed-forward, recurrent and <b>Kohonen</b> <b>networks.</b> Feed-forward networks are generally concerned making a prediction, such as what letter a written character might be, based on a series of inputs. Recurrent networks are use their outputs as more inputs, thus feeding back upon itself. <b>Kohonen</b> <b>networks,</b> by contrast, are self-organizing networks, where a network learns on its own instead of being trained.
