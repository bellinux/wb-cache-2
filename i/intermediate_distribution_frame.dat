50|$|An <b>intermediate</b> <b>{{distribution}}</b> <b>frame</b> (IDF) is {{a distribution}} frame {{in a central}} office or customer premises, which cross-connects the user cable media to individual user line circuits and {{may serve as a}} distribution point for multipair cables from the main distribution frame (MDF) or combined distribution frame (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.|$|E
50|$|A butt set can be {{connected}} wherever {{there is a}} line appearanceâ€”anywhere the wires are accessible. Inside the central office, this would be at a main or <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame.</b> For outside plant, this would include any serving area interface, such as a cross-connect box or aerial splice enclosure. At subscriber site (e.g., residence), this could be inside or behind the housing of a modular connector, or at the network interface.|$|E
5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{combined}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (CDF) is a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> that combines {{the functions of}} main and <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> and contains both vertical and horizontal terminating blocks.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, a main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF or main frame) is {{a signal}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> for {{connecting}} equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate {{on the same}} MDF or on a separate trunk main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (TMDF).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{construct}} an <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution</b> linking the Gaussian and the Cauchy distribution. We provide the probability density function {{and the corresponding}} characteristic function of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution.</b> Because many kinds of distributions have no moment, we introduce weighted moments. Specifically, we consider weighted moments under two types of weighted functions: the cut-off function and the exponential function. Through {{these two types of}} weighted functions, we can obtain weighted moments for almost all distributions. We consider an application of the probability density function of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution</b> on the spectral line broadening in laser theory. Moreover, we utilize the <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution</b> to the problem of the stock market return in quantitative finance. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
50|$|A {{complete}} LMS has {{software and}} hardware components. The latter is usually a switch fabric connected both to all required lines and line equipment at {{either side of a}} line. The functionality is similar to one performed by a Main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> or any other <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> so sometimes is referred to as Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame.</b> A software component implies implementing management operations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> {{may grow}} to {{extremely}} large sizes. In major installations, audio <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> can {{have as many}} as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires (balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban exchanges have about 250,000 wires on their MDF. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> or Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames.</b> The principal issues which {{stand in the way of}} their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.|$|R

40|$|In the paper, {{we present}} a {{strategy}} for accelerating posterior inference for unknown inputs in time fractional diffusion models. In many inference problems, the posterior may be concentrated in {{a small portion of}} the entire prior support. It will be much more efficient if we build and simulate a surrogate only over the significant region of the posterior. To this end, we construct a coarse model using Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM), and solve a least-squares problem for the coarse model with a regularizing Levenberg-Marquart algorithm. An <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution</b> is built based on the approximate sampling distribution. For Bayesian inference, we use GMsFEM and least-squares stochastic collocation method to obtain a reduced coarse model based on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution.</b> To increase the sampling speed of Markov chain Monte Carlo, the DREAM_ZS algorithm is used to explore the surrogate posterior density, which is based on the surrogate likelihood and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>distribution.</b> The proposed method with lower gPC order gives the approximate posterior as accurate as the the surrogate model directly based on the original prior. A few numerical examples for time fractional diffusion equations are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method with applications of the Bayesian inversion.
