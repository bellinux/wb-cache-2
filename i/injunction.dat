HTC would {{still be able to}} use the remaining microphones it acquired in good faith; the offending component was replaced with an alternative version in future production runs.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1922, 400,000 {{railroad}} workers went on strike. Harding {{proposed a}} settlement that made some concessions, but management objected. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge James H. Wilkerson {{to issue a}} sweeping <b>injunction</b> {{to break up the}} strike. Although there was public support for the Wilkerson <b>injunction,</b> Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The <b>injunction</b> succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E

40|$|The proper {{scope of}} tribunal-ordered anti-suit <b>injunctions</b> to combat {{parallel}} proceedings has {{been subject to}} much debate. Some have argued that arbitrators’ use of the <b>injunctions</b> requires restriction, while others argue that existing conditions and limitations are sufficient. This paper provides an outline of the sources from which arbitrators are empowered to order anti-suit <b>injunctions,</b> {{the development of the}} <b>injunctions</b> through cases, and the recent European Court of Justice decision in Gazprom. It briefly touches on court-ordered anti-suit <b>injunctions,</b> and the implications of the Brussels I Regulation for tribunal-ordered anti-suit <b>injunctions.</b> It concludes that the scope of anti-suit <b>injunctions</b> does not require further restriction. Reasons for this conclusion include the 2006 amendments to the UNCITRAL Model Law; commercial reasons; the need to prevent conflicting decisions; and the nature of arbitration as arising from private commercial arrangements between parties...|$|R
5|$|An <b>injunction</b> is an {{equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public body from doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or <b>injunction</b> in the same set of legal proceedings. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the Rules of Court.|$|E
5|$|Flick {{was one of}} many star NL {{players who}} jumped to the fledgling American League (AL) after the 1901 season, playing for the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics. Flick played in 11 games for the Athletics, before the Phillies {{obtained}} an <b>injunction</b> from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court prohibiting any player under contract with the Phillies from playing for another team. Though this <b>injunction</b> named Lajoie, Bill Bernhard, and Chick Fraser only, it still applied to Flick as well. As a recourse, Flick and teammate Lajoie signed instead with the Cleveland Naps, as the Pennsylvania <b>injunction</b> could not be enforced in Ohio. The two players often traveled separately from their teammates for the next year, never setting foot in Pennsylvania in order to avoid a subpoena. Flick spent the remainder of his career in Cleveland, and the contract dispute was resolved when the leagues made peace in September 1903 with the National Agreement.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it.

The Court also may not make an <b>injunction</b> against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a phenomenon}} of <b>injunctions</b> against innocent third parties (in a tort law sense). One type of such <b>injunctions,</b> website blocking, is currently appearing in a spotlight around various European jurisdictions {{as a consequence of}} the implementation of Art. 8 (3) of the Information Society Directive and Art. 11 of the Enforcement Directive. Website blocking <b>injunctions</b> are in this paper used only as a plastic and perhaps also canonical example of the paradigmatic shift we are facing. The shift from tort law centric <b>injunctions</b> to in rem <b>injunctions.</b> Author of this paper maintains that the theoretical framework for latter <b>injunctions</b> is not in the law of civil wrongs, but in an old Roman law concept of so called 'in rem actions' (actio in rem negatoria). Thus the term in rem <b>injunctions</b> is coined to describe this concept of <b>injunctions.</b> Besides the theoretical foundations, the paper explains how system of <b>injunctions</b> against innocent parties fits into the private law regulation of negative externalities of on-line technology and also what are expected dangers of derailing <b>injunctions</b> from the tracks of the tort law. The important question of the justification of an extension of the intellectual property entitlements by in rem paradigm, it's limits or other solutions to it however, which is author's PhD project, is left out from the paper...|$|R

Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog; Richard Stallman called for a boycott, requesting the publisher issue an apology. The Globe and Mail published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning.

5|$|The US federal {{government}} intervened, obtaining an <b>injunction</b> against the strike {{on the theory}} that the strikers had obstructed the US Mail, carried on Pullman cars, by refusing to show up for work. President Grover Cleveland, who Debs had supported in all three of his presidential campaigns, sent the United States Army to enforce the <b>injunction.</b> The entrance of the Army was enough to break the strike. Overall, 30 strikers were killed in the strike, 13 of them in Chicago, and thousands were blacklisted. An estimated $80 million worth of property was damaged, and Debs was found guilty of contempt of court for violating the <b>injunction</b> and sent to federal prison.|$|E
40|$|In {{surveying}} recent {{literature on}} difficulties with cross-border <b>injunctions</b> in patent cases, one may {{conclude that the}} problem appears {{to be limited to}} the phenomenon of pan-European <b>injunctions</b> granted by some courts in Europe in cases concerning infringements of foreign patents. However, even in cases concerning domestic patents, <b>injunctions</b> reaching beyond national borders can be issued; the empirical evidence presented in the paper demonstrates a variety of such instances in U. S. patent cases. Certainly the existence of such <b>injunctions</b> in the U. S. raises concerns about their enforceability in other countries, particularly when they are issued against a foreign entity that has no assets in the U. S.; in such cases the assistance of foreign courts may be necessary to assure enforcement of the U. S. -issued <b>injunctions.</b> The paper discusses various methods of enforcement of these <b>injunctions</b> abroad and outlines the difficulties that parties are likely to encounter when trying to enforce such remedies outside the U. S...|$|R

5|$|The general {{principle}} behind {{the process of}} qiyas {{is based on the}} understanding that every legal <b>injunction</b> guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective.

For example, wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E
