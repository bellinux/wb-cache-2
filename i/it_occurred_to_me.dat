5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E

500|$|Biller {{sought to}} give a more {{interesting}} look at the Borg, rather than simply focusing on their pursuit of assimilation. With this in mind, he thought of an idea based upon the Tower of Babel.

[...] He wanted the potential reunification of the ex-Borg to be a moral dilemma. This was based on the growing favorable views of Communism in the Eastern bloc during the mid-1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E

She was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the film: [...] "As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that her audience was missing a treat." [...] Hepburn was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, many of which did not {{end up in the}} film. Pat and Mike was one of the team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy. The performance brought her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E

Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance seems to me to be showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E

In the original pilot, the character's surname was spelled [...] "Meyer" [...] but had to be changed to [...] "Mayer" [...] for clearance purposes. Cherry commented, [...] "I knew Susan {{was going to be}} my anchor character, and I didn't really know my take on her at first. And then <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that one of these women should be divorced... I thought there was something so real about a woman saying, 'I don't have much time left,' and when this available hunky guy moves onto the street, something in her saying 'Let me at him'". The character is a compendium of single mothers in Cherry's life [...] "desperate to land a man". He also drew upon his own personal experiences while creating the character.|$|E

[...] From this directive Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker requested Thomas Buckingham Smith from St. Augustine to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three canals to the Gulf of Mexico would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he [...] "never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that so great an undertaking, one so utterly impracticable, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, I should not have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but by those who have waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water." ...|$|E

These early sculptures are frequently simple, curved forms, usually monochromatic and brightly coloured, using powder pigment to define and permeate the form. [...] "While making the pigment pieces, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that they all form themselves out of each other. So I decided {{to give them a}} generic title, A Thousand Names, implying infinity, a thousand being a symbolic number. The powder works sat on the floor or projected from the wall. The powder on the floor defines the surface of the floor and the objects appear to be partially submerged, like icebergs. That seems to fit inside the idea of something being partially there." [...] Such use of pigment characterised his first high-profile exhibit as part of the New Sculpture exhibition at the Hayward Gallery London in 1978.|$|E

Herodotus writes, [...] "For it is plain to see that the Colchians are Egyptians; and what I say, I myself noted before I heard it from others. When <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I inquired of both peoples; and the Colchians remembered the Egyptians better than the Egyptians remembered the Colchians; [...] the Egyptians said that they considered the Colchians part of Sesostris' army.
