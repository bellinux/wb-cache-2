40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to develop a}} metered <b>dose</b> <b>spray</b> formulation for transdermal delivery of oxybutynin and to carry out the in vitro characterization of the optimized formulation. Oxybutynin release from a series of ethanol/acetone/methylal based formulations was assessed in vitro and the developed formulation was used for delivery from a metered <b>dose</b> <b>spray.</b> Various qualitative and quantitative parameters like spray pattern, particle size distribution, pH, evaporation time, pump seal efficiency test, average weight per metered <b>dose,</b> content per <b>spray</b> and content uniformity were evaluated. The different film forming agents were assessed and carbopol (0. 5 %) and lutrol (0. 1 %) were found to give good clarity of solution, evaporation rate, spray pattern and tackiness of the film. Diffusion studies of the optimized formulations through the semipermeable membrane showed the release of drug to the extent of almost 50 % over a period of 24 h. Stability studies were conducted as per ICH guidelines and indicated that formulations were stable. Skin irritation studies were performed using rabbit as an animal model.

From the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) in animal experiments an Indicative Limit Value (ILV) was derived. The ILV is considered indicative for the limit of daily exposure for a worker which probably gives no rise to adverse health effects. This value is a rough approximation since the database for a proper assessment of such a value is generally incomplete.

40|$|Iodine-deficiency {{disorders}} {{have been}} a serious public health problem in Brazil because {{of the failure of}} a salt iodination programme established in 1953. The reasons for this failure were logistical, e. g., potassium iodide was not supplied to all salt-producers, iodination of salt was largely erratic, and part of the population at risk used only non-refined salt, which was not iodinated. In 1978 a task force was therefore formed to implement measures to eliminate iodine-deficiency disorders from the country. For this purpose, potassium iodate was distributed, free-of-charge, to all salt mills and an iodate <b>dosing</b> <b>spray</b> was supplied without cost to small salt producers. Also, regional laboratories for determining iodine in salt were set up, inspectors made regular visits to the salt mills, and samples of salt from commerce and from the producers were analysed. More than 90 % of the samples contained 10 - 30 mg iodine per kg. In three typical areas of the country with endemic goitre the urinary excretion of iodine increased from an average of less than 40 μg iodine to 125 ± 38 μg iodine per g creatinine.

40|$|Powders {{intended}} for the use in dry powder inhalers have to fulfill specific product properties, which must be closely controlled {{in order to ensure}} reproducible and efficient <b>dosing.</b> <b>Spray</b> drying is an ideal technique for the preparation of such powders for several reasons. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of spray-drying process parameters on relevant product properties, namely, surface topography, size, breaking strength, and polymorphism of mannitol carrier particles {{intended for}} the use in dry powder inhalers. In order to address this question, a full-factorial design with four factors at two levels was used. The four factors were feed concentration (10 and 20 % [w/wJ), gas heater temperature (170 and 190 °C), feed rate (10 and 20 L/h), and atomizer rotation speed (6, 300 and 8, 100 rpm). The liquid spray was carefully analyzed to better understand the dependence of the particle size of the final product on the former droplet size. High gas heater temperatures and low feed rates, corresponding to high outlet temperatures of the dryer (96 - 98 °C), led to smoother particles with surfaces consisting of smaller crystals compared to those achieved at low outlet temperatures (74 - 75 °C), due to lower gas heater temperatures and higher feed rates. A high solution concentration of the feed also resulted in the formation of comparably rougher surfaces than a low feed concentration. Spray-dried particles showed a volume-weighted mean particle size of 71. 4 - 90. 0 µm and narrow particle size distributions. The mean particle size was influenced by the atomizer rotation speed and feed concentration. Higher rotation speeds and lower feed concentrations resulted in smaller particles. Breaking strength of the dried particles was significantly influenced by gas heater temperature and feed rate. High gas heater temperatures increased the breaking strength, whereas high feed rates decreased it. No influence of the process parameters on the polymorphism was observed. All products were crystalline, consisting of at least 96. 9 % of mannitol crystal modification I...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{study the effects of}} roots pruning with cupper sulphate, cupper oxychlorate and {{ethephon}} (2 -cloroethtlphosphonic acid) on growth and quality of Pinus taeda L. seedlings produced in tubes. The treatments with cupper sulphate or cupper oxychlorate were applied on the tubes (before their filling with the substrate for plantation), by immersing them into a mixture of equal parts of water and latex paint, at cupper doses of 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 g L - 1 of solution (paint + water). The ethefon was sprayed to the aerial part of seedlings (10 - 15 cm height) at 0, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg (a. i.) L - 1. The experiment followed a completely randomized block design with five replicates. Considering the cupper sources, only cupper sulphate reduced the attributes of root dry matter (mainly by inhibiting the development of lateral roots), collar diameter, seedlings height, and aerial dry matter, with the increase of product dose. The increment of cupper sulphate doses resulted in a higher increase of copper concentration in the substrate than the increase of cupper oxychlorate doses. The increment of cupper oxychlorate doses did not reduce the total root dry matter, but increased the number of lateral roots at the median and higher portion of the root system. Cupper sulphate significantly reduced the emission of lateral roots, as opposed to the effect of cupper oxychlorate. Therefore, the use of increasing doses of cupper oxychlorate seems to show a more positive effect on root pruning, compared to cupper sulphate, since a seedling with a large number of lateral roots of small length is desirable aiming the seedling establishment after transplantation. The increase of ethefon <b>dose</b> <b>sprayed</b> at seedlings aerial part increased the principal root dry matter and the number of later roots at the median (linear effect) and lower (quadratic effect) parts of root system. There was no effect of ethefon on the other seedling growth attributes. </p...|$|R

The most likely explanation for particle fusion is that isoniazid crystalizes, resulting in solid bridge formation. L-leucine however, forms a coating around isoniazid particles, thereby preventing this phenomenon. Further experiments are needed to show why isoniazid fuses together in the jet mill. A possible explanation is that some isoniazid sublimates due to heat generation during particle collisions, and causes solid bridge formation between particles when it ripens.

Result of study indicate that 16, 5 % farmer of horticulture that have pesticide exposure  district of Ngablak  have a disorder of  thyroid and manifest as goiter. This research objective was to find out the relation between pesticides exposure and the incidence of goitre on farmer exposed to pesticides. Method: this research used a case control design with  68 case and 68 control. The variable of the research include age, education, work duration, time of activity per day, pesticide type, pesticide <b>dose,</b> <b>spraying</b> frequency, time of  spraying, farmer position to wind direction while spraying and using of personal protective equipment. Result: Research result indicated  that variables that related to the incidence of endemic goitre were age (OR = 3, 83; CI 95 %= 1, 88 – 7, 81), work duration (OR = 12, 79; CI 95 % = 2, 85 – 57, 53), time of activity per day (OR = 2, 47; CI 95 % = 1, 16 – 5, 23), pesticide type (OR = 5, 86; CI 95 % = 2, 73 – 12, 56), pesticide dose (OR = 2, 96; CI 95 % = 1, 37 – 6, 42), spraying frequency (OR = 4, 69; CI 95 % = 2, 28 – 9, 69), farmer position to wind direction while spraying (OR = 3, 07; CI 95 % = 1, 39 – 6, 77), using of personal protective equipment (OR = 3, 18; CI 95 % = 1, 57 – 6, 41). Conclusion: Farmer’s risk factor to the incidence of endemic goitre is  working  time time of activity per day, pesticide type, spraying frequency, farmer position to wind direction while spraying  and  the use of personal protective equipmetn, in its  contribute 33, 78 %. Probability to the incidence of goitre on farmer exposed to pesticides. Keyword : pesticide exposure,  pesticides type, work duration, incidence of goitre, farme...|$|R
