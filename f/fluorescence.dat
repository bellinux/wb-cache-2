5|$|NAD and NADH {{also differ}} in their <b>fluorescence.</b> NADH in {{solution}} has an emission peak at 460nm and a <b>fluorescence</b> lifetime of 0.4nanoseconds, while the oxidized form of the coenzyme does not fluoresce. The properties of the <b>fluorescence</b> signal changes when NADH binds to proteins, so these changes {{can be used to}} measure dissociation constants, which are useful in the study of enzyme kinetics. These changes in <b>fluorescence</b> are also used to measure changes in the redox state of living cells, through <b>fluorescence</b> microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Under {{ultraviolet}} illumination, curium(III) ions exhibit {{strong and}} stable yellow-orange <b>fluorescence</b> {{with a maximum}} in the range about 590–640nm depending on their environment. The <b>fluorescence</b> originates from the transitions from the first excited state 6D7/2 and the ground state 8S7/2. Analysis of this <b>fluorescence</b> allows monitoring interactions between Cm(III) ions in organic and inorganic complexes.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds exhibit <b>fluorescence,</b> that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave <b>fluorescence</b> colors are green (usually in brown stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb diamonds). In natural diamonds, there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave ultraviolet, but {{the reverse is true}} of synthetic diamonds. Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural diamonds, <b>fluorescence</b> under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some diamonds, particularly Canadian diamonds, show no <b>fluorescence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's <b>fluorescence</b> spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin <b>fluorescence</b> is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies <b>fluorescence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nanotube <b>fluorescence</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for the purposes of}} imaging and sensing in biomedical applications.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and <b>fluorescence</b> detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. <b>Fluorescence</b> increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E
5|$|Among {{variety of}} {{approaches}} to toxicity evaluation the ones which have attracted increasing interests are in vitro cell-based sensing methods applying <b>fluorescence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Divalent {{europium}} (Eu2+) {{in small}} amounts is the activator of the bright blue <b>fluorescence</b> of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that <b>fluorescence</b> was named after in 1852, {{although it was not}} until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.|$|E
5|$|Helium–cadmium lasers are {{a common}} source of blue-ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422nm in <b>fluorescence</b> microscopes and various {{laboratory}} experiments. Cadmium selenide quantum dots emit bright luminescence under UV excitation (He-Cd laser, for example). The color of this luminescence can be green, yellow or red depending on the particle size. Colloidal solutions of those particles are used for imaging of biological tissues and solutions with a <b>fluorescence</b> microscope.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by <b>fluorescence</b> microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of <b>fluorescence</b> microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
25|$|BiFC {{does not}} require {{specialised}} equipment, as visualisation is possible with an inverted <b>fluorescence</b> microscope that can detect <b>fluorescence</b> in cells. In addition, analysis {{does not require}} complex data processing or correction for other sources of <b>fluorescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescence</b> in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible <b>fluorescence.</b> Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange <b>fluorescence</b> of calcite, the green <b>fluorescence</b> of willemite, the yellow <b>fluorescence</b> of esperite, and the orange <b>fluorescence</b> of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of <b>fluorescence</b> of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the <b>fluorescence</b> of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red <b>fluorescence</b> of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue <b>fluorescence,</b> when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow <b>fluorescence</b> exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange <b>fluorescence</b> of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E
25|$|After {{sufficient}} {{time for the}} fusion proteins and their linked fluorescent fragments to interact and fluoresce, the cells can be observed under an inverted <b>fluorescence</b> microscope that can visualise <b>fluorescence</b> in cells. Although the <b>fluorescence</b> intensity of BiFC complexes is usually <10% of that produced by expression of intact fluorescent proteins, the extremely low autofluorescence in the visible range extremely most cells often makes the BiFC signal orders of magnitude higher than background <b>fluorescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|SAFI (species altered <b>fluorescence</b> imaging) an imaging {{technique}} in electrokinetics and microfluidics. It uses non-electromigrating dyes whose <b>fluorescence</b> is easily quenched by migrating chemical species of interest. The dye(s) are usually seeded {{everywhere in the}} flow and differential quenching of their <b>fluorescence</b> by analytes is directly observed.|$|E
25|$|FIGS (<b>Fluorescence</b> image-guided surgery) is {{a medical}} imaging {{technique}} that uses <b>fluorescence</b> to detect properly labeled structures during surgery.|$|E
25|$|FLIM (<b>Fluorescence</b> Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) {{can be used}} {{to detect}} certain bio-molecular {{interactions}} that manifest themselves by influencing <b>fluorescence</b> lifetimes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescence</b> {{has many}} {{practical}} applications, including mineralogy, gemology, medicine, chemical sensors (<b>fluorescence</b> spectroscopy), fluorescent labelling, dyes, biological detectors, cosmic-ray detection, and, most commonly, fluorescent lamps. <b>Fluorescence</b> also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in various biological states in many {{branches of the}} animal kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>fluorescence</b> across {{the tree of}} life is widespread, and has been studied most extensively in a phylogenetic sense in fish. The phenomenon appears to have evolved multiple times in multiple taxa such as in the anguilliformes (eels), gobioidei (gobies and cardinalfishes), and tetradontiformes (triggerfishes), along with the other taxa discussed later in the article. <b>Fluorescence</b> is highly genotypically and phenotypically variable even within ecosystems, in regards to the wavelengths emitted, the patterns displayed, and the intensity of the <b>fluorescence.</b> Generally, the species relying upon camouflage exhibit the greatest diversity in <b>fluorescence,</b> likely because camouflage {{is one of the most}} common uses of <b>fluorescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} natural {{compounds}} that exhibit <b>fluorescence,</b> {{and they have}} a number of applications. Some deep-sea animals, such as the greeneye, use <b>fluorescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|If no <b>fluorescence</b> is detected, an {{interaction}} may still {{exist between the}} proteins of interest, as {{the creation of the}} fusion protein may alter the structure or interaction face of the target protein or the <b>fluorescence</b> fragments may be physically unable to associate. To ensure that this result is not a false negative, that there is no interaction, the protein interaction must be tested in a situation where <b>fluorescence</b> complementation and activation requires an external signal. In this case, if the external signal fails to cause <b>fluorescence</b> fragment association, {{it is likely that the}} proteins do not interact or there is a physical impediment to <b>fluorescence</b> complementation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescence</b> quantum yields are {{measured}} by comparison to a standard. The quinine salt quinine sulfate in a sulfuric acid solution {{is a common}} <b>fluorescence</b> standard.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fluorescence</b> {{quantum yield}} gives the {{efficiency}} of the <b>fluorescence</b> process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{simultaneously}} manipulate and image samples that exhibit <b>fluorescence,</b> optical tweezers {{can be built}} alongside a <b>fluorescence</b> microscope. Such instruments are particularly useful {{when it comes to}} studying single or small numbers of biological molecules that have been fluorescently labelled, or in applications in which <b>fluorescence</b> is used to track and visualize objects that are to be trapped.|$|E
25|$|A total {{internal}} reflection <b>fluorescence</b> microscope {{is a type of}} microscope with which a thin region of a specimen, usually less than 200nm, can be observed. It {{can also be used to}} observe the <b>fluorescence</b> of a single molecule, making it an important tool of biophysics and quantitative biology. Daniel Axelrod invented the first total {{internal reflection}} <b>fluorescence</b> microscope in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Spiders fluoresce under UV {{light and}} possess a huge {{diversity}} of fluorophores. Remarkably, spiders {{are the only}} known group in which <b>fluorescence</b> is “taxonomically widespread, variably expressed, evolutionarily labile, and probably under selection and potentially of ecological importance for intraspecific and interspecific signaling.” A study by Andrews et al. (2007) reveals that <b>fluorescence</b> has evolved multiple times across spider taxa, with novel fluorophores evolving during spider diversification. In some spiders, ultraviolet cues are important for predator-prey interactions, intraspecific communication, and camouflaging with matching fluorescent flowers. Differing ecological contexts could favor inhibition or enhancement of <b>fluorescence</b> expression, depending upon whether <b>fluorescence</b> helps spiders be cryptic or makes them more conspicuous to predators. Therefore, natural selection could be acting on expression of <b>fluorescence</b> across spider species.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} general rules {{that deal with}} <b>fluorescence.</b> Each of the {{following}} rules has exceptions but they are useful guidelines for understanding <b>fluorescence</b> (these rules do not necessarily apply to two-photon absorption).|$|E
25|$|Relaxation from S1 {{can also}} occur through {{interaction}} {{with a second}} molecule through <b>fluorescence</b> quenching. Molecular oxygen (O2) is an extremely efficient quencher of <b>fluorescence</b> just because of its unusual triplet ground state.|$|E
25|$|Scanner: an {{instrument}} {{used to detect}} and quantify the intensity of <b>fluorescence</b> of spots on a microarray slide, by selectively exciting fluorophores with a laser and measuring the <b>fluorescence</b> with a filter (optics) photomultiplier system.|$|E
25|$|CMFDA was {{initially}} {{used as a}} cell tracker. Unfortunately, {{it has also been}} mistakenly used as a glutathione probe. Unlike monochlorobimane, whose <b>fluorescence</b> increases upon reacting with glutathione, the <b>fluorescence</b> increase of CMFDA is due to the hydrolysis of the acetate groups inside cells. Although CMFDA may react with glutathione in cells, the <b>fluorescence</b> increase does not reflect the reaction. Therefore, studies using CMFDA as a glutathione probe should be revisited and re-interpreted.|$|E
25|$|There are {{cross-correlation}} {{versions of}} ICS as well, which can yield the concentration, distribution and dynamics of co-localized fluorescent molecules. Molecules are considered co-localized when individual <b>fluorescence</b> contributions are indistinguishable due to overlapping point-spread functions of <b>fluorescence</b> intensities.|$|E
25|$|KI is {{used with}} silver nitrate to make silver iodide (AgI) an {{important}} chemical in film photography. KI is a component in some disinfectants and hair treatment chemicals. KI {{is also used}} as a <b>fluorescence</b> quenching agent in biomedical research, an application that takes advantage of collisional quenching of fluorescent substances by the iodide ion. However, for several fluorophores addition of KI in µM-mM concentrations results in increase of <b>fluorescence</b> intensity, and iodide acts as <b>fluorescence</b> enhancer.|$|E
25|$|Ruby <b>fluorescence</b> system: Pressure in {{the sample}} chamber can be {{measured}} during loading using an online ruby <b>fluorescence</b> system. Not all systems have an online ruby <b>fluorescence</b> system for in situ measuring. However, being able to monitor the pressure within the chamber while the DAC is being sealed is advantageous – ensuring the desired pressure is reached (or not over-shot). Pressure {{is measured by the}} shift in the laser induced luminescence of rubies {{in the sample}} chamber.|$|E
25|$|FRET (<b>fluorescence</b> {{resonance}} energy transfer or Förster {{resonance energy}} transfer) {{is used to}} study protein interactions, detect specific nucleic acid sequences and used as biosensors, while <b>fluorescence</b> lifetime (FLIM) can give an additional layer of information.|$|E
25|$|The X-ray {{signatures}} of aluminium, magnesium and silicon {{were picked up}} by the C1XS X-ray camera. The signals were picked up during a solar flare that caused an X-ray <b>fluorescence</b> phenomenon. The flare that caused the <b>fluorescence</b> was within the lowest C1XS sensitivity range.|$|E
25|$|Siphonophorae is {{an order}} of marine animals from the phylum Hydrozoa that consist of a {{specialized}} medusoid and polyp zooid. Some siphonophores, including the genus Erenna {{that live in the}} aphotic zone between depths of 1600 m and 2300 m, exhibit yellow to red <b>fluorescence</b> in the photophores of their tentacle-like tentilla. This <b>fluorescence</b> occurs as a by-product of bioluminescence from these same photophores. The siphonophores exhibit the <b>fluorescence</b> in a flicking pattern that is used as a lure to attract prey.|$|E
25|$|The Mirabilis jalapa flower {{contains}} violet, fluorescent betacyanins and yellow, fluorescent betaxanthins. Under white light, {{parts of}} the flower containing only betaxanthins appear yellow, but in areas where both betaxanthins and betacyanins are present, the visible <b>fluorescence</b> of the flower is faded due to internal light-filtering mechanisms. <b>Fluorescence</b> was previously suggested {{to play a role}} in pollinator attraction, however, it was later found that the visual signal by <b>fluorescence</b> is negligible compared to the visual signal of light reflected by the flower.|$|E
