50|$|The {{previous}} discussion {{assumes that}} the rectangular mesh sampling is the dominant part of the problem. The filter usually considered optimal is not rotationally symmetrical, as shown in this first figure; {{this is because the}} data is sampled on a square lattice, not using a continuous image.

50|$|An image pyramid is a <b>discrete</b> <b>representation</b> {{in which}} a scale space is sampled in both space and scale. For scale invariance, the scale factors should be sampled exponentially, for example as integer powers of 2 or root 2. When {{properly}} constructed, {{the ratio of the}} sample rates in space and scale are held constant so that the impulse response is identical in all levels of the pyramid. Fast, O(N), algorithms exist for computing a scale invariant image pyramid in which the image or signal is repeatedly smoothed then subsampled. Values for scale space between pyramid samples can easily be estimated using interpolation within and between scales and allowing for scale and position estimates with sub resolution accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|A multidimensional {{signal is}} a {{function}} of M independent variables where [...] Real world signals, which are generally continuous time signals, have to be discretized (sampled) {{in order to ensure that}} digital systems can be used to process the signals. It is during this process of discretization where sampling comes into picture. Although there are many ways of obtaining a <b>discrete</b> <b>representation</b> of a continuous time signal, periodic sampling is by far the simplest scheme. Theoretically, sampling can be performed with respect to any set of points. But practically, sampling is carried out with respect to a set of points that have a certain algebraic structure. Such structures are called lattices. Mathematically, the process of sampling an N-dimensional signal can be written as:-where [...] is continuous domain M-dimensional vector (M-D) that is being sampled, [...] is an M-dimensional integer vector corresponding to indices of a sample, and V is an N X N Sampling Matrix.|$|E
50|$|In the diagram, a {{sine wave}} (red curve) is sampled and {{quantized}} for PCM. The sine wave is sampled at regular intervals, shown as vertical lines. For each sample, {{one of the}} available values (on the y-axis) is chosen by some algorithm. This produces a fully <b>discrete</b> <b>representation</b> of the input signal (blue points) {{that can be easily}} encoded as digital data for storage or manipulation. For the sine wave example at right, we can verify that the quantized values at the sampling moments are 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 15, 15, 14, etc. Encoding these values as binary numbers would result in the following set of nibbles: 1000 (23×1+22×0+21×0+20×0=8+0+0+0=8), 1001, 1011, 1101, 1110, 1111, 1111, 1111, 1110, etc. These digital values could then be further processed or analyzed by a digital signal processor. Several PCM streams could also be multiplexed into a larger aggregate data stream, generally for transmission of multiple streams over a single physical link. One technique is called time-division multiplexing (TDM) and is widely used, notably in the modern public telephone system.|$|E
