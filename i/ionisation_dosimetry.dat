40|$|Intensity {{modulated}} {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT) {{has been widely}} accepted in clinical applications. Compared to traditional 3 D conformal radiation therapy (3 D-CRT) techniques, IMRT can deliver the prescribed dose to the target while reducing the dose delivered to surrounding normal tissue. An IMRT treatment composes multiple field segments (typically 100 to 120); these segments usually involve the use of very small fields measuring as little as 1 cm x 1 cm. Unfortunately, {{the accuracy of the}} dosimetry of such small fields has been a concern to medical physicists because different <b>ionisation</b> <b>dosimetry</b> techniques may yield different results mainly due to different detector volumes. This causes a lack of confidence in IMRT quality assurance (QA) results. This thesis compares and assesses the performance of different dosimeters in small field measurements. The detectors include ionisation chambers of different volumes, a diode, and Gafchromic™ EBT 2 film. Tests include verification of the basic properties of the detectors. Their performance is also compared with a radiation therapy planning system (RTPS). The focus of the project is the suitability of these detectors for IMRT QA. This research also develops and validates a simple and novel method of Gafchromic™ EBT 2 film analysis for IMRT QA using a grey-scale value to calibrate the film as a viable option compared to the conventional colour channel analysis method. Results indicate that small-volume detectors have a higher spatial resolution, which is particularly useful in measuring high-dose gradients, such as the buildup region of PDDs or the penumbra of small-field profiles. Among all the detectors the Gafchromic™ EBT 2 film has the highest spatial resolution, and its measurement is potentially the closest to the reading from a virtual zero-volume detector. However, these detectors usually have poor precision, as their noise is relatively high, especially the Gafchromic™ film. The poor precision will sometimes reduce the accuracy of the measurement. On the other hand, detectors with larger volumes have worse spatial resolution but a relatively more precise signal. When the detector is used to measure a high dose gradient region, its poor spatial resolution will certainly influence the measurement accuracy. This is usually called the volume-averaging effect. Other factors, such as the detector’s non-tissue equivalence or lack of electron equilibrium in the field, may also affect the accuracy of the measurement. When scanned as a 16 -bit grey-scale value (GSV) image, the Gafchromic™ EBT 2 film can provide a very linear GSV-to-dose response in a dose range of 0 to 6 Gy. This means that for a relative measurement, conversion to dose using a log or polynomial relation is not required and the GSV pixel value can be linearly related to dose in this dose range. Together with its other advantages, such as extremely high spatial resolution, planar geometry and water equivalence, the Gafchromic™ EBT 2 film method is a suitable detector for small-segment IMRT QA. However, due to its poor precision and previously reported batch calibration variation it is not recommended for absolute dose determination. Among the other detectors tested, the CC 04 ionisation chamber was most suitable for small-segment IMRT dose determination because it provided the best balance between a reasonably high spatial resolution (to maintain a satisfactory accuracy) and sufficient volume for charge collection (to give relatively high precision) ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: To {{estimate}} the accuracy levels of Lagrange, Newton backward interpolation, and linear interpolation methods in estimating the output factors for square fields used in linear accelerator for 6 MV photons at various depths. Materials and Methods: Ionization measurements {{were carried out}} in radiation field analyzer in linear accelerator for 6 MV beams at the depths of 5 and 10 cm by 0. 6 cc Farmer-type <b>ionisation</b> chamber. <b>Dosimetry</b> was performed by ion collection method with 0. 5 cm 2   interval for square fields from 4 × 4 cm 2 to 40 × 40 cm 2 field sizes. The measured output factor values for 10 square field sizes with equal interval were taken for interpolating the intermediate square field size values. The Lagrange and Newton backward methods were used for predicting the intermediate output factors. Results: The percentage of deviation from the measured value was estimated for all the three methods. The calculated output factor values of the two proposed methods were compared with the standard linear interpolation method used in routine clinical practice. It was observed that the Lagrange and Newton backward methods {{were not significantly different}} from the measured value (P= 0. 77). The linear interpolation values were significantly different from the measured value (...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{requirements}} of a Quality Assurance programme in a radiotherapy department, {{the ability of a}} treatment planning system (TPS) to accurately calculate dose distributions under realistic conditions encountered in radiotherapy (RT) should be validated. This may be accomplished by thermoluminescence (TL) dosimetry in simulated treatment of antropomorphic phantoms. In our radiotherapy department, several planning systems are used concurrently in 3 D conformal treatment of larger volumes (with irregular fields obtained via individual shielding or multileaf collimation) and of very small volumes (stereotactic technique), by external megavoltage photon beams. Realistic 3 D treatment plans were prepared using CadPlan, Theraplan and BrainLab TPS for treating volumes in an Alderson phantom, which was prepared for topometry (CT-scanned) and irradiated in fully simulated conditions of patient RT. Suitably selected TL detectors (some custom-produced for these measurements), were placed inside and around the treated volumes in the phantom. For every photon beam applied (Co- 60, 6 MV or 9 MV) the TL detectors, individually corrected, were calibrated in a standard solid phantom against <b>ionisation</b> chamber <b>dosimetry.</b> For irradiation of larger volumes, standard MTS-N (LiF:Mg,Ti) detectors were used. For stereotactic irradiation of small volumes in the head (6 MV) special miniature thermoluminescent LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P were developed. The technique of detector calibration, preparation of Alderson phantom for simulated RT, detector readout and interpretation of the measured versus calculated values of dose at measurement points inside the phantom, will be described...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIntroduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to index {{deposited}} doses of irradiation to the tumoral activity and not only to the tumoral geometry. This tumoral activity (biological heterogeneities) is given by PET imaging or Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging. The idea is to administer a higher dose to a tiny volume (around 1 cm of diameter), included in a larger Planning Target Volume (PTV). The long-term objective is to offer to the radiation oncologist the possibility to irradiate a hyperfixation with a higher dose within a PTV, while improving the tumoral control. Materials and Method: Dose calculations were performed on Eclipse/Helios, Varian Medical Systems treatment planning system. Two IMRT head and neck phantoms developed in the Centre Alexis Vautrin, were used with various detectors to either perform 1 D <b>dosimetry</b> (<b>ionisation</b> chamber), 2 D dosimetry (radiographic film) or 3 D dosimetry (dosimetric gel, Glucogel). Software characterization was realized studying the influence of different parameters (factor of priority, smoothing, number of beams, prescribed dose [...] .) and according to different treatment plans. Two models were used: - a “simplistic” model, with a non realistic geometry: spherical fields for PTV and Organs At Risk (OAR) with or without conditions on OAR, - an anatomically realistic model containing target volumes, hyperfixation and OAR such as spinal cord, parotids [...] . Results: For volumes of hyperfixation superior to 2 cm 3, the conformation number was superior to 0. 7; the target volume conformation by the reference isodose was thus satisfactory. One or several hot spots outside PTV, unfavourable to the treatment, appeared when the OAR was too close to the hyperfixation (distance inferior to 0. 8 cm). The Conformal Index was lower than 0. 53. No influence was noticed when the 2 structures were separated by 2. 6 cm or more. The detector choice was as important as its location in the phantom, for this reason we used several types of detectors. In absolute dosimetry, the difference between measured and calculated values were in the order of 4 % at the isocentre (area of low gradient), and reached 15 % at areas of high gradients. In relative dosimetry with films, 89 % of pixels had a gamma index inferior to 1, for isodoses superior to 20 % and with 3 mm and 4 % of tolerances. Also with the gel, 90. 5 % of voxels had a gamma index inferior to 1 at isocentre. Conclusion: Highly precise radiotherapy in limited zones is possible with IMRT depending on various conditions: such as localization, number of OAR, distance between PTV and OAR, presence of hyperfixation, volume of this hyperfixation, its localization within the tumour, localization of the tumour as well as its volume within the zone to be treated and the number of fields. According to our results, a precise geometry will thus be recommended to use this method of irradiation adapted to the biological heterogeneities...|$|R
