5|$|Ross was {{the first}} {{governor}} to set aside a day for civic improvements, declaring the third Friday <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> be Arbor Day, when schoolchildren should endeavor to plant trees. He also supported the legislature's efforts to purchase the Huddle portrait gallery, a collection of paintings of each governor of Texas. These paintings continue to hang in the rotunda of the Texas State Capitol.|$|E
5|$|The Kriegsmarines 4thDestroyer Flotilla {{comprised}} the Narvik-class destroyers Z31, Z34, and Z38. By January 1945, these ships had been stationed in northern Norwegian waters {{for three and}} a half years, but had only occasionally put to sea during 1944. Due to Germany's deteriorating position, the flotilla was directed <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> leave Norwegian waters and return to the Baltic. The three destroyers departed Tromsø on the 25th of the month.|$|E
5|$|During January and February 1170 {{the king}} sent Barre on a {{diplomatic}} {{mission to the}} pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket. The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful; rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When Becket protested to Pope Alexander III over this usurpation {{of the right of}} the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir. Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> allow the coronation, but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{opened his}} last season for Miami with 14 points, 4 rebounds and 2 assists, {{to help his}} team get past Tennessee Tech 69–58. He posted a season-high 22 points, against Ole Miss in his senior season. In the first 10 {{games of the season}} Grant {{averaged}} 15.1 points per game, but missed two games <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> attend his brother's funeral, who died of a heart attack. His brother's death affected his game, going 7 games without scoring double digits in February, and finished the season averaging 10.8 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game. Grant graduated from Miami with a degree in Sports Administration.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 the Havana Chess Club {{offered to}} sponsor a match between Steinitz and whomever he would select as a worthy opponent. Steinitz {{nominated}} the Russian Mikhail Chigorin, {{on the condition}} that the invitation should not be presented as a challenge from him. There is some doubt about whether this was intended to be a match for the world championship: both Steinitz's letters and the publicity material just before the match conspicuously avoided the phrase. The proposed match was to have a maximum of 20 games, and Steinitz had said that fixed-length matches were unsuitable for world championship contests because the first player to take the lead could then play for draws; and Steinitz was at the same time supporting the American Chess Congress' world championship project. Whatever the status of the match, it was played in Havana <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> February 1889, and won by Steinitz (ten wins, one draw, six losses).|$|E
5|$|In December, Edward led {{his army}} across the River Severn and {{advanced}} into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had gathered. The coalition of Marcher Lords crumbled and the Mortimers {{surrendered to the}} King, but Damory, Audley and the Earl of Hereford marched north <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> join Lancaster, who had laid siege the King's castle at Tickhill. Bolstered by fresh reinforcements from the Marcher Lords, Edward pursued them, meeting Lancaster's army on 10 March at Burton-on-Trent. Lancaster, outnumbered, retreated without a fight, fleeing north. Andrew Harclay cornered Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and captured the Earl. Edward and Hugh the Younger met Lancaster at Pontefract, where, after a summary trial, the earl {{was found guilty of}} treason and beheaded.|$|E

5|$|In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed {{no further}} than Stora Karlsö off Gotland before it had to turn back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, {{and the loss of}} vital equipment. Stenbock, held {{personally}} responsible for the failure by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent {{about a year}} at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, October 6, {{the grand}} jury heard {{testimony}} from Joseph Langdon, {{the crew of the}} Lucinda, and a carman from Brooklyn.

Voorhees was joined by lawyer Isaac R. Wilson, of New York City, for Jackalow's defense. Jackalow pleaded not guilty to each count. On the motion of U.S. Attorney Cannon, a special term of the circuit court was appointed to meet in Trenton, on the third Tuesday <b>in</b> <b>January,</b> <b>to</b> try the case.|$|E

5|$|The Sun {{is by far}} the {{brightest}} object in the Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude of −26.74. This is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of −1.46. The mean distance of the Sun's center to Earth's center is approximately , though the distance varies as Earth moves from perihelion <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> aphelion in July. At this average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 19 seconds, while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this sunlight supports almost all life on Earth by photosynthesis, and drives Earth's climate and weather.|$|E

The Fourth Air Fleet, under the command of Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen, {{was able to}} regroup and increase the number of daily sorties from an average of 350 <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>to</b> 1,000 in February, providing German forces strategic air superiority. On 20 February, the Red Army was perilously close to Zaporizhia, signaling the beginning of the German counterattack, known to the German forces as the Donets Campaign.|$|E
