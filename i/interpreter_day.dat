2500|$|Like {{most modern}} {{programming}} languages and unlike earlier Lisps such as Maclisp, Scheme is lexically scoped: all possible variable bindings {{in a program}} unit can be analyzed by reading {{the text of the}} program unit without consideration of the contexts in which it may be called.

5000|$|Born in Rome, Verger studied {{singing in}} his native city before making his {{professional}} opera debut at the Royal Opera House, Valletta in 1817. At his debut a critic wrote, [...] "Verger tenori sarà uno dei primi d'Italia". He came back to Italy in 1819 to sing at the Teatro San Samuele as Carlo in the premiere of Donizetti's Pietro il grande. From this point on he arose at the great stages of the Italian peninsula, having tremendous success throughout the 1820s and 1830s in roles from both the lyrical and dramatic repertoire. He became {{known as one of}} the greatest Rossini <b>interpreters</b> of his <b>day,</b> and Rossini himself greatly valued his voice.|$|R
50|$|British {{intelligence}} Major Brian Urquhart warned his {{commander of}} the threat, but an overpowering optimism cause by the recent collapse of the Western front overruled any possibility of an objective threat assessment, resulting in a night-time river crossing in which out of 10,000 members of the British 1st Airborne Division that jumped into Arnhem, only 2,600 survivors would reach the southern shore 9 days later. In spite of the introduction of color film, photo <b>interpreters</b> to this <b>day</b> continue to use black and white because of the greater detail available. The early Cold War era also saw the introduction of strategic collection. In tactical collection, analysts count guns; strategic collection includes butter. The categories of collection is, of course, classified.|$|R
50|$|On {{his return}} to Paris after his honeymoon, he was conscripted into the French army. After one year in the tank regiment, he was {{transferred}} to the SHAPE headquarters to serve as an <b>interpreter.</b> One <b>day</b> in the cafeteria he met a young American corporal, Larry Collins, a Yale graduate and draftee. They became friends instantly. When Collins was discharged he was offered a job with Procter & Gamble. Two days before reporting to the new job, the United Press offered him a job as caption writer at their Paris office, for much less money than offered by Procter & Gamble. Collins took the offer from United Press and was soon picked up by Newsweek to be their correspondent in the Middle East. When Lapierre was discharged, he found work as a reporter for the magazine Paris Match. Collins became the godfather of the Lapierres' first child, Alexandra. On several occasions, Collins and Lapierre met while on assignment. In spite of their friendship they had to compete with each other for stories. But they decided to join forces to tell a big story which would appeal to both French and anglophone audiences. Their first bestseller Is Paris Burning? sold close to ten million copies in thirty languages. In this book they mixed the modern technique of investigation journalism with the classical methods of historical research.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{some ideas}} about how the interpretation framework has changed {{in recent years and}} some requirements imposed by newly available technology to efficiently deal with geological uncertainties. The need to establish an interpretation strategy before starting any interpretation and some of its components are considered. Some critical aspects of the interpretation envi-ronment are also reviewed. The inspiration for this paper came from a great article in the February 2011 issue of TLE, “Interpretation in the year 2010 —How far have we come? ” in which Don Her-ron summarized the results of a workshop at SEG’s 2010 Annual Meeting. This article deals with what an <b>interpreter</b> does every <b>day</b> rather than present a specific case study or describe a special interpretation technique applied over a particular prospect.

5000|$|According to Srinivasan, T.A [...] The Original twin temples' ( [...] Chenna kesava perumal and Chenna Malleeswarar [...] ) {{location}} was later {{occupied by the}} High court building. The original twin temples' history dates back to 1646 CE. Grants made to the original twin temples by Beri Thimmappa (dubash meaning <b>interpreter,</b> to Francis <b>Day)</b> and Nagabattar were recorded. Attack by other European powers and attack and looting of temples by Hyder Ali's forces caused the devotees to relocate some vigrahams to the Thiruneermalai Temple. The twin temples were demolished by the British, {{for the purpose of}} security and expansion of the nearby Fort St.George. Manali Muthu Krishna Mudaliar, translator for Lord Piccode, built new twin temples in 1700 CE in a different location (at Devaraja mudali Street, later called Sowcarpet). He donated his lands, used his own funds to build and he refused the money from the British, accepting only land from them.|$|R

Reports were circulated by them in late April 1811 {{of a trade}} post maintained by white men in the interior. This was correctly conjectured by PFC employees to be their NWC rivals, later found to be Spokane House. Departing on 2 May, McKay led Robert Stuart, Franchère, Ovide de Montigny {{and a number of}} voyaguers up the Columbia, with Clatsop noble Coalpo acting as guide and <b>interpreter.</b> The following <b>day</b> they explored the Cowlitz River and soon encountered a large canoe flotilla of Cowlitz warriors. McKay was able to request a parlay, during which the Cowlitz stated they were armed for combat against the nearby Skilloot Chinookan village near the river mouth. Reaching the Dalles on 10 May, no trade station was found at the important fishery. Due to Coalpo's fear of reprisal from his enemies among the Wasco and Wishram, the party went back to Fort Astoria, returning on 14 May.|$|R
50|$|Oral history states seven tribes {{migrated}} {{together and}} eventually {{settled on the}} Kabadi land. The seven tribes had their respective chiefs who were tasked with specific roles. These are head warriors, magicians or sorcerers and messengers and <b>interpreters.</b> To this <b>day,</b> there are still seven tribes with seven clan chiefs. During {{the arrival of the}} colonisers, government officials who visited the Abadi plains encouraged people to move and settled together in villages. This was to ensure the Crown accounted for everyone, and to ensure much needed services can be provided to them. The early patrol officers that visited the villages on the Gabadi plain named the villages 'Vanuapaka' which literally means 'big village', due to it been the political and administrative center, while there were satellite villages such as Ukaukana, keveona, Matepaila villages - according to Anthropologist and Author; Ch.G. Seligman who wrote in his book 'The Melanesians of British New Guinea' 'the three best known villages of Kabadi Vanuapaka, kopuana and Ukaukana'. p. 27 subnotes. Even so, other settlements continued to exist around the Abadi plains which grew with families and clans moving to strategic locations for easy access to food, and also protect the lands acquired by the Chief.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{implementation}} of evidence-based infection control practices is essential, yet challenging for healthcare institutions worldwide. Although acknowledged that implementation success varies with contextual factors, {{little is known}} regarding the most critical specific conditions within the complex cultural milieu of varying economic, political, and healthcare systems. Given the increasing reliance on unified global schemes to improve patient safety and healthcare effectiveness, research on this topic is needed and timely. The 'InDepth' work package of the European FP 7 Prevention of Hospital Infections by Intervention and Training (PROHIBIT) consortium aims to assess barriers and facilitators to the successful {{implementation of}} catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) prevention in intensive care units (ICU) across several European countries. METHODS: We use a qualitative case study approach in the ICUs of six purposefully selected acute care hospitals among the 15 participants in the PROHIBIT CRBSI intervention study. For sensitizing schemes we apply the theory of diffusion of innovation, published implementation frameworks, sensemaking, and new institutionalism. We conduct interviews with hospital health providers/agents at different organizational levels and ethnographic observations, and conduct rich artifact collection, and photography during two rounds of on-site visits, once before and once one year into the intervention. Data analysis is based on grounded theory. Given the challenge of different languages and cultures, we enlist the help of local <b>interpreters,</b> allot two <b>days</b> for site visits, and perform triangulation across multiple data sources. Qualitative measures of implementation success will consider the longitudinal interaction between the initiative and the institutional context. Quantitative outcomes on catheter-related bloodstream infections and performance indicators from another work package of the consortium will produce a final mixed-methods report. CONCLUSION: A mixed-methods study of this scale with longitudinal follow-up is unique {{in the field of}} infection control. It highlights the 'Why' and 'How' of best practice implementation, revealing key factors that determine success of a uniform intervention in the context of several varying cultural, economic, political, and medical systems across Europe.

6000|$|We {{have here}} {{a problem of}} conduct, and what seems an image of inconsistency, very hard at the first sight to be solved by any European. Plainly Mataafa does not act at random. Plainly, {{in the depths of}} his Samoan mind, he regards his {{attitude}} as regular and constitutional. It may be unexpected, it may be inauspicious, it may be undesirable; but he thinks it--and perhaps it is--in full accordance with those [...] "laws and customs of Samoa" [...] ignorantly invoked by the draughtsmen of the Berlin Act. The point is worth an effort of comprehension; a man's life may yet depend upon it. Let us conceive, in the first place, that there are five separate kingships in Samoa, though not always five different kings; and that though one man, by holding the five royal names, might become king in all parts of Samoa, there is perhaps no such matter as a kingship of all Samoa. He who holds one royal name would be, upon this view, as much a sovereign person as he who should chance to hold the other four; he would have less territory and fewer subjects, but the like independence and an equal royalty. Now Mataafa, even if all debatable points were decided against him, is still Tuiatua, and as such, on this hypothesis, a sovereign prince. In the second place, the draughtsmen of the Act, waxing exceeding bold, employed the word [...] "election," [...] and implicitly justified all precedented steps towards the kingship according with the [...] "customs of Samoa." [...] I am not asking what was intended by the gentlemen who sat and debated very benignly and, on the whole, wisely in Berlin; I am asking what will be understood by a Samoan studying their literary work, the Berlin Act; I am asking what is the result of taking a word out of one state of society, and applying it to another, of which the writers know less than nothing, and no European knows much. Several <b>interpreters</b> and several <b>days</b> were employed last September in the fruitless attempt to convey to the mind of Laupepa the sense of the word [...] "resignation." [...] What can a Samoan gather from the words, election? election of a king? election of a king according to the laws and customs of Samoa? What are the electoral measures, what is the method of canvassing, likely to be employed by two, three, four, or five, more or less absolute princelings, eager to evince each other? And who is to distinguish such a process from the state of war? In such international--or, I should say, interparochial--differences, the nearest we can come towards understanding is to appreciate the cloud of ambiguity in which all parties grope-- ...|$|R
