5|$|Gambia {{had participated}} in six {{previous}} Summer Olympics, between its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. At its debut, the country sent ten athletes to the games, all of whom competed in athletics. As of 2012, 10 remains {{the largest number of}} <b>Gambian</b> athletes participating in the summer games. No <b>Gambian</b> has ever won a summer Olympics medal. Three athletes from Gambia were selected to compete in the 2008 Olympics: Suwaibou Sanneh in the men's track and field 100 metres, Fatou Tiyana in the women's track and field 100 metres and Badou Jack in the men's middleweight boxing competition.|$|E
5|$|Gambia's only boxer at the Beijing Olympics, Badou Jack, {{qualified}} in the middleweight {{class at}} the second African continental qualifying tournament. Jack competed at age 24 and was Gambia's oldest competitor. He {{was selected as the}} <b>Gambian</b> flag bearer for the opening ceremony. His first fight was against Indian Vijender Singh. Kumar won the fight 13-2 and Jack was eliminated from the competition.|$|E
5|$|On 16 March 1996, a <b>Gambian</b> asylum seeker, Ibrahima Sey, {{was taken}} to Ilford Police Station in east London.

Also many of this students returned home after completing his studies, excelling in politics and business.|$|R
5|$|Suwaibou Sanneh was {{the only}} male athlete {{representing}} The Gambia at the London Olympics. He previously competed in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. Sanneh qualified for the London Olympics by securing the required qualifying time in the 'B' standard in an event in Jamaica. He competed in the men's 100 metres race on 4 August in the third heat of the quarter-finals, finishing fifth out of eight athletes {{with a time of}} 10.21 seconds. Sanneh became the first <b>Gambian</b> athlete to qualify for the semi-finals of the event, and the second time a competitor from the country advanced into the semi-finals of any Olympic event. He ranked ahead of Rytis Sakalauskas from Lithuania (10.29 seconds), Central Africa's Béranger-Aymard Bossé (10.55 seconds) and Bruno Rojas of Bolivia (10.65 seconds) in a heat led by American sprinter Ryan Bailey (9.88 seconds). In the semi-finals on 5 August, Sanneh achieved a <b>Gambian</b> national record of 10.18 seconds, but did not advance into the final after finishing eighth (and last) in her heat.|$|E
5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The <b>Gambian</b> pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
5|$|The Gambia competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, {{which was}} held from 27 July to 12 August 2012. The country's {{participation}} at London marked its eighth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its début at the 1984 Summer Olympics. The delegation included two athletes, Suwaibou Sanneh and Saruba Colley, the former had qualified by setting a qualifying time that fell within the required standard and the latter entered via a wildcard place. Sanneh {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies. Sanneh became the first <b>Gambian</b> athlete to advance into the semi-finals of the men's 100 metres, while Colley was eliminated after the quarter-final stages of the Women's 100 metres.|$|E

40|$|A micromethod for {{the study}} of {{specific}} antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in human malaria is described, using cultured, asexual Plasmodium falciparum parasites as viable target cells. Lymphocytes from children with acute malaria, uninfected immune adult <b>Gambians</b> and adult <b>Gambians</b> infected with P. falciparum were capable of killing P. falciparum in vitro in the presence of malaria antibody. A parasite growth-promoting factor, produced by lymphocytes in non-immune serum and at a lymphocyte [...] parasite ratio of 10 : 1, in immune serum, was found to produce three-fold increases in growth of P. falciparum. The mechanisms by which ADCC may occur are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{country did}} not have a FIFA-recognised youth {{national}} team until 2012, when the Gambia under-17 women's team competed in Confederation of African Football qualifiers for the FIFA U-17 World Cup, to be held in Azerbaijan in September 2012. The Gambia had fielded an under-17 team of 24 players, narrowed from an initial pool of 49 young women. Two girls from the SOS Children’s Village Bakoteh were chosen as a members of the team. The Gambia first played Sierra Leone in a pair of qualifying matches for the tournament. Gambia won the first match 3-0 in Banjul, the Gambia's capital. The return match was delayed in for 24 hours and played in Makeni. The Gambia beat Sierra Leone 4-3 to qualify for the final round. The Gambia then beat Tunisia 1-0 at home and won 2-1 in Tunisia. Adama Tamba and Awa Demba scored the Gambia's goals. Tunisia's only goal was a <b>Gambian</b> own goal. The win qualified Gambia for the 2012 Azerbaijan World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Gambia's {{much larger}} neighbor, Senegal, {{is home to}} a {{thriving}} hip hop scene, which has exerted a strong influence on <b>Gambian</b> hip hop but <b>Gambian</b> hip hop is now evolving its own unique style. In 1999, the Gambia Radio & Television Services gave out the first <b>Gambian</b> Rap Award. The first crew to win the award for best new act was Da Fugitvz, who rapped in Wolof, the national language of Senegal, and thus became popular in both countries. They also later played at Popkomm in Germany.|$|E

50|$|Rugby {{union was}} {{introduced}} into the Gambia by the British, who ruled {{the country for a}} number of years. However, it was mainly played by the white population, who made little attempt to spread it to the native <b>Gambians,</b> meaning that the game declined when they left.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the {{integration}} process, support came {{primarily from the}} two governments and their social elites; neither the Senegalese nor the <b>Gambian</b> people at large were particularly interested in integration. Once the threat of political instability began to dissipate, both sides began {{to move back to}} their traditional fears and stereotypes of the other. The <b>Gambian</b> government (and the <b>Gambian</b> people) began to fear losing their own power and identity through Senegalese engulfment. Hughes and Lewis, in their Senegambia analysis, list many problems with unions which often lead to failure, which this union shared.|$|E
25|$|At the 1992 Summer Olympics, the <b>Gambian</b> {{delegation}} (consisting of five athletes) was all-male for {{the first}} and only time. It again consisted entirely of runners, four of whom ran the men's 4 × 100 metres relay. Bangladesh and San Marino were the only countries to record slower times in the event. The 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta saw the <b>Gambian</b> delegation increase to nine athletes, although the only woman was Adama Njie. Ousman Sallah (a long jumper) was the only non-runner, while Dawda Jallow was flag-bearer for a third consecutive occasion, and became the only <b>Gambian</b> to compete in four games.|$|E

5000|$|Countries, {{particularly}} {{those outside the}} Western hemisphere, have accused Western powers of smear campaigns to bring down their governments.

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} the {{cardiovascular}} characteristics of three typically rural communities in the Gambia, Jamaica, and the United Republic of Tanzania were carried out by means of standardized methodology. This paper reports comparisons of arterial blood pressure distribution and electrocardiographic findings in relation to age, sex, and body build. Marked differences in blood pressure were found, with higher values in Jamaicans than in Tanzanians, who in turn had higher values than <b>Gambians.</b> These differences are not explicable in terms of body build. Heart rates and ECG amplitudes were also strikingly different, with higher values in Jamaicans than in Tanzanians and <b>Gambians.</b> The differences in ECG amplitudes cannot be explained by differences in body build, heart rate, or blood pressure. The findings agree with the hypothesis that some factor or factors associated with development contributes {{to the risk of}} cardiovascular disease in peoples of African origin...|$|R
5000|$|Intermarriage between Muslims and Christians is common. In some areas, Islam and Christianity are syncretized with African Traditional Religion. There are few atheists in the country. Although most <b>Gambians</b> are Muslim, some {{suggest that}} Islam is usually syncretized {{with the old}} Traditional African {{religion}} such as the Serer religion. [...] Christians also syncretize Christianity with the old Traditional African religion.|$|R
25|$|The 2003 season {{turned out}} to be another season with steady progression, but still without {{achieving}} the major international breakthrough. In July he broke his first <b>Gambian</b> 100 metres record, running in 10.52 seconds in Gothenburg. The old record was 10.54 seconds, set by Lamin Sanyang in May 2001 in Saidy's hometown Bakau. The next day he ran the 200 metres, and set his second <b>Gambian</b> record in two days with 21.18 seconds, this time in headwind.|$|E

40|$|Supernatants from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [...] stimulated B {{lymphocytes}} {{obtained from}} two adult <b>Gambians</b> who were partially immune to malaria markedly inhibited {{the growth of}} Plasmodium falciparum in vitro (55 - 95 % inhibition). When 22 separate colonies were derived by micromanipulation from one of these primary cultures and their supernatants assayed, the degree of inhibition correlated with levels of IgG fluorescent antibody and total IgG. The inhibitory anti-P. falciparum IgG immunoprecipitated an antigen of mol. wt 195, 000, identified as the major schizont surface glycoprotein by dual biosynthetic labelling with 3 H-glucosamine or 35 S-methionine. Other studies on the analogous schizont surface protein of rodent malarias have shown that this antigen stimulates protective immunity. Production of this inhibitory antibody by adult <b>Gambians</b> may therefore contribute to their immunity to malaria. Human antibodies produced by EBV-stimulated B lymphocytes {{may be used to}} identify other important P. falciparum antigens and have potential applications for immunotherapy...|$|R
50|$|Domodah is {{also used}} by <b>Gambians,</b> having been {{borrowed}} from the Mandinka language. In Senegal domodah or domoda is another dish different from mafe.
