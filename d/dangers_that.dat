5|$|The bat'leth is {{considered}} an iconic image of the Star Trek universe. Replicas are widespread and are considered collectibles by some {{and a part of}} Klingon costume. A number of outlets, including replica merchants, weapons dealers and pawn shops sell them. Ronald D. Moore, who has worked on Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica, displays one in his office. However, due to the <b>dangers</b> <b>that</b> real bat'leths can pose, no officially licensed replicas of the weapon are available from either Curry or Paramount Pictures.|$|E
5|$|Horizon Zero Dawn is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by Guerrilla Games {{and published by}} Sony Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4 and released in early 2017. The plot revolves around Aloy, a hunter and archer {{living in a world}} overrun by robots. Having been an outcast her whole life, she sets out to discover the <b>dangers</b> <b>that</b> kept her sheltered. The character uses ranged weapons and a spear and stealth tactics to combat the mechanised creatures, whose remains can be looted for resources. A skill tree provides the player with new abilities and passive bonuses. The game features an open world environment for Aloy to explore, divided into tribes that hold side quests to undertake, while the main story guides her across the entire map.|$|E

5|$|To {{film the}} scenes at the Wall the {{production}} built a {{set on the}} abandoned quarry of Magheramorne, a few minutes north of Belfast. The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall and the barracks, and used the stone wall of the quarry {{as the basis for}} the ice wall that protects Westeros from the <b>dangers</b> <b>that</b> dwell beyond. They also made a real elevator to lift the rangers to the top of the Wall.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the <b>dangers</b> <b>that</b> occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E

25|$|A site may {{be added}} to the List of World Heritage in Danger if there are {{conditions}} that threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the World Heritage List.

25|$|Jan van der Lans (1933–2002), a {{professor}} of the psychology of religion at the Catholic University of Nijmegen, wrote, in a book commissioned by the Netherlands-based Catholic Study Center for Mental Health, about followers of gurus and the potential <b>dangers</b> <b>that</b> exist when personal contact between the guru and the disciple is absent, such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student (myth making and deification), and an increase of the chance of false mysticism. He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality, but, when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners, {{the distinction between the}} person who is the guru and that which he symbolizes is often lost, resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a boundless, uncritical personality cult.|$|E

25|$|Many {{scholars}} of Islam {{have taken this}} as a classification of the sura as stemming from the earlier Meccan period and have shown the Pope to be mistaken {{by pointing out that}} Surah 2 was revealed in various stages and that this verse was revealed after Muhammad's hijra from Mecca, during his period of stay in Medina and hence is from the Medinan period which was the final stage of the revelation of the Qur'an when the Muslims were becoming numerous and increasingly powerful and safe from the immediate <b>dangers</b> <b>that</b> had overshadowed them for 13 years in Mecca. The scholars also point out that the Pope failed to mention that even if this verse was revealed when the Muslims were weak, they could have easily abrogated it with another verse which gave them permission to forcefully convert people once they finally conquered Mecca; this, however, did not happen.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{posts in}} the newly {{established}} Bulgarian Church were held by Byzantines who preached in Greek language. Aware of the <b>dangers</b> <b>that</b> the spiritual dependency on the Byzantine Empire could pose for Bulgaria's independence, BorisI was determined to ensure {{the autonomy of the}} Bulgarian Church under a Patriarch. Since the Byzantines were reluctant to grant any concessions Boris I took advantage on the ongoing rivalry between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Papacy in Rome in order to prevent either of them from exerting influence in his lands through religion. In 866 he sent a delegation to Rome under the high-ranking official Peter declaring his desire to accept Christianity in accordance with the Western rites along with 115 questions to Pope Nicholas I. The Pope's detailed answers to BorisI's questions were delivered by two bishops heading a mission to facilitate the conversion of the Bulgarian people. However, neither NicolasI nor his successor Adrian II agreed to recognize an autonomous Bulgarian Church, which cooled the relations between the two sides. Bulgaria's shift towards Rome on the other hand, made the Byzantines much more conciliatory. In 870, at the Fourth Council of Constantinople, the Bulgarian Church was recognized as an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Church under the supreme direction of the Patriarch of Constantinople.|$|E
