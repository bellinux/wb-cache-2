25|$|Wind {{power in}} Australia is {{a mode of}} {{production}} of renewable energy in Australia. Wind power is a rapidly expanding mode of renewable energy production in Australia with an average annual rate of growth in installed capacity of 35% over the five years up to 2011. As of 2016, there were 4327 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity. As of May 2017 a further 12328 MW of capacity was proposed or committed. In 2016, wind power accounted for 5.3% of Australia's total electricity demand and 30.8% of total renewable energy supply. At the end of 2016 there were 79 wind farms in Australia, most of which had turbines from 1.5 to 3 MW.

The measures are all found to contribute to the reduction of the deficits in both the public budget and the current account, while inducing positive growth effects and triggering a deflationary process. Rigid market clearing regimes weaken the effects and sometimes have adverse effects. The measures are found to differ in effectiveness, as well as in wealth distribution by economic agent. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The basic {{function}} of all deposit insurance schemes {{is to pay}} deposit insurance payouts to depositors promptly for the losses they otherwise would suffer {{in the event of}} an insured <b>financial</b> institution’s <b>closure.</b> As a result, depositors are relieved of both the recovery-rate and time risks of a liquidation process up to the insured level of their deposits. Deposit insurance payouts – including the speed and convenience – vary across countries and can affect public confidence in the deposit insurance scheme. Information technology support in the payout process is essential. However, one of the major problems in the insurance payout process is the lack of the proper information technology. This paper addresses the factors related to the payout process, dis-cusses the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches, and makes recommendations on the esta-blishment of a universal information technology model for a deposit insurer to accomplish the procedures of insurance payouts. Key words: deposit insurance, deposit insurance payouts, information technology suppor...|$|R

Based on administrative register data matched with firms' <b>financial</b> statements and <b>closure</b> {{data collected from}} bankruptcy proceedings, we show that a large fraction of Norwegian disability insurance claims can be directly attributed to job displacement and other adverse shocks to employment opportunities. For men, we estimate that job loss more than doubles the risk of entry to permanent disability and that displacements account for fully 28 percent of all new disability insurance claims. We conclude that unemployment and disability insurance are close substitutes. disability, displacement, social insurance, employment opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{assurance}} {{is increasingly}} {{seen as a}} means to ensure orderly, clean and lasting closure of mines. Broadly interpreted, "closure" requires leaving viable ecosystems on mining lands that are compatible with a healthy environment and with human activities, that have low hazard, and that encompass measures to prevent ongoing pollution from the site in the long-term. Financial assurance encompasses environmental surety instruments that protect the government and public in the event a mining company cannot meet its reclamation or rehabilitation obligations. As such, financial assurance is in essence the money available for closure of the mine in the case when the mine owner is not available to perform the work. A general trend towards greater environmental concern among social stakeholders in mining further serves to focus attention on policies and practices that can actually "assure" financial assurance. Financial assurance is also perceived {{as a means to}} address closure-related challenges that are increasing in number as well as diversity. Notably, current trends involve a shift towards a greater focus to the societal aspects of mine closure rather than just the ecological. The use of financial assurance, however, also raises some fundamental questions about how assurance mechanisms influence mining operations and the relationship between mining operations and their surroundings. This paper examines both the internal effect of a variety of financial assurance approaches on mining operations [...] in particular the manner in which environmental and social concerns are addressed by mining firms, and the almost inevitable tension between some form of <b>financial</b> provision for <b>closure</b> on the one hand, and governmental expectations of tax revenue on the other. As a major argument for supporting the conduct of mining is that state revenues from the extractive industries supply monies for the building of human and infrastructural capital, this second area of tension also has strong social and developmental overtones. <b>Financial</b> assurance Mine <b>closure</b> Stakeholder management...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{significance}} of hospital costs {{as a component of}} a nation’s total health care spending, governments are giving in-creased scrutiny to hospital privatization as a means of controlling cost escalation. While the means of privatization may differ among nations, such transitions mean the introduction of market forces into the supply and availability of hospital services. Correspondingly, nations must determine whether market forces alone should determine whether specific hospitals should be allowed to close based upon the owner’s sole determination. Responses to the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 show that gov-ernment intervention preserved several <b>financial</b> institutions whose <b>closure</b> or bankruptcy would have meant the termination of critical financial services. The authors believe that such intervention can be rationalized in certain cases of potential acute care hospital closures. Several international examples of health policies intended to maintain government involvement after hospital privatization are included...|$|R

40|$|Interventions in {{banks are}} often an {{integral}} {{element of a}} government’s program for addressing a systemic banking crisis. Interventions may be warranted because the banks are deeply insolvent or riddled with fraud; they may be requiring substantial liquidity support.

The initial closures were subject to criticism, but the more recent ones were viewed more positively.

40|$|The authors {{examine the}} effect of a {{trade-off}} between shared credit risk and liquidity efficiency, among participants in Tranche 2 of the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS T 2), on their decisions to leave open, or close, their bilateral credit limits (BCLs) to a participant at risk of imminent closure. The authors' analysis considers a network of three banks, in a settlement system similar to the LVTS T 2. Although it is widely believed that closure of one bank is imminent, the exact timing of the closure - during or after the settlement cycle - is uncertain. The other two banks face an "open or close" choice regarding their BCLs to the problem participant. Based on the expected net payoff of each choice, which includes the value of network externalities, the analysis shows that, when the expected credit loss is sufficiently low, an open-BCL pure-strategy Nash equilibrium can exist and can be Pareto efficient. This result dispels the generality of the frequent assertion that participants in the LVTS T 2 will close their BCLs to a participant that is subject to imminent <b>closure.</b> <b>Financial</b> institutions; Financial services; Payment, clearing, and settlement systems...|$|R
