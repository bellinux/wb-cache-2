In darkened {{areas of the}} establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed.

You really <b>have</b> <b>to</b> as they grope your crotch area grab their hand and push it away {{and there have been}} times when I’ve <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do that three, two or three or four times before they actually get the message.

I hadn't worked with Shonda Rhimes, and so I didn't know. I certainly knew she was a brilliant writer, but I didn't know what the intent was. We had a conversation about it. I said, 'You know what?

[...] "Of course, there are a few tracks which I'm not a big fan of but I <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the production team and everyone involved in the album very clearly gave every single track an enormous amount of attention."

40|$|Ludwig Wittgenstein's {{notoriously}} elusive later writings {{are dominated}} by remarks on language. However, while the textual analysis of Wittgenstein's writings is presently a boom industry, the tendency is to focus narrowly on exegetical matters with little attention to their bearing on philosophy at large. Moreover, one finds in contemporary philosophy of language various ideas with a distinctively Wittgensteinian ring to them but whose pedigree is uncertain. This volume brings together distinguished Wittgenstein scholars and renowned philosophers of language {{in order to examine}} <b>just</b> what Wittgenstein <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about language and to assess its significance for current philosophy. The topics discussed include the connection between the meaning of a word and its use, the bearing the context of utterance has on how words are to be understood, the role of rules in the employment of language, and whether Wittgenstein's reflections on these issues encourage sceptical or relativist thought...|$|R
