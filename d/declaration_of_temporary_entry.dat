40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the interactions between}} financial sector reform and entrepreneurial development {{with a focus on}} identifying policies appropriate for fostering entrepreneurial discovery and learning. Using a simple model of occupational choice with moral hazard, it analyzes the effects of Financial Liberalization policies (McKinnon, 1973) on the development of industrial entrepreneurship. The analysis shows that in a fully liberalized and competitive banking economy (i) banks may fail to finance potential industrial entrepreneurs because of poaching externality, and (ii) systematically favor short-term projects with front-loaded returns at the expense of projects with strong learning effects. Policies <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>entry</b> restraint and deposit rate control as advocated in the Financial Restraint paradigm can be effective in encouraging banks to experiment with new industrial entrepreneurs. While deposit rate control can encourage entrepreneurial discovery even in a competitive banking economy, it is not effective in weeding out short-termism in project choice. Entry restraint can be especially useful for reducing the bias against the projects with low initial returns but strong learning and productivity gains later. Our analysis shows that a dual-track policy where entry restraint is implemented in the industrial sector lending but competition is preserved in the lending to the competing economic activity (like agriculture) can be useful to tackle the problems of poaching externality and short-termism in project choice...|$|R

5|$|On September 11, 1986, 225 Polish {{political}} prisoners were released—the last of those connected with Solidarity, and arrested {{during the previous}} years. Following amnesty on September 30, Wałęsa created the first public, legal Solidarity entity since the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> martial law—the <b>Temporary</b> Council <b>of</b> NSZZ Solidarność (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność)—with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, Władysław Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Janusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pałubicki and Józef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council {{was admitted to the}} International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many local Solidarity chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on October 25, 1987, the National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarność (Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarność) was created. Nonetheless, Solidarity members and activists continued to be persecuted and discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, a rift between Wałęsa's faction and a more radical Fighting Solidarity grew as the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned for an anti-communist revolution.|$|R
40|$|Migration {{policy in}} Australia has always {{emphasized}} the permanent settlement of skilled migrants. It {{is only in}} the last ten years, since the introduction <b>of</b> the <b>temporary</b> business <b>entry</b> (long-stay) 457 visa in 1996, that skilled temporary migration has become an increasingly important element of international migration to Australia. This paper examines the Asia-Pacific region as a source <b>of</b> skilled <b>temporary</b> migration to Australia. This is based on an examination of trend statistics on visa grants and temporary residents by country of origin published by the Department of Immigration. Following this overview, the paper compares skilled temporary migrants from Asia-Pacific countries with those from non-Asia-Pacific countries to investigate whether the Asia-Pacific migrants are selective of particular demographic or human capital characteristics. This analysis is based on data from a survey of 457 visa holders that was conducted by the authors in 2004. The paper also compares the reasons for migration, employment situation and return migration/permanent residence intentions of migrants from Asia-Pacific countries with those of migrants from non-Asia-Pacific countries. The paper concludes with a discussion of the human resource and policy implications of the findings from these analyses for the Asia-Pacific sending countries and for Australia.

In July 1988, Teoh married Jean Lim, an Australian citizen and the de facto spouse of Teoh's {{deceased}} brother. Mrs Teoh had four children, one from her first marriage and three from the de facto relationship. Subsequently, Mr and Mrs Teoh had three children together. In October 1988, Teoh {{was granted a}} further <b>temporary</b> <b>entry</b> permit that enabled him to remain in Australia until February 1989. Prior to the expiry of the permit, Teoh applied for a grant of resident status. In November 1990, whilst this application was being processed, Mr Teoh was convicted on charges of heroin importation and possession.|$|R

Employers were unhappy {{with what they}} considered excessive regulation <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> jobs, insufficient freedom to proceed with individual dismissals and inappropriate changes in social protection schemes 17. Precisely the opposite criticism came from the trade union side, which branded the reform as too timid in fighting precarious job conditions, too harsh in reducing guarantees against firing and untimely in modifying social protection schemes during a recession. A sense of responsibility, however, prevailed and despite resentful and rhetorical opposition (with <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> a “never ending battle”), CGIL refrained from calling massive general strikes against the change.|$|R
