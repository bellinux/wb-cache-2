It has been introduced in Madagascar, {{where it is now}} a widespread invasive species.|$|E
50|$|Nirmal’s growing role as {{an activist}} {{can be seen in}} the {{successful}} ‘Save the Frogs’ campaign against the local consumption of <b>Indian</b> <b>Bullfrogs,</b> which he led along with co-campaigner Clinton Vaz and the Goa Forest Department. The campaign included awareness-cum-law enforcement activities. He was also part of a team that worked on conserving the Bhimgad Forests in Karnataka. Their efforts ultimately led to the creation of the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary. The efforts by his team under Nirmal’s leadership also have helped declare the Mahdei Wildlife Sanctuary as a Proposed Tiger Reserve and bring attention to the Mahdei Dam Project that is slated to irreversibly damage prime Western Ghats habitat.|$|R
50|$|Focusing his {{researches}} on comparative endocrinology of amphibians, Saidapur {{explained the}} different types of reproductive processes followed by the tropical anurans and their control mechanisms. His studies are reported to have widened the understanding of the reproductive biology of the vertebrates and concentrating his researches on <b>Indian</b> <b>Bullfrog,</b> he proposed gametogenesis methodologies for producing frogs of predetermined sex. His studies also covered the behavioral ecology of anuran tadpoles and agamid lizards with regard to their foraging techniques, food identification, kin detection and predator-prey relationships and he developed new ways for the captive breeding of reptiles. On the academic front, it was under his leadership Karnatak University introduced new academic courses on molecular biology, animal behavior and evolutionary biology. He is {{a former member of the}} INSA council and served as its vice president during 2012-14. He has also published several articles and has mentored 13 scholars in their doctoral researches.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Indian</b> <b>bullfrog,</b> Hoplobatrachus tigerinus plays a {{significant}} role in maintaining the natural balance in the ecosystems. It {{plays an important role in}} controlling the various agricultural pests because of its omnivorous feeding habit. The aim of the present study is to know the genetic variation of H. tigerinus in three natural habitats. Samples collected from three districts of Bangladesh were analyzed with five enzymes (MDH, LDH, GPI, PGM and EST) in CA 6. 1 buffer system for their genetic variation. Four polymorphic loci (Mdh- 1, Est- 1, Gpi- 1 and Pgm) were interpretable in muscle with starch gel electrophoresis. Among the 5 presumptive loci, the mean proportion of polymorphic loci was observed 80, 80 and 60 % in Rangpur, Khulna and Mymensingh populations, respectively. The highest mean number of allele per locus and mean proportion of heterozygous loci per individual were observed in the Rangpur population. The average observed heterozygosity (H o) was 0. 163 and expected heterozygosity (H e) was 0. 469. In pair-wise analysis, comparatively higher N m value (5. 507) was estimated between the Rangpur and Khulna populations corresponding lower level of F ST value (0. 043). The UPGMA dendrogram showed two clusters among the three <b>Indian</b> <b>bullfrog</b> populations. Rangpur and Khulna populations formed one cluster while Mymensingh population formed another cluster. The Mymensingh population separated from Rangpur and Khulna by a genetic distance of 0. 177 whereas, the Khulna population is different from the Rangpur population by the genetic distance of 0. 052. The results suggested that the considerable genetic variation is maintained among the natural H. tigerinus populations...|$|E
