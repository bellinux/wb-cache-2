40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} chewing lice species of waders between September-October 2009 at Lake Kuyucuk Bird Ringing Station in Kars, eastern Turkey. Fourty-one birds belonging to two families (Scolopacidae and Sternidae), five genera and the following species were examined: Chlidonias leucopterus, Gallinago gallinago, Tringa glareola, Calidris minuta, Calidris alpina, Calidris temminckii, and Philomachus pugnax. Birds were caught in mistnets, ringed, examined for ectoparasites and released unharmed. To sample chewing lice, the feathers of each bird were carefully rubbed with a synthetic pyrethroid <b>insecticide</b> <b>dust,</b> over a white piece of paper. Thereafter, birds were placed in a breathable paper bag for 5 min. All lice were collected and placed in tubes with 70 % alcohol. Lice specimens were cleared in 10 % KOH, mounted in Canada balsam and identified under binoculer light microscope. Thirty-six out of 41 birds examined (88 %) were infested {{with at least one}} chewing louse species. All individuals of Chlidonias leucopterus, Calidris minuta, C. alpina, C. temminckii and Philomachus pugnax were infested, whereas 4 ou...|$|E
40|$|Insecticide {{resistance}} in bed bugs (Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus) has become widespread, which has necessitated {{the development of}} new IPM (Integrated Pest Management) strategies and products for the eradication of infestations. Two promising options are the diatomaceous earth and silica gel-based desiccant dusts, both of which induce dehydration and eventual death upon bed bugs exposed to these products. However, the impact of underlying mechanisms that confer resistance to insecticides, such as cuticle thickening, on the performance of these dusts has yet to be determined. In the present study, two desiccant dusts, CimeXa <b>Insecticide</b> <b>Dust</b> (silica gel) and Bed Bug Killer Powder (diatomaceous earth) were evaluated against two strains of C. lectularius; one highly pyrethroid-resistant and one insecticide-susceptible. Label-rate doses of both products produced 100 % mortality in both strains, albeit over dissimilar time-frames (3 – 4 days with CimeXa vs. 14 days with Bed Bug Killer). Sub-label rate exposure to CimeXa indicated that the pyrethroid-resistant strain possessed a degree of tolerance to this product, surviving 50 % longer than the susceptible strain. This is the first study to suggest that mechanisms conferring resistance to pyrethroids, such as cuticular thickening, may have potential secondary impacts on non-synthetic insecticides, including desiccant dusts, which target the bed bug’s cuticle...|$|E
40|$|Dustacators (combination mineral feeders and {{livestock}} dusting devices) {{were used for}} four beef herds at Kansas State University in 1985. Loose mineral was supplied in all four Dustacator tubs, which were adjusted to low settings. Permethrin dust had no apparent effect on horn flies. Co-Ral® from two sources and Rabon® provided approximately 65 % horn fly reduction during the 53 -day test period. The 1986 experiment compared the effects of Dustacator mineral tub height adjustments and loose vs. block mineral. Co-Hal 1 % dust from a single source was used in all treatments on two Simmental herds and two Polled Hereford herds. Excellent horn fly control was achieved and maintained except for a temporary increase in horn fly numbers in early September in all treatments. Face fly control was inadequate in all treatments in both years. Use of block mineral was related to reduced mineral consumption and self-application of more <b>insecticide</b> <b>dust.</b> High tub adjustment was related to greater mineral consumption but reduced self-application of insecticide. The degree of fly control was not correlated with amount of insecticide used either on a per-cow or per-herd basis. Simmentals consumed nearly twice as much mineral per head as Polled Herefords, but they used only 20 % more insecticide. Including the cost of 1 % Co- Ral dust and equipment costs amortized over 5 years, Dustacators provided acceptable horn fly control and some reduction of face fly numbers for $ 1. 62 per cowlcalf pair, plus labor...|$|E
50|$|Their {{first plane}} {{was made in}} late 1925. It was a {{commercial}} type of aircraft, suited to carrying passengers, aerial photography, <b>insecticide</b> <b>dusting,</b> training student pilots, and light cargo use. The plane featured folding wings, bearing and guiding surfaces interchangeability, an adjustable stabilizer, and wide-tracked axleless landing gear. The aircraft had a gasoline tank with a capacity of forty gallons and could fly a maximum of five hours on this quantity of fuel. It was tested at Packard Field in Utica, Michigan. Alfred Verville was the chief designer from the company's founding in 1925 until 1927, the CA-3 Airster was developed and certified, 20 were manufactured.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was laid out}} with 12 treatments including control {{to find out the}} persistence oftoxicity of <b>insecticides</b> in <b>dust</b> and wettable formulations at their recommended concentrations during winterseason on mustard crop. The residual effectiveness was worked out in the laboratory by observing mortalityon the treated apical growth parts of mustard plant of each treatment after 24 hrs, 5 and 10 days ofinsecticidal applications and in the field by taking observations on aphid population. Both under field andlaboratory conditions, fenitrothion 0. 1 % spray and phenthoate 2 % dust proved most effective. Carbaryl 0. 1 %spray proved ineffective. After 10 days of treatment all <b>insecticides</b> of <b>dust</b> and wettable formulations lasttheir toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous {{disease of}} unknown {{aetiology}} characterized by infiltration of non caseating granulomas in multiple organ systems. Sarcoidosis {{can have a}} plethora of cardiac manifestations which can mimic many other cardiovascular conditions ranging from asymptomatic electrocardiographic manifestations to life threatening arrhythmias resulting in sudden cardiac death. Even {{more than a century}} after the first description of the disease by Norwegian dermatologist Caeser Boeck in 1899 [1], the aetiology of the disease remain elusive. Pathophysiology of sarcoidosis The pathological hallmark of sarcoidosis is the non caseating granuloma. The inciting event which leads to the formation of the granuloma is still unknown. various environmental agents have been postulated as triggers leading to granuloma formation including propionibacter and mycobacterial infections, tree pollen, photocopier toner <b>dust,</b> <b>insecticides,</b> vegetable <b>dust</b> and titanium eposure [2 - 4].

40|$|Children may {{be exposed}} to {{pesticides}} in several ways, such as by transplacental transfer during foetal life, by intake of contaminated breast milk and other nutrients, or by contact with contaminated subjects and areas in the environment such as pets treated with <b>insecticides,</b> house <b>dust,</b> carpets and chemically treated lawns and gardens. Exposure early in life, and particularly during periods of rapid development, such as during foetal life and infancy, may have severe effects on child health and development by elevating the risk of congenital malformations, cancer, malabsorption, immunological dysfunction, endocrine disease, and neurobehavioural deficiencies. As pesticides can also interfere with parental reproductive health, exposure of parents may have consequences for the offspring leading to reduced chance of male birth and increased risk of childhood cancer. Conclusions: Current knowledge about tolerable levels and consequences of toxic exposure to pesticides during human development is rather scarce. Owing to the high risk of exposure to pesticides, particularly in less developed countries, further elucidation by well-controlled epidemiological studies in this field it is urgently needed. The Policy Interpretation Network on Children's Health and Environment (PINCHE), which is financed by the EU DG research has suggested actions against pesticide exposure. They have been presented and discussed in this paper. Several suggestions of PINCHE concerning action needed regarding pesticides were presented in the paper...|$|R
50|$|After {{taking out}} a Swiss patent on DDT in 1940 (a U.K. patent {{followed}} in 1942 and patents in the U.S. and Australia in 1943), Geigy began to market two DDT-based products, a 5% dust called Gesarol spray insecticide and a 3% dust called Neocid <b>dust</b> <b>insecticide.</b> The name DDT was first employed by the British Ministry of Supply in 1943, and the product was added to U.S. Army supply lists in May of the same year. It was also in 1943 that the first practical tests of DDT as a residual insecticide against adult vector mosquitoes were carried out. The next year, in Italy, tests were performed in which residual DDT {{was applied to the}} interior surfaces of all habitations and outbuildings of a community to test its effect on Anopheles vectors and malaria incidence.|$|R
30|$|Another {{possible}} mode {{of action}} is physical. Alexander et al. [13] showed that the {{mode of action}} for inert <b>dust</b> <b>insecticides</b> was independent of chemical reactivity. We have previously shown that concrobium dust causes mortality in Reticulitermes flavipes[14]. Also, inert dusts induced death in grain weevils by desiccation since respiration and ingestion {{did not seem to}} harm the insects. While ZnO is not inert, it is entirely possible that termite mortality demonstrated by Kartal et al. [12] and Clausen et al. [11, 15] {{is the result of a}} physical reaction alone, or in addition to a physiochemical reaction since a film of nano-particles remained on the surface of the unleached wood blocks. Furthermore, antibacterial activity has been reported to increase with reduction in particle size [8]. In our previous study, wood blocks were treated with a single particle size (30 nm) of ZnO and the effect of particle size could not be ascertained.|$|R
40|$|Tungiasis is a {{permanent}} penetration of female sand flea “Tunga penetrans” into the epidermis of its host. It affects human beings and domestic and sylvatic animals. In this paper, we apply optimal control techniques to a Tungiasis controlled mathematical model to determine the optimal control strategy {{in order to minimize}} the number of infested humans, infested animals, and sand flea populations. In an attempt to reduce Tungiasis infestation in human population, the control strategies based on personal protection, personal treatment, educational campaign, environmental sanitation, and insecticidal treatments on the affected parts as well as on animal fur are considered. We prove the existence of optimal control problem, determine the necessary conditions for optimality, and then perform numerical simulations. The numerical results showed that the control strategy comprises all five control measures and that which involves the three control measures of <b>insecticide</b> control, insecticidal <b>dusting</b> on animal furs, and environmental hygiene has the significant impact on Tungiasis transmission. Therefore, fighting against Tungiasis infestation in endemic settings, multidimensional control process should be employed in order to achieve the maximum benefits...|$|R
40|$|Insect pests {{associated}} with durable grains and processed food cause considerable {{quantitative and qualitative}} losses throughout the world. Insect infestation can occur just prior to harvest, during storage in traditional storage structures, cribs, metal or concrete bins, and in warehouses, food handling facilities, retail grocery stores as well as in-transit. Many tools are available for managing insects {{associated with}} grains and processed food. Although pest management strategies are changing to meet consumer’s demand for food free of insecticide residues, address concerns about safety of insecticides to humans, delay insecticide resistance development in insects and comply with stricter insecticide regulations, the use of synthetic residual insecticides {{will continue to be}} a major component of stored-product pest management programmes. Selective use of residual insecticides requires a through understanding and evaluation of risks, costs and benefits. The use of plant and inert materials may be a safe, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method of grain preservation against pest infestation among low-resource poor farmers who store small amounts of grains. There is a dearth of information on the use of plant materials by rural farmers in Africa for stored-product protection. The most promising candidate plant materials for future utilization as grain protectants are Azadirachta, Acorus, Chenopodium, Eucalyptus, Mentha, Ocimum, Piper and Tetradenia together with vegetable oils from various sources. Neem is the only plant from which several commercial products have been developed worldwide. However, unlike synthetic insecticides these alternatives often do not provide effective or rapid suppression of pest populations and may not be effective against all species of pests. These alternatives are also more expensive than synthetic insecticides, and have not been tested extensively under field conditions in the tropics. This paper focuses on the current state of the utilization of residual <b>insecticides,</b> inert <b>dusts</b> and botanicals by resource-poor farmers for protection of durable stored produce against pest infestation in Africa. A major research priority is a well designed on-farm trials to validate the efficacy of botanicals and inert dusts for stored-product protection using standard procedures and formulations that can be transferred to other communities...|$|R
40|$|Background: In 2008 the {{poisoning}} {{of about}} 12000 bee colonies {{was reported in}} Germany. These poisonings were caused by the drift of dust particles containing the insecticidal substance clothianidin following the seeding of maize, treated with the <b>insecticide</b> Poncho Pro. <b>Dust</b> abrasion from coated seeds occurred because of inadequate seed dressing quality, resulting in high quantities of dust emitted into the environment. In order to cover this specific risk, Regulation (EC) No. 1107 / 2009 provides for special arrangements for the {{placing on the market}} of treated seeds. In addition, the Commission Directive 2010 / 21 /EU lays down specific provisions relating to certain neonicotinoids and fipronil for seed coating and seeding. Results: According to these provisions the German authorities applied risk mitigation measures in the form of specific labels for certain products and seed bags of treated seeds. Conclusions: Dust within seed bags and drift from seeding actions is a common phenomenon for a number of crops. However, the quantity within the seed bags and the emission of dust can be reduced significantly by technical means (e. g. treatment recipe, facility equipment, deflector technique) and by additional mitigation measures (e. g. max. wind speed). These can be established within the authorization procedure by the Member States...|$|R
40|$|Among recent {{tendencies to}} {{substitute}} the chemical method of plant protection, physical insecticides have also some importance. Physical <b>insecticides</b> include inert <b>dusts,</b> i. e. dusts without chemical action which breeks down the impermeability of the epicuticular wax monolayer causing death of insects by dehydration. A {{survey of the}} extensive investigations carried on in order {{to contribute to the}} better knowledge of different inert dusts is given in this paper and some possibilities of their use are mentioned. The topics of these investigations were as follows: the biological activity of 32 different dusts on ten different coleopteraus insects of stored products, the possibilities to activate some dusts, the influence of the water content of grain, of the relative air humidity and of the temperature on the activity of different dusts on varions test misects, the residnal activity of some dusts apter storing the treated in different conditions, the inflance of dust on the progeny of weevils, the application of dusts in from of water suspension, some investigation deposing inert dusts on the body of insects using a microapplicator, the dynamics of the water loss of insect bodies treated with dusts, the measuring of the sorptive capacity of dusts for linseed oil, rhodamine B, methylene blue and beeswax, the measuring of the dynamics of aceptance or of the loss of water from different dusts in various conditions etc, etc...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{decided to}} explore whether diatomaceous earths (DEs) might meet the grain {{protection}} demands of rural households. These inert dusts are non-toxic to mammals but deadly to insects absorbing the wax from the insect’s cuticle {{which leads to}} water loss and death. Following laboratory studies, promising commercial DEs were trialled collaboratively by researchers and farmers as grain protectants in Zimbabwe. Protect-lt and Dryacide applied at 0. 1 %w/w were {{as effective as the}} synthetic conventional <b>insecticide,</b> Actellic Super <b>dust,</b> in limiting insect damage on stored maize, sorghum and cowpea grains for periods of eight months. However, laboratory studies revealed that the devastating larger grain borer now spread throughout many African countries was more tolerant to DEs than the storage pests found in Zimbabwe. This initiated the testing of DEs in combination with other products. Higher DE application rates of 0. 25 %w/w, a DE-pyrethroid combination and a local African DE were successfully tested by farmers in Tanzania. During this work the importance of the link between a potential technology such as DEs and the wider post-harvest service provision context became clearer. This led to the exploration of this context using: an enquiry approach to learn about post-harvest decision making amongst diverse rural households; and an experimental learning process to empower farmers. As the nature of the different stakeholders within the agricultural innovation system and their information requirements became more central to the work, the importance of the patterns of interaction amongst them and associated attitudes was repeatedly revealed. A learning alliance of key post-harvest stakeholders was established to explore and test opportunities for stakeholders to work together differently to help overcome institutional and other constraints.
