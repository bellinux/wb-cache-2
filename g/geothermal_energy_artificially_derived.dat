40|$|<b>Geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{promising}} renewable energy technologies because it is environmentally benign and, unlike most renewable energy sources, can provide base power. This report provides an assessment of the research and development (R&D) work underway in <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> in the following countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom. While the R&D work underway in the US exceeds the R&D efforts of the other countries, the lead is eroding. This erosion is due to reductions in federal government funding for <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> R&D and the decline of the US petroleum industry. This erosion of R&D leadership is hindering commercialization of US <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> products and services. In comparison, the study countries are promoting the commercialization of their <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> products and services.

40|$|South Africa {{intends to}} {{mitigate}} its carbon emissions by developing renewable energy from solar, wind and hydro, and investigating {{alternative energy sources}} such as natural gas and nuclear. Low-enthalpy <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> is becoming increasingly popular around the world, {{largely as a result}} of technological advances that have enabled energy to be harnessed from relatively low temperature sources. However, <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> does not form part of South Africa’s future renewable energy scenario. This omission may be related to insufficient regional analysis of potentially viable geothermal zones across the country. We considered existing subsurface temperature and heat flow measurements and performed solute-based hydrochemical geothermometry to determine potentially anomalous geothermal gradients that could signify underlying low-enthalpy <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> resources. We correlated these findings against hydro/geological and tectonic controls to find prospective target regions for investigating <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> development. Our results show a significant link between tectonic features, including those on-craton, and the development of geothermal potential regions. In addition, potential regions in South Africa share similarities with other locations that have successfully harnessed low-enthalpy <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy.</b> South Africa may therefore have a realistic chance of developing <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy,</b> but will still need additional research and development, including new temperature measurements, and structural, hydrogeological and economic investigations.
