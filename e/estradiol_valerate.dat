25|$|Prasterone is {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} androgen in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause. In addition to prasterone itself, a long-lasting ester prodrug of prasterone, prasterone enanthate, is used in combination with <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> {{for the treatment of}} menopausal symptoms under the brand name Gynodian Depot.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol, estrone, and estriol {{have all}} been {{approved}} as pharmaceutical drugs and are used medically. Estetrol is currently under development for medical indications, but {{has not yet been}} approved in any country. A variety of synthetic estrogen esters, such as <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate,</b> estradiol cypionate, estradiol acetate, estradiol undecylate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol benzoate, are used clinically. The aforementioned compounds behave as prodrugs to estradiol, and are longer-lasting in comparison. Esters of estrone and estriol also exist and are employed in clinical medicine.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Butenandt {{found that}} the benzoic acid ester of estrone had a {{prolonged}} duration of action. Subsequently, Schwenk and Hildebrant synthesized estradiol benzoate from estradiol in 1933, and estradiol benzoate was introduced by Schering-Kahlbaum for medical use via intramuscular injection under the brand name Progynon-B in 1936. It was the first estrogen ester to be marketed, and has since been followed by many additional esters, for instance <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> and estradiol cypionate in the 1950s. Ethinylestradiol was synthesized from estradiol by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1938 and was introduced for oral use by Schering in the United States under the brand name Estinyl in 1943. It remains widely used in combined oral contraceptives.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{is one of}} the {{two major}} sex hormones in XX chromosomed {{individuals}} (the other being progesterone), and is responsible for the development and maintenance of feminine secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, wide hips, and a feminine pattern of fat distribution. Estrogens act by binding to and activating the estrogen receptor (ER), their biological target in the body. A variety of different forms of estrogen are available and used medically. The most common estrogens used in transgender women include estradiol (which is the predominant natural estrogen in women) and estradiol esters such as <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> and estradiol cypionate (which are prodrugs of estradiol). Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), marketed as Premarin, and ethinylestradiol are also sometimes used, but this is becoming less common. Estrogens may be administered orally, sublingually, transdermally (via patch), topically (via gel), by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, or by an implant.|$|E
50|$|Estradiol cypionate and <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> {{are both}} C17β esters of estradiol. The {{affinity}} of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> for the estrogen receptor {{has been reported}} to be 50 times less than that of estradiol, and <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> and estradiol cypionate have been found to possess similar affinity for the estrogen receptor. Both estradiol cypionate and <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> are rapidly cleaved into estradiol in the body, and <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> {{has been found to be}} unable to reach target tissues in any concentration of significance. As such, <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is regarded as essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol, and estradiol cypionate is described as a prodrug of estradiol similarly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{esterification}} of the C17β {{position of}} estradiol as in <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> prevents the metabolism of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). As approximately 80% of estradiol is metabolized into estrone (and estrone sulfate) by 17β-HSD during first-pass metabolism, this improves the metabolic stability and hence bioavailability of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate.</b> However, <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is hydrolyzed into estradiol and valeric acid in the intestines, and hence, is still subject to extensive (albeit comparatively reduced) first-pass metabolism. As such, the oral bioavailability of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is only around 3 to 5%, and {{is comparable to}} that of micronized estradiol (which has similarly improved bioavailability relative to (non-micronized) oral estradiol). Due to its nature as a rapidly converted prodrug of estradiol, the pharmacokinetics of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> {{are similar to those of}} micronized estradiol. Moreover, the pharmacodynamics and potency (after differences in molecular weight are taken into account) of oral <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> are considered to be equivalent to those of micronized estradiol. This is also notably true for effects on hepatic protein synthesis (e.g., of [...] ), again after differences in molecular weight between the two drugs are considered.|$|E
50|$|The {{affinity}} of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> (before cleavage) for the estrogen receptor {{is approximately}} 50 times {{lower than that}} of estradiol (after cleavage). In addition, <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> (before cleavage) is unable to reach target tissues in any concentration of significance, if at all. As such, <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> (before cleavage) is essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol (after cleavage).|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to oral administration, the bioavailability of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> {{has been found}} to be complete (i.e., 100%) via intramuscular injection. Due to the far greater bioavailability of intramuscular <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> relative to oral, the former is substantially stronger (in terms of potency) than the latter. As an example, a single 4 mg intramuscular injection is said to be approximately equivalent to 2 mg/day of the drug administered orally over the course of 3 weeks. <b>Estradiol</b> <b>valerate,</b> when given intramuscularly in oil, has a relatively long duration due to the formation of an intramuscular depot from which the drug is slowly released and absorbed. Upon intramuscular injection of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> in an oil solution, the solvent (i.e., oil) is absorbed, and a primary microcrystalline depot is formed within the muscle at the site of injection. In addition, a secondary depot may also be formed in adipose tissue. The slow release of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is caused by the increased lipophilicity of the drug, which in turn is due to its long fatty acid valeric acid ester moiety. The terminal half-life of intramuscularly administered <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> in oil is reported to be 4 to 5 days.|$|E
50|$|A single {{intramuscular}} injection of 4 mg <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> {{has been found}} to result in maximal circulating levels of estradiol of about 390 pg/mL within 3 days of administration, with levels declining to 100 pg/mL (baseline, in the study) by 12-13 days. Another study found that a single {{intramuscular injection}} of 5 mg <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> resulted in peak circulating levels of 667 pg/mL estradiol and 324 pg/mL estrone within approximately 2 and 3 days, respectively (see right/above table). The duration of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> at this dose and in this study was considered to be 7 to 8 days. Other studies have found that larger doses of intramuscular <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> exceeding 20 mg have a duration of more than 15 days. A third study, in contrast to the preceding study, found that a single 10 mg intramuscular injection of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> resulted in maximal estradiol levels of 506-544 pg/mL and maximal estrone levels of 205-219 pg/mL in postmenopausal women.|$|E
50|$|This is, however, not {{an issue}} as <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is cleaved very rapidly in the body. The post-cleavage 17β-estradiol is bioidentical to estrogen. In practise, oral <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is {{considered}} to be equivalent to micronized estradiol, due to its fast conversion speed as prodrug.|$|E
50|$|Estradiol, in an ester prodrug form such as <b>{{estradiol}}</b> <b>valerate</b> or estradiol cypionate, can {{be administered}} by intramuscular injection, via which a long-lasting depot effect occurs. In {{contrast to the}} oral route, the bioavailability of estradiol and its esters like <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is complete (i.e., 100%) with intramuscular injection.|$|E

50|$|Oral <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is used {{primarily}} in Europe, under {{the brand name}} Progynova. Although previously available in the United States, oral <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is no longer available in this country (except in combination with dienogest as a combined oral contraceptive under the brand name Natazia). Intramuscular <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is available under the brand name Delestrogen in the U.S. and Canada and under the brand name Progynon Depot in Europe {{and elsewhere in the}} world. In the U.S., it is available in formulations of 10 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL, and 40 mg/mL in oil (as Delestrogen, as well as generics). The only other injectable formulations of estrogen available in the U.S. are estradiol cypionate (5 mg/mL in oil) and conjugated estrogens (Premarin) (25 mg/vial in solution).|$|E
50|$|Upon ingestion, {{regardless}} of the route of administration, <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> behaves as a prodrug via cleavage by esterases into estradiol and the natural fatty acid valeric acid. This cleavage occurs {{not only in the}} liver, but also in the blood and in tissues, and the hydrolysis of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> into estradiol and valeric acid is complete {{regardless of}} whether the drug is administered orally or parenterally. High levels of circulating estradiol are found after an intravenous injection of <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate,</b> and this indicates very rapid cleavage of the drug upon entering circulation. In contrast to estradiol, which can distribute into and exert its effects in target tissues, valeric acid is quickly metabolized via beta oxidation (see also fatty acid metabolism).|$|E
50|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is also widely {{available}} in combination with prasterone enanthate (DHEA enanthate) under the brand name Gynodian Depot.|$|E

5000|$|Progynon {{was also}} the name that Butenandt {{originally}} gave estrone (which he had isolated in 1929) in his first publication on the substance (and later referred to as folliculine, with the name estrone not finally being adopted until 1935). Aside from Progynon and Progynon 2, the Progynon name has also been used {{in a variety of}} other estrogenic products marketed by Schering, including Progynon-B (estradiol benzoate), Progynon-DH (estradiol; [...] "dihydroxyestrin"), Progynon-DP (estradiol dipropionate), Progynon-C (ethinylestradiol), Progynova (<b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate),</b> and Progynon Depot (<b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate,</b> estradiol undecylate).|$|E
50|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>{{valerate}}</b> (EV, E2V) (INN, USAN, JAN) (brand names Progynova, Progynon Depot, Delestrogen, many others), or oestradiol valerate (BAN), is a synthetic, steroidal {{estrogen and}} an estrogen ester - specifically, the 17β-valerate ester of estradiol - which is marketed in the United States, Canada, Europe, and {{throughout much of}} the rest of the world. It acts as a prodrug of estradiol, and hence, is considered to be a natural, bioidentical form of estrogen. Along with estradiol cypionate, <b>estradiol</b> <b>valerate</b> is one of the most widely used esters of estradiol.|$|E
