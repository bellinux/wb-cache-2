5|$|Most pre-race {{analyses}} identified Ivan Basso, Cadel Evans, and Carlos Sastre as {{the major}} favorites to win the overall classification, with Evans perhaps the consensus pick. Basso and Sastre had both ridden the Giro in 2009 and come away finishing in the top five. Sastre also won two difficult mountain stages in the race's final week, and was noted as a rider who gets stronger as a race goes along, making the Giro's very climbing-intensive third week possibly sit in his favor. Evans had finished on a Grand Tour podium in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three seasons, including {{in the most recent}} three-week event, the 2009 Vuelta a España. He also entered the race as the reigning world cycling champion and had had a successful 2010 season to date, with a win in La Flèche Wallonne and a podium finish in the Tirreno–Adriatico. Neither Basso nor Sastre had raced much in the 2010 season prior to the Giro. Other riders named as contenders included Bradley Wiggins, former Giro winners Damiano Cunego and Stefano Garzelli, Alexander Vinokourov, Marzio Bruseghin, Christian Vande Velde, Domenico Pozzovivo, David Moncoutié, and Michele Scarponi. Race director Angelo Zomegnan also named Basso, Evans, and Sastre as his three favorites, and included Wiggins and Linus Gerdemann as possible darkhorses.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May, Totti {{came off}} the bench and scored from a free kick to help Roma to come from behind and achieve a 3–2 away win over Genoa; this was his 21st goal from a free kick in Serie A, which put him {{alongside}} Baggio as the joint all-time fourth-highest scorer of free kicks in Serie A history, behind only Alessandro Del Piero, Andrea Pirlo, and Siniša Mihajlović. Totti {{came off the}} bench in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> five Serie A games and contributed four goals and an assist. On 8 May, Totti came off the bench to set up Roma's final goal in a 3–0 home win over Chievo in his 600th Serie A appearance, becoming the third player ever to reach this milestone. Overall, Totti only made 13 league appearances throughout the season but scored four goals in the final six matches as a substitute. On 7 June, he renewed his contract for another year, stating {{that he would be}} retiring {{at the end of the}} 2016–17 season; he also revealed he had signed a six-year contract as Roma's technical director once the season ends.|$|E
5|$|The Tour de France was {{the main}} {{focal point of the}} season for BMC's leader Evans, and perhaps the team itself. He had ridden two Grand Tours <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two seasons, and in three of the past four, but in 2011 he focused solely on the Tour. He rode a {{different}} race program in preparation for the Tour than he had in previous years, riding fewer races. Among them were the early-season stage races Tirreno–Adriatico and Tour de Romandie, both of which Evans won, and the Critérium du Dauphiné, where he finished on the podium in second overall. The squad named to the race was chosen with the sole goal of helping Evans win the race overall. It consisted of classics specialists Hincapie and Burghardt with the aim of keeping Evans out of trouble in the flatter stages, climbers Moinard and Morabito to help in the mountains, and strong time trialists Bookwalter and Schär (and Hincapie) for the stage 2 team time trial. Hincapie made his 16th consecutive Tour start, to tie the record held by Joop Zoetemelk, having finished each except the very first.|$|E

5|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} of the 2016–17 season against Sampdoria on 11 September, Totti equalled Paolo Maldini's record of playing in 25 Serie A seasons. With Roma trailing 2–1 at half time, Totti came off the bench and assisted Edin Džeko's temporary equaliser, later also scoring the match-winning goal from a penalty in injury time to secure a 3–2 home win in Serie A; Totti's goal meant that {{he had managed to}} score at least once in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 23 consecutive seasons of his career. On 25 September, he scored his 250th Serie A goal from the penalty spot in a 3–1 away defeat to Torino, just two days before his 40th birthday. On his first start two days after his 40th birthday, on 29 September, Totti was praised for his performance and longevity in a 4–0 home win over Astra Giurgiu in the Europa League; he played all 90 minutes of the match, providing two assists, while also being involved in a third goal. On 20 October, Totti made his 100th appearance in UEFA club competitions, setting up two goals in a 3–3 home draw against Austria Wien in the Europa League. In late October, he sustained a muscle injury to the flexor of his left thigh during a training session, which ruled him out indefinitely. He returned to action as a substitute in a 3–2 home win over Pescara on 27 November.|$|E
