Paleolimnologists now recognise that climate change, geology, and other external influences are critical in regulating the natural productivity of lakes.

The main difference between natural and anthropogenic eutrophication is that the natural process is very slow, occurring on geological time scales.|$|E

Objectives: To identify the agreement level of the nutritional diagnosis when patients are evaluated using Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS- 2002) protocol and the one used at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (AN-HCPA). Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients with malnutrition and <b>eutrophy</b> diagnoses. The evaluations were performed at distinct moments, by different researchers. Results: The study involved 247 patients of 50. 7 ± 15. 5 years and BMI of 21. 31 ± 2. 1 kg/m 2. NRS- 2002 classified 43 % of patients with <b>eutrophy</b> and 57 % with malnutrition. AN-HCPA identified 50 % of patients with <b>eutrophy</b> and 50 % with malnutrition. Both systems agreed in 93 cases (38 %) for <b>eutrophy</b> diagnosis and in 110 cases (45 %) for malnutrition diagnosis, with Kappa coefficient of 0. 64 (95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 74) p < 0. 001. AN-HCPA presented a sensitivity of 78. 6 % and a specificity of 86. 9 %, positive predictive value of 88. 7 % and negative predictive value of 75. 6 %. Conclusion: The results showed that AN-HCPA has a good level of agreement with the reference method and is a fast and easy-to-use tool that can be recommended as a sensitive instrument to identify the nutritional status of hospitalized patients...|$|E

40|$|Lakes Findley, Chester Morse and Sammamish, Washington, are {{characterized}} by one major outburst of phytoplankton productivity and biomass (mainly diatoms) with usually no or low fall activity. Vernal outbursts were often delayed in some lakes and years probably by unfavorable climate (snow cover and cloudy rainy conditions). Mean spring-summer productivity ranged from 270 mgC/m² day in the most oligotrophic lake, Findley, to nearly 1000 mgC/m² day in mesotrophic-eutrophic Lake Sammamish. The range in mean Chlorophyll a content was 0. 8 to 10 ug/l for the same lakes respectively. Mean biomass within and between the lakes was related to winter phosphorus content but not to nitrogen. However, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were simultaneously limiting productivity increase in the three lakes in summer. Carbon assimilation in response to added P showed increasing half-saturation constants for the natural phytoplankton progressing from oligotrophy to <b>eutrophy.</b> While diversion of over 1 / 2 the phosphorus from nearby Lake Washington during 1963 - 1967 was followed by reduction in winter mean P content and a rapid shift from <b>eutrophy</b> to mesotrophy (Edmondson 1970), mean winter P content and measured characteristics of plankton response have not changed significantly in Lake Sammamish following a diversion of similar magnitude.
