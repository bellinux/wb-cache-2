40|$|Fig. 5 – Example of geocentric {{distributions}} (α, δ) for {{the predicted}} {{positions on the}} 3 th day after discovery with only Gaia observations (left 1 σ uncertainty) and on the 4 th day with an additional <b>geocentric</b> <b>observation</b> (right 10 σ uncertainty). The triangle represents the expected value. We can wonder now how many alerts are expected. To answer this question, we considered a sample of 20, 000 of NEOs which could be either known or unknown objects. Figure 6 shows the statistic of the possible observed objects. This number appears to be around 12 %. But if we compare this number to the one of known asteroid that will be observed by Gaia (~ 29 %) we can just conclude that we have more chance to observe known objects than discovering new objects. Fig. 6 – Statistic of objects that would be observed by Gaia among a 20, 000 synthetic population. Conclusion Even if Gaia {{will not be a}} big NEAs discoverer, it will provide unprecedented accuracy for NEAs orbit’s improvement. Besides, this study can be continued considering the astrometric reduction due to the stellar catalogue provided by Gaia. As a matter of fact, this catalogue will be more precise and dense and almost free of zonal errors. Thus, classical ground-based astrometry (and concerning hence more objects down to fainter magnitude) will be improved...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of an orbit by using two heciocentrlc positions of a celestial {{body is a}} boundary-value problem of mathematical physics, and may be reduced to the solution of a nonlinear integral equation. Methods of successive approx-imation to the solution are discussed, and convergence conditions and error estimates are derived. The problems of perturbed motion and the {{determination of}} orbits based on three <b>geocentric</b> <b>observations</b> are also considered. — i...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Charlier's theory (1910) {{provides}} a geometric {{interpretation of the}} occurrence of multiple solutions in Laplace's method of preliminary orbit determination, assuming <b>geocentric</b> <b>observations.</b> We introduce a generalization of this theory allowing {{to take into account}} topocentric observations, that is observations made {{from the surface of the}} rotating Earth. The generalized theory works for both Laplace's and Gauss' methods. We also provide a geometric definition of a curve that generalizes Charlier's limiting curve, separating regions with a different number of solutions. The results are generically different from Charlier's: they may change according to the value of a parameter that depends on the observations...|$|R
40|$|A {{simultaneous}} {{observation of}} an auroral spiral and its generator {{region in the}} near-Earth plasma sheet is rather unlikely. Here we present such observations using the THEMIS spacecraft {{as well as the}} THEMIS ground network of all-sky imagers and magnetometers. Two consecutive auroral spirals separated by approximately 14 min occurred during a substorm on 19 February 2008. The spirals formed during the expansion phase and a subsequent intensification, and were among the brightest features in the aurora with diameters of 200 – 300 km. The duration for the formation and decay of each spiral was less than 60 s. Both spirals occurred shortly after the formation of two oppositely rotating plasma flow vortices in space, which were also accompanied by dipolarizations and ion injections, at ~ 11 RE <b>geocentric</b> distance. <b>Observations</b> and model calculations also give evidence for a magnetic-field-aligned current generation of approximately 0. 1 MA via the flow vortices, connecting the generator region of the spirals with the ionosphere, during the formation of both spirals. In the ionosphere, a pair of equivalent ionospheric current (EIC) vortices with opposite rotations (corresponding to upward and downward currents) was present during both auroral spirals with enhanced EICs and ionospheric flows at the locations of the auroral spirals and along the auroral arcs. The combined ground and space observations suggest that each auroral spiral was powered by two oppositely rotating plasma flow vortices that caused a current enhancement in the substorm current wedge...|$|R
