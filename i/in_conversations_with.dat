5|$|A German photographer, Astrid Kirchherr, {{asked if}} they wouldn't mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups only had snapshots taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in der Dom, a municipal park, close to the Reeperbahn. In the afternoon Kirchherr took them to her mother's house in Altona, minus Best, who decided not to attend. Dot Rhone, McCartney's girlfriend at the time who later visited Hamburg, described Best as being very quiet and never taking part <b>in</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> the group.|$|E
5|$|In various {{sections}} of the game, the player can ride a Triumph motorcycle, or a snowmobile. Other segments of the game involve boss fights. If the player chooses to be sneaky, they can overhear humorous conversations between non-player characters, such as guards, scientists and civilians. Occasionally, the player can engage <b>in</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> such characters. In certain cutscenes, the game uses a dialog tree, in which the player can choose between different questions and responses when talking to another character.|$|E
5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate <b>in</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> their older siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> Eidelman, Meyer {{mentioned}} {{that since the}} marches that accompanied the main titles for the previous Star Trek films were so good, he {{had no desire to}} compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision. Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of Bernard Herrmann; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.|$|E

25|$|These {{scholars}} set out {{to demonstrate}} that Christians could hold their own <b>in</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> learned Greek-speaking intellectuals. They argued that Christian faith, while it was against many of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle (and other Greek Philosophers), it was an almost scientific and distinctive movement with the healing of the soul of man and his union with God at its center. They made major contributions {{to the definition of}} the Trinity finalized at the First Council of Constantinople in 381 and {{the final version of the}} Nicene Creed.|$|E

25|$|The trip {{had to be}} {{arranged}} in secret under very tight security as the right-wing Cuban community in the U.S. had threatened those that would participate in cultural exchanges with the Castro government at that time. The U.S. State Department had also warned that those who traveled to Cuba did so at their own risk as there were no formal relations between the U.S. and Cuba. After arrival in Havana, Cuban authorities maintained tight surveillance {{and control of the}} Americans.

25|$|There are 60 towns {{from the}} area of Cottbus {{belonging}} to this region, {{where most of the}} older people over 60 but few young people and children can speak the Lower Sorbian language; the local variant often incorporates many words taken from the German language, and <b>in</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> the younger generation, German is generally preferred. Some primary schools in the region teach bilingually, and in Cottbus there is an important Gymnasium whose main medium of instruction is Lower Sorbian. The region is predominantly Protestant, again highly devastated by the brown coal mining industry. The biggest tourist attraction of the region and in the whole Lusatia are the marshlands, with many Spreewald/Błóta canals, picturesque broads of the Spree.|$|E
25|$|The regime {{permitted}} non-deported Romanian Jews and American charities to send {{humanitarian aid}} into Transnistrian camps, a measure {{it took an}} interest in enforcing in late 1942. Deportations of Jews ceased altogether in October of the same year. A common explanation historians propose for this reassessment of policies is the change in Germany's fortunes on the Eastern Front, with mention that Antonescu was considering using the Jewish population as an asset in his dealings with the Western Allies. It nevertheless took the regime more than a year to allow more selective Jewish returns from Transnistria, including some 2,000 orphans. After Transnistria's 1944 evacuation, Antonescu himself advocated the creation of new camps in Bessarabia. <b>In</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> his cabinet, the Conducător angrily maintained that surviving Jews were better off than Romanian soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Vinul de viață lungă is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Cocea's main work as a novelist. The main character, Manole Arcaș, is, like Cocea himself, a Moldavian boyar. Successive episodes in the book reveal his complex worldview: Arcaș is an atheist with modernist sensibilities, a lover of nature, and a utopian socialist who has been turning his estate into a commune. Having reached a venerable age, he slowly reveals the secret of his longevity <b>in</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> the much younger judge: after decades of experimentation, the Arcaș estate produces a special sort of Moldavian wine; the grapes were pressed by Manole and a Romani (Gypsy) girl, {{in the course of their}} love-making. The object of Arcaș' olfactory fetish, the girl has died a tragic death, inspiring Manole to take up the winery project as a sort of symbolic rebirth.|$|E
25|$|When Junot entered Lisbon on 30 November 1807, the Portuguese royal family, {{aristocracy}} {{and high}} clergy had already set sail for Brazil the previous day. The French Army was initially well received by Lisboners, General Junot taking {{up residence in}} the Queluz National Palace (Palácio Nacional de Queluz). and redecorating it. The bourgeoisie of Lisbon discussed the new liberal ideas <b>in</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> French officers in the cafes of the city, particularly the Nicola in Rossio square, where the French established their headquarters. The people expected {{a continuation of the}} political reforms enacted by the Marquis of Pombal, but Junot did not want to risk stimulating radical ideas and did nothing along those lines. Napoleon proposed that Lisbon should be incorporated directly into the French Empire, while the old Portucale of northern Portugal would be resurrected as the 'Kingdom of Northern Lusitania' in the province of Entre Douro e Minho. Meanwhile, 50,000 Spanish and French troops roamed the countryside arresting, killing, plundering and raping the citizenry.|$|E
25|$|Carp did {{not hold}} an {{official}} post, {{but he was the}} éminence grise, arranging the removal of most bureaucrats who had been left behind by the Brătianu cabinet, or drafting plans for a future Carp cabinet <b>in</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> German military ruler August von Mackensen. The proposed government was to include Kostaki, Barnoschi, Radu Rosetti and Dimitrie S. Nenițescu, alongside zoologist Grigore Antipa and Colonel Victor Verzea. The Carpists were still committed to the cause of Bessarabia, and Kostaki assured his backers that, with German help, the province would eventually be made part of Romania. Early in 1917, Carp's son in law, Colonel Alexandru D. Sturdza, deserted from the Moldavian front and made his way to Bucharest. He claimed that Russia had effectively occupied Moldavia, and wanted to organize a rival Romanian Army to liberate Iași. Some sources state that Carp immediately repudiated him upon arrival, but one account places Sturdza among Carp's visitors and confidants, as late as December 1917.|$|E

25|$|Doctors and {{scientists}} {{who worked with}} Genie were uncertain about {{most of her life}} from birth to 20 months. By the age of 11 months she was falling behind in her physical development, which researchers believed was due to both malnutrition and some degree of neglect, although the few medical records from the first year of her life noted no physical or mental abnormalities. <b>In</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> members of the research team that studied Genie, her mother said that as a baby Genie was not very cuddly and did not babble very much. At times she claimed that at an undetermined point Genie said some unspecified individual words, but on other occasions said that Genie never produced speech of any kind, preventing linguists from making any definitive determinations. When Genie was 20 months old, after a pickup truck struck and killed her paternal grandmother, Genie's father decided to increase the family's isolation as much as possible, and because he believed Genie was severely retarded he believed she required a higher degree of isolation {{than the rest of the}} family.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 November, {{two days after the}} coup, Đôn and Kim visited Lodge at the US Embassy in Saigon, explaining that Minh was busy <b>in</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> Thơ on the new government. The conversation was lengthy and covered many topics. It began with mutual expressions of satisfaction at the success of the coup, and continued with Lodge's assurance of forthcoming American recognition for their new government. The generals explained that they had decided on a two tier government structure with a military committee overseen by Minh presiding over a regular cabinet that would be predominantly civilian with Tho as Prime Minister. Lodge promised to attend to the immediate restoration of some aid programs and the speedy resumption of the others when the government was in place. They then discussed a series of immediate problems including the return of the Nhu children to Madame Nhu, the disposition {{of the rest of the}} Ngô family, press censorship, and the release of Thích Trí Quang from the Embassy.|$|E

500|$|By this time, Booth {{was arguing}} so vehemently with his older, pro-Union brother Edwin about Lincoln {{and the war}} that Edwin finally {{told him that he}} was no longer welcome at his New York home.
