5000|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} {{refers to}} any system that uses mechanical means, {{such as a}} fan, to introduce subaerial air to a space.

50|$|In warm climates {{the window}} is used for <b>exhausting</b> <b>ventilation</b> air. Cooler air enters the cavity at the bottom, from the {{interior}} space, is heated during transfer upwards through the cavity and is exhausted {{at the top of}} the cavity to the exterior.

Cold air enters the bottom of the cavity, from the outside, is heated during transfer upwards though the cavity, and enters the interior space {{at the top of the}} cavity. More complex designs exist, which for example do not transfer ventilated air between the interior and exterior, or which have multiple ventilation channels.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study that {{researched}} the possibility of building passive designs to prevent mould growth in housing in humid and mild winter climatic zones without permanent thermal active controls. This study also investigated indoor relative humidity related to insulation, window cross <b>ventilation,</b> <b>exhaust</b> fan <b>ventilation</b> and temporary heating. The study found that for controlling mould growth on indoor surfaces there are two options available for different climatic conditions and housing designs: a conventional method for buildings designed for permanent thermal active controls and a newer method using passive building design and passive controls to keep the indoor relative humidity under 80 %. Implications from the study include the passive prevention of winter mould growth in houses without permanent active thermal controls, insulation levels and thermal resistance, appropriate insulation levels to prevent mould growth, winter daytime cross <b>ventilation,</b> temporary <b>exhaust</b> fan <b>ventilation</b> and temporary heating and their impacts on decreasing mean indoor relative humidity levels and the relative humidity of air near ceilings. Educating occupants on how to ‘drive’ their passive designed house is also critical to prevent mould growth problems...|$|R

40|$|Buildings today {{account for}} 40 % of the world’s primary energy use and 24 % of the {{greenhouse}} gas emissions. Reducing the energy use in buildings is an important measures to reduce energy dependency and greenhouse gas emissions. In Sweden, there are roughly 2 500 000 dwellings in multifamily houses and single family houses. There {{is a need to}} address the energy use within the existing dwellings; especially within multifamily buildings constructed 1960 - 1975, which accounts for almost one million dwellings or roughly 40 % of the dwelling stock in Sweden. There are good examples of energy renovations of buildings, reducing the energy use by more than 50 %. To reach the energy savings; balanced ventilation with heat recovery was a necessary measure in all projects. However, in all projects; loss of ceiling height in parts of the apartments is a consequence of the measure. Furthermore, it required the residents to temporary move during installment in the majority of the projects. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the potential of using a heat exchanger, suitable for natural <b>ventilation,</b> <b>exhaust</b> air <b>ventilation</b> and hybrid ventilation, for installment in the existing building stock in Sweden. A qualitative and quantitative comparison is carried out; comparing mechanical <b>exhaust</b> air <b>ventilation,</b> balanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery and the heat exchanger suitable for natural <b>ventilation,</b> <b>exhaust</b> air <b>ventilation</b> and hybrid ventilation. The qualitative analysis compares the advantages and disadvantages of the different ventilation system. The quantitative part investigates the potential energy savings and a potential quantity of dwellings where heat recovery may be installed. By installing heat recovery, energy used for space heating may be reduced by roughly 25 %. Combining installment of heat recovery with improvement of the building envelope may reduce the energy demand for heating by roughly 75 %. Heat recovery should be able to install in roughly 80 % of the dwellings in the existing dwelling stock, built before 1980...|$|R

40|$|A two-dimensional, {{steady-state}} finite-element {{model was}} developed to simulate the thermal effects of the application of an attic radiant barrier system (ARBS) inside a ventilated residential attic. The attic is ventilated using the exhaust air from an evaporative cooler. The study uses a k-ε turbulent model to describe the velocity and temperature distributions in the attic. The ambient temperature and solar isolation densities on the outside inclined attic surfaces are used as driving functions for the model. The model also included the appropriate heat exchange modes of convection and radiation on these outside surfaces. Several recirculation zones were visually observed in the attic flow pattern. Also, {{the use of the}} ARBS seems to lower the heat transfer through the ceiling by 25 – 30 %, but this effect decreases significantly as the outside ventilation rates are increased through the attic space. The 2 D model revealed some interesting temperature distributions along the attic surfaces that could not have been predicted by the one-dimensional models. The lower emissivity ARBS seems to raise the temperature of the inclined attic surfaces as well as the temperature of the <b>exhausted</b> <b>ventilation</b> air...|$|R
50|$|Ventilation {{systems can}} be local or general. Local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{operates}} {{at or near the}} source of contamination, often in conjunction with an enclosure. Examples of local exhaust systems include fume hoods, gloveboxes, biosafety cabinets, and vented balance enclosures. Exhaust hoods lacking an enclosure are less preferable, and laminar flow hoods are not recommended because they direct air outwards towards the worker. General <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> operates on an entire room through a building's HVAC system. It is inefficient and costly as compared to local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation,</b> and should not be relied upon for controlling exposure, although it can provide negative room pressure to prevent contaminants from exiting the room. Several control verification techniques can be used with ventilation systems, including pitot tubes, hot-wire anemometers, smoke generators, tracer-gas leak testing, and standardized testing and certification procedures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} {{modeling}} and simulation of release of radiation form two loops PWR {{has been carried out}} for flow blockage accident. For this purpose, a MATLAB based program “Source Term Evaluator for Flow Blockage Accident ” (STEFBA) has been developed, which uses the core inventory as its primary input. The TMI- 2 reactor is considered as the reference plant for this study. For 1100 reactor operation days, the core inventory has been evaluated under the core design constrains at average reactor power. With the instantaneous release of radiation to the containment atmosphere, some reliable results have been achieved for determined states of containment, i. e., Normal, Emergency and Isolation state in this accident situation. Resulting noble gasses, iodine and aerosol source term variation has been evaluated against the containment performance. The dependency of the source term on containment performance parameters has been studied. Typical trend of release of radioactivity has been found corresponding to increase in <b>ventilation</b> <b>exhaust</b> rate values. The dependency of radioisotopes on <b>ventilation</b> <b>exhaust</b> rate has been studied in accident situation.

40|$|Ventilation air may be {{provided}} in buildings {{by means of}} natural or mechanical strategies. When a HVAC system is installed, thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) may be controlled with higher precision. However, especially between the 70 s and the 90 s, mechanical ventilation systems have been installed on formerly naturally ventilated buildings without providing any control for natural ventilation. The two ventilation systems are therefore overlapping, without any energy or comfort oriented control strategy, and the occupants are operating windows without any consistent understanding of IAQ and comfort conditions, neither of energy consumption. It may both lead to a substantial energy waste and to low indoor climate conditions.
