40|$|Aim To {{identify}} {{factors that}} affect attendance at NHS clinical <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> sessions by healthcare professionals. Method A quantitative approach was used, using a questionnaire sent to 400 randomly-selected participants. A total of 122 responses were received, providing a mix of qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data was analysed using statistical methods. Open-ended responses were reviewed using thematic analysis. Findings Clinical staff hold <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> sessions in high regard and are aware of their value and the requirement to keep up-to-date with current practice and ensure patient safety remains a priority. However, changes to the delivery format of <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> sessions are required to enable staff to participate more easily, as staff are often unable to attend <b>mandatory</b> <b>training.</b> Conclusion The delivery of <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> should move away from classroom based sessions into the clinical area, to maximise participation in <b>mandatory</b> <b>training.</b> Delivery should be facilitated by local ‘experts’, {{who are able to}} customise course content to meet specific local requirements and the requirements of different staff groups. Improved arrangements for staff cover will also enable more staff to attend educational sessions...|$|R

METHODS A systematic evaluation of the level of satisfaction of oncologists with the Swiss CST before (2000 - 2005) and after (2006 - 2012) it became mandatory. RESULTS Levels of satisfaction with the CST were high, and satisfaction of physicians participating on a voluntary or mandatory basis did not significantly differ {{for the majority of the}} items. CONCLUSIONS The evaluation of physicians' satisfaction over the years and after introduction of <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> supports recommendations for generalized implementation of CST and <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> for medical oncologists...|$|R
40|$|Aim – To {{identify}} {{the factors that}} impact upon attendance at clinical <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> sessions. Method – A quantitative approach was used, utilising a questionnaire sent to 400 randomly selected participants. A total of 122 responses were received, providing a mix of data that was statistically analysed, and open ended responses that were reviewed utilising a mini thematic analysis. Findings – The study demonstrated that clinical staff hold <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> in high regard, and are {{fully aware of the}} value and need for such training. However, it was clear that a review of the current delivery format is required. Conclusion – To ensure that patient safety is a priority, and that staff remain aware of current practice, the delivery of <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> needs to move away from classroom based sessions, and into the clinical area. Delivery should be facilitated by local “experts” in order that content can be tailored to the local area, rather than generic delivery. A review of staffing establishments would also facilitate the release of staff to attend educational sessions. From an educational perspective, we need to be aware that healthcare staff cannot easily obtain leave to attend classroom based education, and consideration must be given to alternative attendance methods...|$|R

40|$|Background Doctors in {{training}} rotate round different organisations, sometimes {{for short periods}} of times. Face to face induction and requirements for statutory and <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> can be very time-consuming, Streamlining these processes has potential {{to increase the amount}} of times junior doctors can spend on direct patient care, particularly important at the key times when new cohorts of doctors start work. Summary of work In 2012, the hospital in Bath developed an on line e-induction package that also met all the requirements for statutory and <b>mandatory</b> <b>training,</b> which was completed by junior doctors prior to starting work in the hospital. The package was based on interactive patient scenarios, with in built assessment. In 2015, the e-induction package was implemented in 17 hospitals., Summary of results Early evaluation demonstrated that 87...|$|R

40|$|Since January 1, 2007, Government {{legislation}} in Western Australia required all workers in construction to complete <b>mandatory</b> safety awareness <b>training</b> before they {{began work on}} site. During the implementation of this new legislation there was considerable resistance from the construction sector due to the mandatory nature of the training. The construction industry viewed this as an unnecessary impost as they considered that there was already sufficient safety training delivered through individual company and site inductions. In 2010, we evaluated the new Construction Induction Training (CIT) in the commercial construction sector in Western Australia to find that since 2007 {{there has been an}} unanticipated change in support for the <b>mandatory</b> <b>training.</b> The 2010 study shows a shift in the values of the safety culture for the commercial sector of the construction industry. In 2010, the industry not only supports the mandatory CIT, but is very vocal in its request to re-institute the refresher courses that were withdrawn in 2009. Indeed, 79 % of respondents claimed there were measurable benefits to their business having their employees complete the CIT, while 96 % claimed the CIT assisted in reducing accidents/incidents on their worksites. This 2010 study indicates that in this case, <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> has had a positive effect on safety culture change and gradually reduced work-related injury in the industry since 2007 to the present. The paper uses data from two studies conducted in 2006 and 2010 to highlight the unanticipated change in perception of the value of <b>mandatory</b> safety <b>training</b> in the WA construction industry to one which is positive and supportive...|$|R
