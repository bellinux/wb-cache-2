40|$|Although {{franchising}} {{has become}} an important growth strategy in severalindustries {{over the last few}} decades, there are few empirical studies about the effects of franchisor communication strategy on customer responses in the context of <b>franchise</b> <b>brand</b> crisis. Two quasi-experimental studies were conducted to test the effect ofa franchisor ownership separation statement on brand trust and brand avoidance following a brand crisis situation. Results show that a franchisor’s explicit communication of the <b>franchise</b> <b>brand’s</b> individual ownership business structure is useful in preventing further negative spillover effect throughout the franchised chain when thebrand crisis occurs at a single franchise location. The authors also investigate the mechanism through which such communication influences customer behavior and the moderating effect of the brand crisis severity in affecting brand evaluation. These results offer guidance to <b>franchise</b> <b>brand</b> managers by providing insight into how to overcome a <b>franchise</b> <b>brand</b> crisis and by suggesting franchise context-specific managerial recommendation...|$|R

However, franchisee behaviour is sometimes difficult to manage, impacting negatively on the <b>franchise</b> <b>brand.</b> In adopting an internal brand management theoretical lens, this study provides new insight into the development of franchisees as brand champions.

The findings provide significant theoretical and practical implications and lay the foundation for future research in this important research domain. No Full Tex...|$|R

Ideally, to be informed about where to put one's money, a franchise buyer should look at the profit of a brand's average store and compare the rate of return on the investment with all other brands' returns on investments. The purpose of this project is mining the relationship between the attributes in the dataset and offers a reference to the SBA about which kind of <b>brand</b> <b>franchise</b> worth a loan. And the failure percent of a brand can be accurately predicted with the program. Thus, the risk of loaning would be reduced and the percentage of success case could be guaranteed in a certain extent...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} franchisor support, brand commitment, brand citizenship behavior, and franchisee experience on franchisee-perceived brand image (FPBI). Methodology: The hypotheses were tested using survey data from retail franchisees in Australia, structural equation modeling, and bootstrapping regression methods. Findings: The results show that both brand commitment and brand citizenship behavior mediate the effect of franchisor support on FPBI. However, the effect of franchisor support on FPBI via brand commitment is higher for franchisees with less experience compared to their more experienced counterparts. Practical implications The study provides insights to franchise managers and B 2 B practitioners on factors that enhance FPBI. Originality/value: Despite the recognized importance of <b>franchise</b> <b>brands,</b> limited research examines how leveraging the <b>franchise</b> <b>brand</b> can improve franchisee performance.
