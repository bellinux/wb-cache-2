25|$|The mate {{is usually}} {{seen in a}} corner of the board, since fewer pieces are needed to {{surround}} the king there. The most common form of smothered mate is seen in the adjacent diagram. The knight on f7 delivers mate to the king on h8 which is prevented from escaping the check by the rook on g8 and the pawns on g7 and h7. Similarly, White can be mated with the white king on h1 and the knight on f2. Analogous mates on a1 and a8 are rarer, because kingside castling is the more common as it safely places the <b>king</b> <b>closer</b> to the corner than it would had the castling occurred on the queenside.|$|E

60|$|Two taut lassoes {{stretched}} from the pommel of his saddle {{down a little}} into a depression full of brush and cactus and rocks. Then Lucy saw a red horse. He was down in a bad position. She heard his low, choking heaves. Probably he had broken legs or back. She {{could not bear to}} see a horse in pain. She would do what was possible, even to the extent of putting him out of his misery, if nothing else could be done. Yet she scanned the surroundings closely, and peered into the bushes and behind the rocks before she tried to urge Sage <b>King</b> <b>closer.</b> He refused to go nearer, and Lucy dismounted.|$|E

She watched Joel while he watched her. And she saw that he had his foot on the rope round Sage King's neck. The King never liked a rope. He was nervous. He tossed his head to get rid of it. Creech, watching Lucy all the while, reached for the rope, pulled the <b>King</b> <b>closer</b> and closer, and untied the knot. The King stood then, bridle down and quiet. Instead of a saddle he wore a blanket strapped round him.|$|E
