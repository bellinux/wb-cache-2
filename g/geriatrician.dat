2500|$|Emanuel {{said that}} legalizing euthanasia, {{as was done}} in the Netherlands, might be counterproductive, in that it would {{decrease}} support for pain management and mental health care. However, Emanuel does support the use of Medical Directives to allow patients to express their wishes when they can no longer communicate. Ezekiel, and his former wife Linda Emanuel, an M.D. Ph.D. bioethicist and <b>geriatrician,</b> created the Medical Directive, which is described as more specific and extensive than previous living wills and is a third generation Advance Directive. He claims the Hippocratic Oath debunks the theory that opposition to euthanasia is modern. Emanuel said that {{for the vast majority of}} dying patients, [...] "legalizing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide would be of no benefit. To the contrary, it would be a way of avoiding the complex and arduous efforts required of doctors and other health-care providers to ensure that dying patients receive humane, dignified care." [...] Emanuel said that a historical review of opinions on euthanasia from ancient Greece to now [...] "suggests an association between interest in legalizing euthanasia and moments when Social Darwinism and raw individualism, free markets and wealth accumulation, and limited government are celebrated." ...|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, most <b>geriatricians</b> are {{hospital}} physicians, whereas some {{focus on}} community geriatrics. While originally a distinct clinical specialty, {{it has been}} integrated as a specialisation of general medicine since the late 1970s. Most <b>geriatricians</b> are, therefore, accredited for both. In contrast to the United States, geriatric medicine is a major specialty in the United Kingdom; <b>geriatricians</b> are the single most numerous internal medicine specialists.|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is highly {{prevalent}} in the elderly and negatively impacts sur-vival and health status. Thus, nephrological competence is mandatory for a skilled geriatri-cian. The present study aimed to assess nephrological competence {{in a sample of}} <b>geriatricians</b> recruited through a web survey. To this aim, a 12 -items questionnaire was pro-duced by an expert panel of nephrologists and <b>geriatricians</b> and was available online for members of the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics (SIGG). Two-hundred-eighty-seven <b>geriatricians</b> volunteered to fill in the questionnaire. The majority of them indirectly estimated the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using mainly the Cockroft-Gault (C-G) for-mula. Selected nephrological exams, such as urinary Na and serum D-vitamin measure-ments, did not qualify as routine exams although the majority of <b>geriatricians</b> supplemented their patients with fat-soluble secosteroids. Ten percent of <b>geriatricians</b> asked for nephrolo-gical consultation only for stage 5 CKD patients and 30, 9 % only for stage 4 or 5.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{represents}} the first qualitative {{investigation of the}} referral process between <b>geriatricians</b> and neuropsychologists. While quantitative {{studies have indicated that}} physicians are generally satisfied with neuropsychological evaluation, the overall referral process remains a mystery.

The present study seeks to investigate the referral process between <b>geriatricians</b> and neuropsychologists, using consensual qualitative research (CQR) methods, in an effort to inform best practices and ultimately, produce the most efficacious patient care possible...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAs {{individuals}} live longer, {{they may}} have many medical, physical, psychological, and related issues that can impact on their sexual functioning. The sexuality of older patients is a topic that is generally not foremost {{in the minds of}} <b>geriatricians.</b> MethodsThis study was designed to determine the current practice of <b>geriatricians</b> regarding taking sexual histories from older patients and the further management of patients with sexual symptoms or deficits. <b>Geriatricians</b> (consultants, specialist registrars, staff grades, and associate specialists) were invited to complete a questionnaire on the taking of a sexual history and the further management of older patients with sexual problems. ResultsGeriatricians take a sexual history infrequently: 57. 5 % of them take a sexual history only occasionally. Although 96. 7 % are of the opinion that elderly patients with sexual problems should be managed further, opinion was divided, with uncertainty, especially among trainees (registrars), as to who should manage such patients. ConclusionsThese findings indicate that <b>geriatricians</b> generally fail to take a sexual history. However, <b>geriatricians</b> do generally agree that elderly people with sexual problems should receive appropriate referral and treatment. Aged sexuality is an area that requires more attention during the training of registrars and as part of continuing professional development...|$|R

40|$|We {{undertook}} a two-round Delphi {{study of the}} views of consultant <b>geriatricians</b> in three Health Regions on the relative appropriateness of 12 possible performance measures for geriatric services. We compared geriatricians' responses with those of 44 cognitively-intact day hospital patients. Of 138 <b>geriatricians,</b> 89 responded to the first round postal survey, 84 to the second round. The rank order of geriatricians' suggestions did not change from round one to round two, and there was convergence of opinion with {{a significant decrease in}} the coefficients of variation of the ranks (p < 0. 05, Wilcoxon Test). <b>Geriatricians</b> and patients gave high priority to 'reducing disability' and 'improving quality of life', and low priority to 'reducing mortality'. <b>Geriatricians</b> gave higher priority than patients to 'consumer satisfaction', 'problem resolution' and 'efficient use of resources'. Patients gave higher priority to 'reducing burden on carers', 'measures of service activity' and 'avoiding institutional care'. The study shows {{that it is possible to}} obtain a consensus amongst <b>geriatricians</b> about the priorities for measuring the performance of geriatric medical services. Similarities to and differences from patients' views illustrate the need to engage more than one group in the debate about appropriate measures of performance. Findings in both groups give support to recent attempts to develop and use assessment methods for the measurement of disability and quality of life in clinical practice...|$|R
