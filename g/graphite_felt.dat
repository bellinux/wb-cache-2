Nitrogen-doped <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> was synthesized by the controlled deposition of {{a thin layer of}} polydopamine on the surface of <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> followed by pyrolysis in an Ar atmosphere. Taking advantage of the versatile capabilities of the coating, as well as its high nitrogen content, dopamine was demonstrated to be an effective precursor for the preparation of nitrogen-doped graphite. The dopamine-derived <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance when employed as a positive electrode in a VRFB. It exhibited 236 % and 44 % increased discharge capacity at a current density of 150 mA cm− 2 compared to pristine <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> and thermally oxidized <b>graphite</b> <b>felt,</b> respectively. The enhanced performance of the VRFB could be caused by the improved catalytic activity of dopamine-derived <b>graphite</b> <b>felt,</b> resulting from the formation of nitrogen functional groups active in the VO 2 +/VO 2 + redox reaction and the increased specific surface area. © 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} and cost-effective method to prepare cathodes for microbial fuel cells (MFCs) was developed. Fe(CO) (5) was decomposed and Fe was deposited on <b>graphite</b> <b>felts</b> for cathodic preparation. The unmodified, Pt modified and Fe modified <b>graphite</b> <b>felts</b> were utilized as cathodes in MFCs and power generation was compared. The maximum power density of MFCs with unmodified, Pt modified and Fe modified cathodes were respectively 288, 866 and 925 mW/m(3). The internal resistance of MFCs with unmodified, Pt modified and Fe modified cathodes were respectively 505, 384 and 278 Omega. The results of multiple analyses confirmed that Fe on cathode was Fe 2 O 3 and FeOOH and Fe(III) oxides as cathodic catalysts improved the electrochemical activity and promoted power generation.

Carbon fibre based materials like <b>graphite</b> <b>felts</b> (GFs) are commonly used in RFBs as electrodes due to their electrochemical activity, high permeability for liquids, high surface area and relatively low cost. Previous characterisation of GFs has involved flow systems, which can be complicated to replicate and expensive.

By combining the experimental voltammograms with digital simulations, key properties such as capacitance, electrode kinetics, average pore size and electrochemical surface area can be determined. This allows for the rapid and low cost examination of multiple GFs and pre-treatment methods, providing a useful tool for RFB development.

40|$|For the {{proposed}} solar sulfur-ammonia thermochemical water-splitting cycle, cobalt ferrite nanoparticles have potential {{use as an}} electrocatalyst, for the anodic reaction step of ammonium sulfite oxidizing to ammonium sulfate {{for the production of}} hydrogen. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles was investigated as a method of coating three-dimensional graphite electrodes to provide a high surface area and perhaps enhance the electrocatalytic activity. EPD was performed from 5 different bath compositions into several different substrates including aluminum, graphite paper, 3 mm carbon felt, and 6 mm <b>graphite</b> <b>felt.</b> The bath compositions were 2 g/L of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles in 100 % acetylacetone, 100 % acetylacetone with 0. 2 wt. % polyethylenimine (PEI), in 100 % ethanol, and in 90 / 10 vol. % water/isopropanol with 1 mM or 0. 05 mM of hexadecyltrimethlyammonium bromide (CTAB). The deposit morphologies were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM showed full penetration and coating of the felt in 100 % ethanol bath into both 3 mm carbon felt and 6 mm <b>graphite</b> <b>felt.</b> Linear sweep voltammetry in 2 M ammonium sulfite was used to test the electrocatalytic activity of the EPD deposits. The highest electrochemical activity for cobalt ferrite on 3 mm carbon felt was deposits from 100 % acetylacetone with 0. 2 wt. % polyethylenimine. The highest electrochemical activity for cobalt ferrite on 6 mm <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> was found in deposits from 90 / 10 vol. % water/isopropanol with 0. 05 mM CTAB, followed by deposits from 100 % acetylacetone with 0. 2 wt. % polyethylenimine...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} alcohols, aldehydes, and {{carboxylic}} acids were oxidized {{under mild conditions}} (60 - 80 °C, 3 M H 2 S 04 in water) by Fe(II 1) using a catalytic amount of Pt black to generate Fe(I 1) and protons. The extent of oxidation depended on the structures of the organic reductant and on reaction conditions. A redox fuel cell that catalyzed the complete oxidation of ethyl-ene glycol by dioxygen at 80 °C was assembled. Fe(I 1) generated by oxidation of ethylene glycol was reoxidized to Fe(II 1) at the anode of the cell. A V(V) IV(IV) /HNO 3 IO 2 redox system was used to catalyze the electrochemical reduction of dioxygen. Both the anode and cathode consisted of WDF <b>graphite</b> <b>felt,</b> the surface {{of which had been}} oxidized by boiling concentrated riitric acid for 15 min. A maximum power density of 9. 9 mWI cm 3 of <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> was obtained at a cell voltage of 197 mV. e 1 % Academic Press. ~ n c...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{flow sensor}} for trace {{analysis}} of lead, using cyclam-modified <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> as working electrode is reported here. The detection is performed in two steps: the preconcentration of Pb 2 + ions by complexation with immobilized cyclam and the analysis by linear sweep stripping voltammetry. Cyclam ligands are covalently immobilized onto the <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> by chemical reactions on amino acid linkers, previously {{attached to the}} electrode by an electrochemical process. A surface concentration of about 12 % is estimated by cyclic voltammetry analyses, using redox probes. The factors, affecting the performances of the flow sensor are reported, such as the flow rate and {{the volume of the}} analyzed solution used during the preconcentration step. A calibration curve typical of an equilibrium process is obtained for lead ions with a limit of detection able to reach 2. 5 × 10 − 8 mol L− 1, showing the ability of the cyclam-modified electrode to complex Pb 2 + ions. The flow sensor shows a good selectivity toward lead in the presence of Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + ions...|$|E
40|$|Aminiature-microbial {{fuel cell}} (mini-MFC, chamber volume: 1. 2 mL) {{was used to}} monitor biofilm {{development}} from a pure culture of Shewanella oneidensis DSP 10 on <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> (GF) under minimal nutrient conditions. ESEM evidence of biofilm formation on GF is supported by substantial power density (per device cross-section) from the mini-MFC when using an acellular minimal media anolyte (1500 mW/m 2). These experiments demonstrate that power density per volume for a biofilm flow reactor MFC should be calculated using the anode chamber volume alone (250 W/m 3), rather than with the full anolyte volume. Two oxygen reduction cathodes (uncoated GF or a Pt/vulcanized carbon coating on GF) were also compared to a cathode using uncoated GF and a 50 mM ferricyanide catholyte solution. The Pt/C-GF (2 – 4 % Pt by mass) electrodes with liquid cultures of DSP 10 produced one order of magnitude larger power density (150 W/m 3) than bare <b>graphite</b> <b>felt</b> (12 W/m 3) in this design. These advances {{are some of the}} required modifications to enable the mini-MFC to be used in real-time, long-term environmental power generating situations...|$|E

To determine the total protein content of anode to estimate the total microbial biomass, proteins were extracted from the anode pieces (0.5  cm 2) using B-PERII reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and were quantified using a BCA protein kit (Pierce) as described previously (Shimoyama et al. 2009).|$|E
