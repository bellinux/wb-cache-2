5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the <b>filter</b> <b>cake</b> includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant <b>filter</b> <b>cake</b> in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of {{fine coal}} <b>filter</b> <b>cakes</b> governs their formation rate and dewaterability, which are both {{critical to the}} efficient beneficiation of fine coal. However, the principles by which the microstructure influences the transport properties of <b>filter</b> <b>cakes</b> are not well understood, {{partly due to the}} difficulty in obtaining information about the three-dimensional morphology of their pore structure. The paper describes an example of application of the Boolean model that leads to a straightforward and realistic quantification of the three-dimensional microstructure of fine coal <b>filter</b> <b>cakes.</b> Such a model is extremely attractive, for (1) it relies on well-established random set theory, (2) its characterisation involves standard image analysis of polished sections, and (3) no empiricism is involved. Although the model was found to be ideally suited to the characterisation of fine coal <b>filter</b> <b>cakes,</b> the flexibility of its underlying theory makes it an excellent candidate for quantifying other porous media. Such a model not only permits easy access to the three-dimensional details of porous media, but also holds promise for assisting in predicting the transport properties of porous media because of its realism. Subsequent publications will discuss applications of the model to obtain three-dimensional computer simulations of <b>filter</b> <b>cakes,</b> and to predict single-phase permeability of <b>filter</b> <b>cakes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of an industrial sludge, arising from fertilizer and feed phosphate production, {{has been found}} to be similar to that of clayey soil. Prior to its use as a construction material for an embankment, the soft sludge has been improved by means of a filter press chamber to reduce the water content and, thereby, to obtain a stiffer material. Filter pressing has yielded relatively stiffer sludge <b>filter</b> <b>cakes</b> with a water content of less than 90 %. Extensive laboratory tests have been conducted in order to characterize the uncertain {{behavior of}} the original sludge and the <b>filter</b> <b>cakes.</b> Under drying and re-wetting cycles, the <b>filter</b> <b>cakes</b> loose their strength after 4 days of rewetting due to the structure damage. Variation of compression state as well as uncertain behavior of the sludge has necessitated greater attention to the deformation of the foundation.

25|$|Openhole {{completions}} (in {{comparison with}} cemented pipe) require {{better understanding of}} formation damage, wellbore clean-up and fluid loss control.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the damage {{mechanisms}} and improve the method to evaluate and optimize the performance of formation damage control of oil-based drill-in fluids, this paper took an ultra-deep fractured tight gas reservoir in piedmont configuration, located in the Cretaceous Bashijiqike Fm of the Tarim Basin, as an example. First, evaluation experiments were conducted on the filtrate invasion, the dynamic damage of oil-based drill-in fluids and the loading capacity of <b>filter</b> <b>cakes.</b> Meanwhile, the evaluating methods were optimized for the formation damage control effect of oil-based drill-in fluids in laboratory: pre-processing drill-in fluids before grading analysis; using the dynamic damage method to simulate the damage process for evaluating the percentage of regained permeability; and evaluating the loading capacity of <b>filter</b> <b>cakes.</b> The experimental results show that (1) oil phase trapping damage and solid phase invasion are the main formation damage types; (2) the damage degree of filtrate is the strongest on the matrix; and (3) the dynamic damage degree of oil-based drill-in fluids reaches medium strong to strong on fractures and <b>filter</b> <b>cakes</b> show a good sealing capacity for the fractures less than 100  μm. In conclusion, the filter cakes' loading capacity should be first guaranteed, and both percentage of regained permeability and liquid trapping damage degree should be both considered in the oil-based drill-in fluids prepared for those ultra-deep fractured tight sandstone gas reservoirs...|$|R

40|$|The total {{volume of}} the coal {{processing}} wastes (<b>filter</b> <b>cakes)</b> produced by Russia, China, and India {{is as high as}} dozens of millions of tons per year. The concentrations of CO and CO 2 in the emissions from the combustion of <b>filter</b> <b>cakes</b> have been measured directly for the first time. They are the biggest volume of coal processing wastes. There have been many discussions about using these wastes as primary or secondary components of coal-water slurries (CWS) and coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals (CWSP). Boilers have already been operationally tested in Russia for the combustion of CWSP based on <b>filter</b> <b>cakes.</b> In this work, the concentrations of hazardous emissions have been measured at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1000 °С. The produced CO and CO 2 concentrations are shown to be practically constant at high temperatures (over 900 °С) for all the coal processing wastes under study. Experiments have shown the feasibility to lowering the combustion temperatures of coal processing wastes down to 750 – 850 °С. This provides sustainable combustion and reduces the CO and CO 2 emissions 1. 2 – 1. 7 times. These relatively low temperatures ensure satisfactory environmental and energy performance of combustion. Using CWS and CWSP instead of conventional solid fuels significantly reduces NOx and SOx emissions but leaves CO and CO 2 emissions practically at the same level as coal powder combustion. Therefore, the environmentally friendly future (in terms of all the main atmospheric emissions: CO, CO 2, NOx, and SOx) of both CWS and CWSP technologies relies on low-temperature combustion.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Cake filtration {{is an integral part}} of the processes of a whole range of industries from sewage treatment to pharmaceutical manufacture and it has been practised for many centuries by apothecaries and dye extractors. In common with many other unit operations involving particles or powders it has not been the subject of the kind of intensive research with which chemical engineers are familiar in the process dynamics field. It can be seen in the review of the literature that much of the work which has been done has been of an empirical nature and only in recent years has a more analytical approach to the investigations been adopted. It was as a result of the literature review that this research work began. It seemed quite clear that in order more fully to understand the phenomena related, not only to <b>filter</b> <b>cakes,</b> but also to the transmission of force and flow of fluid through fixed beds of particles some technique was needed to permit a microscopic examination of the interiors of these beds without disturbing their activity during the relevant operation. This, therefore, is a report on the development of one such technique which, it is hoped, will assist in a better understanding of packed bed phenomena. A wide range of <b>filter</b> <b>cakes</b> and wet and dry compacted beds has been investigated in order to test the efficacy of the technique. In this respect the results are not exhaustive but are indicative· of a general trend in the structure of the·various beds, particularly <b>filter</b> <b>cakes.</b> There is room for much more work to be done and some areas where it is felt advances can be made are indicated in a later section...|$|R
