A four-five seat variant with a 134kW (180hhp) engine and retractable undercarriage was also planned, and feasibility studies of [...] a twin-engine version made, but neither reached the construction stage.|$|E

Access to the cabin is via two deep, glazed doors. The Kityonok has a conventional undercarriage with main wheels on backward leaning cantilever legs mounted on torsion bars in the lower fuselage. The mainwheels have hydraulic brakes and the tailwheel castors. [...] Alternatively it can be equipped with skis or floats.|$|E
2500|$|The first GV-103L, {{as it was}} {{originally}} called, was a two- or three-seat light touring aircraft first flown in 1969. Later {{referred to as the}} GV-103 and powered by an 86kW (115hp) Lycoming O-235 <b>flat-four</b> <b>engine,</b> it led to several production variants with two, three and four seats using engines of increasing power within the same airframe. It had a side-by-side seating layout and a fixed tricycle undercarriage with a longer nosewheel which gave the aircraft a pronounced tail-down attitude on the ground. [...] Its construction was primarily metal but included some glass fibre structures and plastic bonding, novel at the time.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the cooling}} {{problems}} and some issues concerning the undercarriage had been resolved, the same aircraft flew as the Pa.61B Arbalète but {{proved to be}} underpowered with the Hirth engine. As a result, a new machine, the Pa.61F Arbalète II, was built, powered by a [...] Lycoming O-360 air-cooled <b>flat-four</b> <b>engine</b> with side air intakes on the semi-monocoque, circular cross-section fuselage. The Arbalète II's cockpit was {{large enough to hold}} three. The mid-span fins were different, slightly straight tapered, mounted on the trailing edge and extending below it. [...] Below the rudders they carried airbrakes. The slight sweep on the centre wing section trailing edge has led to a description of the wing plan as [...] "crescent" [...] rather than delta. A [...] narrow continuation of {{the leading edge of the}} wing to the nose formed strakes on each side. There were control surfaces on the trailing edges both within and beyond the fins. The Arbalète II's main undercarriage legs were moved inboard, mounted on the wing but close to the fuselage.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the firing}} order on an {{ordinary}} <b>flat-four</b> boxer <b>engine</b> [...] on 'L'eft and 'R'ight banks are LLRR or RRLL with each ignition (and thus exhaust) being 180 degrees apart. By counting two characters (2 x 180 =360) {{to the right}} of each 'L' or 'R', the cylinders that fire with 360 degree crankshaft rotational angle offset are shown to be located on opposite banks. If the exhaust manifold is designed to merge two exhaust ports on a bank into one exit as was common in the designs in the past, the pulse spacing becomes irregular, which causes uneven filling of intake into cylinders and the characteristic 'burble' of exhaust note on older <b>flat-four</b> <b>engines.</b> Subaru developed an [...] "equal lengths, even pulse spacing" [...] exhaust system with exhaust pipes connecting {{the left and the right}} banks for WRC competition in the 1990s, and incorporated this design into production Legacys in 2003, Foresters in 2005 and Imprezas in 2007. As a result, most Subaru <b>flat-four</b> <b>engines</b> no longer have the [...] "flat-four burble". The Impreza WRX and WRX STI still have unequal length exhaust pipes to feed the turbo sitting in the corner of the engine bay, and still have the characteristic burble. This was changed for the 2015 WRX which feeds a centrally mounted turbo, but the STI retained unequal length headers. They are, however, a somewhat popular aftermarket modification.|$|R

5000|$|In automobiles, the four-cylinder boxer {{powerplant}} goes as {{far back}} as the start of the 20th century; and in the early 1970s <b>flat-four</b> <b>engines</b> were being manufactured by Subaru, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, VW and Porsche as 4 and 6 cylinders, and used in aircraft as the Porsche PFM 3200, motor, as well as Citroën.
