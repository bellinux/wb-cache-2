5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E
5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's fell to <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> a child's to its knees. The tunics {{of poor people}} and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E

5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E
5|$|Knopf {{decided to}} produce The Big Pond in New York and {{appointed}} Hepburn the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired {{and replaced with}} Hepburn, which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career. On opening night, she turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> spoke too quickly to be comprehensible. She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted {{the role of a}} schoolgirl in These Days. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights. Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play Holiday. In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. She planned to leave the theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th {{century and}} {{probably}} continuing {{into the early}} 17th century, the image was modified by adding the mandorla-shaped sunburst around the Virgin, the stars on her cloak, the moon under <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> the angel with folded cloth supporting her—as was determined by an infrared and ocular study of the tilma in 1979.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{arguments}} by many Pentecostal,Protestant {{and a few}} {{churches that}} say that that Mother Mary isn't depicted as the 'Queen of Heaven and the world' in the Bible.The Catholic Church and many others point out the verses from the Book of Revelations in Chapter 12 which states clearly Mother Mary as a Queen, with a crown of twelve stars and the Moon under <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> cloaked with the Sun.|$|E
25|$|He was old, {{his life}} was behind him, and, save herself, he had no ties. What did it matter to him how his {{struggle}} should end? But she was young, she was beautiful, she might form new friendships, the world was before her, the world might yet be at <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> life, so sweet and so sad, and yet so good a thing withal, was ready and waiting for her.|$|E
25|$|Ovid's Metamorphoses {{mentions}} that just before discovering Callisto's pregnancy, Diana washed <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> then {{she and her}} attendants disrobed. Walter Liedtke {{points out that the}} nymph standing somewhat apart from the group, with her hands clenched in front of her abdomen, perhaps in contrast with the nymph showing devotion and fidelity by washing feet, may be Callisto. This scene would then illustrate part of that myth narrative, Liedtke asserts, although Wheelock states that the episode seems unrelated to the mood of the painting.|$|E
60|$|She got up, {{stamped with}} <b>her</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>and</b> then, {{suddenly}} remembering the lodger below, {{sat down and}} wrenched off her boots.|$|R

25|$|Domenico di Bartolo's Madonna of humility, {{painted in}} 1433, was {{described}} by art historian Andrew Ladis {{as one of the}} most innovative devotional images from the early Renaissance. The formal symmetry of the strips below <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> those hovering above her express the symbolic duality of her nature: an earthly woman, as well as a heavenly queen. Despite the low seating position, the star and the gems as well as the halo signify her regal status. In this painting, which is at the Pinoteca Nazionale in Siena, Domenico does not use cast shadows as he does in other works such as the Madonna Enthroned.|$|E
25|$|If the {{infection}} in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; although, this {{was seen as a}} benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.|$|E
25|$|Votive offerings {{became a}} tradition. They are usually small silver objects (hearts, crucifixes, figures of praying people, images of cured eyes, legs, arms). Several times (1799, 1808, 1810) {{some of these}} objects were taken down and melted into liturgical objects. In 1844 there was a total of 785 offerings. Twelve years later, in 1856, the number had almost doubled to 1,438. From 1884 to 1927 a journal of new offerings was kept. During that time 2,539 new gifts were registered. Currently, there are about 8,000 silver votive objects in the chapel. The large {{crescent}} moon located right beneath Our Lady is also a votive offering. Its origins are unknown but it bears an inscription in Polish and a date of 1849. The crescent goes well with the silver cloth, adding additional parallels with the Woman of the Apocalypse, described in the Book of Revelation as a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> on her head a crown of twelve stars.|$|E

25|$|The Nauvoo Temple was {{designed}} in the Greek Revival style by architect William Weeks, {{under the direction of}} Joseph Smith. Weeks' design made use of distinctively Latter Day Saint motifs, including Sunstones, Moonstones, and Starstones. It is often mistakenly thought that these stones represent the Three Degrees of Glory in the Latter Day Saint conception of the afterlife, but the stones appear in the wrong order. Instead, Wandle Mace, foreman for the framework of the Nauvoo Temple, has explained that the design of the temple was meant to be “a representation of the Church, the Bride, the Lamb’s wife” (Wandle Mace, Autobiography 207 (BYU Special Collections)). In this regard Mace references John’s statement in Revelation 12:1 concerning the “woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> upon her head a crown of twelve stars.” This explains why the Starstones are {{at the top of the}} temple (“crown of twelve stars”), the Sunstones in the middle (“clothed with the sun”) and the Moonstones at the bottom (“moon under her feet”).|$|E
25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E
500|$|Filming of {{the trap}} scenes, which was done last, began in March. The film's opening trap scene was filmed at Metro Hall in Toronto, Ontario, just outside Roy Thomson Hall, and {{included}} 400 extras. [...] In the trap, the circular saw blades were actually real and functional, but safety precautions were taken for the actors. One actor {{that was in}} the trap, Jon Cor, told Demon FM that he had scars on his hands from the shackles, and said the other actors, Sebastian Pigott chipped his tooth and Anne Lee Greene lost the feeling in <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> had to receive medical attention.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé also {{revealed}} that the scenes reminded her of Vanity 6. A short [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] clip opens the [...] "Green Light" [...] video. Beyoncé considered [...] "Green Light" [...] the [...] "toughest video" [...] to shoot. Besides from dressing in latex rubber clothing, she and her back-up dancers had to wear ballet-pointe heels. The shoes blistered <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> gave muscle spasms due to the 18-hour session. Beyoncé invited her all-female tour band, Suga Mama, to make their second appearance in a video after their debut performance on the music video for [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] (2006). The video was posted on the MTV Overdrive on March 28, 2007.|$|E
500|$|On that day, Bågenholm was {{skiing in}} the {{mountains}} outside of Narvik with two of her colleagues, Marie Falkenberg and Torvind Næsheim. An expert skier, Bågenholm often skied after work. On this day, as she was heading down a steep mountainside—a route she had taken several times before—she lost control of her skis. She fell headfirst onto a layer of ice on a frozen stream near a waterfall, landing on her back. A hole opened up in the ice and Bågenholm's head and torso were pulled in as meltwater filled her clothes. Her body became trapped under the ice, which was [...] thick. When Falkenberg and Næsheim found Bågenholm, only <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> skis were above the ice.|$|E
500|$|Running {{for nearly}} twelve minutes, the video {{features}} four songs from Artpop and features the central video for [...] "G.U.Y." [...] The video opens with corporate business men {{fighting each other}} over money. Nearby, a fallen angel (played by Gaga) has been {{shot out of the}} sky with an arrow. The instrumental of her song [...] "Artpop" [...] plays in the background. The men run off and Gaga crawls to safety, removing the arrow from her chest. Gaga makes it to <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> travels to a palace, where she collapses at the front door and is scraped up by the guards. [...] "Venus" [...] begins as she is carried down to the pool, where people cover her in flowers and put her into the water in order to heal her.|$|E
