40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} for testing and classifying stability data with multiple factors. A two-way {{analysis of covariance}} is used to classify the differences among the batches as well as another factor such as package type and/or product strength. In the test procedure, slopes and intercepts of the main effects are tested {{using a combination of}} simultaneous and sequential F -tests. Based on the test procedure results, the data are classified into one of four different groups. For each <b>group,</b> <b>shelf</b> life can be calculated accordingly. We examine if the procedure produces satisfactory control of the probability of a Type I error and the power of detecting the difference of degradation rates and intercepts for different nominal levels. The method is evaluated with a Monte Carlo simulation study. The proposed procedure is compared with the current FDA procedure using real data.

40|$|In central West Greenland, early Palaeoproterozoic siliciclastic and {{carbonate}} {{sequences of}} the Karrat <b>Group</b> (<b>shelf</b> sequences of the Rae craton margin) were deposited in sedimentary basins controlled by NW- and SW-trending linked extensional fault systems. The shelf basins were later filled and overtopped by turbidite systems filling a foredeep advancing {{ahead of a}} thrust system – the Karrat Fjord thrust system – that propagated west to east. Deformation culminated in emplacement of basement-cored nappes, progressive deformation and high-grade metamorphism at c. 1. 87  Ga. Reactivation of lower plate growth faults formed dome- and basin-like folds and related thrusts that refolded {{the structure of the}} Karrat Fjord thrust system and inverted the shelf basins. The southern Karrat Fjord thrust system was reworked in a belt of intense ductile NW-directed thrusting – the Nunaarsussuaq thrust system – formed at c. 1. 84  Ga at the northern limit of the Nagssugtoqidian orogen. Kinematics of these events are at odds with the consensus view that the Rinkian fold–thrust belt is a northward extension of the Nagssugtoqidian orogen resulting from north–south convergence between the Rae and North Atlantic cratons. Application of structural restoration techniques to basin analysis of Palaeoproterozoic rocks has potential to provide new insights into Proterozoic orogenic processes worldwide...|$|E

This paper presents an integrated simulation-optimization model to support both strategic and operational decisions in production planning. Discrete-event simulation is used to represent the flows through the supply chain, incorporating collection, production, storing and distribution. On the other hand, an integer linear optimization model running over a rolling planning horizon is used to support daily decisions, such as the required number of donors, collection methods and production planning. This approach is evaluated using real data from a blood center in Colombia. The results show that, using the proposed model, key indicators such as shortages, outdated units, donors required and cost are improved...|$|R

At the same time, the informal setting allowed for continuity; Ella served three terms as postmaster, only retiring at the age of eighty after nearly sixty years in the position, and her own daughter's twenty-year period of service ended only when the post office was closed in 1961, following the dissolution of the Celina community as the Forest Service was buying the surrounding countryside for the Hoosier National Forest.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the Portuguese marine ichthyofauna has a long {{historical}} tradition, rooted back in the 18 th Century. Here we present an annotated checklist of the marine fishes from Portuguese waters, including the area encompassed by the proposed extension of the Portuguese continental shelf and the Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ). The list is based on historical literature records and taxon occurrence data obtained from natural history collections, together with new revisions and occurrences. It comprises a total of 1191 species, distributed among 3 superclasses, 4 classes, 42 orders, 212 families and 617 genera. If considering only the EEZ and present territorial waters, this list represents an increase of 230 species (27. 8 %) and of 238 species (29. 0 %), {{when compared to the}} information available in FishBase (2012) and in the last checklist of marine and estuarine fishes of Portugal (1993), respectively. The order Perciformes shows the highest diversity, with 54 families, 162 genera and 299 species. Stomiidae (80 species), Myctophidae (71 species) and Macrouridae (37 species) are the richest families. From the listed species, 734 are present off mainland Portugal, 857 off the Azores and 766 off Madeira. Within the limits of the examined area, three species are reported {{for the first time in}} mainland Portugal and twenty-nine records are identified as doubtful. A total of 133 species have been recorded from the extended Portuguese continental shelf (2 off mainland Portugal, 117 off the Azores and 14 off Madeira), two of which are common to the Azores and Madeira extensions. Biogeographically, the Atlantic group is the most important (548 species – 46. 01 %), followed by the Lusitanian group (256 species – 21. 49 %), the African group (71 species – 5. 96 %), the Boreal group (34 species – 2. 85 %), the Mediterranean group (31 species – 2. 60 %), the Macaronesian group (21 species – 1. 76 %), the Atlantic/African group (19 species – 1. 60 %) and the Mediterranean/African and the Arctic groups, each with only 1 species (0. 08 %). Regarding the preferences for vertical habitat, the demersal fishes are the most important group (305 species – 25. 61 %), followed by the mesopelagic group (228 species – 19. 14 %), the bathypelagic group (164 species – 13. 77 %), the benthopelagic group (147 species – 12. 34 %), the bathydemersal group (115 species – 9. 66 %), the reef-associated group (88 species – 7. 39 %), the pelagic group (74 species – 6. 21 %), the epipelagic group (58 species – 4. 87 %) and 1 species (0. 08 %) of the benthic group.

40|$|A {{zooplankton}} net sampling {{survey was}} conducted in the southwest Atlantic between 34 * and 55 * S during austral spring 1990. The survey grid covered shelf, slope and oceanic regions and contained 44 stations spaced at 100 / 200 km intervals. Sampling was carried out with an RMT 8 net which was deployed obliquely from the surface to either 200 m over shelf regions or 300 m off-shelf. A total of 155 species were identified from 9 taxonomic groups including euphausiids, hyperiid amphipods, chaetognaths, salps, siphonophores and nektonic/planktonic fish. Log-transformed relative numerical abundances for each species were used in hierarchical classification to elucidate macroscale patterns of distribution. Factor analysis was also used on the most abundant and widely distributed species to reveal mesoscale patterns. Classification analysis produced 4 station groups which showed distinct geographic integrity and strong relationships to the positions of water masses. Group 1 {{was related to the}} Falkland <b>shelf,</b> <b>Group</b> 2, the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), Group 3, the Sub-Antarctic water mass (SAZ) and Group 4, the Sub-Tropical water mass (STZ). The dissimilarity matrix showed that the STZ group was very distant from the other 3 station groups, suggesting that its fauna is distinctly different to that found {{throughout the rest of the}} survey grid. By far the highest number of species showed strongest fidelity to the STZ group with 5 out of the 8 species clusters associated to that station group. Factor analysis gave further resolution to the station group patterns. The distribution of Factor 1 suggested that the warm Falkland Current return carried sub-tropical species into the SAZ. Factors 2 and 3 showed that there were at least 2 distinct faunal zones within the PFZ and Factor 4 highlighted the potential influence of the Falkland Current on the distribution of the shelf community. Overall it was evident that there was a strong correspondence between the distribution of faunal groups and water masses.

40|$|Patients with cleft left lip and palate (CLP) {{normally}} require extensive surgery from {{an early}} age up to the end of adolescence. These surgeries affect the growth of the maxillofacial complex. The degree to which the cleft itself affects growth of the maxillofacial complex remains poorly understood. By analysing the width and elevation of the palatal shelves in unoperated adolescents and adults with unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP and BCLP, respectively) and a non-cleft control group, it is possible to gain more insight into the real intrinsic growth potential of the maxillary structures. In this study, dental casts of the full permanent dentition of individuals with unrepaired UCLP (n = 68) and BCLP (n = 13) and non-cleft controls (n = 24) from the same area of Indonesia were digitized three-dimensionally. Maxillary arch width in the canine, premolar and molar regions, and the width and elevation of the palatal shelves were measured. Results showed that in patients with UCLP, the width of the palatal shelves on the cleft side in all regions, and on the non-cleft side in the canine/first premolar region, was significantly smaller compared with the control group. BCLP subjects showed similar deviations. In the UCLP <b>group,</b> the palatal <b>shelves</b> were rotated cranially and positioned more vertically. In the BCLP <b>group,</b> the palatal <b>shelves</b> were inclined by almost 10 degrees more than the control group. The width of the palatal shelf and width of the maxillary arch positively correlated in the canine and first premolar regions for both the cleft and non-cleft side in patients with UCLP, and in the canine region for patients with BCLP. This means that the wider the palatal shelf, the wider the maxillary arch. The elevation of palatal shelves correlated with the maxillary arch width in all regions in patients with UCLP, and only in the premolar region in the control group. Thus, the wider the arch width, the smaller the elevation angle (the maxillary shelves are less vertical). No correlations between palatal shelf elevation and maxillary arch width were found in the BCLP group. This shows that the intrinsic growth potential in patients with UCLP and BCLP is affected by a smaller palatal shelf width and larger elevation of the shelves. These deviations may result in a wider cleft...|$|R

40|$|Excessive {{dexamethasone}} (Dex) administrated into pregnant mice during critical {{periods of}} palatal development {{can produce a}} high incidence of cleft palate. Its mechanisms remain unknown. Vitamin B 12 has been shown to antagonize the teratogenic effects of Dex, which, however, remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the effects of Dex and vitamin B 12 on murine embryonic palatal shelf fusion using organ culture of murine embryonic shelves. The explanted palatal shelves on embryonic day 14 (E 14) were cultured for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h in different concentrations of Dex and/or vitamin B 12. The palatal shelves were examined histologically for the morphological alterations on the medial edge epithelium (MEE) and fusion rates among different groups. It was found that the palatal shelves were not fused at 72 h or less of culture in Dex group, while they were completely fused in the control and vitamin B 12 -treated groups at 72 and 96 h, respectively. The MEE still existed and proliferated. In Dex+vitamin B 12 <b>group</b> the palatal <b>shelves</b> were fused at each time point in a similar rate to controls.

The results also revealed significantly higher abundances in the Seco de los Olivos seamount, probably related to a higher food availability caused by strong localised currents and upwellings that enhanced primary production. Although depth proved to be the main structuring factor, others such as sediment type and food availability also appeared to be important. Differences between shelf and slope assemblages could be in part related to a greater dependence on benthic resources in the former and a higher use of planktonic resources in the latter...|$|R
40|$|Building {{reliable}} storage systems {{becomes increasingly}} challenging as {{the complexity of}} modern storage systems continues to grow. Understanding storage failure characteristics is crucially important for designing and building a reliable storage system. While several recent {{studies have been conducted}} on understanding storage failures, almost all of them focus on the failure characteristics of one component – disks – and do not study other storage component failures. This paper analyzes the failure characteristics of storage subsystems. More specifically, we analyzed the storage logs collected from about 39, 000 storage systems commercially deployed at various customer sites. The data set covers a period of 44 months and includes about 1, 800, 000 disks hosted in about 155, 000 storage shelf enclosures. Our study reveals many interesting findings, providing useful guideline for designing reliable storage systems. Some of our major findings include: (1) In addition to disk failures that contribute to 20 - 55 % of storage subsystem failures, other components such as physical interconnects and protocol stacks also account for significant percentages of storage subsystem failures.

40|$|As {{fisheries}} {{move into}} deeper waters {{the ability of}} deepwater chondrichthyans to sustain fishing is relatively unknown, although the limited information to date suggests most are inherently vulnerable to exploitation. Knowledge of deepwater chondrichthyans life history traits is required to enable effective management of deepwater chondrichthyans, as life history traits are important indicators of the productivity of species and consequently, species abilities to tolerate fishing pressure. This dissertation aimed to further knowledge of the life histories of deepwater chondrichthyans by assessing patterns in their traits and studying the life history of species taken as bycatch in a deepwater trawl fishery within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. It also {{addressed the issue of}} the inability to age many deepwater chondrichthyans through investigation of a novel approach to ageing, that is, by using near infrared spectroscopy. The association of chondrichthyan life history traits and habitat was examined among the three main marine habitats of shelf, pelagic and deepwater, and also within the deepwater habitat. Life history traits were obtained from 226 populations of chondrichthyans across the three habitats. These traits were analysed for patterns using a linear mixed effects model that controlled for the correlation among species due to their common evolutionary history. Life history differences were identified between chondrichthyans from shelf, pelagic and deepwater habitats, and within the deep habitat down the continental slope. Deepwater species as a group, had lower growth rates, later age at maturity and higher longevity than both <b>shelf</b> and pelagic <b>groups</b> of species. In the deep habitat, with increasing depth, most species matured later, lived longer, had smaller litters and bred less frequently. The group of deepwater species also had a smaller body size than the <b>groups</b> of <b>shelf</b> and pelagic species, which indicates body size is not appropriate as a predictor of vulnerability in most deepwater chondrichthyans. The visual interaction hypothesis offers a potential explanation for these findings, and it is apparent habitat influences the trade-offs in allocation of energy for survival and reproduction. In general, deepwater chondrichthyans are more vulnerable to exploitation than shelf and pelagic species and this vulnerability markedly increases with increasing depth. The life history traits of the deepwater chondrichthyans as a group are unique from the <b>shelf</b> and pelagic <b>groups</b> of species, and reflect adaptations driven by both mortality and resource limitations of their habitat. The chondrichthyan bycatch from the deepwater eastern king prawn fishery at the Swain Reefs, in the southern Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, was sampled onboard two commercial prawn trawlers. In all, 1533 individuals were collected from 11 deepwater chondrichthyan species, with a skate, Dipturus polyommata, most dominant by number at 50...|$|R
40|$|Locally {{abundant}} and diverse brachiopod faunas, associated with unstable outer shelf and slope environments, occur throughout the Barr and Ardmillan groups (middle Llanvirn–upper Ashgill) in the Girvan district of SW Scotland. A dataset of 350 brachiopod species from 30 horizons through the Middle–Upper Ordovician succession {{forms the basis}} for a description of brachiopod diversity through the succession and comparison with global patterns and trends through this time interval. The Middle Ordovician Barr Group incorporates shallow water carbonate and clastic facies, characterised by Valcourea confinis, with deeper-water facies. The trilobite-dominated Albany <b>Group</b> preserves outer <b>shelf</b> biofacies. Deep-water facies occur in the Balclatchie Formation of the lower Ardmillan Group, including an early occurrence of a Foliomena-type species. High diversity brachiopod faunas occur in clastic facies, though many of the biofacies have a transported component to them. Representatives of the deep-water Foliomena fauna occur intermittently throughout the Upper Ardmillan Group, appearing in both the Whitehouse and Drummuck subgroups. This distinctive assemblage of small, thin-shelled brachiopods, including Dedzetina, Christiania, Cyclospira and Foliomena itself, is interbedded with a variety of other less cosmopolitan deep-water assemblages, including the Onniella–Skenidioides and Lingulella–Trimurellina associations. Shallower-water environments in the middle Ashgill Lower Drummuck Subgroup hosted the Fardenia–Eopholidostrophia association in sands, and the Christiania–Leptaena association in muds and silts. The remarkable Lady Burn Starfish Beds in {{the upper part of the}} group contain a variety of brachiopod-dominated assemblages, including the Eochonetes and Plaesiomys–Schizophorella associations, transported from various shelf locations, within a very diverse mid Ashgill biota. The upper Ashgill High Mains Formation contains abundant elements of the terminal Ordovician Hirnantia fauna, including Eostropheodonta, Hindella and Hirnantia itself, but also some taxa more typical of the Laurentian Edgewood Province. As a whole, the changing brachiopod biodiversity biofacies reflect environmental fluctuations, on this part of the Laurentian margin, driven by mainly eustatic and tectonic events against a background of global biotic radiation. ...|$|R

Nine years after releasing his last album, Van Zandt returned to the studio with producer [...] "Cowboy" [...] Jack Clement, Jim Rooney and a <b>group</b> of top <b>shelf</b> musicians, including fiddle and mandolin player Mark O'Connor and Willie Nelson's harmonica player Mickey Raphael, who all complement Van Zandt's subtle, poetic songs. Clement later told Van Zandt's biographer John Kruth that he felt At My Window was the best Townes album that he was ever involved in but Van Zandt's guitarist Mickey White offers a different perspective, telling Kruth, [...] "The album sounds a bit tentative in spots 'cause we didn't use headphones and missed some of the nuances goin' on. And by the time of At My Window, Townes skills were not consistent...he didn't fingerpick as well as he used to. And he started getting a little lazy as a singer. As his voice matured, it got deeper and more resonant, but he tended to not sing with as much energy and lung power as he used to and started shaving off his notes and phrases more and more."

40|$|Facies trends were {{developed}} for San Pedro Bay, California, based upon 44 well-distributed stations. The {{area of investigation}} extends from the shore out to depths of 176 m, {{a distance of about}} 20 km, and spans a distance along the shelf of about 25 km. Sediments of the bay are mostly detrital sands along the shore line, silty sands on the shelf, and silts and silty sands on the slope {{off the edge of the}} shelf; residual and relict sediments (sands and silty sands) occupy a central region, contributing to more complex sedimentary patterns. Values for calcium carbonate and nitrogen are highest along the outer edge of the shelf and in the upper bathyal zone. Polychaetes dominate the megafauna; foraminifera dominate the microfauna. Forammiferal abundance and species diversity are greatest in outer areas of the shelf and in the upper bathyal zone; live/dead ratios are highest in central and inner shelf areas; live foraminifera are about three times as abundant in the upper bathyal zone as on the shelf. Calcareous perforate foraminifera dominate both dead and live assemblages throughout the area. Planktonic/benthic ratios are highest in the upper bathyal region; values for planktonic specimens per gram increase 20 – 100 times from the shelf into the bathyal zone. In the upper 10 m of the water column, phosphate and plankton cells per liter attain highest values in the central and inner shelf areas; however, in the lower 10 m of the water column, there is a general increase in phosphate values away from shore. Benthic foraminiferal populations may be <b>grouped</b> into inner <b>shelf</b> Buliminella elegantissima (d'Orbigny), central and outer shelf Nonionella-Trochammina, and upper bathyal Bolivina acuminata Natland groups. Hopkinsina pacifica Cushman is diagnostic of the general harbor region; Bulimina marginata denudata Cushman and Parker occurs in both the harbor and in the outer shelf and upper bathyal zones. The edge of the shelf, a structural trend, is defined by the boundary zone between the Nonionella and Bolivina acuminata Natland faunal groups. Similar structural trends may be indicated in the California marine Miocene by boundary zones between analogous faunal groups...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale stratal architecture, structure, and {{commonly}} hydrocarbon {{distribution in}} the Mississauga Formation, Sable Subbasin, offshore Nova Scotia, can be satisfactorily explained by shelf margin progradation. Using an integrated subsurface dataset (2 -D and 3 -D seismic data, biostratigraphy, geophysical well logs, core), the physical characteristics and depositional history of the Missisauga Formation (Tithonian-Barremian) were studied on both local and regional scales. These data suggest that during deposition of the Missisauga, the shelf margin prograded southward from an initial position just basinward of the Venture Field (Tithonian) to a final position just basinward of the Glenelg and Alma fields (Barremian). Growth-faulted, storm-dominated deltaic sandstones deposited {{at or near the}} shelf margin during this process are interpreted to contain over half of the discovered in-place gas reserves offshore Nova Scotia. Because shelf-margin delta sand-bodies are typically shore-elongate, tend to occur in <b>groups</b> along a <b>shelf</b> margin and commonly correlate downdip to turbidite sand-bodies, recognition of the shelf-margin delta play-type will not only improve hydrocarbon exploitation strategies offshore Nova Scotia, but will provide an important framework to guide the identification of new exploration opportunities in genetically related parts of the stratigraphic section. In the Venture Field, Tithonian shelf-margin delta lobes are stacked vertically, suggesting that growth-fault related subsidence at the shelf margin negated depositional topography and created topographic lows through which fluvio-deltaic systems preferentially flowed. Over several relative sea level cycles, the positive feedback between sediment supply and subsidence at the shelf margin potentially focused enough sediment to have constructed slope turbidite systems downdip, which in turn represent new exploration targets. In the Glenelg Field, Barremian shelf-margin deltas were initially tide-influenced (dominated?) and then changed to a storm-dominated state, possibly because the shoreline initially prograded into a tidally resonant topographic depression, which upon being filled was converted to a wave-dominated setting. Along depositional strike of the main hydrocarbon-bearing sandstones at Glenelg, Barremian sandstone reservoirs in the Alma Field are interpreted to be storm-dominated shelf-margin delta deposits. However, unlike Glenelg, incised valleys were not identified at Alma, suggesting that downdip depocenters were fed by sediment that bypassed Glenelg during the Barremian. Transgression {{at the end of the}} Barremian deposited mudstone of the Naskapi Member throughout the Sable Subbasin, forming a regional seal. Sharp-based, bioturbated shallow marine sandstones deposited locally during this transgression are an important play type in the western Sable Subbasin (e. g., Alma and Panuke fields) ...|$|R
40|$|During late December 2004 {{and early}} January 2005 the {{plankton}} {{community to the}} south and west of South Georgia was investigated. Satellite imagery had shown the surface expression of a bloom over the southern shelf I month prior to the cruise, although by the time of sampling a well-defined sub-surface chl-a maximum was evident at 26 of the 57 stations located mainly at the western end of the southern shelf (and the bloom was declining). Nonetheless, integrated chl-a was still greater over the shelf than elsewhere (18 - 362 mg m(- 2)). Macronutrient distributions essentially mirrored the distribution of chl-a biomass, with depletion greatest in the on-shelf waters at the western end of South Georgia, where the most intense surface bloom had occurred during the preceding November. Nearest neighbour clustering of microplankton and mesozooplankton data revealed the presence of two major station groups within each analysis with broadly congruent distributions. Within the microplankton analysis a southern and western <b>shelf</b> <b>grouping</b> of 18 stations was dominated by Corethron spp., Eucampia antarctica and Thalassiothrix spp. This group corresponded spatially to a <b>shelf</b> zooplankton <b>grouping</b> (12 of the 18 stations in both groups in common) in which mesozooplankton abundance was greatest. Here small copepods such as Oithona spp. and the neritic clausocalaniid Drepanopus forcipatus dominated, along with the thecate pteropod Limacina helicina, appendicularians and calanoid copepod naupliar stages. Acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements indicated that water flow over the shelf was low and variable (< 15 cm s(- 1)). In contrast the largest station groups in both ordinations were distributed along the southern shelf-break and further off-shelf in water flowing rapidly (up to 55 cm s(- 1)) to the southeast. Nitzschia spp., Pseudonitzschia spp., and Fragilariopsis kerguelensis were abundant here, and the zooplankton, in addition to Oithona spp., was characterized by Metridia spp., Ctenocalanus spp., Oncaea spp., and the polychaete Pelagobia longicirrata. A third group of 13 stations disclosed by the mesoplankton ordination was confined to the north and west and generally comprised outer shelf stations in deeper waters. Here zooplankton abundance was less than in the adjacent major station groupings, although Calanus simillimus was considerably more abundant than in other groups. Relationships of both micro- and zooplankton ordinations with environmental variables were modest (Spearman rank correlation, rho w = 0. 49 - 0. 59), albeit complex, with interactions likely to have occurred over different timescales. High levels of ammonium over the shelf, probably resulting from microbial breakdown and zooplankton excretion, contributed most to explaining both ordinations, along with the Si(OH) (4) :NO 3 deficit ratio, a measure of past nutrient use. Model output from Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling (OCCAM) supported ADCP-derived flow measurements. Specifically, release of particles along a transect to the southwest suggested there was an extended residence time (in excess of 3 months) over the southern shelf and a slow but significant northwards transport into the Georgia Basin. The spatial extent of the shelf and the current speed and direction implied that in situ production was locally important and had the potential to contribute significantly to downstream ecosystems.

40|$|The Olavi Mountain Land is a 10 000 km 2 mineral {{province}} {{located at}} the eastern extremity of the exposed Northern Platform of the Damara Pan African orogenic belt. The Olavi Mountain Land is tbe most important mineral province on the Northern Platform. Exploitation of tbe Cu-Pb-Zn-V province has been on-going since the possession of the territory by the German colonial authority in 1890. Production has been mostly from four mines which in order of importance are Tsumeb, Kombat, Berg Aukas and Abeoab. A second mineral province on the Northern Platform located in the west is centred on Sesfontein where as yet only insignificant mineralization has been noted. Besides these localities, the Northern Platform is conspicuously devoid of notable mineralization. The aim of this thesis has been to document tbe Berg Aukas deposit, an important end-member type of mineralization in the Otavi Mountain Land. The basic premise bas been to show tbat the derivation and localization of the mineralization {{is a consequence of}} two broad controls which can be simply summarised as features of the basement and of the carbonate sequences. The geodynamic evolution of the Damara Belt commenced with intra-continental rifting approximately 900 Ma ago. Rift grabens trending north-east were filled by the Nosib Group which comprises mostly clastic lithologies but also some volcanics. The earliest and largest rift {{is referred to as the}} Northern Rift. Separation of the Congo, Kalahari, and proto-South American cratons resulted in rifting and rapid downwarping so that an encroaching sea and an Olavi <b>Group</b> carbonate <b>shelf</b> developed along the northern margin of the Northern Rift. Significantly, the carbonates only covered the Northern Rift in the area of the Otavi Mountain Land where a basinal dome, referred to as the Grootfontein Basement High, marked the basin edge. In the west, the carbonates covered the less important Sesfonfein Rift, and it is only in these two areas where Nosib sequences underlie the carbonate platform. Carbonate sedimentation was interrupted by a major period of crustal readjustment and the deposition of an extensive mixtite throughout the geosynclinal Swakop Trough and Northern Platform. This is referred to as the Chuos Formation and subdivides the Olavi Group into a lower Abenab and an upper Tsumeb Subgroup. Reversal of spreading led to plate collision and subduction of tbe Kalahari craton beneath the Congo craton. It was accompanied by orogenesis which resulted in F 1 folding of the Northern Platform into a series of north-easterly trending intermontane basins into which a molasse sequence known as the Mulden Group was unconformably deposited. Following this major north-south deformation mild east-west compression initiated F 2 folding and the formation of doubly plunging synclines. The Berg Aukas Syncline represents a primary depositional basin which was subsequently folded. The original basin was formed by late Nosib rifting wben spreading caused the Swakop geosynclinal Trough to form. Carbonates of the basal Berg Aukas Formation were deposited in a lagoonal setting typified by reef and fore-reef facies witb peri-platform conditions. Rapid subsidence caused these sediments to be overlain by deep water carbonates of the Gauss Formation. Two styles of mineralization known as the Tsumeb-type and Berg Aukas-type are stratigraphically, isotopically, and mineralogically distinct. The Tsumeb-type is a cupriferous variety of discordant bodies confined to the upper sequences beneath the Mulden unconformity. The Berg Aukas-type is a Zn-Pb variety confined to tbe basal unconformity. The Berg Aukas deposit comprises three ore bodies known as the Northern Ore Horizon, the Central Ore Body, and the Hanging Wall Ore Body. Sphalerite and galena constitute the bypogene ore. Willemite, smithsonite, cerussite, and descloizite are important supergene ores. A review of genetic models concludes that a magmatic origin initially proposed for tbe Tsumeb deposit is entirely rejected and a basin dewatering model in line with Mississippi Valley-type deposits is proposed. The syntectonic nature of mineralization at Berg Aukas and elsewhere in the Otavi Mountain Land indicates that orogenesis encouraged dewatering and leaching of metals from a broad mineralizing front along the margin of the Swakop Trough. These were transported by acidic saline brines which migrated along the clastic aquifers and structural conduits provided by the Northern Rift. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that the hydrothermal fluids at Berg Aukas were very saline (23 % TDS) and were transported at temperatures ranging between 92 ° to 210 °C. Hydrothermal fluids which mineralized Berg AukaS-type deposits migrated along the basal unconformity towards the basement high and were responsible for hydrothermally altering the basement granites and gabbros and the Nosib clastic rocks. Tsumeb-type deposits resulted by migration of fluids through the carbonate pile and along north-easterly trending basement geofractures. As a consequence of variation in transport, the Berg Aukas-type and Tsumeb-type fluids leached different sources and therefore derived mineralogically and isotopically seperable characteristics. The localization of the Berg Aukas ores was controlled by the carbonate stratigraphy and structure. Hydrothermal karsting and ore deposition took place on the contact between Massive Grey and Light Grey Dolostones which represents a permeability contrast. The movement of the hydrothermal fluids was controlled by north-south trending vertical fractures caused by F 2 folding which resulted in a peric 1 inal structure. Hydrothermal karsting was accompanied by ca 1 citic, dolomitic and silicic alteration. The heated acidic fluids initiated solution collapse and a variety of breccia types. Supergene processes resulted in oxidation and upgrading of the ore. Vanadium derived indirectly from gabbros in the basement complex were transported as calcium metavanadate complexes and deposited on contact with the oxidizing base metal sulphides. ...|$|R
