5|$|Although dietary {{antioxidants}} {{have been}} investigated for potential effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, these studies have been <b>inconclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|April: Marshall and Ian Hislop begin a {{study to}} compare bismuth {{treatment}} with cimetidine. The study is abandoned because it is <b>inconclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Perdido County, {{formed in}} 1824 and {{forgotten}} during the upheavals of the 1840s. Perdido was reportedly abolished in 1858 {{and again in}} 1871. Records of annexation to Dawson County are also <b>inconclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>inconclusive</b> {{report was}} the subject of bitter and {{personal}} debate among Kennedy's senior advisers. Various courses of action towards Vietnam were discussed, such as fostering a regime change or taking a series of selective measures designed to cripple the influence of Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's brother and chief political adviser. Nhu and his wife Madame Ngô Đình Nhu were seen as the major causes of the political problems in South Vietnam. The <b>inconclusive</b> result of Krulak and Mendenhall's expedition resulted in a follow-up mission, the McNamara–Taylor mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{science of}} marking {{the order of}} musical {{instrument}} development relies on archaeological artifacts, artistic depictions, and literary references. Since data in one research path can be <b>inconclusive,</b> all three paths provide a better historical picture.|$|E
5|$|While a {{wide variety}} of studies have upheld the basic tenets of {{attachment}} theory, research has been <b>inconclusive</b> as to whether self-reported early attachment and later depression are demonstrably related.|$|E
5|$|After an <b>inconclusive</b> {{skirmish}} in late June at Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk and {{his band}} fled the approaching militia through Wisconsin. They had passed through what are now Beloit and Janesville, then followed the Rock River toward Horicon Marsh, where they headed west toward the Four Lakes region (near modern-day Madison). The band camped for the night near Pheasant Branch.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} <b>inconclusive</b> winter warfare, the Italians {{launched}} a counter-offensive on {{the centre of}} the front on 9 March 1941, which failed, despite the Italians' superior forces. After one week and 12,000 casualties, Mussolini called off the counter-offensive and left Albania twelve days later.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{preceding}} naval engagements around Guadalcanal, the strategic outcome was <b>inconclusive</b> because neither the Japanese nor United States navies secured operational {{control of the}} waters around Guadalcanal {{as a result of}} this action. However, the Battle of Cape Esperance provided a significant morale boost to the U.S. Navy after the failure at the Savo Island.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the leper colony on Brei Holm {{there may have been}} another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was <b>inconclusive</b> but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony.|$|E
5|$|Johnstone {{sailed to}} the East Indies with a convoy in March 1781, and Romney saw {{action at the}} Battle of Porto Praya on 16 April 1781. The battle was <b>inconclusive,</b> but on 21 July the ship was part of Johnstone's {{squadron}} which succeeded in capturing several Dutch East Indiamen in Saldanha Bay.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of benzodiazepines {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased risk of cognitive impairment, but its relationship with dementia remains <b>inconclusive.</b> The association of a past history of benzodiazepine use and cognitive decline is unclear, with some studies reporting a lower risk of cognitive decline in former users, some finding no association and some indicating an increased risk of cognitive decline.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet {{and two of}} his divisions—-those {{commanded}} by Pickett and John Bell Hood—-were detached from Lee's main army in April while participating in the Suffolk Campaign. They thus missed the Battle of Chancellorsville. The Suffolk Campaign was minor and <b>inconclusive,</b> while the Battle of Chancellorsville was an enormous Confederate victory.|$|E
5|$|Of {{far greater}} {{importance}} to McCarthy than the committee's <b>inconclusive</b> final report was the negative {{effect that the}} extensive exposure had on his popularity. Many in the audience saw him as bullying, reckless, and dishonest, and the daily newspaper summaries of the hearings were also frequently unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Army invaded and {{occupied}} the neighboring state of Kuwait. The invasion, which followed the <b>inconclusive</b> Iran–Iraq War and {{three decades of}} political conflict with Kuwait, offered Saddam Hussein the opportunity to distract political dissent at home and add Kuwait's oil resources to Iraq's own, a boon {{in a time of}} declining petroleum prices.|$|E
5|$|On October 1, 1970, Hendrix was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in Renton, Washington. In 1992, {{his former}} girlfriend Kathy Etchingham asked British {{authorities}} {{to reopen the}} investigation into his death. A subsequent inquiry by Scotland Yard proved <b>inconclusive,</b> and in 1993, they decided against proceeding with the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{argue that}} actual energy savings are <b>inconclusive,</b> that DST {{increases}} health risks such as heart attack, that DST can disrupt morning activities, {{and that the}} act of changing clocks twice a year is economically and socially disruptive and cancels out any benefit. Farmers have tended to oppose DST.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors for}} the {{development}} of acne, other than genetics, have not been conclusively identified. Possible secondary contributors include hormones, infections, diet and stress. Studies investigating the impact of smoking on the incidence and severity of acne have been <b>inconclusive.</b> Sunlight and cleanliness are not associated with acne.|$|E
5|$|Several {{risk factors}} have been {{proposed}} and {{are the subject of}} ongoing research. Due to characteristic early onset many studies have focused on parental factors around conception and during gestation. Factors investigated have included occupation (i.e. exposure to chemicals in specific industries), smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medicinal drugs during pregnancy and birth factors; however, results have been <b>inconclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since the pigeye shark so {{strongly}} resembles the bull shark, morphology-based phylogenetic studies {{have considered the}} two species to be closely related. Neither this nor any other arrangement is strongly supported by molecular phylogenetic research, which to date has been <b>inconclusive</b> regarding this shark's evolutionary relationship to other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inconclusive</b> {{nature of}} the {{hearings}} helped to foster continued speculation as to the {{nature of the}} mystery, and the story has repeatedly been complicated by false detail and fantasy. Hypotheses that have been advanced include the effects on the crew of alcohol fumes rising from the cargo, submarine earthquakes (seaquakes), waterspouts, attacks by giant squid, and paranormal intervention.|$|E
5|$|The judge, Fray Domingo de Soto, {{summarised}} the arguments. Sepúlveda addressed Las Casas's {{arguments with}} twelve refutations, which were again countered by Las Casas. The judges then deliberated on the arguments presented {{for several months}} before coming to a verdict. The verdict was <b>inconclusive,</b> and both debaters claimed that they had won.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} rare genetic condition, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, is self-harm and may include biting and head-banging. Genetics {{may contribute to the}} risk of developing other psychological conditions, such as anxiety or depression, which could in turn lead to self-harming behaviour. However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely <b>inconclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Troops of the KAR {{launched}} a tentative attack on Mbombwe on 25 January but the engagement proved <b>inconclusive.</b> Chilembwe's forces held a strong defensive position along the Mbombwe river {{and could not}} be pushed back. Two African government soldiers were killed and three were wounded; Chilembwe's losses have been estimated as about 20.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} <b>inconclusive</b> {{evidence}} that sleep hygiene alone is {{effective as a}} treatment for insomnia, some research studies have shown improvement in insomnia for patients who receive sleep hygiene education in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy practices.|$|E
5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally <b>inconclusive.</b> Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|After a {{hard but}} <b>inconclusive</b> fight during which Admiral Brézé was killed, the French fleet withdrew to Toulon leaving {{the sea to}} the Spanish, who decided not to pursue them to relieve Orbetello. The land forces disembarked by Count of Linhares a few days later, however, failed to {{dislodge}} the French lines, and the siege could be undertaken until 24 July, when another Spanish army led by the Marquis of Torrecuso and the Duke of Arcos, which {{had come from the}} Kingdom of Naples across the Papal States, defeated the besieging French troops, forcing them to retreat with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide <b>inconclusive</b> results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it allowed}} the militia men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the battle was <b>inconclusive</b> with respect to its {{original}} purpose of stopping the Native American raids in the area. The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle helped raise public opinion towards the militia. After the disastrous defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E
5|$|As {{the advance}} led by Gerhard Schöpfel {{made their way}} past the coast it spotted the vic-formation of RAF fighters. They were Hurricanes of 501 Squadron which were {{conducting}} wide spirals to gain height. Schöpfel bounced them and shot down four in two minutes killing one pilot and wounding three others. As he departed {{other members of his}} Geschwader (Wing) dived on the Squadron and an <b>inconclusive</b> dogfight ensued. Schöpfel's victims were Donald McKay and Pilot Officers J.W Bland, Kenneth Lee and F. Kozlowski. Bland was the only one killed.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} evidence, British zoologist Reginald Pocock {{concluded the}} jaguar is most {{closely related to}} the leopard. However, DNA evidence is <b>inconclusive</b> and the position of the jaguar relative to the other species varies between studies. Fossils of extinct Panthera species, such as the European jaguar (Panthera gombaszoegensis) and the American lion (Panthera atrox), show characteristics of both the lion and the jaguar. Analysis of jaguar mitochondrial DNA has dated the species' lineage to between 280,000 and 510,000 years ago, later than suggested by fossil records.|$|E
5|$|Because Lynott {{had worked}} {{alongside}} Smith at the Rainbow Pub, West Midlands Police wished to re-examine {{the cause of}} her death. In early 2001, investigators asked the Irish authorities for a new post mortem, and on 8 March Lynott's body was exhumed by Gardai from a cemetery in Athlone and taken to Dublin City Morgue for further examination by Ireland's State Pathologist, Dr John Harbison. However, {{the results of this}} autopsy also proved <b>inconclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is <b>inconclusive</b> as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Charles V of France {{maintained}} {{the terms of}} the treaty of Brétigny but encouraged others in Aquitaine to challenge the authority of the Plantagenets in Aquitaine. The prince, who had suffered a debilitating illness for nearly a decade which often restricted his movement to being carried in a litter, returned to England, where he soon died. John of Gaunt assumed leadership in France with limited success, and peace negotiations over several years were <b>inconclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Church members {{reported}} that Father Feit's confession line moved slowly {{that night and}} that he was away from the sanctuary several times. When the canal at the crime scene was drained several days after the discovery of Garza's body, Feit's photo slide viewer was found in the canal. Fellow priests noticed scratch marks on Feit's hands after midnight mass, and they said it was irregular for Feit to have taken Garza to the church rectory to hear her confession. The McAllen Police Department initially said that Feit passed polygraph tests, but the tests were later said to be <b>inconclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was <b>inconclusive</b> and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
