5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E
25|$|Soon, Mr. Kolenkhov appears {{with the}} Grand Duchess Olga Katrina, {{in all of}} her former glory. After {{discussing}} the sad fate of former Russian royalty now working menial jobs in New York, the Grand Duchess soon insists upon going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> cook the dinner for the family.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wilks smiled, {{but almost}} {{instantly}} became grave again. [...] "She's not that sort," [...] he said, bitterly, and went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> draw some beer.|$|E
60|$|And mademoiselle, hastily taking from {{a drawer}} a large linen apron, and tying {{it over her}} black apron, rushed éperdue <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> whence, <b>to</b> speak truth, exhaled an odour of {{calcined}} sweets rather strong than savoury.|$|R
50|$|While {{the school}} {{production}} of Patience is taking place, Blakey, who {{has set up}} camp in the woods surrounding <b>the</b> school, breaks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>to</b> steal food. His camp is discovered the following day by Benji and some other boys who are out on a cross country run. Dyson is not among the boys as presumably his leg brace prevents him taking part. There is a minor altercation between Blakey {{and one of the}} boys, Crawley, but after the others leave, Benji stays behind and strikes up a friendship with Blakey and his girlfriend, Louella.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked the}} length of the hallway, and stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and over <b>to</b> a side window.|$|R
60|$|He {{packed his}} father {{back into the}} shop, and his mother down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> get his tea, {{and for a while}} we sat {{together}} talking.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll get a poker {{and kill}} {{as many of}} 'em as I can," [...] cried Randy, and ran out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> do as he had mentioned.|$|E
6000|$|One big, {{freckled}} {{young fellow}} nudged his neighbor and said: [...] "Wouldn't that pull your teeth? That wall-eyed sorrel has waltzed right <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> buzz the women. Say, his neck needs shortening." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went away}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> wash himself. As he was bending his {{head over the}} sink before the little mirror, {{lathering}} to shave, there came from outside the dissonant voices of boys, pouring out the dregs of carol-singing.|$|R
60|$|Then Jack stole softly {{out of the}} wardrobe, {{and went}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> huge <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> see if <b>the</b> Giantess had gone out; he found no one there, {{so he went to}} the door and opened it softly, for he thought he could not do so with the harp in his hand.|$|R
50|$|After {{storming}} {{out of the}} apartment, Maria encounters Pop in {{the hall}} and he begins to calm her down and the two eventually go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> building's <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> talk. Maria explains that the argument was about her friendship with Eileen, before then admitting her admiration for her friend's beauty and supposed exciting lifestyle.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Potter {{had just}} taken Ethel Spriggs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> say good- by; in the small front room Mr. Spriggs, with his fingers already fumbling at the linen collar of ceremony, waited impatiently.|$|E
6000|$|... "How noble!" [...] was Grizel's comment, {{when she}} heard of this; and then Elspeth was her friend again, insisted on her staying to tea, and went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> prepare it. Aaron was out.|$|E
60|$|Anson {{turned away}} and went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> wash his face and to comb his hair, glad {{to get rid of}} the sight of Kendall for a moment. Mrs. Stickney was {{toasting}} some bread.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{was passing}} through the little {{entryway}} that leads <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> I happened <b>to</b> glance {{out of the window}} and I saw four or five fellows down {{at the foot of the}} fire-escape." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the servant}} {{came in with}} the tea, Vincent {{told her that she}} was to tell Dinah, whom she would find in the veranda, to bring her husband <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and <b>to</b> give him {{everything}} he wanted. Then, as soon as he had finished tea, he told his mother and sister the adventures he had gone through. Both were crying when he had finished.|$|R
60|$|When {{they got}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> Stuyvesant went <b>to</b> Dorothy, {{who was still}} ironing at a table near the window, and asked her if he might use her shovel and her fire to heat some nails.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, look here," [...] said Crippen menacingly, [...] "I’m going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> make a clean {{breast of}} it. I’m sorry for you, but I’ve done the best I can. Come {{and help me}} to explain." ...|$|E
60|$|The maids {{were sent}} flying hither and thither, one <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> make ready some hot supper, {{the other to}} the linen press to find the finest set of bed linen all sweetly laid by in rosemary.|$|E
6000|$|The rest of {{that speech}} was lost, for Father Arnold, muttering some word {{belonging}} to his [...] "centurion" [...] days, dived <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>to</b> reappear presently dragging a little withered old woman after him who {{was dressed in a}} robe of conventual make.|$|E
60|$|So the Giant went to bed, and as {{he slowly}} ascended the stairs, he winked to himself with his right eye. And his wife, she went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and winked <b>to</b> herself with her left eye.|$|R
6000|$|They {{went out}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> after tea, <b>to</b> find Jonas; {{but he was}} not there. They then went out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> yard; and {{presently}} James saw him over beyond the fence, walking along the lane. Rollo called out, ...|$|R
5000|$|A famous {{line from}} his opinion {{comes at the}} end: [...] "The global need to prevent {{chemical}} warfare {{does not require the}} Federal Government <b>to</b> reach <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> cupboard, or <b>to</b> treat a local assault with a chemical irritant as the deployment of a chemical weapon." ...|$|R
60|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{she changed}} her mind. Sleep {{was out of the}} question. A fever of restlessness had come upon her. She put on a kimono, and went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> ascertain whether her commissariat arrangements would permit of a glass of hot milk.|$|E
60|$|When {{he came to}} {{the outer}} gateway of the court he tied up the mare, and carried the crockery in on his own back boldly. The scullions saw him, and called him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> see his crockery, without the least {{intention}} of paying for what they took.|$|E
60|$|They had supper {{of bread}} and cheese and beer, while Mrs. Athelny was putting the {{children}} to bed; and when Philip went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> bid her good-night (she had been sitting there, resting herself and reading The Weekly Despatch) she invited him cordially to come again.|$|E
50|$|The Oxford and Cambridge boasts one of {{the best}} club {{libraries}} in London, and even with some sales of unwanted accumulations, over 20,000 volumes remain to form a well-balanced and very usable collection. During the Second World War a parachute mine fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> but failed <b>to</b> explode.|$|R
6000|$|She came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{and spoke}} <b>to</b> me. [...] "You must come and change your clothes," [...] she said. [...] "You'll catch your death of cold, else. You're the school-master from Walford, I think, sir? Indeed, I'm sure of it, for I've seen {{you on your}} wheel." ...|$|R
60|$|When this {{ceremony}} of introduction {{had been gone}} through, the cook and Mary retired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> titter, for ten minutes; then returning, all giggles and blushes, they sat down to dinner. Mr. Weller's easy manners and conversational powers had such irresistible influence with his new friends, that before the dinner was half over, {{they were on a}} footing of perfect intimacy, and in possession of a full account of the delinquency of Job Trotter.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} Peter was walking {{off with the}} leg of mutton, and Ada had run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> fetch the rice pudding, which she had made to {{celebrate}} her brother's return. Edith winked at her brother to show that all questions as to the tender subject should be postponed for the moment.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had become}} {{restored}} to his usual condition by these and other comments on his approaching triumph, Arthur Gride put away his book, and, having locked the chest with great caution, descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> warn Peg Sliderskew to bed, and scold her for having afforded such ready admission to a stranger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps till morning," [...] {{answered}} the doctor. Mrs. Joe gave a louder howl than ever at this, and Tannis came {{and stood by}} the bed. The doctor, knowing {{that he could do}} nothing for Carey, hurried <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> attend to Paul, who had a badly shattered arm, and Marie went with him.|$|E
60|$|May 19.--And {{so it has}} come! My mere {{avoidance}} of him has precipitated the worst issue--a declaration. I had occasion <b>to</b> go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> garden <b>to</b> gather some of the double ragged-robins which grew in a corner there. Almost as soon as I had entered I heard footsteps without. The door opened and shut, and I turned to behold him just inside it. As the garden is closed by four walls and the gardener was absent, the spot ensured absolute privacy. He came along the path by the asparagus-bed, and overtook me.|$|R
6000|$|He said [...] "Thank God, thank God!" [...] several times, {{and then}} went out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and began <b>to</b> eat some flabby toast and drink some lukewarm tea he found there. He was horribly fatigued. [...] "Is she all right?" [...] he asked over his shoulder, hearing the doctor's {{footsteps}} on the stairs....|$|R
60|$|But Fillmore had rung off. Sally {{hung up the}} {{receiver}} thoughtfully. She was puzzled and anxious. However, there being nothing {{to be gained by}} worrying, she carried <b>the</b> breakfast things <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and tried <b>to</b> divert herself by washing up. Presently a ring at the door-bell brought her out, to find her sister-in-law.|$|R
