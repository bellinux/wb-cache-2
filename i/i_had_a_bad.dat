500|$|... "She Ain't You" [...] is a mid-tempo R, pop-flavored ballad, {{featuring}} {{electronic and}} calm beats. The song {{is set in}} common time with a moderate tempo of 92 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with Brown's vocal range spanning from the note of B3 to the note of B5. It also makes use of the drums. [...] "She Ain't You" [...] contains {{a portion of a}} remixed version of SWV's [...] "Right Here" [...] (1993), which in turn samples Michael Jackson's [...] "Human Nature" [...] (1982). According to Najah Goldstein of WNOW-FM, it is [...] "reminiscent of a 90's R love song." [...] According to Scott Shetler of AOL Music, on the song, [...] "Brown sings that he's found a new girl, but he's not happy because he still prefers his ex." [...] Hannah Ash of The Harber Herald noted that the line: [...] "With you <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> romance", could be a reference to Lady Gaga's 2009 single [...] "Bad Romance". Ash also noted that the song contains [...] "slow and pouty vocals." ...|$|E
500|$|Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe {{wrote that}} the song [...] "is totally shameless and {{completely}} effective" [...] as it [...] "derives much of its charm from a hefty sample of Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'". Joanne Dorken of MTV UK {{wrote that the}} sample gives [...] "the tune an instant eighties feel". Najah Goldstein of radio station WNOW-FM wrote that the song is [...] "shows a much softer side of Chris Brown", and further added that it's [...] "definitely a song for the ladies...maybe even for pop star Rihanna." [...] Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the sentiment of the song is refreshingly complex." [...] Hannah Ash of The Harber Herald wrote that on F.A.M.E., [...] "She Ain't You" [...] and [...] "Up to You" [...] are [...] "the perfect sweet and cute love songs". While reviewing the album, Sean Fennessey of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "a more appropriate application appears on 'She Ain’t You', which interpolates Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'. Jackson {{has long been the}} emotional, physical and musical forebear to Brown. But on 'She Ain’t You' he begs the comparison, and it isn’t pretty." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that Brown [...] "has a really charmless way with a lyric, as on 'She Ain’t You'—"When I'm with her it's only 'bout the sex / With you <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> romance / And if I could just trade her in I would"—and a voice nowhere near strong enough to make up for it." [...] The song was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards, and Top R Song at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards.|$|E
2500|$|In the US, {{the legal}} {{situation}} was clarified by the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, {{an amendment to}} the Lanham Act, which explicitly prohibited cybersquatting. It defines cybersquatting as [...] "(occurring) when a person other than the trademark holder registers the domain name of a well-known trademark and then attempts to profit from this by either ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name holder". The provision states that [...] " [...] person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of the mark ... if, without regard to the goods or services of the person, that person (<b>i)</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> faith intent to profit from the mark ...; and registers, traffics in, or uses domain name [...] ".|$|E

6000|$|... 'What!' he yelled, and his {{two eyes}} transfixed me like bayonets. Oh, those dreadful eyes, {{shifting}} from grey to blue, like steel in the sunshine. I can see them now when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> dream.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope it is," [...] growled the Rak. [...] "I want {{to crush}} them, if possible, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> disposition. If only I could open my mouth, I'd eat all of you, {{although}} my appetite is poorly this warm weather." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{fall and}} lamed my foot," [...] replied Larry, as cheerfully as he could. He was {{never one to}} [...] "cry over spilt milk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I really cannot say. I know my wife {{always said}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> heart and worse head; {{but what she}} meant, upon my honour I never could understand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> character, a {{deceitful}} disposition; and I'll {{let everybody}} at Lowood {{know what you}} are, {{and what you have}} done." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am writing}} in a very poor condition; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> cold all over me, pains in my back and limbs, and a very {{sensitive}} and uncomfortable throat. There was a great draught up some stone steps near me last night, and I daresay that caused it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--he is awake--he {{will go to}} the door," [...] she said, with {{a breath}} of relief. [...] "Come this way. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> name with her, and you must not be seen. Thus I am obliged to act by stealth, not because I do ill, but because others are pleased to say so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{trick of}} {{standing}} before the fire, and so I burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it. You may laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are polite, aren't you? It's funny; I can't {{tell whether}} I'm {{glad to see}} you. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> time, you know; and Mrs. Fiorsen was an angel. Why do you {{come to see me}} now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure--now. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> night. Didn't sleep till near daylight. Wade {{found me}} asleep.... Collie, it's {{good of you}} to come. You look so--so wonderful! I never saw your face glow like that. And your eyes--oh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I'm {{quite well}} {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> headache yesterday," [...] she said. [...] "Matthew went to Bright River. We're {{getting a little}} boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming on the train tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|Caterina {{opened the}} door and said, 'Thank you, dear Mrs. Sharp; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> headache; please tell my lady I felt it come on after singing.' 'Then, {{goodness}} me! why arn't you in bed, istid o' standing shivering there, fit to catch your death? Come, let me fasten up your hair and tuck you up warm.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a scrap," [...] Ryan said, dismally. [...] "There was {{not much}} chance of fun on that long march; on board ship there was a storm all the way; then we were kept on board the {{transport}} at Cork nearly three months. Everyone was out of temper, and a mouse would not have dared squeak on board the ship. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> time of it since the day we lost you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{mentioned}} his manners; but, unless <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> taste, they must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nuttie rushed at her, {{and there}} was an incoherency of exclamations, the first thing that made itself clear to the senses of the {{traveller}} being, 'Ill, my dear? No such thing! Only <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> cold, and Mary here is only too careful of me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it is a {{shame to}} us, I must say," [...] said Mrs. Roberts, sitting down to the table. [...] "I never lie late myself unless {{something}} in particular happens. Last night I was out very late, and Sabbath before last <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> headache." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`Don't laugh,' he said, `your {{breath is}} strong.' And that was true; besides, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> cold at the time, so I {{advised him to}} get off my chin, for if I {{happened}} to cough he might fall in and be swallowed before I could prevent it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{never said}} I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> rotten <b>bad</b> dream last night--dreampt about rats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Lizzie,' said Katherine, 'do {{not be so}} cross; {{you know}} Mamma says <b>I</b> <b>have</b> such <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> memory, <b>I</b> cannot help forgetting.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You correct me," [...] {{returned}} Barbox Brothers with a blush; [...] "and I {{must look}} so like a Brute, {{that at all}} events it would be superfluous in me to confess to that infirmity. I wish you would {{tell me a little}} more about yourselves. I hardly knew how to ask it of you, for I am conscious that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> stiff manner, <b>a</b> dull discouraging way with me, but I wish you would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{sentiment}} does you credit,' {{returned the}} man, with a grim smile; and added, in a mutter, 'the more so, as I believe it's not your father's.--Yes, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> time of it, that time. I lost everything, {{and had a}} sharp struggle for my life, weak as I was.' ...|$|E
60|$|I am out of practice--but I won't {{begin again}} at Manton's now. Besides, I {{would not return}} his shot. I was once a famous wafer-splitter; but then the bullies of society made it necessary. Ever since I began to feel that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> cause to support, I have left off the exercise.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> night, {{being too}} tired to sleep well. Many times I saw the moon shadows of spruce {{branches}} trembling on the tent walls, and the flickering shadows of the dying camp-fire. I heard the melodious tinkle of the bells on the hobbled horses. Bossy bawled often--a discordant break in the serenity of the night. Occasionally the hounds bayed her.|$|E
60|$|MRS. LUNN [blandly] I don't {{remember}} your sinning. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> shocking <b>bad</b> memory for trifles; but I think I should remember that--if you mean me.|$|R
6000|$|... "New to me," [...] he answered, {{and in such}} enigmatic {{way they}} {{expressed}} their emotion while Lawson and Jennie chatted gayly and in clear prose behind. Part of the time Elsie drove, and that gave Curtis an excuse to lay {{his hand on her}} wrist when he wished her to drive slow. At the half-way house she shuddered and made a mouth of disgust. [...] "Let's hurry past here; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> heart when <b>I</b> think of those horrible men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' sobbed Katherine, 'I {{never heard}} you say we should not go, I do not {{remember}} it. You know Mamma says <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> memory.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as I {{told you}} last night, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> fire {{in my house}} at Bombay. Half of it was burned down, and, among other things, my {{pathological}} collection was largely destroyed. What you see are the poor remains of it. The hand of the hillman went with the rest, but I gave the matter no particular thought at the time. That was six years ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where am I?" [...] he said. [...] "Ah! I remember; I {{have not}} been quite well. You must not think {{anything}} of that. What are you doing down here {{at this time of}} night? Pass me that bottle," [...] and he took nearly half a tumbler of raw brandy. [...] "There, I am quite right again now; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> attack of indigestion, that is all. Good night." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{had long}} been my habit to attend with my grandmother, bi-monthly, an early evening whist party {{at the house of}} an elderly neighbor. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{headache}} on one of these appointed evenings, and Walkirk, who was a perfectly respectable and presentable man, went with my grandmother in my stead. I afterward heard that he played an excellent hand at whist, a remark which had never been made of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, father, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> dreamed <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> dream. At first {{last night}} I could not sleep, and when at length I did I dreamed that dream thrice," [...] and she paused.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{certainly}} looks {{black for}} Caven," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I did not think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> such <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> boy here. And you say he got away from you?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Tom Wills, Australia's most revered cricketer of {{the mid-19th}} century, was also its most {{controversial}} {{and he was}} often accused of (and admitted to) throwing. Many of his contemporaries recalled his trickery: [...] " [...] {{used to say to}} the umpire, 'Just look at my feet, will you; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> habit now and then of going over the crease.' The umpire would look at Tom's feet, and Tom would let go a throw for all he was worth." [...] In 1872 he became the first cricketer to be called for throwing in a major Australian match, effectively ending his first-class career.|$|R
