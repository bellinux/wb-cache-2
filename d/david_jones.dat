Detailed study of eight among <b>David</b> <b>Jones's</b> more accessible poems, namely those pieces which he reluctantly detached from his work-in-progress and released for publication between 1955 and his death in 1974.

40|$|<b>David</b> <b>Jones’s</b> In Parenthesis (1937) {{counters}} {{the reduction}} of the First World War to shorthand metaphors. The poem foregrounds how cliché, idioms and proverbs, transported to the battlefield, literalise. Drawing attention to the violence figured in everyday language, Jones faces a conundrum: How to call for a recalibration of the scale by which experience is measured without invoking ‘sense of proportion’, and, in so doing, laying down a universalising law? The question arises from consideration of the breaking of measuring instruments in the poem, and also Jones’s depiction of those who attempt to impose abstract standards unilaterally upon others. A partial resolution to the problematic connection between proportion and conversion is found in myth. Mythical analogy makes for a long and complex process of weighing up. Jones’s frustrations with the measuring instruments available to him can be linked to a more general attempt, one that has been associated with modernism, to find new representational modes. In Parenthesis seeks out means of communicating the excessive quality of war experiences without falling back on conventions and aggressive hyperbole...|$|R

40|$|Reading <b>David</b> <b>Jones’s</b> The Anathemata, William Carlos Williams’s Paterson, and Charles Olson’s The Maximus Poems as epics, this {{doctoral}} dissertation challenges the old but persistent notion that epic poetry ceased being written at a particular point {{in the past and}} instead examines the particular formal, philosophical and political difficulties writers of this genre had to confront {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century. Twentieth-century epic poetry will primarily be defined in terms of its purpose or function, which is the representation of the identity of a ‘community’, while the literary period beginning with the end of the Second World War will be defined as late modernism. Chiefly inspired by Anthony Mellors’s Late Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne, late modernism will be discussed as an aesthetico-political challenge with which writers had to come to terms in the wake of twentieth-century European totalitarianism. Georges Bataille’s philosophy of community, it will be argued, paradigmatically illustrates these aesthetico-political difficulties in philosophical terms, and the discussions of the three epic poems are therefore preceded by an analysis of Bataille’s Summa Atheologica, which constitutes the core of his philosophy of community...|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by <b>David</b> <b>Jones,</b> {{and was the first}} game developed by his company DMA Design. First developed in his bedroom at his parents' house, Jones began seeking an official development studio and publisher when the game was nearing completion. He eventually settled upon a publishing deal with Psygnosis, who first published the game in 1988 to positive reviews; praise was given to the game's graphics, sound and gameplay, while criticism was directed at its ports to inferior hardware. The game was commercially successful, selling over 20,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the game on the Amiga led to its rapid porting to many other platforms, and it is {{regarded as one of}} the most widely ported video games.

His essays were published in two collections, Epoch and Artist (Faber, 1959) and The Dying Gaul — another posthumous volume edited by a close friend and published by Faber in 1978. The most thorough exposition of <b>David</b> <b>Jones's</b> views on aesthetics and culture is his essay, [...] "Art and Sacrament" [...] (included in Epoch and Artist), which explores the meaning of signs and symbols in everyday life, relates them to Roman Catholic teachings such as the dogma of transubstantiation, and argues that human beings are the only animals which create [...] "gratuitous" [...] works, thus making them creators analogous to God. The best summary of these views is his short essay [...] "Use and Sign" [...] (in The Dying Gaul).|$|R

5|$|DMA Design founder <b>David</b> <b>Jones</b> began {{developing}} Walker {{following the}} release of Blood Money in 1989. The inspiration for the game's mech originated in a sprite from Lemmings (1991) originally designed for Blood Money.

Johnston, a freelancer at the time, wrote a small program to correctly render the walker's head in position, which could then be altered in Deluxe Paint. In early 1990, Jones scrapped Walker because the design was not coming together, and began development on a new game called Gore!; this was soon scrapped. Following {{the completion of the}} Commodore 64 and TurboGrafx-16 ports of Shadow of the Beast, Jones hired Ian Dunlop and Neill Glancy to continue working on Walker; Glancy redesigned the game.

40|$|Writers {{from both}} world wars, {{concerned}} with the representation of war, wrestled with the predicament of partial sight. Their work reveals the problematic dichotomy that exists between the individual’s selective range of vision and the immense scale of conflict. Central to this authorial dilemma {{is the question of}} the visual frame: how do you contain – within the written word – sight that resists containment and expression? The scale of the two world wars accentuated the representative problem of warfare. This thesis, by examining a wide range of World War One and World War Two literature, explores the varied literary responses to the topical relationship between sight and reality in wartime. It examines the war poetry of Wilfred Owen, Ford Madox Ford’s tetralogy Parade’s End, The Return of the Soldier by Rebecca West, Elizabeth Bowen’s The Heat of the Day, and Virginia Woolf’s novels Mrs Dalloway and Between the Acts alongside less well-known works such as <b>David</b> <b>Jones’s</b> prose-poem In Parenthesis, the two short stories ‘The Soldier Looks for His Family’ by John Prebble and ‘The Blind Man’ by D. H. Lawrence, as well as William Sansom’s collection of short stories Fireman Flower, and Louis Simpson’s war poetry. This thesis, by focussing on the inherent difficulties of reconciling perception and representation in war, interrogates the boundaries of sight and the limits of representation. The changing place of sight in writing from the two world wars is examined {{and the extent to which}} discourses of vision were shaped and developed, in the early decades of the twentieth century, by war experience is explored. The critical containment and categorisation of sight that often dominates readings of sight in texts from both world wars is questioned suggesting the need for a more flexible understanding of, and approach towards, sight.

To request private access, please {{click on the}} locked Download file link, and fill out the appropriate web form. This dissertation is {{a study of the}} endnotes to <b>David</b> <b>Jones's</b> In Parenthesis. Jones is a 20 th-century Welsh-English author and visual artist who provides semi-extensive annotations to his work in the form of footnotes, endnotes, or prefaces. This study examines Jones's editorial practice with focus on In Parenthesis. The bulk of the work is a critical edition of his notes (which could be followed in the future by a critical edition of the whole of In Parenthesis). Manuscript notes are collated and compared with the published text in order to examine Jones's working methods and use of annotation. Editorial commentary clarifies allusions and indicates where Jones has used similar material in his other writings (The Anathemata and a number of independently published essays) and art (engravings, paintings, and letterings; in particular the illustrations for an edition of S. T. Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"). Further editorial annotation is included where Jones does not explain allusions and references in the body of In Parenthesis. Because there is evidence that Jones is an inconsistent editor of his own work, his omission of these annotations may be accidental rather than deliberate. An initial discussion preceding the collated notes provides personal and historical context for Jones's practice. To provide further context, a chronology and bibliographical description are included, as is a list of key sources and frequency of use, as well as illustrations and facsimile drafts. This study draws attention to the key works and themes that appear not only in In Parenthesis, but again in The Anathemata, Jones's artwork, essays, and other writings. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{consider}} {{the relationship between}} <b>David</b> <b>Jones's</b> poetry and visual art, with reference to his critical writings. My aim is to integrate these in a chronological study, tracing his comparable experiments in word and image, and referring these to a broader contemporary context. I demonstrate that Jones {{was at the heart}} of debates in the British art world of the 1920 s- 1950 s, correcting a prevailing belief that he was a solitary figure. Current assessments of Jones's neglect in modern scholarship focus on the problems caused by his literary allusions and self-annotation. I argue that we ought instead to focus on his use of visual allusion and exposition of aesthetic theories through his poetry; his adoption of tropes from Modernist visual art, and his overlaps with broader movements in the art world (for example, neo-romantic concerns in the I 940 s which find a central place in Jones's art and literature). I focus primarily on three poems, In Parenthesis (1937), 'The Book of Balaam's Ass' (c. 1938), and The Anathemata (1952). Jones's art and literature articulate the same problematic relationship between modern civilization and past cultures, and the role of the artist within them. Jones's approach is not static, but responsive to changing, contemporary assessments of the artist's status and role. By tracing Jones's complex use of art citation and development of an aesthetic theory through In Parenthesis, I point towards a modern crisis of representation. I argue that Jones's anti- mechanistic approach in 'The Book of Balaam's Ass' forms a carefully constructed response to art critic Herbert Read's acceptance of machine art as a form of abstract art. The last two chapters consider Jones's approach to ancient artefacts in The Anathemata and his use of painted inscriptions to illustrate this work, as part of a successful cultural conservatism.

5|$|Many Welsh {{painters}} gravitated {{towards the}} art capitals of Europe. Augustus John {{and his sister}} Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales {{for most of their}} lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-Welshman <b>David</b> <b>Jones</b> and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{continued}} {{to work as a}} schoolteacher after he broke into international cricket, {{but at the end of}} 1934, after missing more than six months of the year in England, he resigned from his government post, reasoning that his career could not progress if he was going to be overseas so often. However, he had not made any plans for his future employment. Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store <b>David</b> <b>Jones</b> with sporting leave entitlements.

40|$|Fragments of an Attempted Reading: Towards a Phenomenology of 'The Anathemata' <b>David</b> <b>Jones's</b> The Anathemata, first {{published}} in 1952 and subtitled Fragments of an Attempted Writing, presents, through its complex late-modernist interleaving of key themes and poetic voices, {{a fine example of}} the challenges posed by long-form poetry; both in terms of the intricacy of its planning and execution, but also in the challenges it poses to the reader. But what then does it mean to say that one has read a long poem: what sort of process is being described here? On one level, these questions are incontestably banal; the process of reading such a work is, physiologically at least, really no different from any other sort of reading. However, I would suggest that the long poem asks its readers to undertake quite a different act of reading on a phenomenological level, and it is this that most concerns me here. This process is compounded in the case of The Anathemata, as in so much poetry written under the aegis of modernism, by the lengthy process of exegesis essential for even a basic understanding of the text. As with Terrell's Companion to Pound's Cantos, Rene Hague's Commentary is a seemingly necessary Virgil for any new reader [...] yet fragmenting the reading process into a spiralling series of texts, intertexts, and paratexts. Furthermore, Jones also provides his own extensive marginal commentary to the work; a move that seems to further distance the reader from the text of the work itself. In this intermeshing of text and commentary then, what can one say {{of the nature of the}} reading process? Does this process effectively undermine the integrity of the long poem as a form; or does it point to new ways to conceive of the relationship between the textual object and its experiential processes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{formulate}} a critical methodology and a poetics that engage with climate change. It critiques the Romantic and social justice premises of literary ecocriticism, arguing that a modernist poetics more capably articulates the complexities exacerbated in anthropogenic climate change. Analysing {{the form of a}} range of modernist work, I assess its expression of the human–climate relations {{at the root of the}} planet's present state, and trace this work's influence on contemporary climate change poetry. Ecocriticism's topical approaches to nature and the environment have been constitutively unable to grapple with climate change until the discipline's recent synthesis of literary theory, and the emergence of a 'material ecocriticism' informed by developments in environmental sociology, ethics and philosophy. Modernist aesthetics has an array of concerns in common with this critical thinking on climate change, and the reciprocity of the two prompts my rereading here of key modernist texts. T. S. Eliot's 'The Waste Land' is seen to reveal civilisation's inability to suppress or surpass its environment; Wallace Stevens's opus exposes the necessarily fictive quality of our relations with nature; Basil Bunting extends Stevens's reconsideration of Romanticism with the diminishment of selfhood and breakdown of order in his poetry; while <b>David</b> <b>Jones's</b> 'The Anathemata' employs the scope of modernist poetics to understand the prehistoric climate change that enabled the emergence of civilisation. By being conscious of modernist traditions, new work – as exemplified here by Jorie Graham's 'Sea Change' – acknowledges the role of human culture in creating the world imaginatively and phenomenally. As contemporary climate change poetry moves away from using culturally familiar elegiac modes, it benefits from a fuller range of resources to articulate the entanglement and hybridity of nature and culture in the twenty-first century...|$|R
