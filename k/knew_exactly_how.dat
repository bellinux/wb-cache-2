25|$|Barry's {{second term}} {{was much more}} {{troublesome}} than his first. Though Washington experienced a massive real estate boom that helped alleviate the city's fiscal problems for a time, government spending skyrocketed; the administration posted a fifth straight budget surplus, but the next year struggled with a $110 million deficit. Much of the disparity was caused by Barry's policy of combatting unemployment by creating government jobs; the city government's payrolls swelled so greatly that by 1986, nobody in the administration <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> many employees it had.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{calculation}} of glass properties {{is directly related to}} the founding of glass science. At the end of the 19th century the physicist Ernst Abbe developed equations that allow calculating the design of optimized optical microscopes in Jena, Germany, stimulated by co-operation with the optical workshop of Carl Zeiss. Before Ernst Abbe's time the building of microscopes was mainly a work of art and experienced craftsmanship, resulting in very expensive optical microscopes with variable quality. Now Ernst Abbe <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> to construct an excellent microscope, but unfortunately, the required lenses and prisms with specific ratios of refractive index and dispersion did not exist. Ernst Abbe was not able to find answers to his needs from glass artists and engineers; glass making was not based on science at this time.|$|E
25|$|Ellis {{started out}} in {{department}} store retailing in the Richmond, Virginia, area to gain experience in the fashion industry as a buyer and merchandiser at the department store Miller & Rhoads. While there, he was co-founder of Richmond retail shop A Sunny Day. He later joined the sportswear company John Meyer of Norwich in New York City. Eventually, in the mid-1970s, he was approached by his then employer, The Vera Companies, famous for their polyester double-knit pantsuits, to design a fashion collection for them. Soon after that, Ellis presented his first women's sportswear line, called Portfolio, in November 1976. Although he could not sketch, he <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> the industry worked and proved a master of innovative ideas who created 'new classics' that American women longed for at the time.|$|E

500|$|As Lear explains, Potter titled The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden {{and sent}} it to publishers, but [...] "her {{manuscript}} was returned... including Frederick Warne & Co.... who nearly a decade earlier had shown some interest in her artwork. Some publishers wanted a shorter book, others a longer one. But most wanted coloured illustrations which by 1900 were both popular and affordable". [...] The several rejections were frustrating to Potter, who <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> her book should look (she had adopted the format and style of Helen Bannerman's Little Black Sambo) [...] "and how much it should cost". She decided to publish the book herself, and on 16 December 1901 the first 250 copies of her privately printed The Tale of Peter Rabbit were [...] "ready for distribution to family and friends".|$|E
500|$|Over 2,200 {{people were}} needed to provide all the {{services}} for the press, officials and athletes at the Games. [...] These services included sanitation, security, and care of the venues. [...] Accommodating the influx of people into St. Moritz was a difficult task for the organizing committee. [...] It was complicated by the mountainous region in which the community was situated. [...] A massive project to improve the village's transportation infrastructure had to be completed prior to the Games. [...] This included building and widening roads for vehicular traffic. [...] Several train stations were built to accommodate the increased demands for public transit. [...] They also had to increase {{the capacity of the}} city's sewers. [...] All of the projects had to be approved by the Swiss government, and justified by its impact on the success of the Games. [...] To aid the organizing committee the IOC demanded that all participating nations provide lists of their athletes several months prior to the Games. [...] Consequently, the Swiss <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> many athletes and officials to plan for.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Imogen {{had visited}} Dartington Hall, a {{progressive}} school and crafts community near Totnes in Devon, {{which had been}} founded in 1925 by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst. [...] In 1941–42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942, while recuperating there, she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, [...] "the {{sort of thing that}} your father did in the old days at Morley College". Beginning in 1943, Imogen established [...] a one-year [...] course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Imogen's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: [...] "Hardly any of us could play... However bad we were, we went on". Imogen's teaching methods, heavily based on [...] "learning by doing" [...] and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Imogen at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: [...] "She <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how,</b> and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't be long before... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank".|$|E

2500|$|So Sparks {{returned}} to Nights in Rodanthe: [...] "My mind then {{returned to}} the story I'd been thinking about, and suddenly everything began to click. Within days, I suddenly <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> to tell the story. I knew the characters, the setting, and especially and most importantly, the 'conflict' that would keep the characters apart." [...] Sparks started writing the novel in December 2001. He finished the draft in February 2002, and editing continued until April of the same year.|$|E
2500|$|Brown had a {{reputation}} in the Assembly {{for his ability to}} manage people. Brown attained the vote of Doris Allen by treating her with the respect she thought she deserved. Republican State Senator Ken Maddy of Fresno noted Brown’s ability to “size up the situation and create, sometimes on the spot, a winning strategy.” According to Hobson, [...] "He was a brilliant day care operator. ... He <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> to hold the hand of his Assembly members. He dominated California politics like no other politician {{in the history of the}} state".|$|E
2500|$|Java (November 27, 1966) – Two tube-like Muppets (which were {{designed}} by Frank Oz) dance to the Al Hirt song [...] "Java." [...] Jim Henson and Frank Oz performed the two puppets and the explosion that provides the punchline was achieved by Jerry Juhl shooting off a fire extinguisher. It {{should be noted that}} as the three of them prepared to go onstage that night right before Ed Sullivan introduced them, Jerry Juhl suddenly realized that he left the fire extinguisher in their dressing room which was up on the second floor. Jerry Juhl raced to the elevator hearing the [...] "Java" [...] music through the speakers in the elevator so he <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> much time he had left until it was too late. Jerry Juhl managed to grab the fire extinguisher, run back to the elevator, and make the trip back down to the stage {{just in time for the}} climax. This sketch was reprised on May 26, 1968. The act even was done on Stuffed and Unstrung (an evolved counterpart of Puppet Up!).|$|E

2500|$|DeLonge {{first began}} skateboarding {{in the third}} grade, which would consume much his {{activity}} outside of school. [...] "I lived, ate, and breathed skateboarding. All I did all day long was skateboard. It was all I cared about," [...] he later remarked. He and friends would begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the other half, intermittently pulling pranks on people in the process. As such, he was an average student: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> hard I had to work in school. As long as I got that C, I wouldn't try one minute extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and music." [...] His parents were constantly fighting in his formative years, culminating in a divorce when DeLonge was 18. [...] Shortly thereafter, his mother lost her job. DeLonge promptly moved out, feeling as though he needed to start his life. His brother was also away {{at that time in}} the United States Army, and his departure affected his family. [...] "My mom and sister were left asking, 'What happened to our family?'".|$|E
