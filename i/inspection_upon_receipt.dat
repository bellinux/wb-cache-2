5000|$|During the transisiton from F-100 to A-7D {{training}} in 1978, the squadron became a checkout and modification organization for new A-7D aircraft being produced by LTV. [...] These new aircraft were produced {{due to a}} Congressional mandate to maintain the A-7D production line in Dallas, and the new aircraft were flown to Tucson for acceptance <b>inspection.</b> <b>Upon</b> <b>receipt</b> of the aircraft, the aircraft would be fully inspected and all discrepancies noted and repaired, being brought up to ANG standards. It would actually take {{about five or six}} months for the squadron to fly a series of check flights and work all the kinks out of the aircraft. Once completed, the squadron would transfer the aircraft to its assigned ANG squadron around the United States. [...] Between 1978 and 1980 a total of 24 new A-7D aircraft were received, of which the squadron increased in size from 12 to a total of 24 aircraft. Because the unit was a training school, its aircraft were flown much heavily than other ANG squadrons which were also more demanding and stressful on the airframes. In order to keep the maximum number of aircraft fully operational, many aircraft were transferred to Tucson from other squadrons and the training aircraft in Tucson were sent to other units to insure all aircraft did not have excessive hours or stress on them.In 1981, the squadron began receiving new A-7K a twin-seat dual-control trainer for the A-7D from LTV. The A-7K was a fully combat-capable aircraft and the squadron continued its acceptance inspection mission as well as its training mission. Eventually 20 A-7K aircraft were added to the squadron, along with its A-7Ds. The last of the A-7Ks were received in 1983, and with the shutdown of the assembly line in Dallas, the inspection and acceptance mission came to a close. The unit received its third Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for this and began another dimension in {{training in}} 1983 when the unit added the A-7 Fighter Weapons School, which replaced the F-100 FWS that was closed in 1978. [...] In 1984, the 195th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron was activated as a 2nd RTU.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{contract}} design {{problem of a}} producer when he purchases parts from a supplier, and there is incomplete information regarding {{the quality of the}} parts. This is the first game-theoretic model of quality control that captures this informational asymmetry. We focus on two compensation schemes embedded in the contract, namely, price rebate (when <b>inspection</b> is done <b>upon</b> <b>receipt</b> of the parts) and warranty. We show that when a full-price rebate is not possible and the producer and the supplier have to share the damage costs, an optimal contract is such that the supplier compensates the producer by the same amount, regardless of his quality type. However, a supplier with low quality {{is more likely to be}} offered a contract with an inspection scheme, while a supplier with high quality is constrained with a warranty scheme. We also show that when the producer need not share the cost in exactly one of the compensation schemes, he may still offer the other compensation scheme to a supplier type depending on the relative costs involved, the maximum compensation cost acceptable by all supplier types, and his ex ante beliefs about the quality level of the supplier.
