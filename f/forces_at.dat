30|$|In model Im 67 (Fig.  8 a), the occlusal <b>force</b> <b>at</b> the premolars and the TMJ on {{the defect}} side {{was smaller than}} that in model MT 67 (shown in Fig.  8 e). The occlusal <b>force</b> <b>at</b> the second premolar and TMJ in model Im 67 was 9.7 – 18.3 and 23.7 – 134.3  N, respectively. Compared with model MT 67, the occlusal <b>force</b> <b>at</b> the second premolar and left TMJ in model Im 67 was reduced by 0.005 – 0.5 -fold and 0.6 – 0.9 -fold, respectively. Under loads 100 and 200  N, the occlusal <b>force</b> <b>at</b> the {{implants}} was slightly smaller than that on the natural dentition side. Under load 800  N, the occlusal <b>force</b> <b>at</b> {{the first and second}} molars was 122.7 and 224.9  N, respectively. The occlusal <b>force</b> <b>at</b> the implants was slightly larger than that at natural teeth on the contralateral side. However, occlusal force distribution in model Im 67 was considered to be almost symmetrical.|$|R
30|$|In model Im 456 (Fig.  8 d), under loads 100 and 200  N, the occlusal <b>force</b> <b>at</b> the premolars on {{the defect}} side {{was larger than}} that in model Im 4567 (shown in Fig.  8 c). The occlusal force was also larger than that in model MT 7 (shown in Fig.  6 f).

Forces attacking Gold faced elements of the German 352nd Infantry Division and German 716th Infantry Division. About 2,000 men were stationed in the immediate area.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the effect of two different type of stitches viz., lockstitch and chainstitch at the seat seam of trouser for military armed forces has been reported. Performance of chainstitched seam is found to be much better as regards lower value of <b>force</b> <b>at</b> low level of strain, higher value of <b>force</b> <b>at</b> break, strain at break and work of rapture. In general with the change in thread linear density, greater improvement in seam strength, seam strain at break and work up to fracture are obtained in case of chainstitched seam. On laundering, in general <b>force</b> <b>at</b> small strain and <b>force</b> <b>at</b> break increases, the change being more in case of lockstitched fabric.
