50|$|While no {{official}} <b>engineering</b> <b>standard</b> covers the process or format of tolerance analysis and stackups, these are essential components of good product design. Tolerance stackups {{should be used}} {{as part of the}} mechanical design process, both as a predictive and a problem-solving tool. The methods used to conduct a tolerance stackup depend somewhat upon the engineering dimensioning and tolerancing standards that are referenced in the engineering documentation, such as American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Y14.5, ASME Y14.41, or the relevant ISO dimensioning and tolerancing standards. Understanding the tolerances, concepts and boundaries created by these standards is vital to performing accurate calculations.|$|E

The previously accepted standard MIL STD 499A (1969) was cancelled after a memo from SECDEF prohibited the use of most United States Military Standards without a waiver. The first edition was issued on 1 November 2002. Stuart Arnold was the editor and Harold Lawson was the architect of the standard. In 2004 this standard was adopted as IEEE 15288. ISO/IEC 15288 has been updated 1 February 2008 as well as on 15 May 2015.|$|E

The story portrays a police state where all technological innovation is controlled by the government, the only scenario in which Doctorow considered a universal, unquestioned application of a standard as strict as the Three Laws to be realistic. In the story, Asenion robots created by the U.S. Robotics corporation (here an arm of a fascist government) are shown to be clearly inferior to the freely evolving and developing robots of another nation where technological innovation is unconstrained by law.|$|E

5000|$|Jitong railway (...) is a 945 km railway in Inner Mongolia, China {{opened in}} 1995. Its start point is at Jining and ends at Tongliao. The Jitong railway {{is a joint}} venture between China Railways and the {{government}} of Inner Mongolia.Since Inner Mongolia was one of the poorer provinces of China in the early 1990s, the line was built with an eye towards reducing startup costs, with the intention of upgrading at a future date as funds became available. The tracks were built to a high <b>engineering</b> <b>standard,</b> featuring heavy rail, concrete crossties, and extensive use of tunnels and viaducts to reduce grades. In contrast, lower-cost anachronistic technologies were intentionally selected for cases where it was possible to upgrade incrementally: semaphore signaling, manned crossing gates, and steam engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{terrain is}} rugged {{and the road}} has not been built to any {{particular}} <b>engineering</b> <b>standard,</b> but is there to give maintenance vehicles access to the power pylons. The road {{is open to the}} public from 26 December until Easter Monday each year. When using a GPS, it may give Rainbow Road as the most direct link from Christchurch to the city of Nelson, as it is the shortest link, and this sometimes catches out tourists unaware of the conditions in New Zealand's back-country. Under good conditions, it takes a 4WD vehicle about three hours to drive the 112 km. Island Saddle is the highest point on the route at 1347 m, and this is New Zealand's highest public road. Part of the road crosses private land at the Rainbow Station, and the leaseholder charges an access fee of NZ$25 per 4WD, NZ$15 per motorbike, and NZ$2 per mountain bike. Access to the road outside of the season can be arranged through the farm manager at Rainbow Station.|$|E
50|$|Steel loses {{strength}} when heated sufficiently. The {{critical temperature}} of a steel member is the temperature {{at which it}} cannot safely support its load. Building codes and structural <b>engineering</b> <b>standard</b> practice defines different critical temperatures depending on the structural element type, configuration, orientation, and loading characteristics. The critical temperature is often considered the temperature at which its yield stress {{has been reduced to}} 60% of the room temperature yield stress. In order to determine the fire resistance rating of a steel member, accepted calculations practice can be used, or a fire test can be performed, the critical temperature of which is set by the standard accepted to the Authority Having Jurisdiction, such as a building code. In Japan, this is below 400 °C. In China, Europe and North America (e.g., ASTM E-119), this is approximately 1000-1300 °F (530-810 °C). The time it takes for the steel element that is being tested to reach the temperature set by the test standard determines the duration of the fire-resistance rating.Heat transfer to the steel can be slowed by the use of fireproofing materials, thus limiting steel temperature. Common fireproofing methods for structural steel include intumescent, endothermic, and plaster coatings as well as drywall, calcium silicate cladding, and mineral wool insulating blankets.|$|E

40|$|Different <b>Engineering</b> <b>standard</b> {{methods of}} measurement, {{developed}} in Africa throughout the last 30 years, {{are currently being}} used throughout the continent. Personal participation in various Civil Engineering projects in Africa {{have led to the}} belief that using different standard measuring systems leads to the loss of project time (all parties need to learn, understand and apply the system), differences in interpretation and opinions regarding the systems could leading to conflict between the parties, as well as the inflation of rates ? due to the contractor?s unfamiliarity with the system, and therefore covering himself for all eventualities. The research findings suggest firstly that quantity surveyors in Africa agree that one concise civil <b>engineering</b> <b>standard</b> method of measurement for Africa should be developed; secondly that they would use the system; and thirdly, that such a system should be incorporated into the Tertiary Institutions? curriculum. The following six measuring systems are currently being used in Africa; and they form the basis of this study: ? The Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors ? 2008 : Building and <b>Engineering</b> <b>Standard</b> Method of Measurement ? The Surveyors? Institute of Zambia ? 2010 : Standard Method of Measurement of Building Works in Zambia The Architectural Association of Kenya, Quantity Surveyors? Chapter ? 2008 : Standard Method of Measurement of the Building and Associated Civil Works for Eastern Africa ? The South African Bureau of Standards ? 1986 : South African Bureau of Standards Standardized Specifications for Civil Engineering Construction ? The South African Bureau of Standards and Anglo?American ? 2004 : South African Bureau of Standards Standardized Specifications for Civil Engineering Construction with Anglo?American Amendments ? Joint Division of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the South African Institution of Civil Engineering ? 2011 : Civil <b>Engineering</b> <b>Standard</b> Method of Measurement ? Southern African Edition. The study resulted in a fully integrated and comprehensive Civil <b>Engineering</b> <b>Standard</b> System of Measuring for Africa, confined to the following trades: ?
