30|$|Another {{range of}} options enables direct human food {{production}} from tree-related biomass, such as extracting sustenance from leaves (for example, pine needle tea) (Kim and Chung 2000), and mushrooms growing on woody residues. The waste from this process can be fed to cellulose digesting animals (Spinosa 2008). Another alternative direct mechanism for providing human food from conventionally non-food sources is utilizing current cellulosic biofuel techniques. For example, enzymes could be used on agricultural residues to create human <b>edible</b> <b>sugars</b> (Langan et al. 2011). With the reclamation of nutrients from excrement and food waste and the possible injection of new nutrients into the food system from leaf litter, for example, the need for artificial fertilizer would fall. This would enable macronutrient (for example, nitrogen) fertilization of part of the ocean, which could allow significant ramping of fish harvesting (Denkenberger and Pearce 2015). Many of these alternate food sources may be valuable even outside a catastrophe for reducing the world’s current undersupply of food (FAO 2015) to the poorest people (Gwatkin 1980).|$|R

30|$|Rising oil prices, {{unstable}} {{supply and}} the demand for sustainable environmental friendly energy sources have increased the interest in research and development of biomass resources for fuels such as bio-ethanol. Carbohydrates are a natural resource commonly available as lignocellulosic biomass that can be hydrolyzed into sugars to be further converted via fermentative or thermochemical processes into useful products (Zhang 2008; Arora et al. 2015). Among the important products that can be derived are ethanol (cellulosic), butanol and similar advanced fuels, platform chemicals such as acetone, furfural, levulinic acid, gamma valerolactone and bioplastics such as polyhydroxy butyrates or valerates (Zhang 2008; Singh et al. 2008; Galbe and Zacchi 2002; Bhuwal et al. 2014). These products are a substitute for fossil fuels or starch-based carbohydrates, thus providing an alternate sustainable resource. The plastics are biodegradable and thus are beneficial to the environment in comparison to petrochemicals and their derivatives (Kale et al. 2007). Cellulosic biomass is a promising material for bio-energy that avoids the usage of corn and other food grains and thus avoids the necessity of competing with <b>edible</b> <b>sugars.</b> One good source of cellulosic biomass is the waste rejects from recycled linerboard mills which manufacture packaging paper from old corrugated containerboard (OCC).|$|R

Sweet sorghums are tall and produce high biomass in addition to sugar. Little has been documented about the genetic relationships and diversity within sweet sorghums and how sweet sorghums relate to grain sorghum racial types. In this study, a diverse panel of 125 sorghums (mostly sweet) was successfully genotyped with 47 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 322 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using both distance-based and model-based methods, we identified three main genetic groupings of sweet sorghums. Based on observed phenotypes and known origins we classified the three groups as historical and modern syrup, modern sugar/energy types, and amber types. Using SSR markers also scored in an available large grain sorghum germplasm panel, we found that these three sweet groupings clustered with kafir/bicolor, caudatum, and bicolor types, respectively. Using the information on population structure and relatedness, association mapping was performed for height and stem sugar (brix) traits. Three significant associations for height were detected. Two of these, on chromosomes 9 and 6, support published QTL studies. One significant association for brix, on chromosome 1, 12 kb from a glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase homolog, was detected...|$|R

Per capita consumption of grains, fibers, <b>edible</b> oil, <b>sugar,</b> fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, and dairy products remained low. The value of goods generated by the agricultural sector has grown, but not as fast as output generated by other sectors in the economy.

This ratio dropped to 41 percent by 1955, declined to 31 percent by 1965, and fell another few percentage points in 1975 to 25 percent.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{discusses the}} state of the art and the challenges in producing biofuels, as well as the need to develop chemical conversion processes of CO 2 in Brazil. Biofuels are sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels for providing energy, whilst minimizing the effects of CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere. Ethanol from fermentation of simple sugars and biodiesel produced from oils and fats are the first-generation of biofuels available in the country. However, they are preferentially produced from <b>edible</b> feedstocks (<b>sugar</b> cane and vegetable oils), which limits the expansion of national production. In addition, environmental issues, as well as political and societal pressures, have promoted the development of 2 nd and 3 rd generation biofuels. These biofuels are based on lignocellulosic biomass from agricultural waste and wood processing, and on algae, respectively. Cellulosic ethanol, from fermentation of cellulose-derived sugars, and hydrocarbons in the range of liquid fuels (gasoline, jet, and diesel fuels) produced through thermochemical conversion processes are considered biofuels of the new generation. Nevertheless, the available 2 nd and 3 rd generation biofuels, and those under development, have to be subsidized for inclusion in the consumer market. Therefore, one of the greatest challenges in the biofuels area is their competitive large-scale production in relation to fossil fuels. Owing to this, fossil fuels, based on petroleum, coal and natural gas, will be around for many years to come. Thus, it is necessary to utilize the inevitable CO 2 released by the combustion processes in a rational and economical way. Chemical transformation processes of CO 2 into methanol, hydrocarbons and organic carbonates are attractive and relatively easy to implement in the short-to-medium terms. However, the low reactivity of CO 2 and the thermodynamic limitations in terms of conversion and yield of products remain challenges to be overcome in the development of sustainable CO 2 conversion processes...|$|R
