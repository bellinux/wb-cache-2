5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and <b>eosin,</b> and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E

25|$|Long-term {{administration}} of spironolactone gives the histologic characteristic of spironolactone {{bodies in the}} adrenal cortex. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and <b>eosin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Histopathology - the {{microscopic}} examination of stained tissue sections using histological techniques. The standard stains are haematoxylin and <b>eosin,</b> {{but many others}} exist. The use of haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides to provide specific diagnoses based on morphology {{is considered to be}} the core skill of anatomic pathology. The science of staining tissues sections is called histochemistry.|$|E
25|$|MacConkey agar is a {{selective}} and differential medium used {{to differentiate between}} Gram-negative bacteria while inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. The addition of bile salts and crystal violet to the agar inhibits the growth of most Gram-positive bacteria, making MacConkey agar selective. Lactose and neutral red are added to differentiate the lactose fermenters, which form pink colonies, from lactose nonfermenters that form clear colonies. An alternative medium, <b>eosin</b> methylene blue serves a similar purpose.|$|E
25|$|C-banding: Giemsa binds to {{constitutive}} heterochromatin, so it stains centromeres.The name {{is derived}} from centromeric or constitutive heterochromatin. The preparations undergo alkaline denaturation prior to staining leading to an almost complete depurination of the DNA. After washing the probe the remaining DNA is renatured again and stained with Giemsa solution consisting of methylene azure, methylene violet, methylene blue, and <b>eosin.</b> Heterochromatin binds {{a lot of the}} dye, {{while the rest of the}} chromosomes absorb only little of it. The C-bonding proved to be especially well-suited for the characterization of plant chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|They {{primarily}} {{deal with}} parasitic infections. Eosinophils {{are also the}} predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions. The most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma, hay fever, and hives; and also parasitic infections. They secrete chemicals that destroy these large parasites, such as hook worms and tapeworms, that are too big for any one WBC to phagocytize. In general, their nucleus is bi-lobed. The lobes are connected by a thin strand. The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with <b>eosin</b> staining.|$|E
25|$|Sentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy is often performed, {{especially}} for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs. A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine hematoxylin and <b>eosin</b> (H) and immunoperoxidase staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had {{a small number of}} positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.|$|E
500|$|The word {{esophagus}} (British English: oesophagus), {{comes from}} the [...] (oisophagos) meaning gullet. It derives from two roots [...] (<b>eosin)</b> to carry and (phagos) to eat. The {{use of the word}} oesophagus, has been documented in anatomical literature since at least the time of Hippocrates, who noted that [...] "the oesophagus... receives the greatest amount of what we consume." [...] Its existence in other animals and its relationship with the stomach was documented by the Roman naturalist [...] Pliny the Elder (AD23–AD79), and the peristaltic contractions of the esophagus have been documented since at least the time of Galen.|$|E
500|$|In 1876, {{methylene}} blue was synthesized by German chemist Heinrich Caro. Paul Ehrlich in 1880 described {{the use of}} [...] "neutral" [...] dyes – mixtures of acidic and basic dyes for the differentiation of cells in peripheral blood smears. In 1891 Ernst Malachowski and Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky independently developed techniques using a mixture of <b>Eosin</b> Y and modified {{methylene blue}} (methylene azure) that produced a surprising hue unattributable to either staining component: a shade of purple. Malachowski used alkali-treated methylene blue solutions and Romanowsky used methylene blue solutions which were molded or aged. This new method differentiated blood cells and demonstrated the nuclei of malarial parasites. Malachowski's staining technique {{was one of the}} most significant technical advances in the history of malaria.|$|E
2500|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} by biopsy of {{an infected}} muscle. Sarcocysts are identifiable with [...] hematoxylin and <b>eosin.</b> The PAS stain {{may be helpful}} but variable uptake of stain is common. Along with the sarcocysts inflammatory cells may be found. Other findings include myositis, myonecrosis, perivascular and interstitial inflammation, vasculitis and eosinophilic myositis.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{staining}} techniques include acid-fast staining, {{which will}} stain the oocysts red. [...] One type of acid-fast stain is the Kinyoun stain. [...] Giemsa staining {{can also be}} performed. [...] Part of the small intestine can be stained with hematoxylin and <b>eosin</b> (H & E), which will show oocysts attached to the epithelial cells.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recommended}} histologic grading schema for RCC is the Fuhrman system (1982), {{which is}} an assessment based on the microscopic morphology of a neoplasm with haematoxylin and <b>eosin</b> (H staining). This system categorises renal cell carcinoma with grades 1, 2, 3, 4 based on nuclear characteristics. The details of the Fuhrman grading system for RCC are shown below: ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Ehrlich {{had used}} {{mixtures}} of acidic and basic dyes {{for this purpose}} in 1879: e.g. fuchsine (acid dye) and methylene blue (basic dye). In 1891, Romanowsky developed techniques using a mixture of <b>eosin</b> Y and modified methylene blue that produced a surprising hue unattributable to either staining component: a beautiful, distinctive shade of purple. Requirement for the occurrence of the Romanowsky-Giemsa effect are: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{demethylation}} of {{methylene blue}} {{in aqueous solution}} using heat and alkali produces a mixture of azure A, azure B, methylene violet, and methylene blue. <b>Eosin</b> Y is then added to produce a [...] "neutral" [...] dye. The precipitate is then dissolved {{in a mixture of}} methanol and glycerol to form a stock solution; this is diluted with water or an aqueous buffer to form a 'working' solution that is used in the staining of pathology specimens. The 'working' solution is stable for 3 hours.|$|E
2500|$|When {{methylene}} blue is [...] "polychromed" [...] (oxidized in solution or [...] "ripened" [...] by fungal metabolism, as originally {{noted in the}} thesis of Dr. D. L. Romanowsky in 1890s), it gets serially demethylated and forms all the tri-, di-, mono- and non-methyl intermediates, which are Azure B, Azure A, Azure C, and thionine, respectively. This {{is the basis of}} the basophilic part of the spectrum of Romanowski-Giemsa effect. If only synthetic Azure B and <b>Eosin</b> Y is used, it may serve as a standardized Giemsa stain; but, without {{methylene blue}}, the normal neutrophilic granules tend to overstain and look like toxic granules. On the other hand, if methylene blue is used it might help to give the normal look of neutrophil granules and may also enhance the staining of nucleoli and polychromatophilic RBCs (reticulocytes).|$|E
5000|$|As {{can be seen}} in Figure 2, Liang et al. {{proposed}} that <b>eosin</b> radicals (<b>Eosin</b> [...] ) react with oxygen, regenerating <b>Eosin</b> Y. In this mechanism, when the ground state of <b>eosin</b> (<b>Eosin</b> Y) absorbs visible light, the <b>eosin</b> becomes excited (<b>Eosin</b> Y*). Then, it is reduced—given one electron—through a reaction with a tertiary amine while generating the amine radical and the <b>eosin</b> radical. This <b>eosin</b> radical is oxidized by the reaction with oxygen, so <b>Eosin</b> Y can be regenerated. The regeneration of <b>eosin</b> makes the PBA efficient because oxygen is consumed through this photocatalytic cycle of <b>Eosin</b> Y, so polymerization can take place in an ambient environment even if there is only a few micromolar concentration of <b>Eosin</b> Y.|$|E
50|$|There are {{actually}} two very closely related compounds {{commonly referred to}} as <b>eosin.</b> Most often used is <b>Eosin</b> Y (also known as <b>eosin</b> Y ws, <b>eosin</b> yellowish, Acid Red 87, C.I. 45380, bromoeosine, bromofluoresceic acid, D&C Red No. 22); it has a very slightly yellowish cast. The other <b>eosin</b> compound is <b>eosin</b> B (<b>eosin</b> bluish, Acid Red 91, C.I. 45400, Saffrosine, <b>Eosin</b> Scarlet, or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast. The two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is a matter of preference and tradition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eosin</b> is {{most often}} used as a counterstain to haematoxylin, imparting a pink or red colour to cytoplasmic material, cell membranes, and some {{extracellular}} structures. It also imparts a strong red colour to red blood cells. <b>Eosin</b> may {{also be used as}} a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining, and in many other protocols.

50|$|Many Zsolnay {{ceramics}} {{are noted}} {{for the use}} of the <b>eosin</b> process that was introduced in 1893. The process results in a light red iridescence of the first prepared hue, hence the term <b>eosin</b> (Greek eos, flush of dawn). Different <b>eosin</b> colours and processes were developed over time. The eosin-based iridescence became a favourite of art nouveau and Jugendstil artists, among them Sándor Apáti Abt, Lajos Mack, Géza Nikelszky, and József Rippl-Rónai.|$|E
50|$|Haematoxylin (hematoxylin in North America) is {{a nuclear}} stain. Used with a mordant, {{haematoxylin}} stains nuclei blue-violet or brown. It {{is most often}} used with <b>eosin</b> in H&E (haematoxylin and <b>eosin)</b> staining—one {{of the most common}} procedures in histology.|$|E
50|$|Haematoxylin and <b>eosin</b> {{staining}} protocol is used {{frequently in}} histology to examine thin sections of tissue. Haematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue, while <b>eosin</b> stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red. <b>Eosin</b> is strongly absorbed by {{red blood cells}}, colouring them bright red. In a skilfully made H & E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) acquire different shades of pink. When the staining is done by a machine, the subtle differences in eosinophilia are often lost. Hematoxylin stains the cell nucleus and other acidic structures (such as RNA-rich portions of the cytoplasm and the matrix of hyaline cartilage) blue. In contrast, <b>eosin</b> stains the cytoplasm and collagen pink.|$|E
5000|$|Hematoxylin and <b>eosin</b> stain or {{haematoxylin}} and <b>eosin</b> stain (H&E stain or HE stain) {{is one of}} {{the principal}} stains in histology.
