40|$|To {{handle a}} great demand for biomass, {{alternative}} biomasses beyond stem wood are being {{introduced into the}} solid fuel combustion market, fuels with generally higher (> 0, 5 wt-%) ash content and different fuel ash compositions compared to stem wood, such as forest residue, bark, grass and straw. Unfortunately, combustion of these alternative fuels often causes more ash related problems such as fouling, slagging and higher particle emissions compared to combustion of stem wood. Many research {{studies have been conducted}} regarding ash melting and ash sintering in biomass combustion. However, literature discussing slagging of biomass ash is rather scarce, especially relating to <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion.</b> The majority of the biomass fuels available on the market today are phosphorus-poor and this thesis emanates from those. The overall objective was to obtain knowledge of slag formation in fixed-bed combustion of phosphorus-poor biomass, based on bench- and full-scale experiments, chemical analysis of produced ash fractions, chemical equilibrium calculations, viscosity estimations and statistical evaluations.   This thesis investigates slagging of [phosphorus-poor] biomass in <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion.</b> 85 fuels and 10 different burner/boiler technologies were utilized. The results in this thesis highlight the importance of the ash forming elements Si, Ca, K and Alin the slag formation process in <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> of phosphorus-poor biomass. Increased Ca/Si ratios in the fuel reduce slag formation due to formation of more temperature stable phases, i. e. Ca/Mg-oxides and/or formation of carbonate melts with lower viscosity (not sticky) that are less prone to forming slag. A high Al/Si ratio increases the possibility of forming solid and thermally stable K−Al silicates that can reduce slag formation.   The fraction of ash melt, along with viscosity, are critical for slag formation and these parameters vary between different fuels. Four classes were defined according to their slagging potential; 1) No slag: fuel composition and the bottom ash contains low Si and K contents and higher Ca content. Fuel examples: non-contaminated stem- and pulpwood/energy wood, 2) Minor slagging tendency: fuel compositions show increased Si compared to non-slagging fuels and the bottom ash contains lower Ca, but increased Si content and approximately unchanged K content compared to the former category. Fuel examples: stem wood, bark and logging residue with increased Si-content due to light contamination. 3) Moderate slagging tendency: fuel composition contains further increased Si content. Increased share of formed silicate melt and higher viscosity (more sticky) compared to minor slagging fuels. Fuel examples: mostly contaminated woody fuels and grass and straws with relatively high amount of Ca. and 4) Major slagging tendency: Fuel composition contains high Si and K content. Sticky K-silicates causes major increase in slagging tendency. Fuel examples: different types of grass and straw fuels.   The burner/boiler technology can affect whether slagging will induce major problems in the burner or not. However, long residence times and high temperatures for the combustion residues in the hot part of the fuel bed are technical prerequisite for increased slag formation.   This thesis developed two qualitative fuel indices for predicting slagging in <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> of phosphorus-poor biofuels – one index for fraction of fuel ash that forms slag and one index for sintering category of the formed slag. Both novel indices deliver acceptable results and are more reliable than previous indices found in the literature. Importantly, the fraction of fuel ash that forms slag index outperforms the sintering category for qualitative prediction of the problematic slagging potential of a certain fuel. Additional work is needed to further widen the compositional range as well as to fine tune the indices’ boundaries...|$|E

40|$|Biomass is an {{important}} new energy source because it is indigenous to {{every part of the}} world, inexpensive and renewable. Malaysia’s ability to produce and consistently export a large quantity of high quality palm oil has made it one of the major vegetable oil exporters in the world. By-products and waste from the palm oil mills are generated in significant amounts and mainly consist of empty fruit bunches, oil palm stone, oil palm shell, palm kernel cake and palm oil mill effluent. Some of this waste is currently used as fuel for boilers with low energy efficiency, as a soil conditioner, or in furniture making. There is a significant interest in recovering energy from oil palm shells and extensive research has been carried out in this area in other studies. However, research on energy production from oil palm stone (OPS) and palm kernel cake (PKC) is very limited. Waste from the oil palm industry, especially OPS and PKC, is abundant and could help to meet the energy demand if properly managed. The main objective of this PhD study was to investigate the main characteristics of the thermo-chemical conversion of OPS and PKC. A series of combustion and pyrolysis tests were carried out using OPS and PKC as the raw materials in fixed bed and pilot-scale fluidised bed reactors. In addition, the FLIC modelling code was used to predict key parameters including theoretical solid temperature and gas composition, and to validate the experimental results from <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> tests. Pelletisation was also carried out on PKC due to the loose nature and small size of the particles. In the series of pyrolysis tests using OPS and PKC carried out in a fixed bed reactor, the effects of heating rate at the temperature of 700 °C on the yields and properties of the pyrolysis products were investigated. The calorific values of the chars obtained from the OPS and PKC were approximately 28 MJ/kg. The properties of the chars produced were similar to bituminous coal in terms of their calorific value and carbon content. The pyrolysis liquids obtained from the OPS and PKC had calorific values of 21 - 38 MJ/kg. The pyrolysis liquids obtained from OPS were {{in the form of a}} homogeneous liquid, whilst that derived from PKC contained more than half as an aqueous fraction. The results from the <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> tests showed that the burning rates increased with an increase in the air flow rate. In addition, results from the FLIC code used to simulate the <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> of the oil palm stone showed good agreement with the experimental data in terms of predicting the dynamic temperature profiles along the bed height and the flue gas composition. The effect of primary air flowrate and initial bed temperature were the main parameters investigated in the pilot-scale fluidised bed combustion tests. Both the internal temperature and the surface temperature were found to decrease as the primary air flowrate increased. In all tests CO emissions were less than 0. 2...|$|E

The fuel was doped with a cerium-based catalyst to {{promote oxidation of the}} soot bed. The soots {{were subjected to}} combustion testing in a DTG under both temperature ramping and isothermal conditions, and under temperature ramping in a small <b>fixed</b> <b>bed.</b> The <b>combustion</b> gas was 10 % oxygen in nitrogen, which was supplemented {{in the case of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> with other gases found in diesel exhausts. The temperatures of initiation of combustion Tin were measured in the DTG and in the <b>fixed</b> <b>bed.</b> The kinetic rates of oxidation were calculated from the DTG results taking into account the influence of oxygen transport. The effect of gas composition on ignition and burnout in the <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> was determined. Ignition did not occur in the DTG, but rather burning progressed steadily. There was a large increase in the kinetic rate constants with cerium present, but the activation energy was unchanged. There was no difference in rates between the two cerium additives. No consistent differences were observed between the combustion kinetics of soots generated under different engine conditions. At temperatures above 600 °C a decline in the catalytic effect of the doped samples appeared. In the <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> the catalysed samples tended to partly burn and then ignite and be totally consumed. The appearance of ignition was erratic with the addition of minor gases to the combustion gas. A simple combustion and heat transfer model was able to predict ignition temperatures.

40|$|Results from {{mathematical}} {{modeling of}} aerosol formation during combustion of woody biomass fuels {{were compared with}} results from particle size distribution (PSD) measurements at a pilot-scale biomass combustion unit with moving grate and flame tube boiler. The mathematical model is a plug flow model considering coagulation, nucleation, condensation, and particle deposition mechanisms (thermophoresis, particle diffusion, turbophoresis, and gravitational settling) of spherical particles as well as condensation of vapors on cooled boiler walls and a changing flue gas composition determined by equilibrium calculations. Additionally, the influence of kinetically limited homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions was {{taken into account in}} the case of sulfation reactions. To check the modeling results, investigations regarding PSDs and total aerosol mass loadings of the flue gas resulting from biomass combustion (beech chips, waste wood) were performed by measurements at a <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> biomass <b>combustion</b> unit (nominal boiler capacity: 440 kW).

40|$|The {{gasification}} and combustion of dry tree {{leaves and}} the cogasification of dry tree leaves soaking crude glycerol were studied experimentally. An updraft <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> gasification and <b>combustion</b> system was built. The operation {{was conducted at}} different air to fuel ratios. Results show more stable combustion and more effective heat transfer to furnace walls for the cases when tree leaves flakes are mixed with 20 percent (on mass basis) of crude glycerol, {{as compared with the}} case when only dry tree leaves are used as fuel. TGA analysis was also conducted for the two fuels used under both air and nitrogen environments. For the crude glycerol, four phases of pyrolysis and gasification were noticed under either of the two surrounding gaseous media (air or nitrogen). For the dry tree leaves, the pyrolysis under nitrogen shows only a simple smooth pyrolysis and gasification curve without showing the different distinct phases that were otherwise identified when the pyrolysis is conducted under air environment. Moreover, the air TGA results lead to more gasification due to the char oxidation at high temperatures. DTG results are also presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} using a porous media approximation, {{neglecting}} intraparticle gradients, for modeling <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> has been investigated. This {{has been done by}} comparing the results from a bed model using the porous media approximation with the results from the same model, where the intraparticle gradients have been taken into account by a two-dimensional particle model. The particle model provides information on the internal heating of the solid particles and the internal rate of drying and devolatilization. The surface temperature of the particles, given by the porous bed model, is the boundary condition for the particle model. Fuel particles of sizes between 5 and 40 mm, consisting of wood, and inlet gas velocities ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 2 m/s are used. For large bed particles there are considerable differences between the two modeling approaches in the rates of release of volatiles and moisture. The temperature profile in the bed is also affected. For the smaller bed particles in the size range investigated, the differences are small. However, the difference in ignition rate and maximum temperature are small even for the largest particles, compared to uncertainties in the models and scattering of experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Brazil {{is rated}} number four among the leading {{producers}} of raw cashew nut. As {{it is known}} its shell (CNS, i. e., the Cashew Nut Shell) comprises around 50 % {{of the weight of}} the raw nut, the kernel representing 25 % and the remaining 25 % consisting of the natural Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL), usually obtained during the cooking of the raw nuts and their kernel separation by roasting. Cashew nut production industries use its main waste, the CNS, as fuel, thus avoiding the need of sanitary landfill. Notice that burning is the best way of eliminating solid residues, for this process leads to a one thousand fold reduction in volume and, if performed under a well controlled mechanism, it may lead to a minimum of residues which may be extracted with the gaseous flow using cyclones and gas washing devices. This work discusses the use of a fluidized combustion chamber with air as its fluidizing agent (instead of sand), to properly burn the CNS. This technique has been shown to improve the overall combustion efficiency to 85 % as compared to values around 50 % achieved with the use of <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> chambers normally used to burn this fuel...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} numerical {{investigations and}} simulations of <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> of wood, models for predicting thermal radiative properties of particles and gases {{related to the}} combustion of wood, and a review of heat load calculations in gas turbines. All subjects have a common factor in thermal radiation. One 2 D and one 3 D model were considered for the <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion.</b> The introductory sensitivity analysis was performed {{in order to identify}} the significant parameters in a fixed bed combustor with updraft by using a two-dimensional CFD model with the computational domain treated as a one, i. e., bed and over fire air region were not separated. The numerical results of this 2 D analysis using a global chemistry model showed that the parameters with the greatest influence were: bed porosity, initial wood particle diameter, thermal dispersion, selected solving algorithm, and inlet velocity and temperature. The 2 D model showed promising for further development. The objectives of the 3 D model was to improve the radiative model and radiative property model used in the 3 D code, and to get more accurate predictions of the boundary conditions related to radiative heat transfer to the bed and the walls. The influence of the mean beam length was also of interest. In the 3 D model the interaction between turbulence and chemistry was modelled by using the eddy dissipation concept, and the bed was treated with a one-dimensional FG-DVC (Functional Group Depolymerization Vaporization Crosslinking) approach. The P 1 -approximation proved to be a useful model when the mean beam length is uncertain, such in boilers. It was found that approximately 2 % of the energy input to the boiler was radiated back to the bed. The purpose of studying radiative property models for gases and soot particles was to produce more computationally efficient models, with no loss in accuracy, useful for furnace calculations. For the gases the exponential wide band model is considered due to its favourable balance between computational speed and accuracy. The Mie theory, the theory of infinite circular cylinders and the RDG-PFA (Rayleigh Debye Gans Polydisperse Fractal Aggregates) theory were used for the soot particles. For the exponential wide band model polynomials of the band strength and line overlap parameter are presented. For the soot particles are correlations given for the effective (transport) parameters. Both the polynomials and the correlations provide a vast improvement in computational speed with almost no loss in accuracy. The objective of the review of heat loads in gas turbine combustors is to identify the present status in this area and to stress the shortcomings of the present models. This was mainly done by a literature survey. Most of the published work neglect soot radiation. A detailed CFD analysis of the combustion chamber is an attractive area of research...|$|E

40|$|The {{utilisation}} {{of energy}} in waste, Waste to Energy (WtE), has become increasingly important. Waste is a wide concept, and to focus, the feedstock dealt with here is mostly municipal solid waste. It is found that combustion in grate-fired furnaces {{is by far the}} most common mode of fuel conversion compared to fluidized beds and rotary furnaces. Combinations of pyrolysis in rotary furnace or gasification in fluidized or <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> with high-temperature <b>combustion</b> are applied particularly in Japan in systems whose purpose is to melt ashes and destroy dioxins. Recently, also in Japan more emphasis is put on WtE. In countries with high heat demand, WtE in the form of heat and power can be quite efficient even in simple grate-fired systems, whereas in warm regions only electricity is generated, and for this product the efficiency of boilers (the steam data) is limited by corrosion from the flue gas. However, combination of cleaned gas from gasification with combustion provides a means to enhance the efficiency of electricity production considerably. Finally, the impact of sorting on the properties of the waste to be fed to boilers or gasifiers is discussed. The description intends to be general, but examples are mostly taken from Europe...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{radiation}} is the dominating form of heat transfer in several combustion technologies that combust solid fuels, such as pulverized coal combustion and <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion.</b> The thermal radiation originates {{from the hot}} combustion gases and particles. For accurate modelling of thermal radiation in these environments {{the selection of the}} radiative transport model and radiative property model is important. Radiative property models for gases have received huge attention and several well documented models exist. For particles, soot has received considerable attention whereas other particles have not to a similar extent. The Planck mean coefficients are most commonly used to describe the radiative properties of the particles. For gases the Planck mean absorption coefficient is known to give large deviations from recognised exact models in predicting the radiative heat transfer. In this study the use of Planck mean coefficients for particles are investigated and compared to spectral models. Two particle mass size distributions of fly ash are used, representing biomass and coal combustion. The evaluation is conducted in several combustion-like test cases with both gases and particles. The evaluation shows that using Planck mean coefficients for particles, in combustion-like situations, can give large errors in predicting the radiative heat flux and especially the source term. A new weighted sum of grey gas approach is tested and evaluated. It includes both the particles and gases to better account for the non-greyness of the fly ash absorption coefficient...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> {{is common}} is small to medium scale heat {{production}} in grate furnaces and domestic boilers. Modelling of these fuel beds {{can give a}} better understanding of the conversion process inside them, and provide a tool for analyzing the performance of furnaces and problems related to the fuel bed. The complexity of the task is however significant and there are at present no models considering all phenomenon related to a bed in a grate furnace. To give reasonable computational times the models depend on simplifications. One simplification often used is the neglect of gradients within individual fuel particles. The influence of this approximation has been investigated in this work. A bed model and a single particle model are presented. The bed model is a one-dimensional model describing the conversion of a batch of biofuels ignited at the top while combustion air is fed from below. All conversion stages are considered; drying, devolatilisation, heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions. The particle model is two-dimensional and describes heating, drying and devolatilisation of a particle inside the bed. The surface temperature, given by a simulation with the bed model, is used as boundary condition. The bed and particle model are linked to each other to account for intra-particle gradients in the conversion of the fuel bed. The linking is carried out in an iterative manner in which the bed and particle model are run in series. The bed model provides the boundary condition for the particle model which in turn gives input parameters to the bed model to reflect the impact of intra-particle gradients. The influence of these gradients on ignition rate, temperature profiles and release of moisture and volatiles is investigated...|$|E
40|$|Under most {{conditions}} for reverse <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion,</b> transport effects {{of heat and}} gaseous species to andwithin fuel bed particles are important phenomena that limit the conversion rate. At present {{there is only one}} model that (1) claims to take transport limitations into account and (2) for which analytical solutions are given. Here, we present a numerical study of reverse combustion analysis {{on the basis of this}} model to show the effect of transport limitations on the reaction front structure and the consequences of these effects for the applicability and accuracy of the analytical solution procedure. A parameter set for coal combustion was used to perform the study. Results of numerical simulations indicate that the model solutions contain two limiting cases: kinetically controlled andmass-transfer-controlled conversion front structures. The kinetically controlled solutions consist of a preheat zone at the upstream side of the front and a thin reaction zone at the downstream side. The mass-transfer-controlled solutions consist of a wide reaction zone with a maximum source term situated at the upstream part of the front. The analytical solution to the model equations is shown to give correct predictions in the kinetically controlled caseonly. In the presence of mass transfer, the solution predicts the trend of decreasing front velocity with increasing transport limitations correctly but does not show the correct functional dependence on the parameter describing transport limitations. In addition, the predictions become highly inaccurate. This is related to the fact that the effect of transport limitations is not accounted for in the analytical solution method. Therefore, numerical methods should be used to obtain generally valid solutions...|$|E

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{a summary of}} eight papers dealing with {{experimental}} studies on bed agglomeration, slag formation, formation of deposits and fine particulate matter during combustion of phosphorus-rich biomass fuels. The experimental procedures were performed in a bubbling fluidized bed (5 kW), two fixed bed appliances (20 and 15 kW) and in a powder burner (150 kW). The phosphorus-rich fuels studied (separately and in mixtures with typical woody or straw biomass fuels) included; rapeseed meal, rapeseed cake, wheat distillers dried grain with solubles (DDGS) and, oat grains. Phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 (PA)), kaolin (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and calcite (CaCO 3) were used as fuel additives. The bed materials used in fluidized bed experiments included, quartz (SiO 2) and, olivine ((Mg, Fe) 2 SiO 4). During fluidized bed combustion of the phosphorus-rich fuels; i. e. DDGS, rapeseed meal and, rapeseed cake, ash particles rich in K-Ca/Mg-phosphates were formed during combustion, leading {{to the formation of}} non-continuous bed particle layers and subsequently bed agglomerates. For woody fuels; i. e. logging residues, willow and, bark, K-compounds in gas/liquid phase reacted with the quartz bed material, and formed an inner bed particle layer rich in K-silicates. The melting behaviour of this layer was found responsible for the initiation of the bed agglomeration. The addition of a high enough amount of phosphorus to the woody fuels (by co-firing with a P-rich fuel or adding PA additive), to convert the available fuel ash basic oxides into phosphates, reduced the amount of K available for the reaction with the quartz bed material particles, thus preventing the formation of an inner reaction bed particle layer. The phosphate-rich ash particles formed during combustion adhered and reacted with the bed material forming non-continuous coating layers, and subsequently agglomerates. During combustion of straw fuels (rich in Si and K), partially molten K-silicates formed non-continuous bed particle layers and subsequently bed agglomerates. Adding phosphorus to the last fuel, changed the composition of the bed ash from being dominated by low melting temperature K-silicates, to a system dominated by crystalline K-Ca-phosphates. The phosphate-silicate ash particles formed during the combustion were found responsible for the initiation of the bed agglomeration process. No significant difference in the bed agglomeration tendency/characteristics was found between olivine and quartz bed materials when combusting the phosphorus-rich DDGS fuel. The bed agglomeration mechanism for this fuel in quartz bed therefore seems to be directly applicable in olivine beds, and can be described as direct adhesion of bed particles by partially molten K-Mg-phosphates in both bed materials. In <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> of phosphorus-rich fuels, {{it was found that the}} relation between alkali and alkaline earth metals in the fuel ash has a key role in the slag formation. DDGS (rich in S, K, P and Mg), formed high amounts of molten material. Fuels with higher Ca content, i. e. rapeseed meal, showed low slagging tendency. The effect is attributed to the formation of low melting temperature K-Mg-phosphates, or more stable K-Ca/Mg-phosphates, respectively. The slag formed during combustion of woody and straw fuels, consisted mainly of K-rich silicates. The addition of phosphorus (by co-firing with a P-rich fuel or adding PA additive), promoted the formation of K-Ca/Mg-phosphates, thereby reducing the amount of K-rich-silicates formed during combustion. The formation and composition of deposits and fine particulate matter during combustion of phosphorus-rich fuels were also studied. In general, during fluidized bed and to a minor extent in <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion,</b> a reduction of fine particulate matter containing KCl as the main component was achieved by increasing the phosphorus content in woody or straw fuels. As a consequence, an increased amount of potassium was found in the coarse ash particle fractions principally as KMgPO 4, CaK 2 P 2 O 7, CaKPO 4, and KPO 3, while the levels of HCl and SO 2 in the flue gases increased. It was found that the relationship between alkali and alkaline-earth metals (i. e., (K + Na) /(Ca + Mg)) in the overall fuel ash composition must be considered, since both Ca and Mg are needed for the formation of refractory ternary phosphate phases containing K. The addition of excessive amounts of phosphorus to P-poor fuels with high (K + Na) /(Ca + Mg) molar ratio resulted in the formation of low melting temperature alkali-rich phosphates, which increased the bed agglomeration tendency and release of alkali and phosphorus from the bed. Powder combustion of the DDGS-fuel resulted in the formation of high amounts of fine particulate matter and deposits rich in KPO 3. During <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> of oat grains, slag rich in K-silicates and fine particulate matter rich in K-phosphates and KCl was formed. The result of using kaolin additive was that no slag was formed, and the effect on the formation of fine particulate matter was an increased content of condensed K-phosphates at the expense of K 2 SO 4 and KCl. Consequently, higher levels of HCl and SO 2 in the flue gases were obtained. The addition of calcite increased the amount of slag formed. Phosphorus was captured to a higher degree in the slag and bottom ash, compared to the combustion of pure oat. The molten phase formed during combustion consisted of both phosphates and silicates and probably had a low melting temperature. The effect of the calcite additive on the fine particle emissions was that the content of KPO 3 decreased considerably, while the content of K 2 SO 4 and KCl increased. Consequently, the levels of HCl and SO 2 in the flue-gas decreased. A general observation was that phosphorus is the controlling element in ash transformation reactions during biomass combustion because of the high stability of ternary phosphate compounds.

40|$|For a long {{heat and}} power {{production}} by combustion of solid fuels has time been an established technique. Environmental concern of emissions for NOx, SOx and other harmful species has caused an increasingly stricter legislation on the emission {{levels of the}} boilers. The rapidly growing awareness of climate changes due {{to the release of}} greenhouse-gases from the use of fossil fuels has resulted in additional challenges. To meet the emerging demands {{there is a need for}} further development of existing and new combustion techniques. The costs involved in building and development of boilers are large, and this makes tools supporting experience and test facilities extremely valuable for design and optimization of the equipment. One of these tools that have received attention the last decades is numerical simulation. Numerical modelling is intended to describe the physical mechanisms of the process and can give a fundamental understanding of the conversion in a boiler. To carry out the modelling a number of phenomena have to be considered: heat transfer, fluid dynamics, chemical reactions, and several other processes, dependent on application. As the computational cost often imposes a problem, approximations are introduced, and the related simplifications create uncertainties in the results. To obtain more reliable models, useful for quantitative predictions, more work is needed to evaluate the validity of model approximations. In this thesis, models in two areas, related to conversion of solid fuels, are investigated: <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> and gaseous radiation. Combustion in fixed beds is of importance in grate furnaces and wood-fired domestic boilers. Modelling of combustion in fixed beds has here been examined with a one-dimensional model. The main aspect studied is the influence of gradients within individual fuel particles. The results show that these gradients only have a small effect on the ignition rate and maximum temperatures, while the effect on the distribution of the release of volatiles in the bed is more significant. Also the sensitivity of the bed model to a number of parameters related to heat transfer and reaction rates has been investigated, showing some sensitivity of the model to heat- and mass-transfer coefficients and the mixing rate of gaseous species. The work on gas radiation includes a theoretical and numerical investigation of various types of models accounting for spectral properties of gases and their relation to the solution of the radiative transfer equation. Further, spectral models have been examined for oxy-fired conditions, i. e. combustion in pure oxygen and recycled flue gas, a proposed method in relation to CO 2 capture.

40|$|Coal {{energized}} the 19 "' century while oil {{worked for}} the 20 "' century. The question that remains pending is the future energy source. With the expanding population and growing demands from industrialization of countries such as India and China, total reliance on fossil fuel is not sustainable. The urgent need for a green and sustainable fuel prompted research into energy crops {{as an alternative to}} fossil fuels. There is a need to identify a suitable biomass species, which can provide high-energy outputs in order to replace conventional fossil fuel. The type of biomass used would then depend on the energy conversion process and the form in which the energy is required. Theoretical and experimental studies are also required to investigate the relevant parameters for future process optimisation. In response to this demand, {{the first part of this}} PhD study focuses on examining the parameters affecting the behaviour of solid bed combustion in a fixed bed reactor. Extensive experimental investigation aimed at studying the behaviour of various biomass materials in <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion</b> was successfully completed. The parameters investigated in this experimental programme were the influence of primary air flow rates and particle sizes. Complementary conversion technology studied in this PhD is the solid bed gasification in a counter-current fixed bed reactor. The proposed gasifier is part of a two-stage integrated unit that ultimately aims to utilise biomass fuel such as wood chips and fuel pellets derived from agricultural waste. Experimental work was carried out to increase the understanding of the underlying principle of the gasification process. Parameters studied were the steam/air ratio, reactor temperature and particle size. The results obtained from the combustion tests showed that the burning rate, ignition velocity and flue gas composition were governed by the primary air flow. Single stage combustion occurred at higher air flow rates. It was also observed that the ignition front speed was inversely proportional to the bulk density. Larger particles have a lower ignition front speed and burning rate. The average burning rates of herbaceous fuels were 3 - 4 times slower compared to other biomass materials such as willow wood, miscanthus pellets and RDF waste. Channelling occurred around the side wall of the reactor for small miscanthus pellets and at several locations in the bed for larger particles (35 mm cube). However, the observed channelling effect is severe in the test cases for uncut straw. The study of the gasification process showed that the hydrogen yield is influenced by the steam/air ratio, total flow rate of reactants, reactor temperature and particle size. The production of methane was negligible and no higher hydrocarbons were detected. A computational code known as the Fluid Dynamics of Incinerator Combustion code (FLIC) was used to interpret the experimental data. In this model, the initial solid waste undergoes step changes in the volume of its components consisting of moisture, volatile, fixed carbon, ash and internal pore space. The code was adapted to incorporate the steam-char reactions and gas phase reactions for the modelling of the gasification process. Comparison between the experimental results and model predictions showed good agreement. The combustion and gasification characteristics such as the burning rate, ignition rate, temperature profiles and gaseous emissions showed similar trends.

40|$|The porous media approximation, {{neglecting}} intra-particle gradients, is extensively used in modelling of <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>combustion.</b> The {{impact of}} this approximation has been investigated for a batch of biofuels ignited at the top, while combustion air is fed from below. The ignition {{is followed by a}} propagation of a reaction front downwards in the bed against the air flow. As the front passes, the fuel is heated, resulting in drying and devolatilisation. Volatile gases are ignited and together with the char formed they burn {{as long as there is}} oxygen available, providing heat for propagation of the front. In a bed, where an ignition front propagates counter-current to the air flow, a very steep temperature profile is created, in which the temperature rises from ambient to more than 1200 K. This means that there will be a significant difference in the surface temperature across the height of a single particle as the width of the reaction front in most cases is just a couple of particle diameters. The internal heating of a symmetric particle leads to a two-dimensional problem, since the temperature depends both on the distance from the surface of the particle and on the height in the bed. A bed model using the porous media approximation is implemented in this work. The fuel bed is assumed to consist of spherical fuel particles of the same size and the model treats the gas and solid phases with separate energy equations. Both drying and devolatilisation are modelled with Arrhenius expressions and char conversion is modelled with an effective reaction rate accounting for both diffusion and kinetics. The concentrations of gas species are described with their respective transport equation and the homogeneous reactions are taken as the minimum of a kinetic and a mixing rate. To close the system of equations the continuity equation for the gas phase is used. The result from the porous bed model has been compared with result from the same model, where the intra-particle gradients have been taken into account by a two-dimensional particle model, below referred to as the linked model. The particle model provides information on the internal heating of the solid particles and the internal rate of drying and devolatilisation. The surface temperature of the particles, given by the porous bed model, is the boundary condition for the particle model. The bed and particle model are run in series until a converged solution has been obtained. Fuel particles of sizes between 5 - 40 mm, consisting of wood, and inlet gas velocities ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 2 m/s are used. The results show that for a fuel bed consisting of large fuel particles (> 2 cm) the porous media approximation clearly influences the release of volatiles and moisture in the bed, but the temperature profile is also affected. The reaction front is wider when internal particle gradients are considered, and this leads to a less steep temperature profile and a release of volatiles in a larger section of the bed height. If gradients in the particles are neglected, volatiles and moisture are released with a high rate in a narrow part of the bed and the temperature profile is steeper. For small particles, < 0. 5 cm, there is no significant difference between the linked and the porous bed model. The two models show the same trends for different inlet gas flows and moisture contents of the fuel. The widening of the reaction front, caused by consideration of gradients in the particles has, however, only a minor influence on the overall conversion rate of the fuel and on the maximum temperatures of gas and solids. The relative differences in these parameters between the porous bed model and the linked bed model are not more than 15 %, which is within the range of uncertainty of model parameters and scatter in experimental data...|$|E

The effects of mass transport, space time, sorbent temperature and concentration of KCl on the rate of potassium adsorption on kaolin were studied in air.

The removal efficiency increased as temperature was decreased or KCl concentration was increased. The capture of potassium by kaolin was irreversible with formation of both water-soluble and water-insoluble products. Kaolin captured KOH almost as effectively as KCl, but K 2 SO 4 was captured much less effectively than KCl. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
