5000|$|<b>High-strength</b> <b>low-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> (HSLA) {{is a type}} of {{alloy steel}} that {{provides}} better mechanical properties or greater resistance to corrosion than carbon steel. HSLA steels vary from other steels in that they are not made to meet a specific chemical composition but rather to specific mechanical properties. They have a carbon content between 0.05-0.25% to retain formability and weldability. Other alloying elements include up to 2.0% manganese and small quantities of copper, nickel, niobium, nitrogen, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, calcium, rare earth elements, or zirconium. Copper, titanium, vanadium, and niobium are added for strengthening purposes. These elements are intended to alter the microstructure of carbon steels, which is usually a ferrite-pearlite aggregate, to produce a very fine dispersion of alloy carbides in an almost pure ferrite matrix. This eliminates the toughness-reducing effect of a pearlitic volume fraction yet maintains and increases the material's strength by refining the grain size, which in the case of ferrite increases yield strength by 50% for every halving of the mean grain diameter. Precipitation strengthening plays a minor role, too. Their yield strengths can be anywhere between [...] Because of their higher strength and toughness HSLA steels usually require 25 to 30% more power to form, as compared to carbon steels.|$|E

40|$|Published online: 25 April 2016 Hydrogen-assisted cold {{cracking}} is generally accepted {{to be the}} consequence of a critical concentration of hydrogen trapped within a susceptible microstructure and subjected to a threshold level of stress. Traditionally, hardness {{has been used as}} a proxy for establishing the critical limits above which the risk of a hydrogen crack propagating is considered significant. However, developments in the steel-making process, in particular thermomechanically controlled processing, has brought into question the suitability of empirical hardness limits developed using older generation steels. In this paper, a safe welding boundary was established for single-pass root runs for API 5 L X 70 steel welded with E 6010 electrodes. Across this boundary, it was shown that hydrogen cracks were present in welds with hardness’s well below the traditionally accepted threshold of 350 HV.
