50|$|When {{a lender}} offers a forbearance, they are refraining from {{enforcing}} {{their right to}} realize on securities under their agreement or contract with the Borrower. This is done to assist the Borrower in returning to a performing financial position as well as better position the Lender to realize its security should the Borrower fail to perform. The borrower is still responsible for their debt obligations, though they will accept the agreed forbearance amount and/or terms. On expiry of the agreed <b>forbearance</b> <b>period</b> the loan account reverts to its original form. In many instances, on expiry of the <b>forbearance</b> <b>period,</b> {{the difference between the}} level of forbearance granted and the full repayment (which was missed) is recalculated over the remaining term and the customers new repayment is based on the current loan balance, rate and term.|$|E
50|$|Equity loans {{designed}} to assist Luxembourg {{limited liability companies}} in promoting the creation, extension, conversion, reorientation and rationalisation of industrial, craft and commercial enterprises. Amounts are fixed {{on a case-by-case basis}} by the SNCI's Board of Directors and require approval by the competent ministers. The duration is normally no more than 10 years but a <b>forbearance</b> <b>period</b> for repayment of the capital may be accorded. The return is identical to that of the shareholders or partners but with a contractually fixed minimum.|$|E
50|$|At present, {{interest}} rates on Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) Federal PLUS loans are fixed at 6.84%. Many lenders offer borrower benefits to reduce this interest rate during repayment. During any period of deferment or forbearance, interest can accrue and be capitalized to the principal loan balance {{at the end of}} the deferment or <b>forbearance</b> <b>period</b> if it is not paid by the borrower as it accrues. There is also a 4.272% origination fee attached to the loan that, due to regulations, cannot be paid by the lender on the borrower's behalf.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} bivariate {{binomial}} model to price Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs). Our model is {{an improvement over}} previous MSR pricing models by explicitly incorporating the realistic assumptions that there are additional costs involved in servicing delinquent loans. In addition to the Hilliard et al. mortgage-pricing tree, we extend additional sub-branches to model the borrower's decision of prepayment, cure, and foreclosure after a loan becomes delinquent. We then investigate how {{the value of the}} Mortgage Servicing Right varies with interest rate volatility, house price volatility, delinquency options, deficiency judgments, default penalties, <b>forbearance</b> <b>periods,</b> and speed of adjustments factors.

5000|$|In {{contrast}} with federal loans, whose terms are public and standardized, the terms for private loans vary from lender to lender. However, {{it is not}} easy to compare them, as some conditions may not be revealed until the student is presented with a contract (promissory note) to sign. A common suggestion is to shop around on all terms, not just respond to [...] "rates as low as..." [...] tactics that are sometimes little more than bait-and-switch. However, shopping around could damage your credit score. Examples of other borrower terms and benefits that vary by lender are deferments (amount of time after leaving school before payments start) and <b>forbearances</b> (a <b>period</b> when payments are temporarily stopped due to financial or other hardship). These policies are solely based on the contract between lender and borrower and not set by Department of Education policies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the fair valuation of deposit insurance with forbearance under moral hazard behavior. Using {{the insights of}} duration and immunizat ion, we model a bank's overall interest rate risk as the duration mismatch. We also recognize that banks tend to hedge most of the interest rate risk, and that credit risk is the main focus in risk-taking. Using a novel correlation setup, we link the level of risk-taking to the net worth of the bank, making the moral hazard behavior endogenous. When modeling stochastic interest rates and deposits, we incorporate realistic features such as allowing continuous interest payments and an on-going deposit portfolio. We allow more frequent audits during forbearance and an effectively stochastic <b>forbearance</b> <b>period.</b> Among other things, we find that under realistic parameter values, forbearance can be a desirable course of action. In addition, the capital ratio plays an extremely important {{role in determining the}} size of the fair insura [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{efficacy}} of forbearance using a real options approach. Our model endogenizes moral hazard embedded in credit risk undertaken by the bank. The bank's interest rate risk is modeled as duration mismatch. Other modeling improvements over previous studies include such features as stochastic interest rates and deposits, continuous interest payments on an ongoing deposit portfolio, and a stochastic <b>forbearance</b> <b>period.</b> We find that the bank does {{have an incentive to}} engage in undue risk taking. Even in the presence of moral hazard, however, forbearance can still be a desirable course of action in reducing the FDIC's expected liability. In addition, the capital ratio plays an extremely important role in determining the fair insurance premium. Finally, using the mismatch of asset and deposit durations as the correct measurement of interest rate risk, our model reveals that an optimal asset variance may exist for a particular bank, contrary to what the contingent claims framework would predict. Therefore, we resolve the puzzle that banks in practice do not increase asset risk {{to take full advantage of}} the limited liability. Copyright The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2004. ...|$|E
