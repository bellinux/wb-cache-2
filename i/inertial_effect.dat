40|$|This study {{provides}} an extended {{approach to the}} mathematical simulation of thin-film flow on a flat inclined plane relevant to flows subject to high surface shear. Motivated by modelling thin-film structures within an industrial context, wave structures are investigated for flows with moderate <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> and small film depth aspect ratio, epsilon. Approximations are made assuming a Reynolds number, Re ~ O(1 /epsilon), and depth-averaging used to simplify the governing Navier-Stokes equations. A parallel Stokes flow is expected {{in the absence of}} any wave disturbance and a generalisation for the flow is based on a local quadratic profile. This approach provides a more general system which includes <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> and is solved numerically. Flow structures are compared with studies for Stokes flow in the limit of negligible <b>inertial</b> <b>effects.</b> Both two-tier and three-tier wave disturbances are used to study film profile evolution. A parametric study is provided for wave disturbances with increasing film Reynolds number. An evaluation of standing wave and transient film profiles is undertaken and identifies new profiles not previously predicted when <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> are neglected...|$|R

However the mathematical Brownian motion is exempt of such <b>inertial</b> <b>effects.</b> Note that <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> have to be considered in the Langevin equation, otherwise the equation becomes singular. so that simply removing the inertia term from this equation would not yield an exact description, but rather a singular behavior in which the particle doesn't move at all.|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} of the gravitational energy-momentum 3 -form and of the superpotential 2 -form {{are discussed in the}} covariant teleparallel framework, where the Weitzenböck connection represents <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> related to the choice of the frame. Due to its odd asymptotic behavior, the contribution of the <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> often yields unphysical (divergent or trivial) results for the total energy of the system. However, in the covariant teleparallel approach, the energy is always finite and nontrivial. The teleparallel connection plays a role of a regularizing tool which subtracts the <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> without distorting the true gravitational contribution.

50|$|Further, the {{equivalence}} principle guarantees that phenomena that {{are caused by}} inertial effects will also be present due to gravitational effects. Imagine, for example, {{a beam of light}} that is shined horizontally across a rocket ship that is accelerating uniformly upwards. According to an observer outside the rocket ship, the floor of the rocket ship accelerates up towards the light beam. The light beam does not seem to travel on a horizontal path according to the outside observer, rather the light seems to bend down toward the floor (because the floor is accelerating uniformly upward). This is an example of an <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> that causes light to bend. The {{equivalence principle}} states that this inertial phenomenon will also occur in a gravitational reference frame as well. Indeed, the phenomenon of gravitational lensing states that matter can bend light, and this phenomenon has been observed by the Hubble Telescope.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that wheels rotate as well as {{translate}} (move in a straight line) when a bicycle moves, more force is required to accelerate a unit of mass on the wheel than on the frame. To accelerate a wheel, total wheel mass matters less than the moment of inertia, which describes the <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> of the mass resisting acceleration (inertia) based on its location with respect to the axis of rotation (the center of the wheel hub/axle). In wheel design, reducing the rotational inertia has the benefit of more responsive, faster-accelerating wheels. To accomplish this, wheel designs are employing lighter rim materials, moving the spoke nipples to the hub or using lighter nipples such as aluminum. Note however that rotational inertia is only a factor during acceleration (and deceleration/braking). At constant speed, aerodynamics are a significant factor. For climbing, total mass remains important. See Bicycle performance for more detail.|$|E

40|$|Topological spin {{structures}} such as {{magnetic domain}} walls, vortices, and skyrmions, have been receiving great interest because of their high potential application in various spintronic devices. To utilize {{them in the future}} spintronic devices, it is first necessary to understand the dynamics of the topological spin structures. Since <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> plays {{a crucial role in the}} dynamics of a particle, understanding the <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> of topological spin structures is an important task. Here, we report that a strong <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> appears steadily when a skyrmion is driven by an oscillating spin-Hall-spintorque (SHST). We find that the skyrmion exhibits an inertia-driven hypocycloid-type trajectory when it is excited by the oscillating SHST. This motion has not been achieved by an oscillating magnetic field, which only excites the breathing mode without the <b>inertial</b> <b>effect.</b> The distinct <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> can be explained in terms of a spin wave excitation in the skyrmion boundary which is induced by the non-uniform SHST. Furthermore, the inertia-driven resonant excitation provides a way of experimentally estimating the inertial mass of the skyrmion. Our results therefore pave the way for the development of skyrmion-based device applications...|$|E

40|$|Significant <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> are {{observed}} for many {{applications such as}} flow in the near-wellbore region, in very permeable reservoirs or in packed-bed reactors. In these cases, the classical description of two-phase flow in porous media by the generalized Darcy's law is no longer valid. Due {{to the lack of}} a formalized theoretical model confirmed experimentally, our study is based on a generalized Darcy-Forchheimer approach for modelling two-phase incompressible inertial flow in porous media. Using a finite volume formulation, an IMPES (IMplicit for Pressures, Explicit for Saturations) scheme and a Fixed Point method for the treatment of non-linearities caused by inertia, a 3 D numerical tool has been developed. For 1 D flow in a homogeneous porous medium, comparison of saturation profiles obtained numerically at different times to those obtained semi-analytically using an “Inertial Buckley-Leverett model” allows a validation of the tool. The influence of <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> on the saturation profiles and therefore on the breakthrough curves for homogeneous media is analysed for different Reynolds numbers, thus emphasizing the necessity of taking into account this additional energy loss when necessary. For 1 D heterogeneous configurations, a thorough analysis of the saturation fronts as well as the saturation jumps at the interface between two media of contrasted properties highlights the influence of <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> for different Reynolds and capillary numbers. In 2 D heterogeneous configurations, saturation distributions are strongly affected by <b>inertial</b> <b>effects.</b> In particular, capillary trapping of the displaced fluid observed for the Darcy regime in certain regions can completely disappears when <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> become dominant...|$|R

40|$|In this endeavor, the {{transients}} persisting in {{a vacuum}} ejector system (put reference of my old paper) is studied by numerically simulating the flow field, and experimentally validating the simulated results. An <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> was discovered in the study due to which the direction of mass flux changes. As a result of this, the recirculation zone moves forward and backward during the transients and the pressure in the secondary chamber rises and falls. The system behaves as a damped oscillatory flow in which the direction of mass flux keeps on changing and finally settles down to a state {{where there is no}} mass flux in either direction. The movement of recirculation zone due to this <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> is studied in more detail for various flow and geometric parameters. The results obtained show that the pressure and mass flux through the secondary chamber depend highly on both the thickness of the primary and secondary jet and the chamber volume. The <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> reduces with the reduction in thickness of primary and secondary flow. The <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> is found to be decreasing with increasing secondary chamber volume.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the flocking of multiple agents which have significant inertias and evolve on a balanced information graph. We first show that flocking algorithms that neglect agents ’ <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> can cause unstable group behavior. To incorporate this <b>inertial</b> <b>effect,</b> {{we use the}} passive decompo-sition, which decomposes the closed-loop group dynamics into two decoupled systems: a shape system representing the internal group formation, and a locked system describing {{the motion of the}} center-of-mass. Then, analyzing the locked and shape systems separately with the help of graph theory, we propose a provably-stable flocking control law, which ensures that the internal group formation is exponentially stabilized to a desired shape, while all the agents ’ velocities converge to the centroid velocity that is also shown to be time-invariant. This result still holds for slowly-switching balanced information graphs. Simulation is performed to validate the theory.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} the heart has been modeled for decades by using continuum mechanics and numerical methods. A widely used, but rarely discussed, assumption is that <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> can be neglected in these models. This M. Sc. project investigates the consequences of including <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> in modeling of left ventricular mechanics. A framework for simulating the complete cardiac cycle is implemented using the Python interface to FEniCS. Numerical experiments are performed to study the role of inertia. The constitutive model for the myocardium suggested by Holzapfel and Ogden will be used, along with a rule-based algorithm for assigning muscle fiber orientations to the ventricular geometry, by Bayer et al. Hozapfel and Ogden’s model assumes the myocardium to behave like an elastic material, despite strong evidence suggesting viscoelastic behavior. To see how <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> relate to rheology we propose a viscoelastic model for the myocardium, based on a generalization of the 1 D Kelvin-Voigt material model. Employing the elastic model, while including <b>inertial</b> <b>effects,</b> led to unphysiological oscillations in the ventricular walls caused by the rapidly increasing pressure load during the diastole.
