25|$|Helnwein {{is part of}} a {{tradition}} going back to the 18th century, to which Messerschmidt's grimacing sculptures belong. One sees, too, the common ground of his works with those of Arnulf Rainer and Hermann Nitsch, two other Viennese, who display their own bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference of injury, pain, and death. And one sees how this fascination with body language goes back to the expressive gesture in the work of Egon Schiele.|$|E

25|$|Aberration may be {{explained}} as the difference in angle of {{a beam of light}} in different inertial frames of reference. A common analogy is to consider the apparent direction of falling rain. If rain is falling vertically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference of a person standing still, then to a person moving forwards the rain will appear to arrive at an angle, requiring the moving observer to tilt their umbrella forwards. The faster the observer moves, the more tilt is needed.|$|E
25|$|Fig. 3-1 {{illustrates}} that in Newton's theory, time is universal, not {{the velocity of}} light.

Within the train, a passenger shoots a bullet with a speed of 0.4c <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> the train. The blue arrow {{illustrates that}} a person standing on the train tracks measures the bullet as traveling at 0.8c. This is in accordance with our naive expectations.|$|E

General Carlos Prats, Pinochet's predecessor and army commander under Allende, who had resigned rather than support the moves against Allende's government, was assassinated in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1974. A year later, the murder of 119 opponents abroad was disguised as an internal conflict, the DINA setting up a propaganda campaign to support this idea (Operation Colombo), a campaign publicised by the leading newspaper in Chile, El Mercurio.|$|E

25|$|The Lorentz {{force is}} {{perpendicular}} {{to both the}} velocity of the electrons, {{which is in the}} plane of the disc, and to the magnetic field, which is normal (surface normal) to the disc. An electron at rest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> the disc moves circularly with the disc relative to the B-field (i.e. the rotational axis or the laboratory frame, remember the note above), and so experiences a radial Lorentz force. In Figure 1 this force (on a positive charge, not an electron) is outward toward the rim according to the right-hand rule.|$|E
