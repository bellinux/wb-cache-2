40|$|Report {{describes}} {{investigation of}} crash-energy-absorbing capabilities of square-cross-section tubes of two matrix/fiber composite materials. Both graphite/epoxy and Kevlar/epoxy tubes crushed in progressive and stable manner. Ratio between width of cross section and thickness of wall determined to affect energy-absorption significantly. As ratio decreases, energy-absorption capability increases non-linearly. Useful in building <b>energy-absorbing</b> <b>composite</b> structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{metallurgical}} {{processes and}} the products developed from these processes {{have been the}} cornerstone on which our civilizations have developed and flourished. Many of the new materials {{that have been developed}} over centuries were often the result of serendipitous occurrences. Because of the importance of new materials to the improvement of society, it is necessary to accelerate the way in which new alloys and processes are designed, developed and implemented. 	Over the last two decades the computational side of materials science has thrived as a result of bigger and faster computers. However, the application of new computational methods to the development of new materials and structures is still in the early stages primarily because of the complexity of most metallurgical processes. One such process is the decarburization of steel. Because {{of the importance of the}} microstructure on the mechanical properties, changes in the near surface properties are affected by the loss of carbon in the alloy. The topics investigated in this thesis include a variety of alloys and microstructures that are considered to be important in the development of a unique structure necessary for a more efficient method of recovering natural gas and oil from underground reserves as well as structures for energy absorbing systems. Since both the material application and the structure are new, this research represents an ideal opportunity to combine processing, properties, microstructure and computations to accelerate the development of these new structures. 	Compared to other commercially available proppants which tend to fail in demanding environments, the thin-walled hollow metal proppants are regarded more promising due to the low density and high mechanical strength. The <b>energy-absorbing</b> <b>composite</b> material manufactured by embedding said spheres in the Mg/Al matrix material is optimized by improving sphere and matrix properties at each step in the process. Ultimately the mechanical strength, fracture toughness, and energy absorption are expected to achieve a factor of 2 - 5 higher than previously reported. 	Modeling makes it economically practical to assess the targeted materials' overall properties, behaviors and the mechanical responses in conjunction with stress environment, material properties, material dimensions among other variables, before a structure is built. Additionally, more advanced modeling can enable the quantitative descriptions of more complex metallurgical phenomena such as the effects of impurity elements and deformation under complex loading conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{crashworthiness}} {{of aviation}} {{is a significant}} aspect of airworthiness, because it helps a lot in keeping crew safety and reducing economic losses. For the purpose of improving the crashworthiness performance {{of a kind of}} general aviation-type helicopter, an innovative light-weight <b>composite</b> <b>energy-absorbing</b> component has been developed in this paper. This component consists of carbon fiber woven cylindrical thin-walled tube and external triggers. The triggers let the cylindrical thin-walled tube split and break along its longitudinal axis and the energy is absorbed at the same time. In order to verify the results, a serial of test components were made and several tests were carried on. Finally, a digital simulation was carried on, whose results correspond with those of the tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{study has}} been made of flat plate chamfer-based, crush trigger {{mechanisms}} subjected to axial compression, for use with <b>energy-absorbing</b> Fiber reinforced <b>composites.</b> This paper will focus on the trigger mechanisms in flat panels made of Newport Nb 321 / 7781 fiber composites. Progressive crushing can often be induced by initiating or triggering fracture {{at one end of the}} plate. Crushing initiates in the highly stressed region at the tip of the chamfer and this develops into a stable crush zone. The sequence of crushing events depends on the type of chamfer and chamfer angle. The test panels would be subjected to low and high speed compression testing. We would like to validate the best optimized model for trigger mechanisms using FEA, with the experimental results. 1...|$|R

40|$|An MSC. Dytran {{model of}} an {{all-composite}} Lear Fan aircraft fuselage {{was developed to}} simulate an impact test conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center Impact Dynamics Research Facility (IDRF). The test was the second of two Lear Fan impact tests. The purpose of the second test was to evaluate the performance of retrofitted <b>composite</b> <b>energy-absorbing</b> floor beams. A computerized photogrammetric survey was performed to provide airframe geometric coordinates, and over 5000 points were processed and imported into MSC. Patran via an IGES file. MSC. Patran was then used to develop the curves and surfaces and to mesh the finite element model. A model of the energy-absorbing floor beams was developed separately and then integrated into the Lear Fan model. Structural responses of components such as the wings were compared with experimental data or previously published analytical data wherever possible. Comparisons with experimental results were used to guide structural model modifications to improve the simulation performance. This process was based largely on qualitative (video and still camera images and post-test inspections) rather than quantitative results due to the relatively few accelerometers attached to the structure...|$|R
