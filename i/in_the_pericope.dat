40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the concept of}} righteousness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gospel of Matthew.

The research also includes relevant information about the historical context of the text {{as well as the}} central theological themes which relate to <b>the</b> subject. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> research on the literal meanings, it seems that both words primarily occur in ethical teaching and that the concept of righteousness in Matthew is closely related to human conduct (e. g.

However, there could be aspects of a divine gift by grace <b>in</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> (Matt 5 : 6; 6 : 33).

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{a brief statement}} made by Patrick D Miller in his commentary on Deuteronomy, namely that scholars quite likely have missed the most important Old Testament passage relating {{to the kind of}} kingship Jesus manifested in his earthly ministry. Deuteronomy 17 : 14 - 20 gives a job description for an upcoming, earthly king; it carries messianic dimensions. Christian scholars, however, primarily have pointed to Isaiah and the messianic passages of the royal psalms to provide indication from the Old Testament that Jesus indeed fulfilled the promises therein of the promised king and the Messiah. Reading like a modern "Position Available" advertisement, the qualifications for kingship in Deuteronomy begin by saying the coming king must be God's choice, an Israelite and not a foreigner; frugal, not prone to displays of wealth and military might; and careful to keep his heart faithful to the Lord. Furthermore, a king's first duty is to write for himself a copy of the law and to read it throughout his life. The kind of kingship Jesus displayed during his ministry indeed exemplified his personal knowledge and careful following of the law, his total obedience to the law, his reverence for the law, and his humility before his disciples-all qualifications for earthly kingship "advertised" <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pericope.</b> The Gospel of Matthew resonates with passages showing that Jesus answered the advertisement, met the job description, and fulfilled the qualifications for kingship outlined prophetically by Moses in Deuteronomy.

40|$|Among the Dead Sea Scrolls are {{a number}} of texts that provide insight into demonological beliefs and {{practices}} in Second Temple Judaism. Some passages are concerned principally with providing safety from demonic influence. This anti-demonic orientation is expressed in two fundamental ways: the first is exorcistic and intends to relieve a person of current demonic affliction; the second is apotropaic and seeks protection from future demonic harm. Assessments of exorcistic and apotropaic works have benefited scholars of both early Jewish and early Christian literature. However, the majority of discussions which intersect Qumran studies with demonological traditions in the Synoptic Gospels have typically focused on exorcism. Still, the growing interest in preventative, apotropaic prayer and the illumination of this tradition by the Qumran material is resulting in recent endeavours to broaden the conversation about anti-demonic elements in the gospels. Building on the latest contributions, I analyse the account of the Temptation in the Gospel of Matthew (Matt 4 : 1 - 11) with the aim of demonstrating the presence of apotropaic features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pericope.</b> Specifically, two components of the narrative are considered: quotations from (1) Deuteronomy and (2) Psalm 91. The nature and function of these biblical quotations in the gospel text are examined against the backdrop of anti-demonic traditions from Qumran. This comparison reveals a similarity between aspects of the Temptation and early Jewish apotropaisms. Not only does this suggest the likelihood of analogous apotropaic features in Qumran texts and a Matthean narrative, it puts key parts of the pericope into sharper focus...|$|E

40|$|The Hebrew Bible is {{the product}} of scribes. Whether copying, editing, conflating, adapting, or authoring, these ancient {{professionals}} were responsible for the various text designs, constructions and text-types that we have today. This thesis seeks to investigate the many practices employed by ancient scribes in literary production, or, more aptly, scribal composition. An investigation of scribal composition must incorporate inquiry into both synchronic and diachronic aspects of a text; a synchronic viewpoint can clarify diachronic features of the text and a diachronic viewpoint can clarify synchronic features of the text. To understand the text as the product of scribal composition requires recognition that the ancient scribe had a communicative goal when he engaged in the different forms of scribal composition (e. g. authoring, redacting, etc.). This communicative goal was reached through the scribal composer’s implementation of various literary techniques. By tracing the reception of a text, it is possible to demonstrate when a scribal composer successfully reached his communicative goal. Using Malachi as a test-case, three autonomous yet complementary chapters will illustrate how investigating the text as the product of scribal composition can yield new and important insights. Chapter 2 : Mal 2. 10 - 16 focuses on a particularly difficult portion of Malachi (2. 10 - 16), noting patterns amongst the texts reused <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pericope.</b> These patterns give information about the ancient scribe’s view of scripture and about his communicative goal. Chapter 3 : Wordplay surveys Malachi for different types of the wordplay. The chapter demonstrates how a poetic feature such as wordplay, generally treated as a synchronic element, can also have diachronic implications. Chapter 4 : Phinehas, he is Elijah investigates the reception of Malachi as a finished text. By tracing backwards a tradition found throughout later Jewish literature, it is evident that the literary techniques employed by the composer made his text successfully communicative...|$|E

The timelessness of this text and the pressing environmental crisis prompt our research to reread the pericope in its context (Micah 6 : 1 - 8) from the viewpoint of ecological hermeneutics.

How do YHWH, humanity and non-human creation interrelate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pericope?</b> What fresh insights can we glean from reading Mic 6 : 8 with ecological eyes? This investigation answers these questions by presenting an overview and a critique of the two recent responses on the ecological crisis from the field of biblical scholarship: the Earth Bible Project’s ecojustice principles (2000 - 2002) and Hilary Marlow’s “ecological triangle” (2009). We shall look at (1) the understanding of the non-human creation in the text; (2) the discernible assumptions on the relationship between YHWH and the created world; and (3) the effects of the actions and choices of human beings concerning the non-human creation and vice versa. To further the scholarly discussion, we propose that the “ecological triangle” be modified by (4) discerning deeper and inner dimensions of the interrelationship between YHWH, humanity and non-human creation. Our research suggests that the most authentic answer to the many “whats” that unite the pericope is a “who”, a corrective and transformative reconsideration of humanity’s interrelationship with other humans, non-human creation and YHWH. status: submitte...|$|E
40|$|Pouca atenção foi dada pelos estudiosos para a função da Palavra de Deus no relato da pesca milagrosa em Lucas, tanto em nível literário, quanto teológico.

A metodologia utilizada foi a análise e interpretação de textos, privilegiando o método histórico-crítico e os seus elementos essenciais, além do uso de outros métodos, baseados na ciência da linguagem. Pode-se dizer que a Palavra de Deus ocupa um lugar central na trama, dando cadência ao relato e elucidando o sentido teológico que Lucas pretende imprimir, o que fica evidente pelas alterações feitas pelo autor no relato original. Na perícope da pesca milagrosa, a Palavra é proclamada por Jesus em caráter performativo, faz o milagre acontecer, conduz Pedro à conversão e dá a ele uma nova missão.

The timelessness of this book, the pressing environmental crisis, and the challenge of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 2015 to ensure environmental sustainability prompt me to reread Rev 21 : 1 - 7 from the perspective of ecological hermeneutics. This text mentions the inauguration of a new heaven and a new earth after all the catastrophes have passed. In particular, it underlines God’s “tenting” with his people, reminiscent of the wilderness sanctuary mentioned in the Book of Exodus (Pilch & Malina, 2000). The text continues, “they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them”. While these words are clearly election and covenant language meant for the human believers, I propose that an ecological reading of this pericope will allow for an emergence of alternative insights on the dynamic of the interrelationship not only between God and humanity but also including non-human creation especially when how, why, where and what made up the tabernacle in the wilderness are reconsidered or what Leal calls “theological geography” (2004). Thus, in this investigation, I will trace the theological significance of the words σκηνὴ and σκηνώσει and how these words feature in the God–Israel–non-human creation relations as attested in the LXX, the New Testament and the Book of Revelation. Afterwards, I will look at how God, humanity and non-human creation interrelate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pericope</b> by using Hilary Marlow’s concept of “ecological triangle” (2009).

Traditionally understood, these texts present how YHWH confronts Israel’s infidelity to the covenant by way of “disputation” or “conduct of a legal case,” with usually the natural elements as witnesses. Recently, however, some interests have focused on the presence and role of Earth community in the covenant relation between YHWH and Israel. Our research looks into the ryb in Mic 6 : 1 - 8 and discerns not only what the role/s of the hrym, gb‘wt, and ’tnym msdy ’rts (Mic 6 : 1 - 2) are but also the presence and function/s of other members of Earth community <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pericope.</b> Guided by the principle of voice that “Earth is a subject capable of raising its voice in celebration and against injustice,” our study investigates the various ways (gesture, sign, image or sound) in which Earth community communicates with humans, other members of Earth community, and YHWH. We endeavor to reclaim the voice of Earth community in Mic 6 : 1 - 8 in four steps. First, we consider the role of the hrym, gb‘wt, and ’tnym msdy ’rts as witnesses in the so-called ryb (Mic 6 : 1 - 2) in comparison with the role of the deities and natural elements in the ancient Near East treaties. Second, we attempt to listen to the voice of these witnesses by rereading the complaint of YHWH (Mic 6 : 3 - 5) from their perspective. Third, we allow these witnesses to raise their voice against objectification and exploitatively anthropocentric mindset which suggest covenant violation (Mic 6 : 6 - 7). Lastly, we show how hrym, gb‘wt, and ’tnym msdy ’rts witness anew the re-presentation of covenant relationship within the Earth community which allow for fullness of life for all life forms (Mic 6 : 8). status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Scholars have {{examined}} several motifs in Luke 2 : 22 - 35, the 2 ̆ 2 Presentation 2 ̆ 2 of the Gospel of Luke. However, scholarship scarcely has treated {{the theme of}} nomos, the Septuagintal word Luke uses as a translation of the Hebrew word Torah. Nomos is mentioned {{four times in the}} Presentation narrative; it also is a word in Septuagintal Isaiah to which the metaphor of light in Luke 2 : 32 alludes. In 2 : 22 - 32 [...] a pivotal piece within Luke-Acts [...] nomos relates to several themes, including ones David Pao discusses in his study on Isaiah 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of Israel 2 ̆ 7 s restoration, appropriated by Luke. My dissertation investigates, for the first time, the Septuagintal Isaian use of nomos in this pericope. My thesis is that Luke 2 ̆ 7 s use of nomos in the Presentation pericope highlight 2 ̆ 7 s Jesus 2 ̆ 7 identity as the Messiah who will restore and fulfill Israel. Methodologically, I use intertextual narrative interpretation. In Chapter One, I examine Luke 2 ̆ 7 s transitional, dual use of nomos <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pericope.</b> This includes Luke 2 ̆ 7 s use of nomos {{on the surface of the}} text, and his allusive appropriation, in Luke 2 : 32, of nomos in the LXX-Isaiah. In Chapter Two I discuss in greater depth an overriding theme of Luke-Acts [...] the new exodus [...] and the Isaian motif of the restoration and fulfillment of Israel which establishes and informs this theme. I outline the process of Israel 2 ̆ 7 s restoration, including the role of Septuagintal Isaian nomos within it. In my discussion, I critique David Pao 2 ̆ 7 s six themes of the restoration of Israel. I argue that Luke 2 : 32 alludes to nomos, situated within a Davidic context and integral to Isaiah 2 ̆ 7 s motif of the restoration and fulfillment of Israel. I show that, consequently, this Lukan allusion discloses Jesus as the Servant Messiah who restores Israel and offers salvation to the Gentiles. Chapter Three addresses the influence of dikaiosune of the LXX-Isaiah on Luke 2 ̆ 7 s appropriation of nomos. In conclusion, I present the results of this study. Additionally, I address methodological implications of intertextual analysis, and of interpretation of the Book of Isaiah at the turn of the era...|$|E
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> essay 'Donner la mort' (1992) Jacques Derrida {{develops}} {{a new concept}} for the philosophical category of <b>the</b> subjectivity. <b>In</b> particular, he crucially connects {{the genesis of the}} subject with the experience of the absolute responsibility that, for Derrida, also represents the beginning of the religion itself: the religion comes to light fundamentally as history of the responsibility. The symbol of the absolute responsibility is the biblical figure of Abraham <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shocking <b>pericope</b> of Genesis 22, where God demands the sacrifice of Isaac. This paper aims to analyze the structure of the absolute responsibility as genesis of <b>the</b> subject <b>in</b> Derrida’s reconstruction of the biblical text. The responsibility itself {{turns out to be the}} common foundation of those religions that share the figure of Abraham and provides also a base for a philosophy of monotheism. ...|$|R
