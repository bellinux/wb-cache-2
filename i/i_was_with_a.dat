However, Wrangler always considered himself homosexual. [...] "I'm not bisexual and I'm not straight", Wrangler later said.

After a visit to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and an MRI scan, he was advised that he had a developing pituitary adenoma, which was the size of two golf balls. According to Watson, [...] "Since an early age I've had an in-built premonition, a vision that I wouldn't make 40. For the previous seven years I'd have a recurring nightmare in which my head exploded. And here <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brain tumour on the eve of my 40th birthday; I thought, 'This is it, I was right, I knew it'." [...] Watson recalled that the tumours were [...] "like a figure of eight, one filling the frontal cavity of my skull, the other forced through into the top of my nose." [...] He stayed in Los Angeles for two days and continued recording his album while tests confirmed whether the tumour was malignant or not – {{it turned out to be}} benign.|$|E

They are excellent for a Court, but you never heard them in the camp, for we could not afford to do away with our Ney, our Rapp, or our Soult--names which were as stirring to our ears as the blare of our trumpets blowing the reveille.

60|$|I {{went with}} Mrs. Fazy {{the other night}} to call on Mrs. C.'s friend, Pastor C. They were so affectionate, so full of {{beautiful}} kindness! The French language sounds sweetly as a language of affection and sympathy: with all its tart vivacity, it has a richness in the gentler world of feeling. Then, in the evening, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little circle of friends {{at the house of}} the sister of Merle d'Aubigne, and they prayed and sang together. It was beautiful. The hymn was one on the following of Jesus, similar to that German one of old Godfrey Arnold, which is your favorite. These Christians speak with deep sorrow of our slavery; it grieves, it distresses them, for the American church has been to them a beloved object. They have leaned towards it as a vine inclines towards a vigorous elm. To them it looks incomprehensible that such a thing could gain strength in a free Christian republic.|$|E
60|$|He was {{standing}} before a table which was littered {{all over with}} pots, brushes, boxes, and a score of the like trifles, which he had either bought or borrowed for the occasion. A large hand-mirror was balanced against the wall, with rush-lights {{on either side of}} it. In front of this, with a most solemn and serious expression upon his pale, handsome face, the Baronet was arranging and re-arranging a white berdash cravat. His riding-boots were brightly polished, and the broken seam repaired. His sword-sheath, breastplate, and trappings were clear and bright. He wore his gayest and newest suit, and above all he had donned a most noble and impressive full-bottomed periwig, which drooped down to his shoulders, as white as powder could make it. From his dainty riding-hat to his shining spur there was no speck or stain upon him--a sad set-off to my own state, plastered as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thick crust of the Sedgemoor mud, and disordered from having ridden and worked for two days without rest or repose.|$|E
60|$|You {{know how}} it is when you get an idea. For awhile it sort of simmers inside you, and then {{suddenly}} it sizzles up like a rocket, and there you are, right up against it. That's what happened now. I went away from that luncheon, vaguely determined to pull off some stunt which would prove that I was right there with the gray matter, but without any clear notion of what I was going to do. Side by side with this in my mind was the case of dear old Harold. When I wasn't brooding on the stunt, I was brooding on Harold. I was fond of the good old lad, and I hated the idea of his slowly wrecking the home purely by being a chump. And {{all of a sudden the}} two things clicked together like a couple of chemicals, and there <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> corking plan for killing two birds with one stone--putting one across that would startle and impress Ann, and at the same time healing the breach between Harold and Hilda.|$|E

60|$|It cost me much labour, {{and many}} days, before {{all these things}} were brought to perfection, and {{therefore}} I must go back to some other things which took up some of my thoughts. At {{the same time it}} happened, after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with the lightning, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thought which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning itself; O my powder! my very heart sunk within me, when I thought, that at one blast all my powder might be destroyed; on which, not my defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended; I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger; though, had the powder took fire, I had never known who had hurt me.|$|E
60|$|There {{over the}} waters I could dimly see the loom of the English coast, with its {{suggestions}} of dreamy villages, humming bees, and the pealing of Sunday bells.

All my life had been spent in these peaceful surroundings, and now, here <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spirited horse between my knees, two pistols peeping out of my holsters, and a commission upon which my whole future might depend, to arrest the most redoubtable conspirator in France. No wonder that, looking back over many dangers and many vicissitudes, it is still that evening ride over the short crisp turf of the downs which stands out most clearly in my memory. One becomes blase to adventure, as one becomes blase to all else which the world can give, save only the simple joys of home, and to taste the full relish of such an expedition one must approach it with the hot blood of youth still throbbing in one's veins.|$|E

I have spent some months among them, and got a wonderful lot of skins, beavers principally of course, but half a dozen mountain lions and two grizzlies. I did not bring home their skins, you bet. They were too heavy, and I should not have troubled them if they had not troubled me. There was good fish, too, in the streams, and I never had a better time.
