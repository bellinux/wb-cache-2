[...] "I was always taught as a kid giving to charity. You're {{supposed}} to give a good amount of charity each and every year. ... It's just a great thing when you can make a kid smile that's going through some hard times in life... I wish more people, not just athletes, would give people <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> their time. It doesn't take much... It can make a huge difference." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hook Me Up" [...] {{was written}} by The Veronicas' twin sisters, Jessica and Lisa Origliasso {{together}} with Shelly Peiken and Greg Wells – Wells also produced the track. The composition {{was influenced by the}} electropop of underground bands in Los Angeles, whose sound The Veronicas were keen to incorporate into their own music. Jessica explained the lyrical content and central theme behind [...] "Hook Me Up": [...] "It's about being tired with where you're at in life and wanting to get away and out for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> time-whether it's in a relationship or in life. I guess we went through that a little bit when things started getting full on with us. It went from one extreme, where no one knew who we were, to the complete opposite".|$|E
500|$|While {{starting}} for {{an injured}} John David Booty in 2007, Sanchez wore a custom mouthguard that featured {{the colors of}} the Mexican flag in honor of his heritage. It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of unity—Sanchez accepting his heritage; for critics, the gesture symbolized a radical political statement. Sanchez, who {{was born and raised in}} the United States, received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico. Sanchez responded to the controversy stating, [...] "It’s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that. It’s <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> pride in our heritage. Hopefully, it inspires somebody and it’s all for the best." [...] Overwhelmed by the attention and shying away from politics, Sanchez stopped wearing the mouthpiece, but began participating in other efforts to help the Hispanic community.|$|E

500|$|Ian McDiarmid {{required}} little make-up in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. He recalled, [...] "I'm ... slightly aged [...] In {{the last}} film, I had a fairly standard make-up on, but now, they're starting to crinkle my face." [...] Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, however, required extensive make-up. McDiarmid remarked {{in an interview}} with Star Wars Insider magazine, [...] "Yes—that was a four-hour job, initially, although we got it down to about two-and-a-half in the end. But this was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> latex here and there, a little bit of skin-scrunching." [...] He told the Homing Beacon newsletter, [...] "When my face changes in the film, my mind went back to the early silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney, Sr.." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that he [...] "looks uncannily like Death in The Seventh Seal" [...] (1957) and film historian Robin Wood compares him to the hag from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).|$|E

2500|$|White {{endured a}} lacklustre {{campaign}} in the 1993/1994 season, but managed to reach the 1994 World Championship final for a fifth successive year, becoming only the second player after Steve Davis (1983–89) to achieve this. For {{the fourth time in}} five years, White's opponent in the final was Stephen Hendry and the defending champion opened up a 5–1 lead. White recovered well to lead 13–12 and made a break of 75 to take the match into a deciding frame. In the final frame, White was on a break of 29 and leading the frame by 37 points to 24 when he missed a straightforward black off its spot. Commentator Dennis Taylor memorably observed: [...] "Dear me, that was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> tension". As it happened, Hendry cleared with a technically straightforward break of 58 to win the title. Gracious in defeat, White joked that Hendry was [...] "beginning to annoy" [...] him in the post-match interview.|$|E

Her husband was beating her, she was on 80-cents a day and she was—she was telling us how she would borrow dirty laundry water from her neighbors to—to clean her clothes because—and her children’s clothes because she couldn’t even afford a little bit of soap. Now 11 years later, she’s opened up a restaurant. Her loans are up to $2,000 now because she’s been such a--you know {{reliable}} client. She hired seven other women. She sends all of her daughters to school. One of them is in University now; they like all pooled their money together to—to send the smartest one to University and it’s just amazing the—the amount of responsibility and pride that these women who have no education and virtually no hope can take with themselves with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> input." ...|$|E

6000|$|Well, {{my friend}} the poet thought {{his life was}} a failure, and I told him I thought it was, {{and then he said}} he thought he ought to commit suicide, and I said [...] "all right," [...] which was disinterested advice to a friend in trouble; but, like all such advice, there was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> self-interest back of it, for if I could get a [...] "scoop" [...] on the other {{newspapers}} I could get a job.|$|E

Nevertheless, those deeds, as before hinted, did indeed date back to three kings--Indian kings--only so much the finer for that.|$|E

60|$|The roof, and {{the north}} side, down to {{the feet of the}} {{horizontal}} line of sitting figures, were originally third-rate work of the school of Giotto; the rest of the chapel was originally, and most of it is still, magnificent work of the school of Siena. The roof and north side have been heavily repainted in, many places; the rest is faded and injured, but not destroyed in its most essential qualities. And now, farther, you must bear with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> tormenting history of painters.|$|E

He had had <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> hope, and this was that Jimmy Skunk wouldn't come back when it grew dark. He had crept part way up the hall at the first hint of night and {{stretched}} himself out to wait until he could be sure that those dreadful Yellow Jackets had gone to sleep. He had just about made up his mind that it was safe for him to scamper out when Jimmy Skunk's voice came down the hall to him. Poor Peter! The sound of that voice almost broke his heart.|$|E
