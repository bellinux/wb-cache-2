40|$|Abstract—Most of the 22 {{approved}} or developing ISO standards rely on {{a wheelchair}} <b>test</b> <b>dummy,</b> a specialized device described in ISO 7176 - 11. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a means for modifying the design of the ISO 7176 - 11 <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> to be suitable for testing with higher masses. The changes are based upon published data for obese individuals. With these data, we derived equations for determining the distribution of the additional mass among the <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> components, and the locations of the centers of mass. The results of this study provide guidelines for adding mass to the 100 kg wheelchair <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> to accommodate <b>testing</b> of wheelchairs designed for obese individuals...|$|R

40|$|The <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> (4) has {{a sensor}} for {{measuring}} measured variables of bypassed decontamination test liquid and/or contaminants, where the <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> exhibits a human form.

40|$|Injury {{criteria}} and risk curves {{are needed for}} anthropomorphic <b>test</b> devices (<b>dummies)</b> to assess injuries for improving human safety. The present state of knowledge is based on using injury outcomes and biomechanical metrics from post-mortem human subject (PMHS) and mechanical records from <b>dummy</b> <b>tests.</b> Data from these models are combined to develop dummy injury assessment risk curves/values (IARCs and IARVs). This simple substitution approach involves duplicating dummy metrics for PMHS tested under similar conditions and pairing with PMHS injury outcomes. It {{does not account for}} the age of each specimen tested in the PMHS group. Current substitution methods for injury risk assessments use age as a covariate and dummy metrics (e. g., accelerations) are not modified so that age can be directly included in the model. The age-infusion methodology presented in this perspective article accommodates for an annual rate factor that modifies the dummy injury risk assessment responses to account for the age of the PMHS that the injury data was based on. The annual rate factor is determined using human injury risk curves. The dummy metrics are modulated based on individual PMHS age and rate factor, thus infusing age into the dummy data. Using PMHS injuries and accelerations from side-impact experiments, matched-pair <b>dummy</b> <b>tests</b> and logistic regression techniques, the methodology demonstrates the process of age-infusion to derive the IARCs and IARVs...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid <b>test</b> <b>dummies</b> {{provide a}} safe {{alternative}} to human subjects when investigating mechanisms of wheelchair tips and falls. The data that researchers acquire from these <b>test</b> <b>dummies</b> are more useful if the <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> represents the population being studied. The goal {{of this study was}} to measure the validity of a 50 th percentile Hybrid II <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> (HTD) as an accurate representation of a wheelchair user. A test pilot with T 8 paraplegia due to traumatic spinal cord injury served as a basis for validation. Simple modifications were made to the HTD to approximate the trunk stability characteristics of a person with a spinal cord injury. An HTD, a modified HTD, and a human test pilot were seated in an electric-powered wheelchair and several braking tests performed. The standard HTD underestimated the kinematics when compared to the test pilot. The modified HTD had less trunk stability than the standard HTD during all braking methods. The modified HTD and wheelchair test pilot had similar trunk stability characteristics during kill switch and joystick full-reverse braking conditions. The modified HTD is a satisfactory representation of a wheelchair user with a spinal cord injury; however, the modified <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> underestimates the trunk dynamics during the less extreme joystick release braking. Work should continue on the development of a low-speed, low-impact <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> that emulates the wheelchair user population. © 2001 IPEM...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Rollover {{accidents}} {{have the}} highest serious to fatal injury rates of any accident mode. Research and development on rollover occupant protection has been frustrated {{by the lack of}} a low cost, controlled, repeatable, dynamic test. The most widely used tests, dolly and CRIS system rollovers, do not meet all of these conditions, but the Jordan Rollover System (JRS) does. This study demonstrates JRS repeatability using three identical production vehicles with anthropomorphic <b>test</b> <b>dummies.</b> The first <b>test</b> of each vehicle used string potentiometers to measure roof performance. The second used both string potentiometers and an instrumented <b>test</b> <b>dummy.</b> The JRS <b>test</b> parameters, roof structural performance, and Hybrid III dummy injury measures were all shown to be highly repeatable with variation generally not more than 10 percent. The dummy and vehicle repeatability was on par with the repeatability shown in similar crash test studies conducted by IIHS and NHTSA...|$|R
