5|$|Tigers {{generally}} do not prey on fully grown adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros but incidents have been reported. More often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken. Tigers have been reported attacking and killing elephants ridden by humans during tiger hunts in the 19th century. When {{in close proximity to}} humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys. Old or wounded tigers, unable to catch wild prey, can become man-eaters; this pattern has recurred frequently across India. An exception is in the Sundarbans, where healthy tigers prey upon fishermen and villagers in search of <b>forest</b> <b>produce,</b> humans thereby forming a minor part of the tiger's diet. Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for dietary fibre such as fruit of the slow match tree.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak's {{rain forests}} are {{primarily}} {{threatened by the}} logging industry and palm oil plantations. The issue of human rights of the Penan and deforestation in Sarawak became an international environmental issue when Swiss activist Bruno Manser visited Sarawak regularly between 1984 and 2000. Deforestation has affected the life of indigenous tribes, especially the Penan, whose livelihood is heavily dependent on <b>forest</b> <b>produce.</b> This led to several blockades by indigenous tribes during the 1980s and 1990s against logging companies encroaching on their lands. There have also been cases where Native Customary Rights (NCR) lands {{have been given to}} timber and plantation companies without the permission of the locals. The indigenous people have resorted to legal means to reinstate their NCR. In 2001 the High Court of Sarawak fully reinstated the NCR land claimed by the Rumah Nor people, but this was overturned partially in 2005. However, this case has served as a precedent, leading to more NCR being upheld by the high court in the following years. Sarawak's mega-dam policies, such as the Bakun Dam and Murum Dam projects, have submerged thousands of hectares of forest and displaced thousands of indigenous people. Since 2013, the proposed Baram Dam project has been delayed due to ongoing protests from local indigenous tribes. Since 2014, the Sarawak government under chief minister Adenan Satem started to take action against illegal logging in the state and to diversify the economy of the state. Through the course of 2016 over 2 million acres of forest, much of it in orangutan habitats, were declared protected areas.|$|E

25|$|The Sundarbans {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the economy of the southwestern region of Bangladesh as well as in the national economy. It is the single largest source of <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> in the country. The forest provides raw materials for wood-based industries. In addition to traditional <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> like timber, fuelwood, pulpwood etc., large-scale harvest of non-wood forest products such as thatching materials, honey, beeswax, fish, crustacean and mollusc resources of the forest takes place regularly. The vegetated tidal lands of the Sundarbans function as an essential habitat, produces nutrients and purifies water. The forest also traps nutrient and sediment, acts as a storm barrier, shore stabiliser and energy storage unit. Last but not the least, the Sunderbans provides an aesthetic attraction for local and foreign tourists.|$|E
25|$|A {{state highway}} and the Vijayawada-Guntakal {{line of the}} South Central Railway pass through the hills. The railway was first built by the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway and is a feat of engineering, having 2 tunnels at Bogada and Chelama and a few viaducts, the most famous being the now {{abandoned}} Dorabavi Viaduct. The railway enters the hills at the Nandikama Pass near Cumbum Lake. The highway follows a zig zag alignment and thus avoids any tunnels. The primary exports of this region are <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> like timber waste, honey and molasses.|$|E
25|$|The {{management}} of wildlife is restricted to, firstly, {{the protection of}} fauna from poaching, and, secondly, designation of some areas as wildlife sanctuaries where no extraction of <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> is allowed and where the wildlife face few disturbances. Although the fauna of Bangladesh have diminished in recent times and the Sundarbans has not been spared from this decline, the mangrove forest retains several good wildlife habitats and their associated fauna. Of these, the tiger and dolphin are target species for planning wildlife management and tourism development. There are high profile and vulnerable mammals living in two contrasting environments, and their statuses and management are strong indicators of the general condition and {{management of}} wildlife. Some species are protected by legislation, notably by the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973).|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this case study was to reveal richness, {{uniqueness}} and economic importance of the minor <b>forest</b> <b>producing</b> species (MFPs). International Forest Resources and Institutions (IFRI) techniques were used to collect biophysical information pertaining to forest, vegetation and socio economy of dwellers. Ninety plots were demarcated to represent all types of vegetation and linked to social and institutional parameters. The regeneration status of the plant species was correlated to different resource utilization management practices, which includes harvesting practices as well as associated anthropogenic disturbances. The present paper tries to relate the usage of minor <b>forest</b> <b>produces</b> and its reflection on richness and diversity of the ecosystem. With above objects in mind, this paper brings out the role of community forest management {{and its impact on}} vegetation and sustainable development of aboriginals based on successive field work from three villages, Markegaon, Devulgaon and Ranvahi of Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra, India.

25|$|In the 1970s, India {{declared}} its long-term strategy for forestry development to compose of three major objectives: to reduce soil erosion and flooding; {{to supply the}} growing needs of the domestic wood products industries; and to supply {{the needs of the}} rural population for fuelwood, fodder, small timber, and miscellaneous <b>forest</b> <b>produce.</b> To achieve these objectives, the National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 recommended the reorganisation of state forestry departments and advocated the concept of social forestry. The commission itself worked on the first two objectives, emphasising traditional forestry and wildlife activities; in pursuit of the third objective, the commission recommended the establishment of a new kind of unit to develop community forests. Following the leads of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, a number of other states also established community-based forestry agencies that emphasized programmes on farm forestry, timber management, extension forestry, reforestation of degraded forests, and use of forests for recreational purposes.|$|E
500|$|These {{forests are}} home to {{indigenous}} tribal people belonging largely to the Irula tribe (also known as the Urali) and Soliga communities. In 2011, the Tamil Nadu state forest department officials conducted {{a study on the}} cattle and human population in the seven forest settlements and 12 revenue settlements inside the protected area. As of 2013, tribals engage in collecting honey, more than 900 families live in 138 villages within a [...] radius surrounding the park. The tribals engage in agriculture, grazing of animals and collecting minor <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> such as honey, tubers, fuel wood and fish. According to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, the tribals were entitled to use designated land within the park area for agriculture and the title deeds for the same are to be distributed within 2016 after the Supreme Court of India vacated a stay order issued by the Madras High Court prohibiting the same.|$|E
2500|$|The Hindu {{tradition}} considers forests (Van/ Ban) to be {{of three}} types - Tapovan, Mahavan and Sreevan. Tapovan are forests associated with penance (Tapas), and are inhabited by saints and rishis. Mahavan refers to the grand natural forests. Tapovan and Mahavan {{are considered to be}} a Raksha ("sanctuary") for flora and fauna as ordinary human beings are not allowed to enter these forests. Sreevan, which means, [...] "forests of prosperity", consists of dense forests and groves. From the former, people would collect dry wood, leaves, <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> and a limited amount of timber, though natural ecosystem would not be unnecessarily disturbed. Groves were considered as spaces of forests from where harvesting could be done. Sometimes, specific trees like mango trees could be planted and nurtured here. Groves were associated with religious rites, festivals and recreation. Typical recreational activities associated with these groves included jhoola/ jhoolan. In the villages, Panchavati, or a cluster of five trees that represented the forests, were maintained. These trees represented the five elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space.|$|E

Hence, despite the powers vested in them under PESA, the Gram sabhas {{were not able to}} access many important MFPs such as Tendu and Bamboo. In fact, the list included in the state subject law pertained to only 33 low value MFPs. This anomaly had led to denial of livelihood opportunities to Village Communities in the Scheduled Areas, primarily the members of the Scheduled Tribes. By Notification dated 19/08/2014, the Governor of Maharashtra made modifications to the Maharashtra Transfer of Ownership of Minor <b>Forest</b> <b>Produce</b> in the Scheduled Areas and the Maharashtra Minor <b>Forest</b> <b>Produce</b> (Regulation of trade) (Amendment) Act, 1997 and modifications to the Indian Forest Act, 1927, in its application to the State of Maharashtra. Because of these changes many Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas have been able to exercise their rights over minor <b>forest</b> <b>produce,</b> including high value products, such as bamboo and tendu. Using these rights in consonance with FRA, more than 100 Gram Sabhas in Gadchiroli have exercised for the first time their rights over bamboo and more than 500 have exercised their rights over tendu and earned income ranging from 10 lakh to 80 lakh per Gram Sabha, leading to a positive impact in the Left-Wing Extremist (LWE) affected district.|$|E
