This process is of high interest for fractured reservoirs and/or cover integrity but it is not well constrained giving an uncertainty as this interval can either promote the migration of deeper fluids and the mineralized fluids intensifies diagenesis in the fracture planes, rendering this interval all the more impermeable. The next challenge will be to define where, when and how does this polygonal fault interval occur and this can only be done by understanding the behavior of clay grains and fluids during early burial...|$|E

Two distinct shortening directions have been previously identified and interpreted in terms of two separate phases of Alleghenian deformation. Over most of the transect, minimum anhysteretic susceptibility axes within the plane of bedding closely parallel the compression direction of the earlier ("Lackawanna") phase. A few sites show minimum anhysteretic susceptibility parallel to the later ("Main") phase. The threshold for resolution of the tectonic signal by AAS is at anhysteretic susceptibilities of about 2 x 10 - 5 (SI) and strain magnitudes of 0. 5 to 1 % as recorded by twinning in calcite. The central part of the transect exhibits minimum horizontal anhysteretic susceptibility perpendicular to the inferred tectonic compression, rather than parallel to it. We attribute this to either: (a) anisotropic transmission of stresses from the larger calcite matrix grains to the smaller magnetite grains during twinning; or (b) preferential recording of a late-stage non-coaxial stress direction in this area by late diagenetic magnetite...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for {{determining}} mag-netic anisotropy using anhysteric remanence susceptibility is described. The magnetic <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> {{a collection of}} Trenton Limestone specimens has been determined using this method, {{as well as by}} conventional anisotropy of magnetic suscepti-bility. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the new method for finding the magnetic <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> units such as the Trenton in which the bulk magnetic susceptibilities are low. A model is proposed to explain the observed foliated and lineated fabric as a consequence of overburden compaction and regional horizontal stresses. The original fabric is inferred to have been iso-tropic; the anisotropy resides in secondary mag-netite of Late Paleozoic age. It is argued that the observed magnetic fabric must therefore be the presence of a small direct magnetic field. The anhysteretic remanence intensity is normally proportional to the strength of the direct field. This proportionality, a specific magnetization for unit applied direct field, is termed anhysteretic susceptibility by King et al. [1982]. An important difference between initial or low-field susceptibility and anhysteretic susceptibility is that in the latter there is no contribution from paramagnetic and diamagnetic components in the sample. Further, because of their coercivities, typically much higher than the normal range of alternating fields applied, hematite and goethite contribute minimally to anhysteretic susceptibility. The contribution of magnetite is thus enhanced, which can be important in rocks where the concentration of Alleghenian or younger in age. Our method has the magnetite is particularly low, e. g., limestones potential to determine palcostress directions in carbonates elsewhere, provided our assumptions are correct...|$|R

The chert nodules were formed by silicification of carbonate deposit, what is proved by silicified skeletal remains of carbonate fauna. The primary deposit formed in aerobic and sometimes evaporitic conditions was permeable, not lithified, and contained some per cent of SiO 2. The silicification advanced either radially from the centre outwards, {{or from the}} outer surface inwards. In the latter case, a precursor of chert nodule was probably a carbonate nodule. The formation of chert nodules proceeded in two stages. In the first stage, the primary <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> were silicified but preserved, while in the second one they were destroyed. Simultaneously, the organic matter and iron were removed. Lithification advanced from the outer surface inwards. At first, the whole nodule was in a semi-plastic state, what is proved by the occurrence of plastic deformations. Some deformations have been induced by earthquake tremors. With aging of the nodule, only its outer, indurated part underwent cracking. The cortex was developed mostly after nodule's lithification {{at the expense of}} the outer part of the nodule, and it entered into the nodule's interior along the cracks.

Chloritoid's intrinsic degree of anisotropy of 1. 47 ± 0. 06, suggests that chloritoid-bearing slates can have {{a high degree of}} anisotropy without the need of invoking a significant contribution of strongly anisotropic ferromagnetic (s. l.) minerals. To validate this assumption we performed a texture analysis on a representative sample of the chloritoid-bearing slates using hard X-ray synchrotron diffraction. The preferred orientation patterns of both muscovite and chloritoid are extremely strong (∼ 38. 6 m. r. d. for muscovite, 20. 9 m. r. d. for chloritoid) and display roughly axial symmetry about the minimum magnetic susceptibility axis, indeed suggesting that chloritoid may have a profound impact on the magnetic <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> chloritoid-bearing <b>rocks.</b> However, modeling the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility by averaging single crystal properties indicates that the CPO of chloritoid only partially explains the slate's anisotropy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Anisotropy of {{magnetic}} susceptibility (AMS) {{is often used}} {{as a proxy for}} mineral fabric in deformed rocks. To do so quantitatively, it is necessary to quantify the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy of single crystals of rock-forming minerals. Amphiboles are common in mafic igneous and metamorphic rocks and often define rock texture due to their general prismatic crystal habits. Amphiboles may dominate the magnetic anisotropy in intermediate to felsic igneous rocks and in some metamorphic rock types, because they have a high Fe concentration and they can develop a strong crystallographic preferred orientation. In this study, the AMS is characterized in 28 single crystals and I crystal aggregate of compositionally diverse clino- and ortho-amphiboles. High-field methods were used to isolate the paramagnetic component of the anisotropy, which is unaffected by ferromagnetic inclusions that often occur in amphibole crystals. Laue imaging, laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and Mossbauer spectroscopy were performed to relate the magnetic anisotropy to crystal structure and Fe concentration. The minimum susceptibility is parallel to the crystallographic a*-axis and the maximum susceptibility is generally parallel to the crystallographic b-axis in tremolite, actinolite, and hornblende. Gedrite has its minimum susceptibility along the a-axis, and maximum susceptibility aligned with c. In richterite, however, the intermediate susceptibility is parallel to the b-axis and the minimum and maximum susceptibility directions are distributed in the a-c plane. The degree of anisotropy, k', increases generally with Fe concentration, following a linear trend: k' = 1. 61 x 10 (- 9) Fe - 1. 17 x 10 (- 9) m(3) /kg. Additionally, it may depend on the Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratio. For most samples, the degree of anisotropy increases by a factor of approximately 8 upon cooling from room temperature to 77 K. Fen-oactinolite, one pargasite crystal and riebeckite show a larger increase, which is related to the onset of local ferromagnetic (s. l.) interactions below about 100 K. This comprehensive data set increases our understanding of the magnetic structure of amphiboles, and it is central to interpreting magnetic <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> whose AMS is controlled by amphibole minerals...|$|R

40|$|Low yields in {{ornamental}} rock mining remain one of {{the most}} important problems in this industry. This fact is usually associated with the presence of anisotropies in the rock, which makes it difficult to extract the blocks. An optimised planning of the exploitation, together with an improved geological understanding of the deposit, could increase these yields. In this work, marble mining in Macael (Spain) was studied to test the capacity of non-destructive geophysical prospecting methods (GPR and ERI) as tools to characterize the geology of the deposit. It is well-known that the ERI method provides a greater penetration depth. By using this technique, it is possible to distinguish the boundaries between the marble and the underlying micaschists, the morphology of the unit to be exploited, and even fracture zones to be identified. Therefore, this technique could be used in the early stages of research, to estimate the reserves of the deposit. The GPR methodology, with a lower penetration depth, is able to offer more detailed information. Specifically, it detects lateral and vertical changes of the facies inside the marble unit, as well as the anisotropies <b>of</b> the <b>rock</b> (fractures or holes).

The AMS fabric might allow us to reconstruct transport directions of unconsolidated tsunami sediments during emplacement because AMS provides a cryptic alignment of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic minerals.

In the AMS <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> volcanic <b>rocks,</b> there are large discrepancies between the magnetic lineation and the framework-forming silicate linear fabric.

40|$|The {{anisotropy}} {{of magnetic}} susceptibility (AMS) <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> can {{be composed of}} contributions from ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic minerals. However, in general the AMS of only one fraction is of interest. While there are several approaches to isolate the ferromagnetic contribution to the AMS, {{the separation of the}} diamagnetic from the paramagnetic contribution is still problematic. A new method for the separation of these two contributions based on high-field torque measurements at room and low-temperature is presented. The paramagnetic anisotropy increases at low temperature according to the Curie-Weiss law, whereas the diamagnetic contribution is temperature independent. If the paramagnetic AMS is due to perfectly oblate or prolate minerals and the ratio of the susceptibility differences at two temperatures is known, paramagnetic and diamagnetic AMS can be separated. When measuring in fields high enough to saturate the ferromagnetic phases all three contributions to the AMS can be separated. The separation of paramagnetic and diamagnetic AMS is demonstrated on natural crystals and synthetic calcite-muscovite aggregates.

Complex Cenozoic faulting (normal and strike-slip) of several ages has strongly deformed the anorthosite, which is tectonically floored by a thick zone of mylonitized gneiss along which important post-late Cretaceous (?) thrust movement probably occurred, and at least the western part of which is underlain by a major thrust fault, as shown by the distribution of the main shock and aftershocks of the February 9, 1971 San Fernando earthquake. Abundant textural and structural evidence suggests that bottom crystal accumulation has produced the classic anorthosite-gabbro-syenite differentiation suite (andesine anorthosite-leuconorite-norite-jotunite-mangerite-syenite-quartz syenite) making up this body. All the <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> this suite appear to be relatively iron-enriched; extensive deuteric uralitization of pyroxene in all but the last intruded rocks suggests that the magma probably was also relatively water-rich. In {{the lower part of the}} intrusion, extensive "annealing" recrystallization, especially of anorthosite, has strongly modified the original <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rock.</b> Some rocks near the top of the body (jotunite and syenite) contain small amounts of pigeonite, both in the cores of strongly zoned pigeonite-augite crystals and as uninverted remnants in hypersthene inverted from original pigeonite, suggesting a relatively shallow depth of crystallization...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Karakorum Range {{comprises}} a crustal {{section of}} marbles and metapelites providing {{an opportunity to}} study the extent of high-temperature metamorphic reequilibration in an active orogen. Metamorphism culminated during the Mio-Pliocene, at 6 - 7 Ma. Peak metamorphic conditions increased from south to north, i. e. from (1) the Upper Anchizone grade (lawsonite, chlorite-smectite) to (2) lower granulite migmatite grade (HT∼ 800 °C) conditions along strike of a 30 -km section perpendicular to the structural <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rocks.</b> The metamorphic section can be separated into two domains: 1. A domain with low to transitional metamorphic conditions, {{with respect to the}} HT zone, where initial bedding is preserved. These moderate PT conditions prevailed during the main tectonic stacking event (50 - 37 Ma), prior to the Mio-Pliocene event. In this domain, metamorphism is governed by fluid-assisted grain-scale diffusion, as suggested by the progressive coarsening of minerals with increasing metamorphic grade and the preservation of sedimentary δ 13 C signatures in carbonates. A low thermal gradient (17 °C/km) is derived from P-T estimates of the prograde metamorphic sequences. 2. A higher-grade metamorphic domain where, by contrast, the metamorphic style is dominated by advection of heat with magmatic intrusions involving mantle melts during the recent tectonic history (20 - 3 Ma). Strong devolatilisation of CO 2 and partial melting of the metapelites triggered mixing up of carbonated and pelitic lithologies resulting in ultramafic restites and calc-silicate mobilisates. The δ 13 C isotopic composition of carbonates is widely modified, though locally preserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] An ophicalcite {{occurrence}} {{is recorded}} in the uppermost part of the Precambrian ophiolitic serpentinites at Gebel Mohagara (Wadi Ghadir area) in the Egyptian Eastern Desert. In this locality, the serpentinites and their ophicalcites are sometimes directly overlain by pelagic shales and calcareous sediments along thrust planes. Field relations suggest that these ophicalcites are present as serpentine-carbonate breccias that develop along conjugate shear planes and brecciation zones. Typical sedimentary features are common, such {{as the presence of}} micritic carbonate, colloform texture, geopetal-like structures and the presence of vugs. The latter are often filled by coarse calcite spars due to diagenesis and neomorphism. Another older type of less brecciated ophicarbonates (ophimagnesites) is also present and shows extensive replacement of serpentine minerals by magnesite. The ophicalcites are considered as sedimentary breccias formed in a weathered serpentinite lithology with <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> typical calichified <b>rocks.</b> It is believed that the calichified serpentinites represent a reworked oceanic calcite that have been formed after the abduction of the ophiolite nappe on the continent. The dissolution of the calcareous material in the pelagic cap furnished the needed carbonate influx to fill the brecciated serpentinit...|$|R
40|$|The studied mafic-ultramafic rock {{association}} occurs within Archean tonalitic gneisses and metasupracrustal suites of the Astridal belt {{belonging to}} the West Troms Basement Complex in the northwestern part of the Senja Island. The rock association appears in lens-shaped bodies, up to 200 m long, which are oriented conformal to the major metamorphic <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the host <b>rock.</b> The rock association is made up by interlayered units of green spinel-bearing olivine orthopyroxene-hornblendite, hornblende peridotite, olivine hornblendite, hornblendite and amphibolite (metagabbroic rock). Microscope studies and whole rock geochemical data indicate that the ultramafic rocks represent a single magmatic series of mafic and ultramafic olivine-amphibole cumulates, which have been significantly affected by metamorphism. Igneous mineral and whole rock trace element data indicate MORB affinity of the cumulates and suggest their emplacement in oceanic rift or rifted continental margin setting. The studied cumulates may represent a crustal remnant of the Paleoproterozic Svecofennian ocean. The rocks were metamorphosed together with the supracrustal suites of the Astridal belt during the major Svecofennian event about 1. 74 Ga ago as indicated by a U-Pb age of metamorphic zircons from the metagabbroic rock {{belonging to the}} studied suite...|$|R
40|$|During Leg 134, the {{influence}} of ridge collision and subduction on the structural evolution of island arcs was investigated by drilling at a series of sites in the collision zone between the d'Entrecasteaux Zone (DEZ) and the central New Hebrides Island Arc. The DEZ is an arcuate Eocene-Oligocene submarine volcanic chain that extends from the northern New Caledonia Ridge to the New Hebrides Trench. High magnetic susceptibilities and intensities of magnetic remanence were measured in volcanic silts, sands, siltstones, and sandstones from collision zone sites. This chapter presents the preliminary results of studies of magnetic mineralogy, magnetic properties, and magnetic <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> sediments and <b>rocks</b> from Sites 827 through 830 in the collision zone. The dominant carrier of remanence in the highly magnetic sediments and sedimentary rocks in the DEZ is low-titanium titanomagnetite of variable particle size. Changes in rock magnetic properties reflect variations in the abundance and size of titanomagnetite particles, which result from differences in volcanogenic contribution and {{the presence or absence}} of graded beds. Although the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility results are difficult to interpret in terms of regional stresses because the cores were azimuthally unoriented, the shapes of the susceptibility ellipsoids provide information about deformation style. The magnetic <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> most samples is oblate, dominated by foliation, as is the structural <b>fabric.</b> The variability <b>of</b> degree of anisotropy (P) and a factor that measures the shape of the ellipsoid (q) reflect the patchy nature of deformation, at a micrometer scale, that is elucidated by scanning electron microscope analysis. The nature of this patchiness implies that deformation in the shear zones is accomplished primarily by motion along bedding planes, whereas the material within the beds themselves remains relatively undeformed...|$|R
40|$|The Moresby Seamount {{detachment}} (MSD) in the Woodlark Basin (offshore Papua New Guinea) {{is a large}} active low-angle detachment excellently exposed at the seafloor, {{and cutting}} through mafic metamorphic <b>rocks.</b> Hydrothermal infiltration <b>of</b> quartz followed by that of calcite occurred during cataclastic deformation. Subsequent deformation of these a priori softer minerals leads to mylonite formation in the MSD. This study aims at {{a better understanding of}} the deformation mechanism switch from cataclastic to plastic flow. Deformation <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> the fault <b>rocks</b> were analyzed by light-optical microscopy. Rheologically critical phases were mapped to determine distributions and area proportions, and EBSD was used to measure crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Strong calcite CPOs indicate dominant dislocation creep. Quartz CPOs, however, are weak and more difficult to interpret, suggesting at least some strain accommodation by diffusion creep mechanisms. When quartz aggregates are intermixed with the polymineralic mylonite matrix diffusion creep grain boundary sliding may be dominant. The syntectonic conversion from mafic cataclasites to more siliceous and carbonaceous mylonites induced by hydrothermal processes is a critical weakening mechanism enabling the MSD to at least intermittently plastic flow at low shear stresses. This is probably a crucial process for the operation of low-angle detachments in hydrated and dominantly mafic crust...|$|R
