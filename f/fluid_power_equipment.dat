40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a co-simulation method for <b>fluid</b> <b>power</b> driven machinery <b>equipment,</b> i. e. oil hydraulic machinery. In {{these types of}} machinery, the fluid-structure interaction affects the end-product performance to a large extent, hence an efficient co-simulation method is of high importance. The proposed method {{is based on a}} 1 D system model representing the fluid components of the hydraulic machinery, within which structural 3 D Finite Element (FE) models can be incorporated for detailed simulation of specific sub-models or complete structural assemblies. This means that the fluid system simulation will get a more accurate structural response, and that the structural simulation will get more correct fluid loads at every time step, compared to decoupled analysis. Global system parameters such as fluid flow, performance and efficiency can be evaluated from the 1 D system model simulation results. From the 3 D FE-models, it is possible to evaluate displacements, stresses and strains to be used in stress analysis, fatigue evaluation, acoustic analysis, etc. The method has been implemented using two well-known simulation tools for <b>fluid</b> <b>power</b> system simulations and FE-simulations, respectively, where the interface between the tools is realised by use of the Functional Mock-up Interface standard. A simple but relevant model is used to validate the method. Funding Agencies|Atlas Copco Construction Tools</p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to estimate the impact (energy, emissions and economics) of United <b>Fluid</b> <b>power</b> (hydraulic and pneumatic actuation) is the generation, control, and application of pumped or compressed <b>fluids</b> when this <b>power</b> is used to provide force and motion to mechanisms. This form of mechanical power {{is an integral part}} of United States (U. S.) manufacturing and transportation. In 2008, according to the U. S. Census Bureau, sales of <b>fluid</b> <b>power</b> components exceeded $ 17. 7 B, sales of systems using <b>fluid</b> <b>power</b> exceeded $ 226 B. As large as the industry is, it has had little fundamental research that could lead to improved efficiency since the late 1960 s (prior to the 1970 energy crisis). While there have been some attempts to replace <b>fluid</b> <b>powered</b> components with electric systems, its performance and rugged operating condition limit the impact of simple part replacement. Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National <b>Fluid</b> <b>Power</b> Association (NFPA) collaborated with 31 industrial partners to collect and consolidate energy specific measurements (consumption, emissions, efficiency) of deployed <b>fluid</b> <b>power</b> systems. The {{objective of}} this study was to establish a rudimentary order of magnitude estimate of the energy consumed by <b>fluid</b> <b>powered</b> systems. The analysis conducted in this study shows that <b>fluid</b> <b>powered</b> systems consumed between 2. 0 and 2. 9 Quadrillion (1015) Btus (Quads) of energy per year; producing between 310 and 380 million metric tons (MMT) of Carbon Dioxide (CO 2).
