Today, the community of Catalonia has more than twenty organizations that require technical maintenance specialist certifying aircraft and/or <b>helicopters</b> <b>turbine</b> and/or piston, as well as who can certify avionics maintenance performed on systems electric aircraft. In contrast, there is no maintenance training organization in the fields of helicopters and avionics. Therefore, the aim of this project is to create an organization for training in specialties not currently in Catalonia. In order {{to make the most of}} existing resources, it was necessary to visit and learn the means of which have different maintenance organizations as Heliswiss Iberica, Inaer, Aero Link, SHSC Helicopters, EFAV and Illa dels Banyols institute. The most obvious conclusion is that the helicopter maintenance companies and/or avionics have to hire skilled in aircraft and then train them in-house, instead of being able to hire technicians trained directly in the fields of helicopters and/or avionics. The procedures and training plans developed in this project provide trained technicians in schools and Banyols EFAV a curriculum to expand their skills to the needs of companies of helicopters and/or avionics, fully complying with requirements established by the European Aviation Safety Agency...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Operational modal {{analysis}} (OMA) allows {{to identify the}} modal parameters from the measured response to unknown random perturbations of a mechanical structure in operation. However, in all applications with rotating components (e. g. <b>helicopters,</b> <b>turbines,</b> diesel motors, …), the structural vibration in operation {{is a combination of}} the response to the random perturbation and the harmonic excitation due to the rotating components. Classical OMA methods fail if the harmonic disturbance is close to, or coincides with a resonance frequency of the structure. Therefore, these methods have been extended to deal with harmonic disturbances with a known, fixed frequency. However, in many applications (e. g. <b>helicopters,</b> wind <b>turbines,</b> diesel motors, …) the frequencies of the harmonic disturbances vary in time. This paper presents three methods for suppressing the influence of harmonic disturbances with unknown varying frequencies in operational {{modal analysis}}. Two of these methods can handle the case where the peak of the harmonic disturbance and the resonance peak completely overlap. The performance of the three methods is illustrated on simulations and real helicopter data...|$|R

The landing gear failure was found to have resulted from prior cracking; the engine bearing failure was caused by fatigue of the roller bearing cage; and the <b>helicopter</b> <b>turbine</b> blade failure was a result of large brittle precipitates at the surface of the cast structure of the blade/disc combination from which a fatigue crack had grown...|$|R

5000|$|In late 1956, the United States Department of the Army {{announced}} plans to replace the Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave, which was powered by piston engines, with a new, gas turbine-powered <b>helicopter.</b> <b>Turbine</b> engines were also a key design feature of the smaller UH-1 [...] "Huey" [...] utility helicopter. Following a design competition, in September 1958, a joint Army-Air Force source selection board recommended that the Army procure the Vertol medium transport helicopter. However, funding for full-scale development was not then available, and the Army vacillated on its design requirements. Some in Army Aviation thought that the new helicopter should be a light tactical transport aimed at taking over the missions of the old piston-engined Piasecki H-21 and Sikorsky H-34 helicopters, and be consequently capable of carrying about 15 troops (one squad). Another faction in Army Aviation thought that the new helicopter should be much larger {{to be able to}} airlift a large artillery piece, and have enough internal space to carry the new MGM-31 [...] "Pershing" [...] Missile System.|$|R
