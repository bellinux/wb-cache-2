In addition, the ecological niche of a species may also be affected by landscape composition; particularly, agricultural fragmentation may greatly influence the trophic behavior of herbivores. We studied trophic niche variation in <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chickens</b> (Tympanuchus cupido), a grouse species that shows moderate sex-dimorphism. <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chickens</b> are native to tallgrass prairies of North America, although populations persist in less natural mosaics of cropland and native habitats.

We found that females showed broader niches and higher individual specialization than males, especially in winter and autumn. However, differences between females and males were smaller in spring when birds converge at leks, suggesting that females and males may exhibit similar feeding behaviors during the lekking period. In addition, we found that birds living in native prairies showed greater annual trophic variability than conspecifics in agricultural mosaic landscapes.

40|$|Recent {{wind energy}} {{development}} in the Great Plains of North America {{has given rise to}} concerns of potential impacts on the <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus). Recent studies in fragmented landscapes have suggested greater prairie-chickens may avoid wind facilities, which may lead to habitat loss and negative impacts on reproduction and survival. But, it is unknown if there is a similar effect in contiguous grass landscapes. Thus, we investigated the effect of a pre-existing, 36 -turbine wind energy facility on <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> nesting, brood-rearing, and spatial ecology in the Nebraska Sandhills. We captured and marked 78 female greater prairie-chickens along a 24 -km disturbance gradient leading away from the wind facility in 2013 and 2014, and used radio and satellite telemetry to monitor females throughout the breeding seasons. We located and monitored 91 nests and 31 broods, and recorded habitat, temporal, and weather covariates for nest and brood locations throughout the study period. Proximity to the wind energy facility did not affect <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> nest site preference or nest survival. We also found no effect of the wind energy facility on <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> brood site preference or survival. With regard to <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> spatial ecology, we found no significant difference between home range area for females that were near or far from the wind energy facility, and no association of space use with distance to the nearest wind turbine for females in close proximity to the wind energy facility. Our results suggest that <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> nesting, brood-rearing, and spatial ecology is not influenced by the presence of the wind energy facility in an unfragmented grassland landscape.

40|$|Populations of <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chickens</b> (Tympanuchus cupido) {{have been}} declining because {{of loss and}} {{fragmentation}} of tallgrass prairie habitats, and management plans require contemporary demographic data. Our objectives were to determine whether maternal nutrition or predation were determinants of nesting success and female survival. We captured and radio-marked 43 females at four leks in natural, unfragmented prairie during a 4 -year study. Reproductive potential was high because females laid large clutches (10. 9 ± 0. 3 eggs, n = 24), renested following clutch loss (22. 2 %, n = 27 females), and had high egg viability (88. 6 ± 5. 0 % of eggs hatched; n = 7 nests), but reproductive traits {{were not correlated with}} female morphometrics (mass, or tarsus and keel lengths). Daily survival rate of nests was low (0. 928, n = 34 nests) resulting in a predicted nest success rate of 7. 4 % for a 35 -day exposure period. We used known fate models to estimate weekly survival from telemetry data for 40 females. Weekly survival was 0. 970 and the extrapolated survival rate for the 6 -month breeding season was 45. 7 %. Using time-since-marking Cormack-Jolly-Seber models for live encounter data to control for transience, annual apparent survival was 0. 277 ± 0. 081 SE for 55 marked females after initial capture, and 0. 424 ± 0. 139 during subsequent intervals. Survival of females was 1. 6 to 2. 0 times higher during the nonbreeding season than the breeding season, presumably because females are susceptible to predation during incubation and brood-rearing. Predation of nests and females may be the main demographic factors limiting population viability because predation, and not maternal nutrition, accounted for unexpectedly low nesting success and breeding season survival of <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chickens</b> in natural habitats.

40|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> (Tympanuchus cupido pinnata) are a {{grassland}} {{bird species}} of conservation concern. Although <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> have declined {{over much of}} their range, the Nebraska Sandhills has the largest population in North America. However, the responses of nest and brood site selection and survival to vegetation characteristics are unknown. I studied prairie-chickens on private rangelands in Rock and Brown Counties from 2009 - 2011. I fitted 139 females with radio collars to locate nest and brood sites and to determine nest and brood survival rates. Females were trapped on leks during the breeding season and I monitored them throughout the summer using radio telemetry. At nest and brood sites, I collected vegetation structure and composition data. Plant composition was estimated by functional groups using a quadrat method and vegetation structure was measured using the Robel pole and coverboard. I identified the ecological site and plant community at each nest and brood site. I then sampled to determine the relative availability of ecological sites and plant communities in each pasture to assess preference at a macroscale level. I also collected weather data throughout the reproductive season to assess variation in nest and brood survival. Prairie-chicken females tended to choose upland ecological sites for nesting and brood-rearing. Nest sites had more vegetation cover (VOR) (mean VOR: 10. 8 cm; SD= 0. 7) than coupled random sites (mean VOR: 4. 6 cm; SD= 0. 4). Nest site selection is positively associated with moderate levels of VOR and residual vegetation. Daily nest survival was poorly associated with habitat measures and was marginally associated with weather and temporal effects. Brood-rearing sites tended to have higher VOR and LD (mean VOR: 6. 92 cm, SD= 0. 62; mean LD: 0. 06 cm, SD= 0. 1) than at coupled random locations (mean VOR: 6. 45 cm, SD= 0. 37; mean LD: 0. 05 cm, SD= 0. 1).

I investigated the effects of wind turbine noise on male <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) vocalizations and chorus near Ainsworth, NE, USA in 2013 and 2014. I studied 14 leks located in the area surrounding a 36 -turbine wind energy facility. I used two main approaches in this study. First, I recorded <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chicken</b> boom, cackle, whine, and whoop vocalizations {{at each of the}} study leks and measured the duration, sound pressure level, peak frequency, dominant frequency, fundamental frequency, bandwidth and nonlinearities of each vocalization. I used linear models to determine whether the vocalizations at leks near the wind energy facility differed from vocalizations at leks farther away. I found that within 1000 meters of the wind energy facility, boom and whoop sound pressure levels were higher, boom duration was shorter, whine fundamental frequency was higher, and cackle biphonations occurred less often. These differences suggest that male Greater Prairie-Chickens are adjusting aspects of their vocalizations in response to wind turbine noise. In the second approach, I placed audio recorders along transects extending from leks to record the sound of the <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chicken</b> chorus. I also placed audio recorders at locations in a grid formation overlaid on the wind energy facility. I created models to describe how the chorus and wind turbine noise were affected by covariates. I used the models to predict levels of the chorus and wind turbine noise and assess the potential for wind turbine noise to mask the chorus under specific scenarios. The results suggested that wind turbine noise may have the potential to mask the <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chicken</b> chorus at 296 Hz under these scenarios, but the extent and degree of masking is uncertain.

40|$|The {{potential}} effects of wind energy development on wildlife have received increased attention {{over the past}} decade. In Kansas, optimal sites for wind energy development often overlap with preferred habitats of <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> Tympanuchus cupido. Our goal {{was to determine whether}} wind energy development affected survival of female prairie-chickens in a grassland ecosystem, assessing one potential impact of wind on an upland gamebird of conservation concern. We focused primarily on the response of female prairie-chickens to wind energy development because population dynamics of prairie-chickens are primarily determined by female demography. We monitored prairie-chickens at a wind facility in Kansas during a 2 -year pre-construction (2007 – 2008) and a 3 -year post-construction period (2009 – 2011). We used data from 220 radio-marked females to calculate weekly survival and hazard rates. We used cause of death for 81 mortality events to test for changes in the proportion of mortalities attributed to mammalian predators, avian predators and collisions. We observed an unexpected increase in annual survival during the post-construction period (0 · 57) compared with the pre-construction period (0 · 32). Distance from home range centroid to the nearest wind turbine site had no effect on weekly survival of females. Collision mortality events were rare, and most were associated with fences or transmission lines and not turbine blades. Most female mortality was due to predation (c. 90 %). Differences in annual survival were driven by a higher risk of mortality during lekking activity in March and April during the pre-construction period (weekly hazard rate = 0 · 050 – 0 · 062) compared with the post-construction period (hazard rate = 0 · 012 – 0 · 021). We observed no change in the proportion of mortalities attributed to different causes between the two treatment periods. Synthesis and applications. Development of a wind energy facility had no negative effect on survival of female prairie-chickens. The results of our field study indicate that <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> are less sensitive to wind energy development than lesser prairie-chickens Tympanuchus pallidicinctus and greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus are to oil and gas development.

40|$|Ring-Necked Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) {{populations have}} {{declined}} in the Midwest since the 1960 ’s. Research has suggested decreased nest and brood survival are the major causes of this decline {{due to the lack}} of suitable habitat. Habitat degradation has been attributed to the shift to larger crop fields, lower diversity of crops, and more intensive pesticide and herbicide use. A primary goal of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is to mitigate the loss of wildlife habitat. Early research found that CRP increased the amount of suitable nesting and brood rearing cover for both species but the habitat may start to deteriorate later in the contract. From 2005 to 2006, I studied nest and brood habitat selection and survival of Ring-necked Pheasants in an area where portions of CRP fields had been disced and interseeded in order to rejuvenate the grass stand and to set it back to an early successional stage. I found pheasant hens selected areas in disced and interseeded CRP (DI-CRP) to nest and rear broods over other grassland types. Within fields, I found hens selected areas with high forb content and vegetation density. I also found pheasant nests and broods had an higher survival rate in DI-CRP fields. From 2007 to 2008, I studied nest and brood habitat selection and survival of Greater Prairie-chickens in an area where the population seemed to rebound after the introduction of CRP. I found hens selected nest sites in CRP fields and these nests had an higher success rate compared to other habitat types. <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-chicken</b> broods also selected CRP fields; however, a disproportionate time spent in these fields did not correspond to advantages in brood survival. Higher forb cover corresponded to higher survival of both nests and broods. My research suggests CRP plays an integral part in fulfilling the habitat requirements of these upland game birds.

Understanding the spatial patterns of exposure to dipteran vectors and their associated pathogens is critical for epidemiological research to target prevention and control of vector-borne infectious diseases. In recent years, Western Equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile Virus encephalitis and avian malaria have not only been a public health concern but also a conservation concern, specifically the conservation of grassland nesting birds. Although the central Great Plains is the most specious region for grassland nesting birds, {{their role in the}} enzootic (primary) amplification cycle of infectious diseases may lead to further population depressions, and could potentially result in spill-over events to humans and livestock. The goals of my thesis were 1) to identify the underlying causes of spatio-temporal abundance patterns of mosquito vectors within the grasslands of the eastern Smoky Hills, and 2) to create probabilistic distributions of functional disease vectors, to evaluate disease risk in <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido, surrogate species for other grassland nesting birds). First, I found that temporal dynamics in mosquito abundances were explained by maximum and minimum temperature indices. Spatial dynamics in mosquito abundances were best explained by environmental variables, such as curvature, TWI (Topographic Wetness Index), distance to woodland and distance to road. Second, the overall predictive power of the ecological niche models of important vector species in the grasslands of the Smoky Hills was better than random predictions, indicating that the most important predictor variables in their distribution were: distance to water, TWI, AASHTO (soil particle size distribution), and mean temperature during the coldest quarter. Furthermore, the spatial analysis indicated that <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-chicken</b> nest in areas with a higher probability of vector occurrence than other potentially available habitats within the grasslands.

40|$|As {{is often}} the case, the spring season had {{something}} for everyone: potential range expansions, an incredible shorebird migration through the eastern Rainwater Basin, a scarcity of migrant warblers, and some genuinely rare birds. Timely spring rainfall transformed the Rainwater Basin, leaving large areas of sheetwater for migrant shorebirds and improving the attractiveness of wetlands, particularly renovated wetlands, to certain breeding species. Perhaps the most important bits of information we can record here are changes in breeding ranges or behavior. Of significance here is the second nesting record for Hooded Merganser, the increasing occurrence of <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chickens</b> at Rainwater Basin grasslands, the return of Mississippi Kites to Red Cloud, nesting Black-necked Stilts and American Avocets in the Rainwater Basin, discovery of Barn Owls in northeast Nebraska, expansion into the state of Scissor-tailed Flycatchers, possible breeding of Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcrackers on the Pine Ridge, the continued feeding of grackle and robin chicks by the Sioux Co Curve-billed Thrasher (now {{considered to be a}} Husker), increasing evidence of Spotted Towhee introgression at Schramm State Park, and extra-limital nestings of Pine Siskin. The shorebird migration through the Rainwater Basin was one for the ages, with record numbers of Hudsonian Godwits, Ruddy Turnstones, Dunlin, and Buff-breasted Sandpipers found. Numbers of other species were also high, and L Mcconaughy contributed with a record count of Whimbrels. On the other hand, migrant warblers were drastically lower in numbers, notably Nashville Warbler (8), Chestnut-sided Warbler (3), Magnolia Warbler (1), Black-throated Green Warbler (1), and Blackburnian Warbler (0). What this means will have to wait for a regional or national perspective. Rarities were in evidence also, with some real 2 ̆ 2 zooties 2 ̆ 2 : Black-bellied Whistling-Duck, Anhinga, Glossy Ibis, White-tailed Kite, Red Knot, Ruff, Little Gull, White-eyed Vireo (in Sioux Co, no less), and Connecticut Warbler...|$|R

"May 2012 "Few rigorous studies have evaluated translocation as a management tool, despite frequent use of the technique in conservation settings. We used radiotelemetry to compare survival, habitat use, and movements among 58 resident and 54 translocated <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> (Tympanuchus cupido) between March and August, 2010 and 2011 within a landscape structured after the Partners in Flight Bird Conservation Area Model (PIF model). Results indicated lower survival in translocated prairie-chickens than in residents, and in agricultural and private grassland habitats than in core protected prairie habitats. Habitat use did not differ between resident and translocated birds and a ranking of habitat preference indicated that birds preferred prairie, agriculture, private grassland and wooded habitats sequentially. We also found that fences and trees reduced the amount of useable space within prairie, as birds avoided areas near these features. Post-translocation movements of birds were exploratory, search oriented, and substantially larger and more frequent than those of resident birds. Our research illustrates that the survival and movement of recently translocated birds differs from resident birds. Our results also question the efficacy of the PIF model for prairie-chickens, as birds preferred core prairie habitats over other habitats within the landscape and they also experienced lower survival outside of these core areas...|$|R
40|$|Until {{recently}} the severe {{decline in the}} populations of many species of grassland birds in eastern North America has aroused relatively little concern or conservation action. This response appears to be rooted in the perception that grassland birds invaded the East Coast from western grasslands after European settlers cleared the forest. Detailed historical accounts and analysis of pollen deposits, however, show that open grasslands existed on the East Coast of North America {{at the time of}} European settlement. Extensive grasslands resulted from burning and agricultural clearing by Native Americans. Natural disturbances, such as wildfire and beaver (Castor canadensis) activity, produced grasslands even before Native Americans cleared the forest. The presence of specialized grassland birds in Pleistocene deposits and in the earliest ornithological collections from eastern North America, and the existence of distinctive eastern populations of the <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido), Henslows Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), indicate that grassland birds are an ancient component of biological diversity on the heavily forested East Coast of North America...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{understood}} that landscape processes can affect habitat selection patterns, move-ments, and species persistence. These selection patterns may be altered or even elimi-nated {{as a result}} of changes in disturbance regimes and a concomitant management focus on uniform, moderate disturbance across landscapes. To assess how restored landscape heterogeneity influences habitat selection patterns, we examined 21 years (1991, 1993 – 2012) of <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido) lek location data in tallgrass prairie with restored fire and grazing processes. Our study took place at The Nature Conservancy’s Tallgrass Prairie Preserve located at the southern extent of Flint Hills in northeastern Okla-homa. We specifically addressed stability of lek locations {{in the context of the}} fire-grazing interaction, and the environmental factors influencing lek locations. We found that lek loca-tions were dynamic in a landscape with interacting fire and grazing. While previous conser-vation efforts have treated leks as stable with high site fidelity in static landscapes, a majority of lek locations in our study (i. e., 65 %) moved by nearly one kilometer on an annual basis in this dynamic setting. Lek sites were in elevated areas with low tree cover and lo...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{selection}} via female {{choice and}} male-male aggression leads to elaboration of male traits. If male traits correlated with reproductive success are honest signals of male quality, survival costs {{may be associated}} with the expression of those traits. Testosterone (hereafter ‘T’) may enhance male breeding success, but T can also reduce immunocompetence and survival. Socially monogamous male birds with higher circulating T experience reproductive advantages, but the role of T in lek mating systems is largely unknown. To address these issues, I individually marked and conducted focal behavioral observations of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) at five lek sites over a 5 -year period. Females were fitted with radio-telemetry to monitor nesting success and survival. I examined the relationship between male traits and mating success using multinomial discrete choice models, a statistical method not previously applied to studies of sexual selection. Male mating success was highly skewed at <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> leks with 18. 5 % of males obtaining 87. 2 % of all successful copulations (n = 108 males; 85 copulations). Mating success was influenced most by male behavior, followed by several morphological attributes. The role of T was quantified using blood samples and b...|$|E
40|$|This {{summer was}} a 2 ̆ 2 {{something}} for everyone 2 ̆ 2 season. Ecologists, already excited by the apparent ability of <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chickens</b> to lek in improbable habitats, such as corn fields and dirt edges of Rainwater Basin playas, will welcome the use by Lark Buntings and Vesper Sparrows of wheat stubble fields with a growing corn crop. The Vesper Sparrows of the east, a different subspecies {{from those in the}} north and west, have been at the mercy of full-tillage cropping systems, but now have a reprieve and may even be increasing because of no-till and minimum tillage methods currently in vogue due to high fuel prices and conservation benefits. White-faced Ibis again nested in several places, and Red-shouldered Hawk is showing signs of expanding from its limited range at Fontenelle Forest. Very exciting was the confirmation of breeding {{for the first time in}} Nebraska of Ash-throated Flycatcher, only the second record of the species 2 ̆ 7 occurrence in the state. Hopefully confirmation is soon to follow for Broad-tailed Hummingbird, which has now twice been reported during the breeding season. A phenomenon that may be applicable to those early migrant passerines that appear well before local breeders seem to have finished breeding and have even contemplated migration, is molt-migration. A recent article in Birding ([URL] discusses this strategy for such species as Dusky Flycatcher, Warbling Vireo, Western Tanager, Lazuli Bunting, and Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole, which is probably best known for its early departure from breeding areas for an intermediate staging area where it molts, and then continues to its wintering grounds. The possibility was raised by Ted Floyd that Chipping Sparrow might be in this group as well. Unfortunately, other than the existence of many such rather early fall records for various species in areas where breeding does not occur, Nebraska has little data to support or contradict this idea. Observers should continue to report obvious indications of early fall movement (flocking, appearance out of breeding habitat, disappearance of adults) ...|$|R
40|$|Wind energy {{development}} is targeted to meet 20 % of U. S. energy demand by 2030. In Kansas, optimal sites for wind {{energy development}} often overlap with preferred habitats of <b>Greater</b> <b>Prairie-Chickens</b> (Tympanuchus cupido), a lek-mating species of prairie grouse with declining populations. Our {{goal was to}} use movement data from radio telemetry to investigate patterns and drivers of seasonal space use by female prairie-chickens during pre- and post-construction periods at a wind energy facility in northcentral Kansas. We developed individual and population level resource utilization functions (RUFs) for four time periods: the 6 -month breeding and nonbreeding seasons during the pre-construction stage (2007 – 2008; n = 28 and 14 females), and the same two seasons during a post-construction period (2009 – 2011; n = 102 and 37). RUFs relate non-uniform space use within a home range to landscape metrics in a multiple regression framework. We selected ten predictor variables that described land cover, habitat patchiness, anthropogenic disturbance, and social behavior of prairie-chickens. We documented two behavioral responses of females to wind energy development during the breeding season: (1) mean home range size increased approximately two-fold, and (2) space use had a positive relationship with distance to turbine, which indicated female avoidance of wind turbines. A parallel study of demographic rates in our study population found no negative effects of wind energy development on prairie-chicken fecundity or survival, but persistent avoidance of wind energy development {{could result in the}} local extirpation of prairie-chicken populations at our study site. Our primary ecological finding was that distance to lek was the strongest predictor of space use during all treatment periods, with relatively high use of areas at short distances from leks in 79 % of female home ranges. Thus, lek site surveys should be effective for identifying prairie grouse habitat preferences and monitoring population dynamics when more intensive demographic studies are not feasible. Our study is the first application of resource utilization function techniques to a wildlife population in response to energy development, and our results provide new quantitative insights into the spatial ecology of an upland gamebird of conservation concern...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of pen-reared Attwater's prairie-chickens (APC, Tympanuchus cupido attwateri) {{into the wild}} to supplement existing populations has met with marginal success. Flight characteristics, predator avoidance behavior, and rearing methods are possible factors contributing to post-release mortality of pen-reared birds. To evaluate flight characteristics and predator avoidance behavior of pen-reared APC's released onto the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge, flight characteristics and predator avoidance behavior of pen-reared APC's was compared to wild <b>greater</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> (GPC, T. c. pinnatus) in Minnesota and Kansas using a radar gun and a trained dog. There was no difference (P = 0. 134) in flight speed for pen-reared APC and wild GPC. However, wild GPC had greater (P < 0. 001) flight distances than did pen-reared APC. Wild GPC and pen-reared APC that had survived in the wild {{for at least a}} year flushed at a greater (P < 0. 001) distance from an approaching human than did pen-reared APC that had been released for less than 3 months. A trained dog was able to approach closer (P < 0. 001) to APC than GPC before birds flushed, and APC did not fly as far as GPC after being flushed by the dog. Pen-reared APC displayed flight endurance deficiencies and were more approachable by humans and a dog before they flushed when compared to wild GPC, which could explain their increased mortality when released into the wild. To determine if APC chicks could be reared without daily human contact, pelleted food, and water in founts, a greenhouse was used to rear chicks in a semi-natural environment. Planted vegetation and commercial insects provided hiding cover and a food source for the APC chicks. An underground heat source provided chick warmth, and water misters and a sprinkler system simulated dew (a water source for chicks) and rain. The greenhouse provided chicks protection from predators and adverse weather conditions (before they could thermo-regulate) while exposing chicks to natural sunlight, day length, and temperature fluctuations. This technique allowed chicks to be reared in a semi-natural environment which reinforced their natural foraging behavior for food and water, and reinforced their hiding and avoidance behaviors, creating a wilder pen-reared bird...|$|R
