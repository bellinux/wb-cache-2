500|$|As a youth, he {{attended}} a five-day baseball fundamentals camp that his father runs for children ages 5–14. [...] His father was also his little league coach until he was 14. [...] His father said: [...] People would say Ike was good because his dad was a player. [...] But it's not that easy.... I can tell Ike how to swing, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> him to pitch, [...] the game of baseball, but he's {{the only one to}} make it to the big leagues. You can't teach heart and soul. That's what it takes to play in the game.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{win against}} Matthysse, {{negotiations}} {{for a fight}} against Kaizer Mabuza began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. I help guys {{to do the things}} that work for them. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you how to hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and do it the way that Zab knows how to do it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Kersten remained in Helsinki, where he studied therapy with the specialist Dr Colander, and after two years was awarded a certificate in physical therapy. He then left for Berlin, where he continued his studies and eventually became the pupil of a notable Chinese therapeutic masseur, Dr Ko, whom he had met at a dinner party. In 1925, Ko told Kersten [...] "You have learned all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you." [...] He then turned his practice over to Kersten and retired to Tibet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] {{cried the}} captain when Locker {{had entered the}} house, [...] "I was looking for you. We can run out, and have some fishing this morning. The tide will suit. You did so well {{yesterday}} that I think to-day. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> even <b>teach</b> you {{to take out a}} hook." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{misunderstand}} me, as usual, love. Work's {{the essence}} of life; but to expend precious unreturning vitality and real labour against imaginary danger, that is heartbreakingly absurd! If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>teach</b> a--a little toleration--a little ordinary kindness here toward that absurd old bogey you call the Death's Header, I shan't have lived in vain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>teach</b> you, Arthur, when I {{have so much}} {{to learn}} myself?" [...] she answered, simply, and from that moment, though she did not know it as yet, she loved him.|$|R
60|$|JOHN. Thank you, Lady Sybil. And {{who knows}} {{there may be}} one or two things <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you.|$|E
60|$|LIZA [rising determinedly] I'll let you {{see whether}} I'm {{dependent}} on you. If you can preach, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach.</b> I'll go and be a teacher.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. It {{was very}} foolish {{of me to}} attempt it. When I'm through Redmond I'll stick to teaching. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach.</b> I can't write stories." ...|$|E
5000|$|Simplicity is a {{focus on}} the {{essentials}} of faith and a lack of interest in the niceties of doctrinal definition. Shawe quotes Zinzendorf's remark that 'The Apostles say: [...] "We believe we have salvation through the grace of Jesus Christ ...." [...] If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>teach</b> a person that catechism I have made him a divinity scholar for all time'. From this simplicity flow secondary qualities of genuineness and practicality.|$|R
50|$|Born in Guyana, Rickford {{grew up in}} Palo Alto, California. His mother, Angela E. Rickford, is a {{professor}} of Special Education at San Jose State University and the author of <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Fly: <b>Teaching</b> Narratives and Reading Comprehension to African Americans and other Ethnic Minority Students. His father, John R. Rickford, an authority on African American Vernacular English and the author of numerous books and scholarly articles, teaches linguistics at Stanford University. Russell Rickford attended Gunn High School in Palo Alto and won a National Merit Scholarship.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Tell <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> but <b>teach</b> <b>I</b> cannot," [...] I said. [...] "The {{virtue of}} the Ring is only that he must go among folk in housen henceforward, doing what they want done, or what he knows they need, all Old England over. Never will he be his own master, nor yet ever any man's. He will get half he gives, and give twice what he gets, till his life's last breath; and if he lays aside his load before he draws that last breath, all his work will go for naught." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{give them}} {{the value of a}} penny, and I'll stick to my job. Perhaps, by {{flogging}} the bully <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> them to let me alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{come from}} home because I'm unhappy, and I {{mean to be}} a gipsy. I'll live with you, if you like, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you a great many things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what would}} they wish for? I can do {{something}} towards preparing them, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> Thekla, but I should {{like to know what}} you think would be best for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes--I will be {{exceedingly}} careful,' said Picotee, {{with great}} vivacity. 'And {{if there is}} time <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go on <b>teaching</b> them a little.' Then Picotee caught Ethelberta's eye, and colouring red, sank down beside her sister, whispering, 'I know why it is! But if you would rather have me with you I will go, and not once wish to stay.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1977, {{he said of}} his {{training}} at the Neighborhood Playhouse under Meisner, [...] "My work up to then had been very uneven. I would be good one night, dull the next. Meisner made me aware of how to be consistent in using the best that I have to offer. But <b>I</b> guess nobody <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you the knack, or whatever it is, that helps you come to life on stage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anne Shirley, don't let me {{hear you}} talking about your teacher in that way again," [...] said Marilla sharply. [...] "You don't go to school to criticize the master. <b>I</b> guess he <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> YOU something, and it's your {{business}} to learn. And I {{want you to understand}} right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him. That is something I won't encourage. I hope you were a good girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{should you}} like to be, Lillo? You might be a scholar. My father was a scholar, you know, and taught me a great deal. That {{is the reason why}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{come and}} see me some time. You will never be sorry. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you much. Come in the afternoon. My man is night {{watchman}} in the yards and sleeps of mornings. He's sleeping now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've seen me clumsy, in driving. You {{taught me}} to get over it. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you some things. And we'll study--together--evenings! I'm a {{thoroughly}} ignorant parasite woman. Make me become real! A real woman!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is a child, {{and that}} is all ye seem to see. Keep to that superstition if you must, but you {{perceive}} that this child understands this complex game of war as well as any of you; and if you want my opinion without the trouble of asking for it, here you have it without ruffles or embroideryby God, <b>I</b> think she <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> the best of you how to play it!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Grear {{started his}} {{teaching}} {{career at the}} University of Louisville, {{before moving on to}} the Rhode Island School of Design’s graphic design faculty from 1960 to 1998, serving as its chairman from 1965 through 1969. He has earned an international reputation as a leader in the field of design education and has received five honorary doctorates. [...] "I don't—indeed can't—teach students to be designers," [...] he says, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> and do <b>teach</b> attitudes and strategies that help them become designers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That 'rithmetic do bother me, an' no mistake," [...] he said, with a grave {{shake of}} the head at a lively lizard which was looking up in his face. [...] "You see, history is easy. What I knows <b>I</b> knows an' <b>can</b> <b>teach,</b> an' what <b>I</b> don't know I let alone, an there's an end on't. There's no makin' a better o' that. Then, as to writin', though my hand is crabbed enough, and my pot-hooks are shaky and sprawly, still I know the shapes o' things, an' the youngsters are so quick that they can most of 'em write better than myself; but in regard to that 'rithmetic, it's a heartbreak altogether, for I've only just got enough of it to puzzle me. Wi' the use o' my fingers <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do simple {{addition}} pretty well, an' <b>I</b> <b>can</b> screw round subtraction, but multiplication's a terrible business. Unfort'nitely my edication has carried me only the length o' the fourth line, an' that ain't enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps, after all,' she said, smiling, 'they {{may make}} of me {{something}} really useful and valuable, {{and it will}} all be owing to you, dear madame. Drawing and Italian! When <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> them, I shall be able to make grandmamma easy for life!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you. I {{think of}} making this my {{profession}} since I must do something. Mademoiselle earns heaps of money by it," [...] she said, sitting down to rest, resolved not {{to be ashamed of}} her work or to let Fanny pity her, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Breakfast," [...] said Rupert, firmly. [...] "If {{you don't}} {{know what it}} is, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you in half a minute. You play it with a pot of coffee, a knife and fork, and about a hundred-weight of {{scrambled}} eggs. Try it. It's a pastime that grows on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One thing I do think, {{that the}} being conversant only with {{thoughtful}} educated Christians {{may result in}} a person ignoring the simpler idea of the Eucharist which does not in the least divest it of its mysterious character, but rather, recognising the mystery, seeks for no solution of it. How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>teach</b> my fifteen Melanesian Communicants the points which I suppose an advanced Ritualist would regard as most essential? But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> give them the actual words of some of the ancient, really ancient, Liturgies, and teach them what Christ said, and St. Paul said, and the Church of England says, and bid them acquiesce in the mystery.|$|R
40|$|In this essay, I turn to Shakespeare {{for advice}} {{about how to}} {{alleviate}} {{the crisis in the}} humanities. University faculty and PhD students develop what I’ve called a dispositional immobility, a disposition to do what they do only in an academic setting. I think humanities faculty and doctoral students can learn from Shakespeare a good deal about how to mobilize themselves and what they do as well as a lot about how to change the institution of the humanities, especially by following his practice of institution blending. Shakespeare, <b>I</b> will argue, <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> us how to move...|$|R
5000|$|Suddenly, the egg hatches: to everyone's surprise, a tiny flying Elephant-Bird comes out. Horton panics, {{realizing he}} can't handle flying progeny, and asks Gertrude {{what he should}} do. She responds, [...] "I have wings, yes <b>I</b> <b>can</b> fly...you <b>teach</b> him earth, and I will teach him sky." [...] They agree to raise the child {{together}} as mother and father. The Cat in the Hat appears one final time to sum things up ("Oh, the Thinks You Can Think! (Reprise)"). The scene dissolves, leaving only Jojo, now just a boy again, and the strange hat {{from the top of}} show. The Boy walks up to the hat, and pulls it over his head and says [...] "Seuss!" [...] Blackout. The curtain call is accompanied by a final number set to a verse of Green Eggs and Ham.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are too acute by far," [...] said he; [...] "your {{imagination}} {{runs with}} you. I have said I like you, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> you classics {{as well as}} another. Is it not enough {{to admit that the}} money I get for your instruction keeps me in champagne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the native}} {{integrity}} {{which had been}} vainly exerted to secure M. Nioche's commercial prosperity flickered up again. [...] "Dame, monsieur!" [...] he answered.

6000|$|THE NOTE TAKER. Oh yes. Quite a fat one. This is {{an age of}} upstarts. Men {{begin in}} Kentish Town with 80 pounds a year, and end in Park Lane with a hundred thousand. They want to drop Kentish Town; but they give {{themselves}} away every time they open their mouths. Now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> them-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enough of this folly; I am {{not here}} to juggle with words, or to listen to such play. Whether the lady Elissa spoke of the gods she serves or of a man is one to me. I care not of whom she spoke, but for her words I do care. Now hearken, you city of traders: If {{this is to be}} thy answer, then I break down that bridge which I have built, and it is war between you and my Tribes, war to the end. But let her change her words, and whether she loves me or loves me not, come to be my wife, and, for my day, the bridge shall stand; for once that we are wed <b>I</b> <b>can</b> surely <b>teach</b> her love, or if I cannot, at least it is she I seek with or without her love. Reflect then, lady, and reply again, remembering how much hangs upon your lips." ...|$|R
40|$|The pattems and motifs of {{the state}} chamber of shuri Castle form a unique design. A careful study of this design <b>can,</b> <b>I</b> think, <b>teach</b> us {{a lot about the}} {{aesthetic}} consciousness of the era in which Shuri Castle was built and the social context of its construction. Powerful paintings and sculptures of dragons and lions constitute {{an integral part of the}} design. In this paper the focus is on the form and style of the dragons in the state chamber, on their role in the overall design, and especially on their relation to the flamboyant globular gems...|$|R
6000|$|Alton {{laughed a}} little, {{and held out}} his hand. [...] "Do you know I'm thankful that's over once for all, and now we can be friends," [...] he said.
