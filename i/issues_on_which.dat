McEntee began to work in Leinster House as her father's personal assistant in May 2010 while he was an opposition TD. One of the first <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> she worked with {{her father was a}} campaign on behalf of the owners of several thousand houses damaged by the use of pyrite, a material used as backfill during construction, that expands when damp or exposed to air. She considered standing as a candidate in the 2014 local elections, and discussed the prospect with her father, as well as the possibility of one day succeeding him {{as a member of the}} Dáil. She moved with him to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine when he was appointed minister of state after Fine Gael became a party of government following the 2011 general election.|$|E

The parting of ways started in the early 1870s, and one of the <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> they differed was women’s education.|$|E
25|$|While Pickton had an {{automatic}} {{right to appeal}} to the Supreme Court of Canada based on the legal <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> Justice Donald had dissented, Pickton's lawyers applied to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal on other issues as well. On November 26, 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada granted this application for leave to appeal. The effect of this was to broaden the scope of Pickton's appeal, allowing him to raise arguments that had been rejected unanimously in the B.C. Court of Appeal (not just arguments that had been rejected by the 2-1 majority).|$|E

Eight years ago we went into Afghanistan to eliminate al-Qaeda and the “safe haven” that Afghanistan’s Taliban were providing the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Al-Qaeda has no significant presence today in all of Afghanistan.... Instead of increasing our troop presence, the U.S. should limit its mission in Afghanistan to securing strategic Afghan population centers with the troops currently on the ground." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank {{has been}} {{involved}} in mortgage foreclosure bailout issues. [...] In 2008 Frank supported passage of the American Housing Rescue & Foreclosure Prevention Act, intended to protect thousands of homeowners from foreclosure. This law, , {{is considered one of the}} most important and complex <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> he worked. In an August 2007 op-ed piece in Financial Times, Frank wrote, [...] "In the debate between those who believe in essentially unregulated markets and others who hold that reasonable regulation diminishes market excesses without inhibiting their basic function, the subprime situation unfortunately provides ammunition for the latter view." [...] Frank was also instrumental in the passage of , the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2008, a measure that drew praise from editorial boards and consumer advocates. In 2007. Frank co-sponsored legislation to reform the Section 202 refinancing program, which is for affordable housing for the elderly, and Section 811 disabled programs. Frank has been a chief advocate of the National Housing Trust Fund, which was created as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and was the first affordable housing program to be enacted by the Congress since 1990.|$|E

2500|$|After the colony's {{original}} charter was revoked in 1684, {{there was}} the short-lived Dominion of New England (1686-1689), which was succeeded in the territories of modern Massachusetts and Maine by the Province of Massachusetts Bay. [...] The charter for the province called for [...] "eight and twenty assistants, or counsellors, to be advising and assisting to the governor" [...] who were to be chosen annually by the Great and General Court. [...] It further specified that the council was to assume {{the duties of the}} governor in the absence of both the royal governor and lieutenant governor (who were appointed by the crown), and enumerated some of the specific <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the council was to advise the governor. [...] During the provincial period, the relationship between the governor and council was sometimes difficult, since the council represented colonial interests which diverged from the crown interests of the governor.|$|E
2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} have made many different responses ranging from positive, to neutral, to negative. When the plan {{came out in}} 2002, the Israeli government rejected the initiative, {{on the grounds that}} it would result in the return of a large number of Palestinians into Israel. Israel expressed reservations on [...] "red line" [...] <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> it stated that it would not compromise. The 1948 Palestinian exodus, Israel's homeland security against terror attacks, and the nature of Jerusalem are the three most prominent such issues. Israel has stated that the return of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants would turn Israel into an Arab state. Israel has also had concerns about compromise on Jerusalem due to the city's historical and religious significance to Jews, especially since East Jerusalem contains the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism, and that a unified Jerusalem has been Israel's proclaimed capital since the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980. It is also concerned about the possible danger of making a complete withdrawal to the borders of 1967, which would possibly render Israel more vulnerable to attacks. The allegedly non-negotiable nature of the initiative's provisions, which must be accepted first before any further dialogue can take place, forms a stumbling block for the Israeli government, Israel had asked for amendments after the 2002 summit. The Passover Massacre overshadowed the initial 2002 initiative, and it initially derailed further progress on it. Oslo Agreement negotiator Joel Singer commented shortly after the Beirut Summit that [...] "the major problem with it is that it only called upon Israel to do a series of things and there was no call upon the Palestinians to stop terrorism." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the {{weakening}} {{phase of the}} Ottoman Empire in the 19th century and the global dominance of western colonialism, purchases without constraint and effective surveillance of real estate by the nationals and companies of western powers {{was one of the}} <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the Ottoman state had been subjected to the direst foreign pressures. As a consequence of these pressures, The Ottoman Land Code of 1858 was passed. An 1858 firman on [...] "Reform" [...] had announced a grant of permission in this respect, but the necessary legal arrangements had been delayed till 1868. With the enactment of the 1868 regulation, according to one estimate, British capitalist-farmers (see Levantine mansions of İzmir) had almost immediately emerged as having acquired one third of all arable lands in the entire vilayet of İzmir (Aydın in name), possibly held in an indirect manner till then, and by 1878, the majority of the arable land in the same province. This trend coincided with the influx of refugees from lands lost for the Ottoman Empire, and the migrants often saw themselves having to buy property from foreigners in their own country. A further law in 1913 also allowed foreign legal entities (companies, foundations etc.) to purchase property in Ottoman lands, with decisive effects for the early foundations of the state of Israel. A partial face-about by the Committee of Union and Progress, simultaneous to the outbreak of the World War I in Europe, was one of the causes for the deterioration of relations between Turkey and the Allied powers Britain, France and Italy. The Treaty of Lausanne which established modern Turkey laid a ground based on a strict understanding of reciprocity in the matter, on a bilateral and contractual bases as concluded with individual countries at first, and full legal reciprocity after 1934.|$|E
60|$|What, then, was the {{substance}} of this Contract to which the Allies had bound themselves? An examination of the documents shows that, although {{a large part of}} the Addresses is concerned with spirit, purpose, and intention, and not with concrete solutions, and that many questions requiring a settlement in the Peace Treaty are not touched on, nevertheless, there are certain questions which they settle definitely. It is true that within somewhat wide limits the Allies still had a free hand. Further, it is difficult to apply on a contractual basis those passages which deal with spirit, purpose, and intention;--every man must judge for himself whether, in view of them, deception or hypocrisy has been practised. But there remain, as will be seen below, certain important <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the Contract is unequivocal.|$|E
60|$|And {{there is}} even a more {{unstable}} foundation for Imperial unity. Does it never occur to right hon. gentlemen opposite that this solution which they offer of the problem of Imperial unity places the Empire not on a national, but on a purely party basis, and upon a basis repudiated by at least half the nation? Some day it may be that they will return triumphant from a general election. As party politicians they may rejoice, yet I think a wise statesman would try to win for the British Empire, our Colonial relations, the same sort of position, high above the struggle of Parties, which is now so happily occupied by the Crown and the Courts of Justice, which in less degree, though in an increasing degree, is coming to be occupied by the fighting Services. Whatever advantages from a Party point of view, or {{from the point of view}} of gratifying Colonial opinion, may be gained by food preferences, they would be very small compared with the enormous boon of keeping the field of Colonial politics separate from the social and economic <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> Parties in this country are so fiercely divided.|$|E
30|$|The {{alteration}} {{of this article}} therefore involved much more than mere economic efficiency considerations. Ex ante, this was perhaps the single <b>issue</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the social partners and the political parties were most radically divided. Ex post, changes are, naturally enough, a compromise, {{but this does not}} lessen their innovative content when all political and social constraints are taken into due consideration.|$|R
