25|$|The trans {{fatty acid}} <b>elaidic</b> <b>acid</b> has {{different}} chemical and physical properties, owing to the slightly different bond configuration. It has a much higher melting point, 45°C, than oleic acid, 13.4°C, due {{to the ability of}} the trans molecules to pack more tightly, forming a solid that is more difficult to break apart. This notably means that it is a solid at human body temperatures.|$|E

The major sources of dietary trans MUFA (dairy fat vs. industrially hydrogenated oils) have different isomeric profiles and thus probably different metabolic consequences. These effects may involve alterations in muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity, which may in turn promote insulin resistance if fatty acid oxidation is reduced. We report that in Wistar rats, an 8 week diet enriched (4 % of energy intake) in either dairy, industrial, or control MUFA did not alter insulin and glucose responses to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (1 g/kg). In C 2 C 12 myotubes, vaccenic and <b>elaidic</b> <b>acids</b> did not modify insulin sensitivity compared with oleic acid. Furthermore, the ex vivo total, mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation rates of [1 -(14) C]oleic, vaccenic, and <b>elaidic</b> <b>acids</b> were similar in soleus and tibialis anterior rat muscle. Finally, an 8 week diet enriched in either dairy or industrial trans MUFA did not alter mitochondrial oxidative capacity in these two muscles compared with control MUFA but did induce a specific reduction in soleus mitochondrial ATP and superoxide anion production (P< 0. 01 vs. control). In conclusion, dietary trans MUFA of dairy or industrial origin have similar effects and do not impair muscle mitochondrial capacity and insulin sensitivity...|$|R

CP- 4126 was tested in cell lines resistant to cytarabine, another dCyd analog or gemcitabine. Activity of gemcitabine and the derivative was comparable in the parent cell lines, while in dCK deficient cells all compounds were inactive. However, inhibition of nucleoside transport increased the IC 50 for gemcitabine up to 200 -fold, but not for CP- 4126, underlining the independence of a nucleoside transporter. For in vivo evaluation, nude mice bearing a human xenograft were treated intraperitoneally every third day for five doses at the maximal tolerated dose. In melanoma, sarcoma, lung, prostate, pancreatic and breast cancer xenografts, gemcitabine and CP- 4126 were equally and highly effective; in four other xenografts moderately but equally active. In contrast to gemcitabine, CP- 4126 could be administered orally, with a schedule and dose dependent toxicity and antitumor activity. In a colon cancer xenograft, antitumor activity of orally administered CP- 4126 was equal to the intraperitoneally administered drug. In conclusion, CP- 4126 is membrane transporter independent. Intraperitoneally administered CP- 4126 was as effective as gemcitabine in several xenografts and CP- 4126 is tolerated when orally administered.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that high olive oil intake reduces blood {{pressure}} (BP). These positive effects of olive oil have frequently been ascribed to its minor components, such as α-tocopherol, polyphenols, and other phenolic compounds that are not present in other oils. However, in this study we demonstrate that the hypotensive effect of olive oil is caused by its high oleic acid (OA) content (≈ 70 – 80 %). We propose that olive oil intake increases OA levels in membranes, which regulates membrane lipid structure (HII phase propensity) {{in such a way as}} to control G protein-mediated signaling, causing a reduction in BP. This effect is in part caused by its regulatory action on G protein-associated cascades that regulate adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C.

He found that the relations between erucic acid, brassidinic acid and behenic acid correspond to the relationship in the three fatty acids oleic acid, <b>elaidic</b> <b>acid</b> and stearic acid. Goldschmiedt also improved the method of Victor Meyer to determine, through vapor density, the molecular mass of compounds with low boiling point.

This research took most of his time between 1877 and 1883. In the following five years, Goldschmiedt focused on the determination of the structure of papaverine - a compound found in poppy seed and opium. With his 9th publication on that topic in 1889, he concluded that the structure of papaverine had been solved. At the University of Prague, Goldschmiedt had to perform analysis of the drinking water in Bohemia that slowed his research on other fields. Consequently, the determination of the structure of scutellarin took him many years: after the first publication on that topic in 1901, only in 1910 he managed to obtain enough starting material for more detailed studies. In Prague, he also studied glucuronolactone and ratanhine - a substance found in hardwood Ferreira spectabilis (Sucupira amarela). This substance had been in storage since the first tests by a Ph.D. student of Rochleder in 1868. Although only a small amount was available, Goldschmiedt succeeded to determine that the substance was methyltyrosine.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityAlthough the 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acids {{have been}} known for sixty years, the {{assignment}} of configuration of these acids has not been definite. All of the pertinent arguments have been based either on the known stereospecificity of the reagents used to produce these acids from oleic acid, or on physical measurements on the product. The purpose {{of this research was}} to demonstrate the configuration of these acids by unequivocal means. The methods starting from the stereospecificity of reagents, have as their basis the analogy that the stereospecificity would be carried over to this new reactant. The interpretation of the physical measurements requires an assumption of a certain conformation that is reasonable on the basis of X-ray diffraction measurements on similar compounds but has never been demonstrated in the compounds studied in this investigation. Both of these methods give concordant results in assigning the threo configuration to the lower melting 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic. The method of attack on this problem was the synthesis of an eighteen carbon compound having the elements of symmetry lacking in 9, 10 -dihydro:xystearic acid and capable of conversion to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid. The compound chosen was 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid. This acid exists in two forms, meso and racemic. The configuration at the nine and ten positions could be demonstrated unequivocally in this case by the actual resolution of the racemic mixture. Conversion of the racemic 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid would produce the threo configuration if no inversion took place at the nine and ten positions. In this manner, a total synthesis of 9, 10 -dibydroxystearic acid would also be accomplished. The synthesis of the desired 9, 10 -dibydroxyoctadecanedioic acid was accomplished as outlined below. 8 -Chlorooctyne- 1 and 1 -iodo- 6 -chlorohexane were prepared from hexamethylene glycol. Condensation of these compounds afforded 1, 14 -dichlorotetradecyne- 7. This, after conversion to the diiodo compound and reaction with ethyl malonate in sodium ethoxide solution, afforded 1, 1, 16, 16 -tetracarbethoxyhexadecyne- 8. A partially saponified and decarboxylated byproduct was also isolated but its constitution was not definitely established. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the pure tetraester afforded 9 -octadecynedioic acid. From the yield data from reactions with tetraester of different history, {{it was found that the}} highest yield of pure 9 -octadecynedioic acid was obtained when the tetraester had been exposed least to alkali. Migration of the acetylenic bond under alkaline conditions is a possible explanation for this observation. The position of the acetylenic bond in the 9 -octadecynedioic acid was determined by ozonolysis. Hydrogenation of 9 -octadecynedioic acid afforded cis 9 -octadecenedioic acid, agreeing in physical constants with those reported in the literature. A remarkable example of a poisoned palladium catalyst was discovered in developing this reaction. Analytically pure 9 -octadecynedioic acid absorbed two molar equivalents of hydrogen with the rate of hydrogen absorption slower during the absorption of the second mole. However, material that had a wider melting point range absorbed only molar equivalent of hydrogen even on prolonged exposure to hydrogen. The cis 9 -octadecynedioic acid was hydroxylated (a) with potassium permanganate and (b) with performic acid. These two methods had been used to produce the two forms of 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid from oleic acid. In this case, two different dihydroxy acids, m. p. 's 157 ° and 122 °, were produced. The acid, m. p. 122 ° (phloionic acid) was also isolated from cork. Two methods were emplqyed to determine the configuration, meso or racemic, of these 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acids. One method involved the formation of a cyclic benzylidene compound by reaction with benzaldehyde. Consideration of the geometry of these molecules indicated that the meso compound would afford a mixture of two compounds that should be separable whereas the racemic modification would afford only one compound. Experiment showed that only one compound was isolated when the 122 ° acid was used whereas the 157 ° acid afforded material that melted over a wide range. The analytical figures for this mixture were in agreement with those expected for the benzylidene compound. Crystallization from several solvents, and chromatography on several adsorbents were tried but with no success in separating the mixture. Since separation of the mixture was not accomplished, this proof of configuration is not conclusive. However, the method indicated that the 122 ° acid is racemic and the 157 ° acid is the meso modification. The configuration of the 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acids was established definitely by resolution of the 122 ° acid as its brucine salt. The resolution was accomplished by equilibrating the salt of the racemic acid with small amounts of cold ethanol. The residue after eight equilibrations differed in specific rotation from the starting material. The salt was decomposed with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the free acid was isolated. This acid was optically active with a specific rotation of + 4. 4 ± 1. 1 °. No claim is made that this material is optically pure since no further resolution attempts were made. For the purpose of the establishment of configuration, the demonstration of optical activity is sufficient. This activity was enhanced by benzoylation. The activity was not due to impurities since this acid was analytically pure. Examination of the alcoholic solution from the equilibration afforded an acid that had a specific rotation of - 0. 5 ± 1. 0 °. This activity is within experimental error and is not too significant. Naturally occurring phloionic acid was found to be optically inactive. This material would appear to originate from non-enzymatic processes since otherwise it would be optically active. The optically active acid appears resistant to racemization. No further work was done on the state or origin of phloionic acid in cork and cork wax. The last part of the problem was the conversion of the racemic 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid (phloionic acid) to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid which would be the threo modification. This conversion was accomplished in the following way: Phloionic acid was converted to the monoester by transesterification with ethyl acetate and sulfuric acid. Normal Fischer esterification afforded the diester mainly even when the reaction was interrupted at shorter time intervals. Hydrolysis of the diester with sodium hydroxide afforded phloionic acid with very small amounts of monoester being formed at the point of half hydrolysis. These facts would indicate that the rate of hydrolysis of the monoester is faster than the diester, and that the monoester is hydrolyzed as rapidly as it is formed. In the transesterification reaction, unchanged starting material was always recovered, a fact indicating that this reaction involved no change in the configuration at the nine and ten positions. The ethyl hydrogen phloionate was reduced to 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxystearic acid by a modification of the Bouvealt-Blanc procedure with sodium in absolute ethanol. The reaction proceeded smoothly and in good yield. A sample of phloionic acid was subjected to these conditions and was recovered unchanged. This observation demonstrated that the nine and ten positions were not involved in this reaction. The 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxystearic acid isolated from this reaction differed in physical constants from the values reported by Zetsche in 1938 for a trihydroxystearic isolated from cork wax and called phloionolic acid. The structure proof was not very conclusive since the degradation products were not compared directly with the known compounds. Phloionolic acid may possibly have the other configuration (erythro). However, this research makes it doubtful that the erythro form would have a lower melting point than the threo form. If this conclusion is correct, Zetsche has incorrectly assigned the 9, 10, 18 -tribydroxystearic acid structure to phloionolic acid. The conversion of threo 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxystearic acid to threo 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid was accomplished in a manner analogous to the conversion of glucose to 6 -desoxyglucose. The 18 -tosyl ester was formed without protection of the vicinal hydroxyl groups by isopropylidene formation. The ester grouping was converted to the 18 -iodo compound by reaction with sodium iodide in acetone. Iodine was replaced by hydrogen by reaction with zinc and hydrochloric acid in glacial acetic acid solvent. The material isolated was identical in analysis, melting point, and mixed melting point with authentic 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid, m. p. 95 °. Both forms of 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid were carried through this process unchanged. The conversion of the racemic 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid without alteration of configuration at the nine and ten positions definitely establishes the low-melting 9, 10 -dibydroxystearic acid as the threo form. In summary, the accomplishments of this research are: 1. The definite assignment of the three configuration to the low-melting 9, 10 -dibydroxystearic acid. 2. The first recorded total synthesis of tb. e 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acids from materials that are not derived from fats and oils. 3. A synthesis of oleic and <b>elaidic</b> <b>acids,</b> since Ames and Bowman have shown that the dihydroxystearic acids can be converted to the unsaturated acids in a stereospecific manner so that the erythro acid affords oleic acid exclusively and threo, elaidic. 4. The demonstration of configuration of the 9, 1. 0 -dibydroxyoctadecanedioic acids. 5 · The questioning of the assignment assigned by Zetsche to phloionolic acid as a 9, 10, 18 -tribydroxyetearic acid. 6. The assignment of configuration to aleurtic acid, 9, 10, 16 -trihydroxypalmitic acid, as threo as a corollary of this work. The assignment is made on the basis of the formation of a trans unsaturated acid when treated in the manner of Bowman, the ease of isoproproylidene formation analogous to the reactivity of the now known threo 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid, and its lower melting point than its isomer...|$|R

Adjusted ecological and individual correlations were calculated between processed food intakes and plasma <b>elaidic</b> <b>acid</b> levels. At the population level, mean intakes of highly processed foods were strongly correlated with mean levels of plasma <b>elaidic</b> <b>acid</b> in men (P = 0. 0016) and in women (P = 0. 0012). At the individual level, these associations remained but at a much lower level in men (r = 0. 08, P = 0. 006) and in women (r = 0. 09, P = 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: Several dietary {{factors are}} {{involved}} in cardiovascular coronary heart diseases, including trans fatty acids, which are generally formed during hydrogenation of vegetable oils, a process that causes conversion of liquid oils into semisolid fats. Nowadays, it is well-known that trans fatty acids form a major risk factor in the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis. On the other hand, it has been identified that some nuclear receptors, such as PPARs, are involved and play important roles in lipid homeostasis and pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we studied the effect of <b>elaidic</b> <b>acid</b> on gene expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Methods: Murine macrophage RAW 264. 7 cells were treated by 0. 5, 1, and 2 mM concentrations of <b>elaidic</b> <b>acid</b> for 6 h. The control group was treated by 50 % ethanol (as solvent), equivalent {{to the amount of}} ethanol used in 2 mM concentration of <b>elaidic</b> <b>acid.</b> Later, the total RNA was extracted and its cDNA was synthesized. Finally, the quantity of PPARγ gene expression was measured by real-time PCR. Results: Overall, 0. 5, 1, and 2 mM concentrations of <b>elaidic</b> <b>acid</b> decreased PPARγ gene expression in RAW 264. 7 macrophage cell line by - 1. 36, - 1. 68, and - 3. 24 folds compared with the control group, respectively. Conclusion: By decreasing the expression of nuclear receptor PPARγ, <b>elaidic</b> <b>acid</b> causes, intensifies or accelerates the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases, especially atherosclerosis.
