Visitor accommodation consists of 11 caravan and camping parks and some 900 bed spaces in eight hotels and 75 guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments.|$|E

In 2009, the department measured a peak of 19,719vehicles daily on the stretch north of Tittabawasee Road. The section south of the US10 interchange had the lowest traffic level at 9,315vehicles AADT.

5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be so <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E

One section runs concurrently with I-94 south of Ypsilanti. From there eastward, the US12 is a divided highway and then a boulevard into the Detroit area.
