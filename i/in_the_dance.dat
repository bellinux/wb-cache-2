5|$|The {{texts and}} artwork of Jainism show Indra as a dancer, {{although}} not identical but generally resembling the dancing Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly {{in their respective}} mudras. For example, in the Jain caves at Ellora, extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of Tirthankaras {{in a manner similar}} to Shiva Nataraja. The similarities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> iconography suggests that there may be a link between ancient Indra and Shiva.|$|E

5|$|Copeland was {{appointed}} a soloist at ABT in August 2007, {{one of the}} youngest ABT dancers promoted to soloist. Although, she was described by early accounts as the first African American woman promoted to soloist for ABT, Anne Benna Sims and Nora Kimball were soloists with ABT in the 1980s. Male soloist Keith Lee also preceded her. As of 2008, Copeland was the only African-American woman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> company during her entire ABT career. The only male African American in the company during her career, Danny Tidwell, left in 2005. In an international ballet community with a lack of diversity, she was so unusual as an African American ballerina, that she endured cultural isolation. She has been described in the press as the Jackie Robinson of classical ballet.|$|E
5|$|Fame was {{the last}} musical film to be {{produced}} by MGM, before the studio merged with United Artists in 1981. The film has been credited with revitalizing the teen musical subgenre by adding dramatic elements into its story, echoing 1950s melodramas. Its presentation of musical numbers {{in the style of}} a music video—through the use of quick cuts with multiple angles and crowded, kinetic frames—was a major influence on other 1980s films <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> film genre, such as Flashdance (1983), Footloose (1984) and Dirty Dancing (1987). It also inspired the creation of many similar performing arts schools around the world—notably the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA)— and popularized the use of leg warmers.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{group of}} {{teenagers}} audition to study at the High School of Performing Arts, where they are sorted into three different departments: Drama, Music and Dance. Accepted in the Drama department are Montgomery MacNeil, a closeted homosexual, Doris Finsecker, a shy Jewish girl, and Ralph Garci, who succeeds after failed auditions for Music and Dance. In the Music department, Bruno Martelli is an aspiring keyboardist whose electronic equipment horrifies Mr. Shorofsky, a conservative music teacher. Lisa Monroe is accepted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dance</b> department, despite having {{no interest in the}} subject. Coco Hernandez is accepted in all three departments because of her all-around talent. Leroy Johnson goes to the school, performing as part of a dance routine for an auditioning friend, but the dance teachers are more impressed by his talents than hers.|$|E

5000|$|Ice dancing judging {{is similar}} to pairs and singles, but uses a {{separate}} set of rules and table of values. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> compulsory <b>dance,</b> steps are specified and [...] "elements" [...] are defined for each dance as subsets of the prescribed steps. For compulsory dance only, there is no program component score given for transitions and choreography. Instead there is a timing (TI) program component that is exclusive to <b>the</b> compulsory <b>dance,</b> leaving only four program components <b>in</b> <b>the</b> compulsory <b>dance.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> original <b>dance</b> there are 5 marked technical elements. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> free <b>dance,</b> there are 9 marked technical elements. Unlike singles and pair skating, the different program components are weighted differently in each segment of the competition. The highest factored component(s) in each segment are skating skills and timing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> compulsory <b>dance,</b> interpretation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original <b>dance,</b> and transitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> free <b>dance.</b> <b>The</b> exact values of these factors are listed in ISU Rule 543.1k.|$|R

He warns Sudeshna of dire consequences if Sairandhri does not willingly submit herself for unison. As Kichaka is the supreme power of Matsya, Virata and Sudeshna do not dare to oppose. Sairandhri warns and pleads Kichaka several times which bear no result. One night, Valala disguises {{himself as a}} woman and waits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> hall.

Valala also kills Kichaka's hundred brothers who attempt to kill Sairandhri by making her perform Sati with Kichaka's corpse.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} {{four members of}} the nobility was {{sufficiently}} important to ensure that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles, most notably by Froissart and the Monk of St Denis, and subsequently illustrated in a number of copies of illuminated manuscripts. While the two main chroniclers agree on essential points of the evening—the dancers were dressed as wild men, the King survived, one man fell into a vat, and four of the dancers died—there are discrepancies in the details. Froissart wrote that the dancers were chained together, which is not mentioned in the monk's account. Furthermore, the two chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance. According to the historian Susan Crane, the monk describes the event as a wild charivari with the audience participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance,</b> whereas Froissart's description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation.|$|E

The video intercuts {{scenes of the}} studio with footage of Black making TV appearances, walking on red carpets, driving around Hollywood and greeting fans.

5|$|The video {{opens with}} the news of a fight {{circulating}} at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where gang members arrive via foot, forklift, and out of sewers, while the video's titular song begins to play. The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence. The singer notices rival gangs and leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall. A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance,</b> agreeing that violence is not the solution to their problems.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E
