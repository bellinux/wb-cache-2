An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the effect of hydrogen fraction on the combustion characteristics of a spark ignition engine fueled with low <b>heat</b> <b>value</b> gas-hydrogen blends was studied. The results show that engine indicated thermal efficiency, indicated mean effective pressure and maximum combustion pressure are increased with the increase of hydrogen fraction in the blends. And hydrogen addition shows remarkable influence on engine power and emissions. At the same excess air ratio, HC emissions decrease, CO and NOx emissions increase with the increase of hydrogen fraction in the blends.

40|$|Abstract. The {{combustion}} {{stability of}} pulverized coal is very essential for utility boilers. That {{is the key}} issue to keep {{the operation of the}} whole power-generation unit in a safe state. The amount of volatile matter is used to anticipate the combustion state of pulverized coal. As a widely accepted concept, higher volatile matter content would result in more stable combustion state. But in some cases, the coal with high volatile matter content led to poor combustion states, even resulted in the flameout of the burner. More method is needed to judge the coal and to predict the combustion stability. With research on the approximate analysis of the coal composition, the <b>heat</b> <b>value</b> of volatile matter was calculated. Such <b>heat</b> <b>value</b> varies obviously for different kinds of coal. The ratio of the <b>heat</b> <b>value</b> of volatile matter to the <b>heat</b> <b>value</b> of fixed carbon is supposed to describe the combustion stability of pulverized coal. The application of the method judges the coal better than using the amount of volatile matter alone...|$|R
30|$|The {{invasive}} plants used in {{the present}} study are characterized by higher total extractive and lower lignin contents. However, we expected that higher extractives of these plants will not increase the energy output, because there are no significant differences between them in the benzene-alcohol extractive (ranged from 5.2 to 7.1 %, Table  1), indicating that most of the total extractives are soluble in water, which have little effect on the energy output [15]. Nasser et al. [15] reported that the correlation between total extractives and <b>heating</b> <b>values</b> was not significant, while the correlation between <b>heating</b> <b>values</b> and benzene-alcohol extractives was significant. The little effect of extractives soluble in water on the energy output is due to its chemical compositions, i.e., sugars, which have lower <b>heating</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R

25|$|The coal {{industry}} of Illinois has {{its origins in}} the middle 19th century, when entrepreneurs such as Jacob Loose discovered coal in locations such as Sangamon County. Jacob Bunn contributed {{to the development of}} the Illinois {{coal industry}}, and was a founder and owner of the Western Coal & Mining Company of Illinois. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the Pennsylvanian geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211billion tons of bituminous coal are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula. However, this coal has a high sulfur content, which causes acid rain unless special equipment is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Many Illinois power plants are not equipped to burn high-sulfur coal. In 1999, Illinois produced 40.4million tons of coal, but only 17million tons (42%) of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states and countries. In 2008, Illinois exported 3 million tons of coal and was projected to export 9 million tons in 2011, as demand for energy grows in places such as China, India, elsewise in Asia and Europe. As of 2010, Illinois was ranked third in recoverable coal reserves at producing mines in the Nation. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states, while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois (21million tons in 1998) is mined in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.|$|E
