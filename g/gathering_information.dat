5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by <b>gathering</b> <b>information</b> on their targets. The documents included Saeed <b>gathering</b> <b>information</b> about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|The Ace Attorney {{games are}} visual novel {{adventure}} {{games in which}} the player controls defense attorneys and defends their clients in several different episodes.

Once enough evidence has been collected, the game moves on to a courtroom trial section.|$|E

In 1947 he co-founded the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Linz, Austria, where he and others gathered information for future war crime trials and aided refugees in their search for lost relatives. He opened the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna in 1961 and continued to try to locate missing Nazi war criminals. He played a small role in locating Adolf Eichmann, who was captured in Buenos Aires in 1960, and worked closely with the Austrian justice ministry to prepare a dossier on Franz Stangl, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1971.|$|E

After <b>gathering</b> <b>information</b> from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the data on a map using his own system of symbols, thereby creating the world's first weather map. He used his map to prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term 'anticyclone' to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather map in a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. The Times began printing weather maps using these methods with data from the Meteorological Office.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This PhD project aims at {{understanding}} {{and supporting the}} complex activities of <b>information</b> <b>gathering.</b> To date, most search applications support one aspect of search namely low-level keyword-based search to find documents. However, in reality, users search tasks are often high-level search tasks, such as comparing differences between art objects. Thus, there is a mismatch between the users search needs and the available search tools. This research investigates <b>information</b> <b>gathering</b> characteristics and how alternative search interfaces could support them. Design recommendations and guidelines for interfaces to support <b>information</b> <b>gathering</b> will be designed and verified through lab experiments and evaluation in different domains. Motivation — <b>Information</b> <b>gathering</b> tasks involve collecting information, often from various sources, to fulfill a higher level goal, such as making a decision, writing a report, and completing a project [3]. To date, most search interfaces and functionalities are typically designed for fact finding by means of keyword matching such as the simple or advanced (Google-like) search interfaces. Nevertheless, it is not certain whether these interfaces are sufficient for <b>information</b> <b>gathering</b> tasks. This research aims at addressing the following questions: What are the characteristics of <b>information</b> <b>gathering</b> tasks? How can <b>information</b> <b>gathering</b> tasks be supported? What kinds of search interface are best suited for which <b>information</b> <b>gathering</b> tasks? The following section will discuss three research stages. Stage 1 and 2 describe user studies on understanding <b>information</b> <b>gathering</b> behavior for different settings: cultural heritage experts in their daily professional work and visitors in a museum. These stages provide requirements to develop applications that support <b>information</b> <b>gathering</b> tasks. Based on the requirements derived from earlier studies, I explain the future work in stage 3 on design and evaluation of <b>information</b> <b>gathering</b> interfaces. Finally, this pape...|$|R
5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had {{a support}} network in Missouri, that {{provided}} them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by <b>gathering</b> <b>information</b> inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced that it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than a means to an end at that point for Anderson: it became an end in itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can fit on the screen, and the main character can move up, down, left, and right across the screen. The player can interact with individuals within towns by <b>gathering</b> <b>information</b> and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Warrior {{presents}} {{players with}} a clear objective from the start and uses a series of smaller scenarios to increase the hero's strength {{in order to achieve}} the objective. The game begins in King Lorik's chamber in Tantegel Castle, where the hero receives information about the Dragonlord, whom he must defeat, and the stolen Balls of Light, which he must retrieve. After receiving some items and gold, the hero sets out on his quest. Much of Dragon Warrior is spent talking to townspeople and <b>gathering</b> <b>information</b> from them that leads to additional places, events, and secrets. Players are advised to take notes of these hints for future reference. Towns contain shops that sell improved weapons and armor; general stores where the player may buy other goods; inns that allow the hero to recover his health and magic, and shops that offer keys for purchase. Players may sell items at half price to shops that provide weapons, armor, or general goods. The hero's status window is shown whenever he stops moving, displaying his current experience level (LV) and the amount of hit points (HP), magic points (MP), gold (G), and experience points (E).|$|E
