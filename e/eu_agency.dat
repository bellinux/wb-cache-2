25|$|The {{impact of}} sexual {{harassment}} can vary. In research {{carried out by the}} <b>EU</b> <b>Agency</b> for Fundamental Human Rights research, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29 %) who has experienced sexual harassment says that she felt fearful {{as a result of the}} most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made her feel ashamed of what had taken place. In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and the social support or lack thereof for the recipient. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault. Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying.|$|E

It reflects on the role of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> within the expanding contours of the EU’s emerging crisis capacity and the most appropriate way forward for effective and legitimate crisis management at the EU level, thus contributing to both the debate on the EU’s role in crisis management and the delegation of tasks to specialized <b>EU</b> <b>agencies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose The chapter furnishes {{empirical}} {{evidence about the}} extent and profiles of autonomy of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies,</b> the modalities whereby they are steered and controlled, and the interactions they have in EU policy networks. It thus provides the bases for a more complete picture of the EU multi-level administration. Methodology/approach The research is a survey-based design. A questionnaire was administered between July 2009 and April 2010 to 30 <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> {{included in the study}} population. The questionnaire was sent to the executive director of all the agencies included in the study. Questions were closed-ended, either in the form of multiple choices – with one answer or with check-all-that-apply and an option for ‘other’ to be filled – or in scale format. The resulting data set included ratio, interval, ordinal, and nominal scales. The reference model employed for the investigation relies on the analytical model developed {{within the framework of the}} research project COST Action IS 0651 CRIPO (Comparative Research into Current Trends in Public Sector Organization – see also ‘Acknowledgements’) for the study of public agencies in Europe (Verhoest, Van Thiel, Bouckaert, & Lægreid, 2012). Findings <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> display a rather low level of managerial, especially financial, autonomy; conversely, they enjoy relatively high policy autonomy. As to the way in which multiple ‘parent’ administration steer <b>EU</b> <b>agencies,</b> it emerges a composite picture, in which the crossroads of steering and control by the parent administrations and accountability by the agency lies in the executive director. In terms of interactions within policy networks, <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> interact in a significant way with the European Commission, with national-level agencies in the pertinent policy field, and with specific technical bodies where they are part of the configuration of the policy sector, whilst interactions with national ministries as well as with other <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> are rare. No single model can capture in full the overall features of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies,</b> although the ‘community level institution’ model seems to capture a number of the profiles of these agencies. Research implications Both the literature on EU multi-level administration and research agendas in public management can benefit from inclusion of – and in-depth empirical knowledge about – <b>EU</b> <b>agencies.</b> The chapter provides important {{empirical evidence}} to these purposes. Practical/social implications <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> are actors in European public policy-making, albeit to a varied extent depending on the sector. The extent of autonomy and the way in which they are held to account are crucial aspects for an enhanced understanding of their influence on European public policy-making, as is their location in European policy networks. Originality/value Research presented in this chapter is the first systematic empirical investigation of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> encompassing networking, steering and control and autonomy of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies,</b> based on primary data...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, EU {{legislation}} has established {{a growing number of}} subsidiary bodies commonly referred to as <b>EU</b> decentralised <b>agencies.</b> Recent years have witnessed the conferral of increasingly significant powers to these bodies {{to the point where the}} successful implementation of many of the EU's policies is now dependent upon the activities of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies.</b> While <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> have become indispensable in terms of their practical importance, the lack of a legal basis in the EU Treaties to establish and empower new bodies as well as the lack of an adequate framework in secondary law means that there exists little control over <b>EU</b> <b>agencies.</b> This results in critical issues, such as the absence of clear criteria prescribing when an agency may be empowered to act and also the failure to consider the interests of the actors normally responsible for the implementation of EU law, such as the Member States and the Commission. Providing the first comprehensive overview of the development of agencification in the EU, this book explores the question: What are the political and legal limits to EU agencification? Analysing <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> from an institutional and constitutional perspective, the book traces the development of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies,</b> explores the different tasks they perform, investigates the limits to agencification, and discusses the legal basis for such agencies...|$|R

40|$|The paper explores why Agencies of the European Union <b>EU</b> <b>Agencies</b> were {{established}} through {{the case of}} the <b>EU</b> border control <b>agency,</b> Frontex. Existing literature on <b>EU</b> <b>Agencies</b> has contributed to it by identifying the balance between the delegation of power to the <b>EU</b> <b>Agencies</b> and the effective implementation of EU policies; however literature, which commonly employs the principal-agent model as the theoretical framework, often overly focuses on the state-centric processes and only takes Member States as the principals in the <b>EU</b> <b>Agencies</b> as the agents. Unlike this conventional view, this article argues that the European Commission has also had an influence on the agency creation process with its effect of agenda-setting and can be conceptualized as-another principal. By tracing the historical process of EU cooperation on border management, the case study of Frontex highlights that, though Frontex was born in the process through which Member States exercised their influence and leverage, the effective introduction of the EU Agency-model by the European Commission helped Frontex to be accepted and created. In other words, Frontex, where the different actor’s preferences converged, was constructed as the focal point by the European Commission...|$|R

40|$|The {{delegation}} of {{more and more}} soft regulatory powers to <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> occurs in {{an increasing number of}} policy areas, e. g. aviation, medicines and financial services. Although the growing scope of the {{delegation of}} public authority to agencies is said to be necessary to enhance the effectiveness of EU policies, it raises doubts concerning the legitimacy of agencies and their decisions at the same time. This article aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion on EU agencies’ regulatory powers by uncovering the problematic aspects which the application and enforcement of soft law rules of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> may induce at the national level. Furthermore, it adds new elements to the wider reflection on the function and status of soft law within the EU. Ultimately, it argues that further procedural and good governance guarantees are required in order to ensure both the legitimacy and effectiveness of the soft regulatory powers of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies.</b> It does so by taking one of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), namely the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), as an illustrative example of how the establishing regulations of newer <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> proceed {{in the direction of the}} institutionalisation and proceduralisation of soft law rule-making...|$|R
40|$|Although not {{explicitly}} {{regulated by the}} <b>EU</b> treaties, <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> not only exist but also have increased in number and power. In addition, while <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> may exercise very similar functions {{to those of the}} Commission, Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) do not list agencies among the possible authors of non-legislative acts. The existing situation raises the questions {{of the extent to which}} the ongoing agencification in the EU is legitimate and what its limits are. This article addresses these questions in the light of the old and new Treaties and case law, including the just released ESMA-shortselling case. It shows that while the Lisbon Treaty made a few steps forward on the road of legitimizing <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> and delegating important powers to them, the scope of powers that <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> can have remains unclear. In this respect, the European Court of Justice’s lenient approach in the ESMA-shortselling case is unfortunate because it neither clarifies the issue nor pushes the Union Legislator and the Member States to address it. Consequently, in the absence of clear limits, further agencification is likely to persist at the risk of increasing the democratic legitimacy deficit and remaining accountability gaps...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{from a legal}} perspective {{the modes}} in which <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> partake in the enlargement process. In so doing, first the main forms in which agencies become involved in EU enlargement are explored. Next, EU agencies’ forms {{of participation in the}} enlargement process are subjected to a legal assessment taking the principle of institutional balance and the delegation of powers within the EU as the main yardsticks. In this context, the legal nature of such forms of participation and related instruments are discussed, as are some of the relevant legal problems they might raise. The paper examines these issues both with regard to the wider category of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> and by focusing on the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), an agency actively involved in the enlargement process, in order to provide a concrete illustration of how agencies’ involvement works in practice. It is argued that, apart from the formalised cooperation instruments that could result in legally binding agreements under international law, the forms in which <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> take part in the enlargement process do not create insurmountable legal and practical problems. As for the more controversial category of ‘binding agreements’ concluded by <b>EU</b> <b>agencies,</b> objections can be raised in view of the rather conventional reading by the CJEU of the balance of powers between the EU institutions, in particular with regard to the Union’s treaty-making. Arguments are advanced for an alternative route based on a dynamic interpretation of the institutional balance and of the delegation of powers within the EU...|$|R

Whether the advent of <b>EU</b> <b>agencies</b> tends to underpin a basically intergovernmental, transnational or supranational order has potentially huge consequences for the distribution of power across levels of government, for the degree of policy uniformity and pooling of administrative resources across countries, {{for the role of}} genuinely European perspectives in the policy process, and for accountability relations.
