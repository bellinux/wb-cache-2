60|$|The final fact which fixes {{this is a}} {{sufficiently}} plain one. Supposing it to be conceded that humanity has acted at least not unnaturally in dividing itself into two halves, respectively typifying the ideals of special talent and of general sanity (since they are genuinely difficult to combine completely in one mind), {{it is not difficult}} to see why the line of cleavage has followed the line of sex, or why the female became the emblem of the universal and the male of the special and superior. Two gigantic facts of nature fixed it thus: first, that the woman who frequently fulfilled her functions literally could not be specially prominent in experiment and adventure; and second, that the same natural operation surrounded her with very young children, who require to be taught not so much anything as everything. Babies need not to be taught a trade, but to be introduced to a world. To put the matter shortly, woman is generally shut up in a house with a human being at the time when he asks all the questions that there are, and some that there aren't. It would be odd if she retained any of the narrowness of a specialist. Now if anyone says that this duty of general enlightenment (even when freed from modern rules and hours, and exercised more spontaneously by a more protected person) is in itself too exacting and oppressive, I can understand the view. I can only answer that our race has thought it worth while to cast this burden on women in order to keep common-sense in the world. But when people begin to talk about this domestic duty as not merely difficult but trivial and dreary, I simply give up the question. For I cannot with the utmost energy of imagination conceive what they mean. When domesticity, for instance, is called drudgery, all the difficulty arises from a double meaning in the word. If drudgery only means dreadfully hard work, I admit the woman drudges in the home, as a man might drudge at the Cathedral of Amiens or drudge behind a gun at Trafalgar. But if it means that the hard work is more heavy because it is trifling, colorless and of small import to the soul, then as I say, I give it up; I do not know what the words mean. To be Queen Elizabeth within a <b>definite</b> <b>area,</b> deciding sales, banquets, labors and holidays; to be Whiteley within a certain area, providing toys, boots, sheets, cakes and books, to be Aristotle within a certain area, teaching morals, manners, theology, and hygiene; I can understand how this might exhaust the mind, but I cannot imagine how it could narrow it. How can it be a large career to tell other people's children about the Rule of Three, and a small career to tell one's own children about the universe? How can it be broad to be the same thing to everyone, and narrow to be everything to someone? No; a woman's function is laborious, but because it is gigantic, not because it is minute. I will pity Mrs. Jones for the hugeness of her task; I will never pity her for its smallness.|$|E

40|$|Bilayer vesicles form readily from {{mixtures}} of charged and neutral surfactants. When such a mixed vesicle binds an oppositely-charged object, its membrane partially demixes: the adhesion zone recruits more charged surfactants {{from the rest}} of the membrane. Given an unlimited supply of adhering objects one might expect the vesicle to remain attractive until it was completely covered. Contrary to this expectation, we show that a vesicle can instead exhibit adhesion saturation, partitioning spontaneously into an attractive zone with <b>definite</b> <b>area</b> fraction, and a repulsive zone. The latter zone rejects additional incoming objects because counterions on the interior of the vesicle migrate there, effectively reversing the membrane’s charge. The effect is strongest at high surface charge densities, low ionic strength, and with thin, impermeable membranes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a general {{approach}} to verbal inflection with special emphasis on suppletion phenomena. The approach is applied to French in this paper, but it extends straightforwardly to other languages. 1 The first part of the paper describes an analysis of suppletion in inflectional morphology with two design requirements. First, we attempt to provide an analysis which not only accounts for the existence of suppletion phenomena, but also accounts for the fact that suppletion is not erratic: suppletive forms tend to always appear in groups, in <b>definite</b> <b>areas</b> of verbal paradigms. Second, we try to minimize the quantity of redundant phonological information that has to be listed in the lexicon for a given lexeme. We assume that an optimal analysis of inflection should be able to derive all and only predictable inflectional forms from a single representation. Our analysis is based on the observation of a number of dependency relations between in-flectional forms of verbs. 2 We define for each language a stem dependency tree based on these observations, which allows one to predict the whole paradigm of every verb in the language on the basis of a minimal number of idiosyncratic stems.

When the flow has no whirl component at the inlet, the optimum convergent angle of the hub, giving the best pressure recovery, is about 24 degrees.

Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the separation by giving an adequate whirl component at the inlet, even if it occurs at the hub wall with a large convergent angle in the case without the whirl component.

60|$|This {{discussion}} has {{led us to}} some conclusions of the greatest importance as bearing on the difficult problem of {{the cause of the}} sterility of the hybrids between distinct species. Accepting, as highly probable, the fact of variations in fertility occurring in correlation with variations in habits, colour, or structure, we see, that so long as such variations occurred only sporadically, and affected but a small proportion of the individuals in any area, the infertility could not be increased by natural selection, but would tend to die out almost as fast as it was produced. If, however, it was so closely correlated with physical variations or diverse modes of life as to affect, even in a small degree, a considerable proportion of the individuals of the two forms in <b>definite</b> <b>areas,</b> it would be preserved by natural selection, and the portion of the varying species thus affected would increase at the expense of those portions which were more fertile when crossed. Each further variation towards infertility between the two forms would be again preserved, and thus the incipient infertility of the hybrid offspring might be increased till it became so great as almost to amount to sterility. Yet further, we have seen that if several competing species in the same area were being simultaneously modified, those between whose varieties infertility arose would have an advantage over those whose varieties remained fertile inter se, and would ultimately supplant them.|$|R
40|$|The main {{thrust of}} my {{project was to}} {{investigate}} the Endless Pools system and to develop some suggestions for improvement. The systems major problem was a lack of velocity attainable in the pool "bed", the area the swimmer is located. The pool's basic function is to act as a "treadmill for swimmers". By this, I mean the swimmer swims in place while the water flows past him. The velocity of the flow in the bed is adjusted to accommodate the pace desired by the swimmer. In other words, the velocity in the bed must be equal to that of the swimmer to keep the swimmer in place. The problem arises with the competitive swimmer that requires a faster paced flow to stay in place. This was the main focus of my improvements. I investigated this goal through three methods: first was through theoretical analysis of the system to discover possible areas of improvement; second was the building of a scale model of the system so that any possible improvements discovered could be tested; and third was the investigation of the actual model to discover the actual characteristics of the pool, both to compare the system to the model for accuracy and to search for other problems. Combining the three of these I hoped to discover, test and hopefully implement some improvements to the system. In the end I feel as though <b>definite</b> <b>areas</b> for improvement were arrived at and hopefully some will be implemented...|$|R
