40|$|A flat <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> <b>pressure</b> {{transducer}} with an anodised {{insulating layer}} and thin Pt-film as a strain gauge {{has been designed}} and made. Thepapergives details of the diaphragm and {{the information on the}} anodisation process employed. Sputtering was used for the deposition of the Pt-film strain gauge sensors. Observations on the behaviour of the transducer are presented which include, stability of the <b>gauge</b> resistance with <b>pressure</b> and time, linearity and hysteresis, and the insulation resistance of the anodised base layer. It was concluded that although this type of transducer can be adopted for measuring pressure in the lower range up to 10 bars, creep effect was at a noticeable level in the output. However, the transducer is attractive for its low-cost and weight...|$|R

There are two kinds of <b>diaphragms,</b> square <b>type</b> and circular type have been considered for the analysis. In this sense, diaphragms with equivalent cross sectional area have been selected for the simplicity. The proposed diaphragms has been simulated to get maximum deformation for an input pressure by using COMSOL and it is compared with the theoretical analysis. In addition, stress analysis along the mid line of the square type and circular type membranes also has been obtained by using FEM simulation. Based on the deformation, circular <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is preferable than square type. Even though, the design layout costs more in fabricating circular diaphragms which indeed increases the cost of the sensor and the fabrication costs are higher compared to the square shaped diaphragm...|$|R
5000|$|In 1849, B. Schäffer {{patented}} {{the design}} of a diaphragm <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> The following year he formed a business partnership with his brother-in-law C.F. Budenberg, The Schäffer & Budenberg Machinery & Boiler Fittings Company, in the altstadt of the Prussian town of Magdeburg Germany. They began manufacturing <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> and all items relating the steam industry. In 1858 they moved to purpose built premises on Schoenebecker Strasse in the suburb of Buckau. The company became known by the shorter name of The Schäffer & Budenberg Manufacturing Company (S&B) [...] "a special factory for the production of fine mechanical instruments". However, locally in Buckau they were always known as 'Schäffers'. Export success {{on the back of the}} every increasing steam industry led to the formation of manufacturing and sales subsidiaries all over the world. In c1875 the company produced its first Bourdon <b>type</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> thanks to the expiry of patents. They opened American Schäffer & Budenberg office & factory in Brooklyn, New York in 1876, and briefly a second factory in Foxboro, Massachusetts. They had 5 factories, 4 depots, 25 offices and numerous agencies over five continents by the beginning of WWI employing nearly 8,000.|$|R
40|$|Drawing-in {{process on}} {{covering}} machines {{is so difficult}} and inefficient that its automation is especially hoped. However the automatic drawing-in system developed {{in order to improve}} drawing-in operation is not able to distinguish whether the core yarn is successfully drawn into the hollow spindle or not. So we developed a detecting system for fine Spandex, applying pressure variation in pipe flow caused by yarn behavior. Results obtained are as follows : (1) Pressure variation can check the presence of Spandex when it runs through, a small air flow pipe. (2) This detecting system consists of a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor, a small pipe and a simple sequence program. (3) The system can detect Spandex yarns from 30 D to 420 D that are widely used and too thin to sense even by manual operation. And it is confirmed that the system has practical utility. (4) The system is installed on the automatic yarn drawing-in device. When the system distinguish the failure to draw Spandex into hollow spindles, the failed Spandex package is removed and drawing-in is again attempted with another package on the same spindle. In this way, yarn drawing-in is performed for all spindles on a covering machine continually and automatically...|$|R
40|$|To {{obtain a}} more {{vibration}} resistant pressure sensor {{for use on}} the Space Shuttle Main Engine, a proximity probe based, <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor breadboard was developed. A fiber optic proximity probe {{was selected as the}} sensor. In combination with existing electronics, a thermal stability evaluation of the entire probe system was made. Based upon the results, a breadboard design of the pressure sensor and electronics was made and fabricated. A brief series of functional experiments was made with the breadboard to calibrate, thermally compensate, and linearize its response. In these experiments, the performance obtained in the temperature range of - 320 F (liquid N 2) to + 200 F was comparable to that of the strain gage based sensor presently in use on the engine. In tests at NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), after some time at or near liquid nitrogen temperatures, the sensor output varied over the entire output range. These large spurious signals were attributed to condensation of air in the sensing gap. In the next phase of development of this sensor, an evaluation of fabrication techniques toward greater thermal and mechanical stability of the fiber probe assembly must be made. In addition to this, a positive optics to metal seal must be developed to withstand the pressure that would result from a diaphragm failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{time capsule}} [Biological and Environmental Specimens Time Capsule] aims at {{the storage of}} {{biological}} and environmental data on contemporary earth until 1000 year future from now on. In {{order to make the}} samples kept in the capsule for ultra-long time useful in judging that of biological and environmental degradation of the earth comparing the data with 1000 year time difference, two conditions for the biological contents in the capsule are necessary they are: (1) oxygen free and (2) temperature below - 60 ℃, which should strictly be fulfilled for 1, 000 years. The ultra-long-term recorder has been developed which is energized by the stored energy of the materials. The time span [t] is regulated by the torsion creep behavior of pure copper. The pressure [P] in the capsule is to be monitored by a pen cylinder <b>type</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge,</b> and temperature [T] by bimetal. All these three essential key values: P, T, in the capsule and time are to be recorded on the clean surface of metal plate with the scratch of the needles, which follows on each sensor. The extrapolation of the torsion creep data gives approximately 8 rotations on time scale shaft, which leads us to the 40 mm transverse motion of scratch needles during 1000 year [3 × 10 ^ sec] lapse of time...|$|R
50|$|Copper {{units of}} {{pressure}} or CUP, {{and the related}} lead units of pressure or LUP, are terms applied to pressure measurements used {{in the field of}} internal ballistics for the estimation of chamber pressures in firearms. These terms were adopted by convention to indicate that the pressure values were measured by copper crusher and lead crusher gauges respectively. In recent years, they have been replaced by the adoption of more modern piezoelectric <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> that more accurately measure chamber pressures and generally give significantly higher pressure values. This nomenclature was adopted to avoid confusion and the potentially dangerous interchange of pressure values and standards made by different <b>types</b> of <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges.</b> <b>Pressure</b> is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter that is expressed in units of force divided by area. In the avoirdupois system, the units of pressure are pounds per square inch and in the metric system, the units or pressure are newtons per square meter (pascals). A chamber pressure measured with a copper crusher gauge would be expressed as psi (CUP) in the English system or MPa (CUP) in the metric system.|$|R
40|$|Pressure pulses {{caused by}} {{irradiation}} {{of a model}} {{gallium arsenide solar cell}} with a Carbon Dioxide TEA Laser were examined using power densities of the order of 10 7 watts/cm 2. The pressure pulses were monitored with a Sandia <b>type</b> quartz <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> It was discovered that the relatively low power densities used were capable of removing the silicon dioxide antireflective and gold contact layers of the solar cell after only a few shots of the laser. An exponential relationship between the initial thicknesses of these layers and the pressure pulse generated in the gallium arsenide substrate was indicated for gold contact layers of less than 5000 A thickness. Evidence was found that the principal pressure generation mechanism is thermomechanical. Gold films of thickness greater than 5000 A were found to be able to absorb the power densities used with no apparent damage. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Several {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on single-cylinder test engines to determine the performance characteristics of four types of combustion chambers designed for aircraft oil engines. Two of the combustion chambers studied were bulb-type precombustion chambers, the connecting orifice of one having been designed to produce high turbulence by tangential air flow in both the precombustion chamber and the cylinder. The other two were integral combustion chambers, one being dome-shaped and the other pent-roof shaped. The injection systems used included cam and eccentric driven fuel pumps, and diaphragm and spring-loaded fuel-injection valves. A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> maximum cylinder <b>pressure</b> indicator was used in part of these investigations with which the cylinder pressures were controlled to definite valves. The performance of the engines when equipped {{with each of the}} combustion chambers is discussed. The best performance for the tests reported was obtained with a bulb-type combustion chamber designed to give a high degree of turbulence within the bulb and cylinder. (author) ...|$|R

Here an analysis is carried out by varying the dimensions of two different diaphragm geometries, namely conventional square <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and cross-sectional beam <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The analysis is done using finite element method (FEM) technique in ANSYS software and by comparing the results, the better <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> is chosen for the required pressure range of the application for flash flood level measurement.

40|$|Liquid lead-lithium (Pb- 16 Li) is {{of primary}} {{interest}} {{as one of}} the candidate materials for tritium breeder, neutron multiplier and coolant fluid in liquid metal blanket concepts relevant to fusion power plants. For an effective and reliable operation of such high temperature liquid metal systems, monitoring and control of critical process parameters is essential. However, limited operational experience coupled with high temperature operating conditions and corrosive nature of Pb- 16 Li severely limits application of commercially available diagnostic tools. This paper illustrates indigenous calibration test facility designs and experimental methods used to develop non-contact configuration level diagnostics using pulse radar level sensor, wetted configuration pressure diagnostics using <b>diaphragm</b> seal <b>type</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor and bulk temperature diagnostics with temperature profiling for high temperature, high pressure liquid Pb and Pb- 16 Li applications. Calibration check of these sensors was performed using analytical methods, at temperature between 380 C- 400 C and pressure upto 1 MPa (g). Reliability and performance validation were achieved through long duration testing of sensors in liquid Pb and liquid Pb- 16 Li environment for over 1000 hour. Estimated deviation for radar level sensor lies within [- 3. 36 mm, + 13. 64 mm] and the estimated error for pressure sensor lies within 1. 1 % of calibrated span over the entire test duration. Results obtained and critical observations from these tests are presented in this paper. Comment: 09 Pages, 19 Figures, 02 Table...|$|R
