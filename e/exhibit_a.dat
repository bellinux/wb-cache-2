40|$|ABSTRACTWe {{examined}} the chemotactic response of eosinophils to five eosinophil chemotactic factors (ECF; ECF-PI 5, −PI 6, −PI 7, −PI 8 and -PI 9) from an established T cell line (ST 02) in 31 patients with bronchial asthma (BA). The asthmatic patients {{were divided into}} three groups according to {{the ratio of the}} chemotactic response to ECF-PI 5 and -PI 9 (PI 5 /PI 9). A type 1 response occurred when eosinophils responded to both ECF-PI 5 and to ECF-PI 9, a type 2 response occurred when eosinophils responded to ECF-PI 5 only and a type 3 response occurred when eosinophils responded to ECF-PI 9 only. Of 31 asthmatic patients, 21 <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 2 response, six <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 1 response and the remainder <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 3 response. In contrast, 23 of 25 healthy donors <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 1 response and none of them <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 2 response. This typing of asthmatic patients was apparently correlated with the clinical symptoms of the patients. All patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 1 response were diagnosed with mild and episodic asthma and none of them had taken oral prednisolone. In contrast, many patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 2 response were diagnosed with moderate, persistent and perennial asthma. Indeed, eight of these 21 patients had taken oral prednisolone. The patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 3 response were diagnosed with mild to moderate and episodic asthma, but none of them had taken oral prednisolone. Furthermore, according to the total percentage migration to five ST 02 -derived ECF, asthmatic patients were further divided into two groups: high- and low-responding groups. Sixteen of 21 patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 2 response belonged to the high-responding group, whereas all patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 1 or type 3 response belonged to low-responding group. The present results indicate that such chemotactic heterogeneity of eosinophils to ST 02 -derived ECF is closely associated with the severity of BA, particularly with regard to the necessity of steroid therapy...|$|R

5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below.

Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number.

5|$|Archaea <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> {{great variety}} of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds.

In several species, females and juveniles <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> light-coloured coat, while those of males darken with age.

5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} {{stabilization of}} flerovium's 7s27p valence electron configuration, the 0 oxidation state {{should also be}} more stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> mild inert pair effect: this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E
