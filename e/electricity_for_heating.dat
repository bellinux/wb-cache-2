30|$|However, {{the real}} {{challenge}} of the next decade is to move the energy transition beyond the power sector. Heat production—in industry and in buildings—is {{a major source of}} CO 2 emissions today. Certainly, efficiency improvements, renewable sources (geothermal or solar thermal), or decarbonised <b>electricity</b> (<b>for</b> example, <b>for</b> <b>heat</b> pumps or resistance heaters) can play an important role, but they all hit constraints at a certain point in time. For example, based on what we can see today, large-scale seasonal <b>electricity</b> storage <b>for</b> <b>heating</b> purposes is unlikely to become economically feasible.

50|$|The {{lifespan}} of {{the system}} is longer than conventional heating and cooling systems. Good data on system lifespan is not yet available because the technology is too recent, but many early systems are still operational today after 25-30 years with routine maintenance. Most loop fields have warranties for 25 to 50 years and are expected to last at least 50 to 200 years. Ground-source heat pumps use <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> <b>heating</b> the house. The higher investment above conventional oil, propane or electric systems may be returned in energy savings in 2-10 years for residential systems in the US. If compared to natural gas systems, the payback period can be much longer or non-existent. The payback period for larger commercial systems in the US is 1-5 years, even when compared to natural gas. Additionally, because geothermal heat pumps usually have no outdoor compressors or cooling towers, the risk of vandalism is reduced or eliminated, potentially extending a system's lifespan.|$|E
