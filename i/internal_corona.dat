The {{aim of this}} work {{was to understand the}} mechanisms controlling the molecular exchange with a particular focus to delineate any potential effect of the micellar morphology. As model system symmetric short-chain amphiphilic poly(ethylene-alt-propylene) -poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer (PEP 1 -PEO 1, numbers denote approximate molecular weight in l(D) in aqueous solutions has been used. This system undergoes a irreversible cylinder to sphere transition upon addition of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as cosolvent or upon heating. This feature allowed to quantitatively compare chain exchange kinetics in both morphologies. The kinetics were accessed by using hydrogen/deuterium labeling and time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering experiments employing a stopped flow apparatus by which the kinetics could be followed from about some hundreds of milliseconds up to hours. The results show that, independent of morphology, all data can be satisfactorily described by a scaling model that takes into account the polydispersity of the core forming PEP block in order to describe the broad logarithmic time decay at longer times. A small but significant effect of the morphology could be seen which was reflected in a slightly accelerated kinetics for spherical micelles. A detailed comparison shows that for both morphologies, the activation energy follows a scaling law proportional to the product of the interfacial tension, gamma, and the number of repeat units of the, insoluble block, N-B, i. e., E-a similar to gamma N-B rather than the gamma N-B(2 / 3) predicted by Halperin and Alexander. This implies a stretched conformation of the insoluble block during the expulsion process compared to the more globular shape considered in the original scaling theory. This can be related to insufficient chain length/statistics for these rather small chains to form a globule during the expulsion process; or to an higher polymer density within the corona of these "crew cut" type micelles. Through the analysis, the faster kinetics could be summarized in a slightly smaller activation energy for the spherical micelles which is probably related to small changes in the <b>internal</b> <b>corona</b> structure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Diffusion tensor MRI {{provides}} unique directional diffusion {{information that}} can be used to estimate the patterns of white matter connectivity in the human brain. In this study, the behavior of an algorithm for white matter tractography is examined. The algorithm, called TEND, uses the entire diffusion tensor to deflect the estimated fiber trajectory. Simulations and imaging experiments on in vivo human brains were performed to investigate the behavior of the tractography algorithm. The simulations show that the deflection term is less sensitive than the major eigenvector to image noise. In the human brain imaging experiments, estimated tracts were generated in corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, <b>internal</b> capsule, <b>corona</b> radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus.

40|$|White {{matter in}} the brain {{supports}} higher-order cognitive processes by facilitating signal transmission between diverse cortical regions. White matter integrity declines with advancing age, leading to impairments in memory and executive processes in older adulthood. Recent research suggests that higher-fit older adults may be less susceptible to white matter degeneration, although evidence for this relationship is limited. Here we examine whether cardiorespiratory fitness correlates with white matter integrity and whether this relationship further predicts cognitive performance in a large, older adult sample. Diffusion tensor imaging {{was used to determine}} microstructural white matter integrity in a group of 113 (mean age = 66. 61) neurologically healthy adults. Measures of cardiorespiratory fitness (VO 2), working memory, and executive function were also collected. Using a whole-brain voxelwise analysis, we found that higher fitness levels predicted greater white matter integrity in multiple fiber pathways. We explored this relationship further using a region of interest approach, and found that higher fitness was associated with greater microstructural integrity in the anterior <b>internal</b> capsule and <b>corona</b> radiata, which contain fibers that project from subcortical to prefrontal structures. Further, statistical mediation analysis revealed that white matter integrity within the anterior <b>internal</b> capsule and <b>corona</b> radiata mediated the relationship between fitness and spatial working memory performance. Results suggest that higher levels of aerobic fitness may protect against age-related declines in white matter integrity, which may, in turn, preserve memory performance in older adulthood. ...|$|R
40|$|Association {{between the}} site of brain injury and poststroke {{spasticity}} is poorly understood. The present study investigated whether lesion analysis could document brain regions associated {{with the development of}} severe upper limb poststroke spasticity. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 39 chronic stroke patients. Spasticity was assessed at the affected upper limb with the modified Ashworth scale (shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers). Brain lesions were traced from magnetic resonance imaging performed within the first 7 days after stroke and region of interest images were generated. The association between severe upper limb spasticity (modified Ashworth scale ≥ 2) and lesion location was determined with the voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping method implemented in MRIcro software. Colored maps representing the z statistics were generated and overlaid onto the automated anatomical labeling and the Johns Hopkins University white matter templates provided with MRIcron. Thalamic nuclei were identified with the Talairach Daemon software. Injuries to the insula, the thalamus, the basal ganglia, and white matter tracts (<b>internal</b> capsule, <b>corona</b> radiata, external capsule, and superior longitudinal fasciculus) were significantly associated with severe upper limb poststroke spasticity.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{describe}} 2 {{cases of}} diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging in hypoglycemic coma. One patient, with diffuse cortical lesions, had a poor outcome, but the other, with transient white matter abnormalities, made a complete recovery. The distinctive patterns of DWMR imaging abnormalities in hypoglycemic {{patients should be}} recognized and may be a predictor of clinical outcome. The effects of hypoglycemic coma, especially when severeand prolonged, can be catastrophic. 1 Neurologic signs of hypoglycemia are nonspecific and include weakness, confu-sion, seizures, and coma, and delayed diagnosis {{can result in a}} poor outcome or death. On MR imaging, lesions in the cere-bral cortex, particularly the temporal lobe and/or hippocam-pus, 2 and the basal ganglia 3 have been described. There have only been 2 previous case reports of diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging findings in hypoglycemia, with hyperintense sig-nal intensity and reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) involving the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. 4 Recently, however, a different pattern of DWMR finding, involving the <b>internal</b> capsules, <b>corona</b> radiate, and frontopa-rietal cortex, was reported in a patient who later recovered from hypoglycemic coma without neurologic deficit. 5 We de-scribe DWMR imaging in 2 patients with different patterns of brain involvement and different clinical outcomes, thus illus-trating its potential use for diagnosis and prognosis in hypo-glycemic coma...|$|R
40|$|Crossed {{cerebellar}} diaschisis (CCD) is {{the phenomenon}} of decreased blood flow and altered metabolism in the contralateral cerebellum following supratentorial lesions. We evaluated CCD in patients with cerebravascular lesions using single photon emission tomography (SPECT) amd CBF tracer, ^ I- Iodoamphetamine (^ I-IMP), and considered {{the correlation between the}} development of CCD and many factors including the location and size of lesions, the degree of motor paralysis and the time from onset. Furthermore, we studied the effect of acetazolamide on cerebellar blood flow with SPECT. SPECT was performed in 86 patients with unilateral cerebral infarction and in 31 patients with cerebral hemorrhage. Acetazolamide test was performed in 17 patients with cerebrovascular lesions. There was no correlation between the occurrence of CCD and the time interval from onset. However, CCD tended to persist {{for a long time in}} patients whose degrees of CCD within the first month were severe. CCD was correlated with the severity of motor paralysis. CCD was present more frequently in patients with multilobular infarctions or subcortial infaractions including those of the <b>internal</b> capsule and/or <b>corona</b> radiata. Mean maximum hematoma diameters in patients with CCD were 56. 4 ± 7. 4 mm in putaminal hemorrhage and 29. 5 ± 6. 8 mm in thalamic hemorrhage. In these patients, hematomas were extended to the <b>internal</b> capsule or <b>corona</b> raciata. The acetazolamide test demonstrated that cerebellar vasoreactivity was intact in patients with CCD. MRI showed crossed cerebellar atrophy in a patient with presistent CCD.

This movement, or diffusion, is known {{to depend on the}} microstructure of the local environment. Thus diffusion weighted MRI can be used to identify microstructural changes in the brain that are not apparent on standard anatomical MR images. We used this to investigate the correlation of microstructural changes with neuropsychological variables in Parkinsonian patients, and to localise structural abnormalities in the brains of non-symptomatic professional boxers. In both cases, scanning was done using a single shot 2 D spin echo Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence. All brain images were spatially normalized to allow for statistical comparisons with alpha = 0. 05, and correction for multiple comparisons done using false discovery rate methodology. Twelve Parkinsonian patients with varying degrees of cognitive impairment were studied. Clusters of voxels showing statistically significant correlation between diffusion measures and neuropsychological variables marking cognitive decline were most apparent for periventricular regions, the medial temporal lobe and the thalamus. 59 male professional boxers and 12 normal male controls in the same age range were studied. Regions showing microstructural changes in the boxers who had received mild, repetitive, non-symptomatic head trauma were identified in subcortical white matter in the brainstem/midbrain, cerebral peduncle, corticospinal tract, the posterior limb of the <b>internal</b> capsule, <b>corona</b> radiata and the frontal lobes.

30|$|Acute {{ischaemic stroke}} {{represents}} {{the most common}} cause of new sudden neurological deficit, but other diseases mimicking stroke happen in about one-third of the cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best technique to identify those ‘stroke mimics’. In this article, we propose a diagnostic approach of those stroke mimics on MRI according to an algorithm based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which can be abnormal or normal, followed by the results of other common additional MRI sequences, such as T 2 with gradient recalled echo weighted imaging (T 2 -GRE) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Analysis of the signal intensity of the parenchyma, the intracranial arteries and, overall, of the veins, is crucial on T 2 -GRE, while anatomic distribution of the parenchymal lesions is essential on FLAIR. Among stroke mimics with abnormal DWI, T 2 -GRE demonstrates obvious abnormalities in case of intracerebral haemorrhage or cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but this sequence also allows to propose alternative diagnoses when DWI is negative, such as in migraine aura or headaches with associated neurological deficits and lymphocytosis (HaNDL), in which cortical venous prominence is observed at the acute phase on T 2 -GRE. FLAIR is also of major interest when DWI is positive by better showing evocative distribution of cerebral lesions in case of seizure (involving the hippocampus, pulvinar and cortex), hypoglycaemia (bilateral lesions in the posterior limb of the <b>internal</b> capsules, <b>corona</b> radiata, striata or splenium of the corpus callosum) or in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Other real stroke mimics such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS), Susac’s syndrome, brain tumour, demyelinating diseases and herpes simplex encephalitis are also included in our detailed and practical algorithm.|$|R

We studied cerebrovascular P-gp function using [(11) C]-verapamil positron emission tomography (PET) in seventeen healthy volunteers with age 18 - 86.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological data were collected. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data was analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Using a standard white matter atlas, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for three corpus callosum ROIs and eight bilateral ROIs. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed significant group differences for MD, AD, and RD and a trend for group differences in FA in the bilateral ROIs. Consequently, diffusivity measures for each ROI were tested for group differences using univariate ANOVAs followed by pairwise Tukey tests. Diffusivity was lower in AUD-C compared to HC in anterior limb of <b>internal</b> capsule, anterior <b>corona</b> radiata, cingulate gyrus, and external capsule. AUD-C also had lower diffusivity than AUD-R in cingulum-hippocampal connections and uncinate fasciculus. Furthermore, correlations between frontal and limbic white matter and cognitive measures of executive function, attention, and processing speed were identified. Hypotheses of abnormal diffusion in frontal and limbic ROIs were confirmed, yet the direction of differences was opposite that of previous findings.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The {{long term}} outcome after a single {{symptomatic}} lacunar infarct {{may be less}} favourable than is generally assumed. Patients often present with complaints such as fatigue or "being different from before the stroke", for {{which there are no}} obvious physical explanations. Although cognitive functioning is considered normal in most patients with lacunar infarction in the <b>internal</b> capsule or <b>corona</b> radiata, a study was carried out to determine if subclinical changes in mental or emotional function can explain these vague complaints characteristic for their disablement.  METHODS— Sixteen patients, each with a single symptomatic supratentorial lacunar infarct, and 16 matched healthy controls were examined with an extensive neuropsychological screening battery and a standardised questionnaire aimed at emotional problems. The mean number of correct responses was calculated for each subject and averaged within each group.  RESULTS—Although, on the whole, there were no differences in performance, patients' results on the following tasks in different modalities showed evidence for decreased performance under relatively more demanding conditions: line orientation task (mean difference (MD) 261 ms; 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) 94 to 428), Rey-Osterrieth delayed recall (MD− 3. 8, 95 % CI − 7. 5 to 0. 0), visual elevator subtest of the everyday attention task (EAT) (MD − 0. 7, 95 % CI − 1. 5 to 0. 1), lottery subtest of the EAT (MD − 0. 6, 95 % CI − 1. 3 to 0. 1) and WAIS similarities (MD − 3. 2 95 % CI − 6. 3 to 0. 1).

The conditions necessary for the occurrence of PDs are covered {{in addition to an}} analysis of the different types of PD in GIS ranging from <b>corona,</b> <b>internal,</b> surface and discharges due to electrically floating components for both AC and DC voltage. Chapter 3 presents the equipment available at TUDelft HV laboratory to create the set-up used for applying AC and DC voltages to the test object. The PD monitoring configuration are covered categorizing conventional and unconventional methods. Chapter 4 deals with signal processing of the PD data for classification of PD sources. Some quantities on which the analysis can be based, are discussed. Furthermore a distinction of quantities which are directly measurable by detection systems as direct data and the quantities or derived data derived through combinations or data analysis, will be made. In chapter 5, PD measurements using the conventional method of created defects in the HV laboratory are discussed. The defects are used to simulate insulation defects and the measurements in DC are analysed resulting in recognition graphs used for differentiating between the possible defects. Chapter 6 discusses the results of simultaneous measurements of PDs using the conventional method and RF techniques. The combined PD measurements on multiple defects are used to create plots of RF quantities to apparent charge. These plots are used for quantification {{of the relationship between the}} different techniques. Lastly, chapter 7 concludes the study and suggests future research related to the measurement of PDs in HVDC GIS using electrical partial discharge detection.

Multivariate analysis of covariance were used to investigate the relationship between Aβ deposition and WMH pathology on fractional anisotropy (FA) from 9 tracts of interest (i. e., <b>corona</b> radiata, <b>internal</b> capsule, cingulum, parahippocampal white matter, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal, superior and inferior front-occipital fasciculi, and fornix). WMH pathology was associated with reduced FA in projection (i. e., <b>internal</b> capsule and <b>corona</b> radiate) and association (i. e., superior longitudinal, superior and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi) fiber tracts. Aβ deposition (i. e., PiB positivity) was associated with reduced FA in the fornix and splenium of the corpus callosum. There were interactions between PiB and WMH pathology in the internal capsule and parahippocampal white matter, where Aβ deposition reduced FA more among subjects with WMH pathology than those without. However, accounting for apoE ε 4 genotype rendered these interactions insignificant. Although this finding suggests that apoE 4 may increase amyloid deposition, both in the parenchyma (resulting in PiB positivity) and in blood vessels (resulting in amyloid angiopathy and WMH pathology), and that these two factors together may be associated with compromised white matter microstructural integrity in multiple brain regions, additional studies with a longitudinal design will be necessary to resolve this issue...|$|R

The structural consequences of such surgery in the white matter, and how these relate to language function after surgery remain unknown. We carried out a longitudinal study with diffusion tensor imaging in 26 left and 20 right temporal lobe epilepsy patients before and a mean of 4. 5 months after anterior temporal lobe resection. The whole-brain analysis technique tract-based spatial statistics {{was used to compare}} pre- and postoperative data in the left and right temporal lobe epilepsy groups separately. We observed widespread, significant, mean 7 %, decreases in fractional anisotropy in white matter networks connected to the area of resection, following both left and right temporal lobe resections. However, we also observed a widespread, mean 8 %, increase in fractional anisotropy after left anterior temporal lobe resection in the ipsilateral external capsule and posterior limb of the <b>internal</b> capsule, and <b>corona</b> radiata. These findings were confirmed on analysis of the native clusters and hand drawn regions of interest. Postoperative tractography seeded from this area suggests that this cluster is part of the ventro-medial language network. The mean pre- and postoperative fractional anisotropy and parallel diffusivity in this cluster were significantly correlated with postoperative verbal fluency and naming test scores. In addition, the percentage change in parallel diffusivity in this cluster was correlated with the percentage change in verbal fluency after anterior temporal lobe resection, such that the bigger the increase in parallel diffusivity, the smaller the fall in language proficiency after surgery. We suggest that the findings of increased fractional anisotropy in this ventro-medial language network represent structural reorganization in response to the anterior temporal lobe resection, which may damage the more susceptible dorso-lateral language pathway. These findings have important implications for our understanding of brain injury and rehabilitation, and may also prove useful in the prediction and minimization of postoperative language deficits...|$|R
40|$|Progress on the {{development}} of an insulation defect detection and location system using a partial discharge (PD) wireless sensor network (WSN) will be presented. Such a PD WSN based on intensity only measurements has cost and scalability advantages over existing detection and location technologies based on time difference-of-arrival measurements such as described in (I. E. Portugues, P. J. Moore, I. A. Glover, IEEE Trans. on Power Delivery, 1, 2009, pp. 20 – 29). Figure 1 shows a hypothetical deployment of the PD WSN in an electricity substation. The (red) pentagram denotes a PD source, yellow circles and triangles denote sensor nodes, and the yellow St George’s cross denotes the data collection/processing node. Each node of the WSN is a broadband radiometer with a measurement band of 50 – 800 MHz, Figure 2. Three measurement sub-bands allow the radiometer to distinguish different forms of PD; in particular <b>internal</b> PD and <b>corona</b> discharge. WirelessHart has been selected as the network communications technology since this offers improved reliability over other standards (e. g. Zigbee) in harsh industrial environments. In the substation environment the path-loss index is both unknown and generally different for the path from the PD source to each sensor, so range cannot be estimated from a single power measurement. A simulated PD signal will therefore be periodically radiated from each node to calibrate path-loss index from that node to all other nodes. The authors’ (currently) favoured PD location method is based on a variation of path-loss inversion as follows: (i) assume a plausible path-loss index (e. g. n = 2), (ii) calculate the ratio of received power at any two nodes implying a locus of possible source locations, (iii) use intersecting loci from all measurement node pairs to establish an initial estimate of source location, (iv) use the initial source location to refine the estimate of n appropriate to each sensing node, (v) use pairs of nodes corresponding to paths with (nearly) equal n to calculate an improved estimate of source location, (vi) iterate as necessary to converge on a final location estimate. Proof-of-principle measurements using an artificial PD source and a sensor node in Fig. 2 in a laboratory environment are encouraging, Figure 3. These proof-of-principle results implement only steps (i) through (iii) of the algorithm described above. Steps (iv) through (vi) of the algorithm will result in a final location accuracy at least as good as selecting the optimum path-loss index in Figure 3 and probably better than this. The error between estimated and actual PD source location selecting the optimum path-loss index is 1. 4 m...|$|R
