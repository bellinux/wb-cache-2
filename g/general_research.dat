40|$|Background. In spring 2002, WONCA Europe, the European Society of General Practice/Family Medicine and its Network {{organizations}} reached {{consensus on}} a 'new' European definition of general practice. Subsequently, the European <b>General</b> Practice <b>Research</b> Workshop (EGPRW) {{started working on}} a European <b>General</b> Practice <b>Research</b> Agenda. This topic was addressed during the 2002 EGPRW autumn meeting. Objective. Our aim was to explore the views of European general practice researchers on needs and priorities as well as barriers for <b>general</b> practice <b>research</b> in Europe. Methods. In seven discussion groups, 43 general practice researchers from 18 European countries had {{to answer the following}} questions. (i) What major topics should be included in a <b>research</b> agenda for <b>general</b> practice in your country? (ii) What are the barriers to adequate implementation of <b>general</b> practice <b>research</b> in your country? Group answers were listed and subsequently categorized by two authors. Results. Research on 'clinical issues' (common diseases, chronic diseases, etc.), including diagnostic strategies, was considered to be the core content of <b>general</b> practice <b>research,</b> with primary care-based morbidity registration essential for surveillance of disease, clinical research and teaching in general practice. There was also consensus on the need for research on education and teaching. 'Insufficient funding opportunities' was perceived to be the major barrier to the development of <b>general</b> practice <b>research.</b> Conclusions. These findings {{could be used as a}} basis for national checklists of 'content of' and 'conditions for' <b>general</b> practice <b>research.</b> European <b>general</b> practice <b>research</b> training programmes should be developed further...|$|R

25|$|The <b>general</b> <b>research</b> plan {{initially}} {{developed in}} 1977 {{for studying the}} Varsity Scouting program, during its two year pre-test, made provision for the program’s evaluation after one year of implementation with another evaluation to be conducted {{at the end of}} the two year pre-pilot. In addition to the two evaluations mentioned, a third evaluation was conducted, mid-way through the pre-pilot in order to probe the assumptions upon which the program was developed: questions needed to be answered with regards to the needs, interests and preferences of 14- and 15-year-old boys in order to determine what exactly would attract and hold them in a program specifically designed for their age group.|$|E

25|$|In <b>general,</b> <b>research</b> for {{treatment}} of hyperkinesia has most recently been focusing on ameliorating symptoms rather than attempting to correct the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, {{now and in the}} future it may be beneficial to inform the learning of the disease's pathology through carefully controlled, long-term, observation-based studies. As therapies are supported by proven effectiveness that can be repeated in multiple studies, they are useful, but the clinician may also consider that the best treatments for patients can only be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. It is the interplay of these two facets of neurology and medicine that may bring about significant progress in this field.|$|E
500|$|These {{searches}} only excluded larger {{brown dwarf}} bodies and giant planets, so smaller, Earth-like planets {{in orbit around}} the star were not precluded. If [...] "hot Jupiters" [...] did exist in close orbit they would likely disrupt the star's habitable zone; their exclusion was thus considered positive {{for the possibility of}} Earth-like planets. <b>General</b> <b>research</b> has shown a positive correlation between the presence of planets and a relatively high-metallicity parent star, suggesting that stars with lower metallicity such as Tau Ceti have a lower chance of having planets. Primitive life on Tau Ceti's planets might reveal itself through an atmospheric composition unlikely to be abiotic, just as oxygen on Earth is indicative of life.|$|E

2500|$|Gradually, {{order was}} {{introduced}} {{in all kinds of}} research work, in which task notable services were rendered by the historical institutes which were established in close relation to the Vatican Archives. Research work in these archives may be divided into individual and collective, or general and special. Individual researches are made by individual scholars, while collective work is conducted by several who have either united for that purpose, or belong permanently to some association. <b>General</b> <b>research</b> devotes itself to the larger outlines of ecclesiastical history, while special research seeks the solution of particular problems, more or less far-reaching in importance. Both methods may be combined, objectively and subjectively; an individual investigator may work at a general theme, while an association may take up the study of a restricted or specific problem, and vice versa. The results of Vatican historical study {{are to be found in}} periodicals, essays, and books, also disseminated in large historical collections devoted to other classes of historical material, and containing the results of other investigations, e.g. the [...] "Monumenta Germaniæ Historica". A study of the published material exhibits long series of original documents, narratives based on copious documentary material, and occasionally narratives based on information obtained in the archives, but unaccompanied by the documents or by reference to them.|$|E
