40|$|Force {{measurement}} in hypervelocity <b>expansion</b> <b>tubes</b> is {{not possible}} using conventional techniques. The stress wave force balance technique can be applied in <b>expansion</b> <b>tubes</b> to measure forces despite the short test times involved. This paper presents a new calibration technique for multiple-component stress wave force balances where an impulse response created using a load distribution is required and no orthogonal surfaces on the model exist [...] This new technique relies on the tensorial superposition of single-component impulse responses analogous to the vectorial superposition of the calibration loads. The example presented here {{is that of a}} scale model of the Mars Pathfinder, but the technique is applicable to any geometry and may be useful for cases where orthogonal loads cannot be applied...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> {{is a type}} of impulse {{facility}} that is conceptually similar to a shock tube with a secondary diaphragm, an expansion section, a test section, and a dump tank where the endwall would be located in a shock tube. [...] It is typically used to produce high enthalpy flows for high speed aerodynamic flow and aerodynamic heating and atmospheric reentry testing.|$|E
50|$|A testing {{facility}} {{that relies on}} rapid release of stored energy to generate {{a short period of}} high enthalpy test conditions for testing of aerodynamic flow, aerodynamic heating and atmospheric reentry, combustion, chemical kinetics, ballistics, and other effects. The rapid release of energy can result in very high instantaneous energy release rates even though the total energy released is modest. This effect also produces short test times, however, with some types of tests in these facilities lasting less than 100 microseconds. Impulse facilities are a special case of blow down facilities where an energy storage mechanism is charged {{over a period of time}} and then released to initiate a test and must be charged again before the next test. This contrasts with continuous facilities such as wind tunnels that may run continuously. Examples of impulse facilities are the shock tube, the shock tunnel, the <b>expansion</b> <b>tube,</b> the expansion tunnel, and the Ludwieg tube.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program in FORTRAN 4 language was written to determine shock tube, <b>expansion</b> <b>tube,</b> and expansion tunnel flow quantities for real-air test gas. This program permits, as input data, {{a number of}} possible combinations of flow quantities generally measured during a test. The versatility of the program is enhanced by the inclusion of such effects as a standing or totally reflected shock at the secondary diaphragm, thermochemical-equilibrium flow expansion and frozen flow expansion for the <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> and expansion tunnel, attenuation of the flow in traversing the acceleration section of the <b>expansion</b> <b>tube,</b> real air as the acceleration gas, and the effect of wall boundary layer on the acceleration section air flow.

40|$|Background: <b>Tube</b> <b>{{expansion}}</b> defects like stenoses and atresias cause devastating human diseases. Luminal expansion during organogenesis {{begins to}} be elucidated in several systems {{but we still}} lack a mechanistic view of the process in many organs. The Drosophila tracheal respiratory system provides an amenable model to study tube size regulation. In the trachea, COPII anterograde transport of luminal proteins is required for extracellular matrix assembly and the concurrent <b>tube</b> <b>expansion.</b> Principal Findings: We identified and analyzed Drosophila COPI retrograde transport mutants with narrow tracheal tubes. cCOP mutants fail to efficiently secrete luminal components and assemble the luminal chitinous matrix during tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>expansion.</b> Likewise, <b>tube</b> extension is defective in salivary glands, where it also coincides with a failure in the luminal deposition and assembly of a distinct, transient intraluminal matrix. Drosophila cCOP colocalizes with cis-Golgi markers and in cCOP mutant embryos the ER and Golgi structures are severely disrupted. Analysis of cCOP and Sar 1 double mutants suggests that bidirectional ER-Golgi traffic maintains the ER and Golgi compartments and is required for secretion and assembly of luminal matrixes during <b>tube</b> <b>expansion.</b> Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate the function of COPI components in organ morphogenesis and highlight the common role of apical secretion and assembly of transient organotypic matrices in <b>tube</b> <b>expansion...</b>|$|R

The mechanism is the strong V-VR coupling with H 2 O molecules that dramatically facilitates the collisional transfer of vibrational energy.

Under these conditions, the response {{time of the}} Pitot pressure measuring device is critical when performing flow calibration studies. The conventional technique of using a commercial pressure transducer protected by shielding has not always proven to be effective, due to the relatively large (and variable) response time caused by the shielding.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of an interface between two gases and strong expansion is investigated {{and the effect}} on flow in an <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> is examined. Two mechanisms for the unsteady Pitot-pressure fluctuations found in the test section of an <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> are proposed. The first mechanism depends on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the driver-test gas interface {{in the presence of}} a strong expansion. The second mechanism depends on the reflection of the strong expansion from the interface. Predictions compare favorably with experimental results.

This paper is part of a continuing project to investigate the use of RHYFL-X as a scramjet test facility. The long term aim of this project is to further validate the previous numerical studies and the claims that the attachment of a nozzle onto an <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> will not only increase the core flow diameter but also increase the steady time available for testing.

40|$|The stress waves {{produced}} by rapid piston deceleration are a fundamental feature of free-piston driven <b>expansion</b> <b>tubes,</b> and wave propagation {{has to be}} considered in the design process. For lower enthalpy test conditions, these waves can traverse the tube ahead of critical flow processes, severely interfering with static pressure measurements of the passing flow. This paper details a new device which decouples the driven tube from the free-piston driver, and thus prevents transmission of stress waves. Following successful incorporation of the concept in the smaller X 2 facility, it has now been applied to the larger X 3 facility, and results for both facilities are presented...|$|R

A pulsed ruby laser is used at a CF 4 tunnel for single pulse holography, double pulse with several minutes between exposures, and dual plate holographic interferometry. Shadowgraph, schlieren, and interferograms are reconstructed from the holograms {{in a separate}} reconstruction lab. At the <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> the short run time of 200 microseconds requires precise triggering of its double pulsed ruby laser. With double pulse capability of 20 to 1200 microseconds pulse separation, one pulse can occur before and one later after flow is established to obtain fringe free background interferograms (perfect infinite fringe) or both pulses can occur during flow in order to study flow instabilities.

40|$|Expansion {{tubes are}} an {{important}} type of test facility {{for the study of}} planetary entry flow-fields, being the only type of impulse facility capable of simulating the aerothermodynamics of superorbital planetary entry conditions from 10 to 20 km/s. However, the complex flow processes involved in <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> operation make it difficult to fully characterise flow conditions, with two-dimensional full facility computational fluid dynamics simulations often requiring tens or hundreds of thousands of computational hours to complete. In an attempt to simplify this problem and provide a rapid flow condition prediction tool, this paper presents a validated and comprehensive analytical framework for the simulation of an <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> facility. It identifies central flow processes and models them from state to state through the facility using established compressible and isentropic flow relations, and equilibrium and frozen chemistry. How the model simulates each section of an <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> is discussed, as well as how the model can be used to simulate situations where flow conditions diverge from ideal theory.

40|$|Epithelial {{tubes in}} {{developing}} organs, such as mammalian lungs and insect tracheae, {{need to expand}} their initially narrow lumina to attain their final, functional dimensions [1]. Despite its critical role for organ function, the cellular mechanism of <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> remains unclear. Tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> in Drosophila involves apical secretion and deposition of a luminal matrix [2, 3, 4, 5], but the mechanistic role of secretion {{and the nature of}} forces involved in the process were not previously clear. Here we address the roles of cell-intrinsic and extrinsic processes in tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>expansion.</b> We identify mutations in the sec 24 gene stenosis, encoding a cargo-binding subunit of the COPII complex [6, 7, 8]. Via genetic-mosaic analyses, we show that stenosis-dependent secretion drives <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> in a cell-autonomous fashion. Strikingly, single cells autonomously adjust both tube diameter and length by implementing a sequence of events including apical membrane growth, cell flattening, and taenidial cuticle formation. Known luminal components are not required for this process. Thus, a cell-intrinsic program, rather than nonautonomous extrinsic cues, controls the dimensions of tracheal tubes. These results indicate a critical role of membrane-associated proteins in the process and imply a mechanism that coordinates autonomous behaviors of individual cells within epithelial structures...|$|R

Unsteady effects of stenosis severity and the imposed pressure conditions on the tube wall and flow are studied. Special {{attention was paid to}} tube contractions because they can be indications of the tube collapsing.
