25|$|Némirovsky was {{the very}} {{definition}} of a self-hating Jew. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> too strong? Well, here is a Jewish writer who owed her success in France entre deux guerres in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of reaction, to the fascist right. Némirovsky's stories of corrupt Jews—some of them even have hooked noses, no less!—appeared in right-wing periodicals and won her the friendship of her editors, many of whom held positions of power in extreme-right political circles. When the racial laws in 1940 and 1941 cut off her ability to publish, she turned to those connections to seek special favors for herself, and {{even went so far as}} to write a personal plea to Marshal Pétain.|$|E

This was the reason behind the gorilla {{on the cover of the}} album, as Mars {{explained}} in an interview with MTV News. In another interview, this time for GQ magazine, Mars revealed the song's conception, saying that [...] "it was just painting a picture—some animalistic sex". When asked about what the meaning is for [...] "making love like a gorilla"?, Mars replied aggressively [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> like to you? Come on...What is this, 1933? We can't talk about this?". Regarding the line [...] "I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker", Mars said that his inspiration came [...] "just because the room was dark" [...] and he felt like Johnny Cash.|$|E

But, really, please don't think I like to be rude. But you see we Jolines are so poor that if I stopped it all my business acquaintances would think I was admitting how poor we are, so I'm practically forced to be horrid.

6000|$|<b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> {{much like}} a general {{increase}} of armaments? or like bills {{for the prevention of}} pestilence, or of drunkenness,--which, even if they pass, will both probably fail to do the good which they propose? No. [...] And if this wicked world is to be mended, then God must stir up the wills of His faithful people, and we must pray without ceasing for ourselves, and for all for whom we are bound to pray, that He would stir them up. [...] For what we want is not knowledge; we have enough of that, and too much. [...] Too much; for knowing so much and doing so little, what an account will be required of us at the last day! ...|$|E

In this world one may wake {{in the night and}} one may resolve to be a king, and {{directly}} one has resolved one is a king. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> foolishness to you? Anyhow, it's fair that I should tell you, though you count me a fool. This--this kingship--this dream of the night--is my life. It is the very core of me. Much more than you are. More than anything else can be. I mean to be a king in this earth. KING. I'm not mad.... I see the world staggering from misery to misery and there is little wisdom, less rule, folly, prejudice, limitation, the good things come by chance and the evil things recover and slay them, and it is my world and I am responsible. Every man to whom this light has come is responsible. As soon as this light comes to you, as soon as your kingship is plain to you, there is no more rest, no peace, no delight, except in work, in service, in utmost effort. As far as I can do it I will rule my world. I cannot abide in this smug city, I cannot endure its self-complacency, its routine, its gloss of success, its rottenness.... I shall do little, perhaps I shall do nothing, but what I can understand and what I can do I will do. Think of that wild beautiful country we saw, and the mean misery, the filth and the warring cruelty of the life that lives there, tragedy, tragedy without dignity; and think, too, of the limitless ugliness here, and of Russia slipping from disorder to massacre, and China, that sea of human beings, sliding steadily to disaster. Do you think these are only things in the newspapers? To me at any rate they are not things in newspapers; they are pain and failure, they are torment, they are blood and dust and misery. They haunt me day and night. Even if it is utterly absurd I will still do my utmost. It IS absurd. I'm a madman and you and my mother are sensible people.... And I will go my way.... I don't care for the absurdity. I don't care a rap." ...|$|E

To answer this question, let us consider the property, [...] "contains mast #1". Mast #1 is one of the masts that the original Ship of Theseus had.

Hour after hour, all through my life, from the depths of Rothland Wood, from the home meadows, or in my long rambles over the far-away Barnwood Hills, I had heard those deep, throbbing chimes; sometimes faint and low, when the wind bore the sound away from me, sometimes harsh and piercing in the storm, and often as dear and distinct as though only a sheet of water stretched between us. And now I stood almost within a stone's throw of them, and marvelled no longer that the deep, resounding notes should travel so far over hill and moor that I had never yet been able to wander out of hearing of them.|$|R
