Unlike many existing deep CNNs, our model computes local features around a given point in an image. We also present a face alignment algorithm based on regression using these local descriptors. The proposed method called Local Deep Descriptor Regression (LDDR) {{is able to}} localize face landmarks of varying sizes, poses and occlusions with high accuracy. Deep Descriptors {{presented in this paper}} are able to uniquely and efficiently describe every pixel in the image and therefore can potentially replace traditional descriptors such as SIFT and HOG.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{cooperative}} training of two probabilistic models of signals such as images. Both models are parametrized by convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The first network is a <b>descriptor</b> <b>network,</b> {{which is an}} exponential family model or an energy-based model, whose feature statistics or energy function are defined by a bottom-up ConvNet, which maps the observed signal to the feature statistics. The second network is a generator network, which is a non-linear version of factor analysis. It is defined by a top-down ConvNet, which maps the latent factors to the observed signal. The maximum likelihood training algorithms of both the descriptor net and the generator net are {{in the form of}} alternating back-propagation, and both algorithms involve Langevin sampling. We observe that the two training algorithms can cooperate with each other by jumpstarting each other's Langevin sampling, and they can be naturally and seamlessly interwoven into a CoopNets algorithm that can train both nets simultaneously...|$|E

Here, we present {{an approach to}} classify the three domains of life using topological information about the underlying metabolic networks. These networks {{have been shown to}} share domain-independent structural similarities, which pose a special challenge for our endeavour. We quantify specific structural information by using topological <b>network</b> <b>descriptors</b> to classify this set of metabolic networks. Such measures quantify the structural complexity of the underlying networks. In this study, we use such measures to capture domain-specific structural features of the metabolic networks to classify the data set. So far, it has been a challenging undertaking to examine what kind of structural complexity such measures do detect. In this paper, we apply two groups of topological <b>network</b> <b>descriptors</b> to metabolic <b>networks</b> and evaluate their classification performance. Moreover, we combine the two groups to perform a feature selection to estimate the structural features with the highest classification ability in order to optimize the classification performance. Results By combining the two groups, we can identify seven topological <b>network</b> <b>descriptors</b> that show a group-specific characteristic by ANOVA. A multivariate analysis using feature selection and supervised machine learning leads to a reasonable classification performance with a weighted F -score of 83. 7 % and an accuracy of 83. 9 %. We further demonstrate that our approach outperforms alternative methods. Also, our results reveal that entropy-based descriptors show the highest classification ability for this set of networks. Conclusions Our results show that these particular topological <b>network</b> <b>descriptors</b> are able to capture domain-specific structural characteristics for classifying metabolic networks between the three domains of life. </p...|$|R

As {{it is now}} understood that most diseases are driven by sets of interacting genes or proteins this has shifted towards a more complex and holistic perception of this problem Strohman (2002). The first step in network-based analysis of complex biological data is inferring valid and robust network representations of the data. A plethora of packages for this task are available in R, e. g. Langfelder and Horvath (2008); Meyer et al. (2008); Altay and Emmert-Streib (2010). A topological analysis of the network provides new insights, as {{the structure of a}} network represents the biological function. A quantitative approach is to use so called topological <b>network</b> <b>descriptors,</b> which represent a network structure by a numeric value. Note, that different descriptors capture different structural patterns of the network topology. A small selection of topological <b>network</b> <b>descriptors</b> is available in the igraph package Csardi and Nepusz (2006). Recently we published the package QuACN on CRAN Mueller et al. (2011). QuACN provides a multitude of different topological <b>network</b> <b>descriptors.</b> We want to draw ones attention to the group of parametric graph entropy measures Dehmer and Emmert-streib (2008); Dehmer and Mowshowitz (2011), which are exclusively available in QuACN. These measures assign a probability value to each vertex of a graph by using information functionals to calculate the graph’s information-content. Topological <b>network</b> <b>descriptors</b> can be used for a multitude of applications in the structural analysis of (biological) networks, e. g. supervised and unsupervised machine learning, or the integrative analysis of networks.

However, we could previously demonstrate that it is still possible to find domain-specific attributes in the corresponding networks, that allow for a good inter-domain classification performance. In this paper we aim at finding domain dependent differences based on distances between vertices in the networks.

Clinical data including age, sex and skin site were also considered. The prevalence of different dermoscopic features was calculated to allow (i) the identification of lesions to be excised and (ii) the distinction between MIS and dermoscopically atypical naevi.

With respect to atypical naevi, MIS more frequently showed larger size, an atypical network involving {{more than half of the}} lesion, the contemporary presence of more than one type of network and more extended reticular grey-blue regression areas located both in the centre and at the periphery of the lesion.

Complex networks exhibit some common topological features including small diameter, high degree of clustering, power-law degree distribution, and modularity. We investigated the topological properties of a network constructed from co-occurrences between MeSH descriptors in the MEDLINE database. We conducted the analysis on two networks, one constructed from all MeSH descriptors and another using only major <b>descriptors.</b> <b>Network</b> reduction was performed using the Pearson’s chi-square test for independence. To characterize topological properties of the network we adopted some specific measures, including diameter, average path length, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution. For the full MeSH network the average path length was 1. 95 with a diameter of three edges and clustering coefficient of 0. 26. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the power law as a plausible model for degree distribution. For the major MeSH network the average path length was 2. 63 edges with a diameter of seven edges and clustering coefficient of 0. 15. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test failed to reject the power law as a plausible model. The power-law exponent was 5. 07. In both networks it was evident that nodes with a lower degree exhibit higher clustering than those with a higher degree.
