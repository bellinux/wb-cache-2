The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with <b>egg</b> <b>yolks</b> and additional bread crumbs.

40|$|Summary. The {{antigenicity}} {{of whole}} rabbit semen or of bull semen in <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> citrate {{and the distribution}} of antibodies in the serum and in the reproductive tract were studied following either two intramuscular injections with adjuvant or several intravaginal depositions (artificial inseminations) into female rabbits. Repeated artificial insemination ofnon-pregnant does with bull semen in <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> citrate induced only serum antibodies against <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> in two out of five rabbits. Repeated insemination of pregnant does led to serum antibodies against <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> bull seminal plasma, and bull spermatozoa in three out of four rabbits, and to vaginal antibodies against <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> and bull seminal plasma in two ofthese rabbits. The cause of the increased response during pregnancy is not known.

40|$|Background: Hen's egg allergy is a {{frequent}} cause of childhood food allergy. <b>Egg</b> <b>yolk</b> is used in various commonly consumed foods; if children with allergy to hen's egg could eat heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> {{their quality of life}} (QOL) would improve. No reports exist regarding oral food challenges (OFCs) for heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b> We aimed to clarify whether pediatric patients allergic to hen's egg could consume heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b> Methods: Data from pediatric patients who had undergone OFCs for heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Among 919 patients, positive OFC results were obtained in 17. 0 % of patients; seven presented with severe symptoms. Older age, high specific IgEvalue for ovomucoid, low total IgE levels, and history of anaphylaxis related to food other than hen's egg were risk factors for positive OFC results. Specific IgE values for eggwhite, ovomucoid, and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> indicative of a negative predictive value > 95 %, were 0. 71, 0. 41, and 0. 17 kU(A) /l, respectively. Aspecific IgE to ovomucoidlevels of 100 kU(A) /l predictedheated egg yolk-positive OFCs for 38. 3 % of patients. Among 763 patients with a negative OFC, seven (0. 9 %) reacted to heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> at home, and 756 (99. 1 %) consumed hen's <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> safely. Conclusions: Most pediatric patients allergic to heated hen's egg safely consumed heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b> Heated <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> OFCs rarely provoked severe symptoms and may be recommended for improving the QOL of children with allergy to hen's egg...|$|R
5|$|The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, {{compiled}} in the 9th century, mentions cubeb as {{a remedy}} for infertility, showing it was already used by Arabs for medicinal purposes. Cubeb was introduced to Arabic cuisine around the 10th century. The Travels of Marco Polo, written in late 13th century, describes Java as a producer of cubeb, along with other valuable spices. In the 14th century, cubeb was imported into Europe from the Grain Coast, {{under the name of}} pepper, by merchants of Rouen and Lippe.

5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Egg</b> <b>yolk</b> {{consisted}} of lecithin and phospholipids {{are one of}} the most commonly used components that will protect spermatozoa against cold shock during cooling and freezing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different hen <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> on Tris extender on the freezability of local ram semen. Semen from six sexually matured local rams was collected weekly using artificial vagina. Collected semen was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically and extended using tris extender {{consisted of}} 20 % (v/v) regular <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> (TRCEY), native <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> (TNCEY), omega- 3 hen <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> (TOEY) and 6 % (v/v) glycerol. Those were packed in 0. 25 ml straws, equilibrated at 5 oC for 3 hours, frozen and stored in nitrogen tank for 24 hours, and thawed at 37 oC for 30 second. The result of the experiment showed that there were no significant differences on the sperm motility and the number of living sperm. Percentage of plasma membrane intact in TOEY (60. 3 %) was significantly higher compared to TREY (56. 9 %) and TNEY (55. 6 %).

40|$|Aim: The aim was {{to study}} the {{seroconversion}} and development of <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> immunoglobulins in adult laying White Leghorn hens immunized against an isolate of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) bearing K 91 and K 88 ac antigens, obtained from diarrheic piglet. Materials and Methods: Adult laying White Leghorn hens were immunized with inactivated enterotoxic E. coli strain isolated originally from a case of piglet diarrhea following recommended schedule. The development of whole antibodies and isotype-specific antibodies in serum and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> were measured using {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). Piglets suffering from diarrhea with fecal samples positive for ETEC were fed with <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> and compared with diarrheic control group. Results: The serum and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> ELISA antibody titer against E. coli strain {{used in the present study}} was as high as 2666. 66 ± 307. 92 and 933. 33 ± 203. 67 respectively on 50 day-post-vaccination (DPV). The immunoglobulin Y (IgY) was the predominant isotype in serum and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> which reached the peak titer of 2200 ± 519. 61 in serum on 40 DPV and 800 ± 244. 94 in <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> on 50 DPV.

Conclusion: <b>Egg</b> <b>yolk</b> antibodies are considered a suitable immunotherapeutic alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy. High titer of <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> antibodies raised in the immunized hen against an isolate of ETEC holds the potential to be used for passive protection of diarrheic piglets during their most susceptible period of infection...|$|R
