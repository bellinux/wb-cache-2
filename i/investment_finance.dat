We hypothesize that {{a decrease in}} analyst coverage increases information asymmetry and thus increases the cost of capital; as a result, firms decrease <b>investment,</b> <b>financing,</b> and payouts. We use broker closures and broker mergers to identify changes in analyst coverage that are exogenous to corporate policies. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that firms that lose analyst coverage decrease <b>investment</b> and <b>financing</b> by 3. 05 and 2. 13 percentage points of total assets, respectively; firms also decrease payouts but by smaller magnitudes. We also find that these results are bigger for firms that are more financially constrained, with more product market competition, with worse corporate governance, and with more information asymmetry...|$|R

Arguments presented in this paper show that public <b>investment</b> <b>financed</b> by seigniorage gradually pulls up the growth rate of consumption and overshoots the inflation rate. Furthermore, we show that public <b>investment</b> <b>financed</b> by an income tax brings about an overshooting of the inflation rate and a simultaneous undershooting of the growth rate of consumption. These dynamic effects influence welfare dynamics. Taking account of transitional effects, we derive the welfare effects of fiscal and monetary policy. fiscal policy, monetary policy, economic growth, welfare...|$|R

The returns are comparable if investments share approximately the same timing.|$|R
