5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A <b>drawbar</b> is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio mixing board. As a <b>drawbar</b> is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined <b>drawbar</b> combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected <b>drawbar</b> settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first engines of the class was fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment {{on top of the}} tender to work their way forward into the cab. The passengers' complaints were dealt with by reducing the tension in the <b>drawbar</b> spring.|$|E

5000|$|The engines {{operated}} at [...] {{and delivered}} 51,580 lb of tractive effort which, on the lightly laid New Zealand tracks, {{proved to be}} too powerful for the <b>drawbars</b> on rolling stock and broken <b>drawbars</b> occurred wherever the engines ran. Further, the locomotives when hauling a full load, generated such intense heat in restricted tunnels, which are common in New Zealand, that crews refused to work them.|$|R

5|$|The Nord Stage is multitimbral – {{each of the}} Piano, Organ, and Synth {{sections}} {{can sound}} independently. There are two Panels – A and B – each of which provides a separate configuration of the three sections within a single Program. Panels can be played independently, {{with one of the}} panels being controlled via an external MIDI keyboard controller, or they can be layered together, allowing for a maximum of 6 part multitimbral. Most of the buttons and knobs on the Stage, such as volume, instrument selection, <b>drawbar</b> levels (for organ) or filter controls (for synthesizer) can also be adjusted by the external keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The Roland VK-7, {{introduced}} in 1997, attempted {{to emulate the}} sound of a Hammond using digital signal processing technology. An updated version, the VK-8, which appeared in 2002, also provided emulations of other vintage keyboards and provided a connector for a Leslie. Clavia introduced the Nord Electro in 2001; this used buttons to emulate the physical action of pulling or pushing a <b>drawbar,</b> with an LED graph indicating its current state. Clavia has released several updated versions of the Electro since then, and introduced the Nord Stage with the same technology. The Nord C2D was Clavia's first organ with real drawbars. Diversi, founded by former Hammond-Suzuki sales rep Tom Tuson in 2003, has specialised in Hammond clones, and featured a notable endorsement from Joey DeFrancesco.|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, the {{keyboard}} can be {{split into two}} sections, so that the bass <b>drawbars</b> are applied to {{the low end of}} {{the keyboard}}, and the nine upper <b>drawbars</b> are applied to the rest of the keyboard. This keyboard-split function allows an organist to perform low-register basslines and high-register chords and solos on a single keyboard. The organist can view the effect and registration settings on a small LCD screen.|$|R

50|$|Also, in {{a number}} of cases, {{multiple}} single-well cars (usually 3 or 5) are connected by <b>drawbars</b> and share a single reporting mark.|$|R
25|$|British railway {{companies}} {{have been reluctant to}} disclose figures for <b>drawbar</b> horsepower and have usually relied on continuous tractive effort instead.|$|E
25|$|During {{dynamometer}} car testing with S301 in 1937, a maximum output of 2,300 <b>drawbar</b> horsepower (1,720kW) at 45mph (72km/h) was recorded.|$|E
25|$|R8 collets have a keyway {{to prevent}} {{rotation}} when fitting or removing, {{but it is}} the compressed taper and not the keyway that provides the driving force. Collets are compressed by a <b>drawbar</b> from behind, they are self releasing and tool changes can be automated.|$|E
50|$|Setting standards. Within 90 days {{of passage}} of act, the American Railway Association is {{authorized}} to set standard height of <b>drawbars</b> for freight cars and fix maximum variation from such standard heights {{to be allowed}} between <b>drawbars</b> of empty and loaded cars. Will submit these standards to the Interstate Commerce Commission, which will inform the carriers. If ARA fails to set standard, ICC will do so before July 1, 1894. After July 1, 1895, no cars can be used that don’t comply.|$|R
50|$|Carriages were {{connected}} by semi-permanent <b>drawbars,</b> {{except for the}} driving ends of motor carriages, and one end of BT carriages, which were provided with automatic couplers.|$|R
5000|$|The VK-7 is {{designed}} to recreate the organ sounds of the 1960s and 1970s jazz and popular music. The instrument has nine harmonic <b>drawbars</b> so that the organist can control the volume of different overtones. The instrument also provides vibrato, chorus, and reverb effects and an overdrive knob, which adds simulated tube amplifier [...] "growl". As with most clonewheel emulator keyboards, the <b>drawbars</b> are positioned {{to the left of}} the keyboard. Unlike the Hammond organ, which had two manuals (keyboards), the VK-7 has only a single manual with 61 keys.|$|R
25|$|In use, {{the part}} {{to be held}} is {{inserted}} into the collet and then the collet is driven (using a nose cap) or drawn (using a <b>drawbar)</b> into the body which has a matching taper. When properly tightened, enough {{force is applied to}} securely clamp the workpiece or tool.|$|E
25|$|The Westinghouse H2C coupler, {{first used}} on the R1 class, is {{currently}} {{used on the}} R32, R42, R62, R62A, R68, and R68A class subway cars of the New York City Subway. The A ends of the cars typically have the Westinghouse coupler and the B ends use either a semi-permanent <b>drawbar,</b> or a Westinghouse coupler.|$|E
25|$|Drawbars: Usually {{found only}} on {{high-end}} keyboards and workstation, this feature allows the performer to emulate digitally-modeled {{sounds of a}} tonewheel electronic organ (hence <b>drawbar).</b> It consists of nine editable virtual sliders that resemble the drawbars of a tonewheel organ, and features various effects such as rotary speaker, percussion, and tremolo. The setting can be saved to the keyboard's user memory or storage device.|$|E
5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain pedal, a swell pedal for organ, a footswitch to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control pedal to modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of screw-in legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled <b>drawbars</b> for the Nord Stage, for users who prefer to use real <b>drawbars</b> instead of the buttons provided as standard.|$|R
50|$|ELS-02C: The custom model. Other {{than all}} the {{features}} of the ELS-02, it has an additional 60 AWM voices, VA voices, Organ Flutes voices (with digital <b>drawbars),</b> a second expression pedal, horizontal keyboard touch, and pedal board aftertouch.|$|R
50|$|A digital {{remake of}} the CX-3 was {{launched}} in 2001, which included two sets of <b>drawbars,</b> expression and overdrive controls, and a built-in reverb unit and Leslie simulator. It was retired in 2011 after {{the introduction of the}} Korg Kronos.|$|R
25|$|While at the GCR, Tornado hauled empty {{passenger}} trains at {{speeds up to}} , and load test trains of up to around 500 tons. One load test in September involved the hauling of a rake of 11 empty coaches and a dead Class 45 diesel locomotive. Also in one load test, over 2,000edhp (Effective <b>Drawbar</b> Horsepower) was recorded. On 10 September Tornado was officially timed for the first time, hauling 518 tons up the 1-in-176 gradient south from Rothley railway station.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, the WD-45 was introduced, {{replacing}} the WD. The motor was increased to 226 cubic inches, giving it 30 horsepower on the <b>drawbar</b> at the Nebraska Tests. This was {{almost double the}} horsepower of the WD. A new Allis chalmers designed Snap- Coupler hitch was used. It allowed the operator to hook up to an implement from {{the seat of the}} tractor. A Buda diesel-powered WD-45 was introduced in 1955. This series stayed in production until the unveiling of the D-series in 1957.|$|E
25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop tractive effort (also referred to as <b>drawbar</b> pull or tractive force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E
5000|$|The most revolutionary {{difference}} in the Hammond, however, was its huge number of tonewheel settings, achieved by manipulating a system of <b>drawbars</b> located near the manuals. By using the <b>drawbars,</b> the organist could combine a variety of electrical tones and harmonics in varying proportions, thus giving the Hammond vast [...] "registration." [...] In all, the Hammond was capable of producing more than 250 million tones. This feature, combined with the three-keyboard layout (i.e., manuals and pedalboard), the freedom of electrical power, and a wide, easily controllable range of volume made the first electronic organs more flexible than any reed organ, or indeed any previous musical instrument except, perhaps, the pipe organ itself.|$|R
2500|$|... "B-B+B-B+B-B" [...] {{means that}} the {{locomotive}} has six trucks. Each truck contains two powered axles. The only known locomotives to have this configuration were the two EMD TR3 locomotives made of three permanently coupled B-B units, which had solid <b>drawbars</b> connecting the units instead of the typical couplers.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Nord Electro has two sections. One was a sample-player {{intended for}} electric pianos, although samples of acoustic grand and upright pianos are also available. The sample libraries are exchangeable, and Clavia has made several samples libraries available for free for Nord Electro owners. The second section is a digital emulation of electronic organs. This is not sample based, but instead {{generated by the}} digital modelling of several types of organs. Unlike many other keyboards that feature tonewheel organ emulation, the <b>drawbars</b> of the Nord Electro are represented by LED bar graphs and up/down buttons instead of the traditional mechanical <b>drawbars.</b> The Electro 3 added a sample player which offered the ability to play {{a wider range of}} sounds, notably including those from the Mellotron and Chamberlin libraries.|$|R
25|$|The Rs were {{pressed into}} {{secondary}} passenger and goods service, roles {{for which a}} Hudson with large diameter driving wheels was sometimes a less than ideal choice. There was little opportunity to exploit their high speed capability. Furthermore, their relatively low factor of adhesion (4.08) and lack of fully compensated springing, coupled with the tendency of locomotives to transfer weight to the rearmost wheels under high <b>drawbar</b> pull conditions (which {{in the case of}} the R meant a weight transfer from the driving wheels to the unpowered trailing truck) caused them to slip when starting heavy goods trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{successful}} {{and led to}} production orders being placed for similar trains for the Western, Eastern, Scottish and London Midland Regions. The production power cars featured a redesigned front end without conventional buffers, although a rigid <b>drawbar</b> {{can be used to}} connect an HST to an ordinary locomotive. Following the introduction of production HST sets, the prototype unit was withdrawn, the power cars passing to the Research Division at Derby. Of the ten prototype coaches, two were adapted for use in the Royal Train, five were modified for use with the production HSTs, and three were transferred to Departmental stock.|$|E
25|$|The Great Hall is sited on the castle's {{southern}} side, {{where some}} of the more visible remains still stand. This was a large room used for dining and receiving visitors. Its much enlarged windows still look south across the valley and an arched gateway leads from the west end of the room to what was once the Kitchens {{in the basement of the}} adjacent apsidal ('D' shaped) tower. This tower, called the Welsh Tower, is a typical feature of Welsh castles of the period. It would have protruded from the castle wall into the defensive ditch and provided archers with a clear view of any attackers attempting to approach the southern wall. The tower had perhaps three storeys with living quarters on the upper floors. In the south western corner was a Postern gate. This was an additional exit from the castle, designed to be used in times of siege to allow the garrison to 'sally' out and attack their besiegers. Fragments of the arch remain as well as the slot for the door's <b>drawbar.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first model}} in production, in June 1935, was the Model A. It {{contained}} {{most of the}} features {{that came to be}} standard on all console Hammonds, including two 61-key manuals, a 25-key pedalboard, an expression pedal, 12 reverse-color preset keys, two sets of <b>drawbars</b> for each manual, and one for the pedals.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ability to}} couple diesel–electric {{locomotives}} in an MU fashion {{was first introduced}} in the EMD FT four-unit demonstrator that toured the United States in 1939. At the time, American railroad work rules required that each operating locomotive in a train had to have on board a full crew. EMD circumvented that requirement by coupling the individual units of the demonstrator with <b>drawbars</b> instead of conventional knuckle couplers and declaring the combination to be a single locomotive. [...] Electrical interconnections were made so one engine driver could operate the entire consist from the head-end unit. [...] Later on, work rules were amended and the semi-permanent coupling of units with <b>drawbars</b> was eliminated in favour of couplers, as servicing had proved to be somewhat cumbersome owing to the total length of the consist (about 200 feet or nearly 61 meters).|$|R
50|$|A further four MTH {{carriages}} {{were converted}} in 1984, essentially BH carriages with an underfloor alternator fitted and with regular automatic couplers {{in place of}} <b>drawbars.</b> These were intended {{to be used as}} trailers for the Tulloch Railcars, as the older trailers were of timber construction with no airconditioning, and well past their use-by dates.|$|R
