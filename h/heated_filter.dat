A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the determination of lead in wine by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry without any sample preparation and calibration against aqueous standards, using 7. 5 g Pd as a chemical modifier. The results obtained for seven wines using the proposed method and an acid digestion procedure did not show any significant difference using a Student’s t-test. Atomization in a transversally <b>heated</b> <b>filter</b> atomizer (THFA) was compared with atomization in a conventional transversally heated platform furnace. The former provided a 2. 6 -fold higher sensitivity, improving the characteristic mass from 34 to 12 pg and a 1. 6 -fold better limit of detection (0. 3 gL− 1 compared to 0. 5 gL− 1) for aqueous solutions using the same injection volume of 20 L. However, the average precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation for the determination of lead in wine under routine conditions was improved from 4. 6 % with platform atomization to 0. 6 % in the THFA. The lead content found in seven arbitrarily chosen white and red wines, five from Brazil, one from Chile and one from Spain, ranged from 6 to 60 gL− 1 Pb with an average content of 11. 4 gL− 1 Pb for the wines from South America...|$|E
40|$|A {{transverse}} <b>heated</b> <b>filter</b> atomizer (THFA) {{was applied}} to the direct determination of Cd and Pb in urine, and its analytical performances were investigated using a PerkinElmer SIMAA 6000 atomic absorption spectrometer. Seronorm certified human urine reference materials and six realistic samples collected locally were used for the method validation. The urines were diluted ten- or five-fold with 0. 2 % HNO 3. Cd and Pb nitrate solutions were employed as standards. Recoveries of the elements from the urine samples were investigated with the analyte addition method. Compared to the transverse heated graphite atomizer (THGA) with a platform, the THFA provided a significant reduction of spectral background and chemical interferences from the urine matrix, without the use of chemical matrix modifiers, a 1. 5 – 2 times increase of the determination sensitivity and, therefore, a reduction of limits of detection up to 0. 018 and 0. 2 mg L 21 for Cd and Pb, respectively. The use of a THFA collector made from carbon fiber and a tungsten wire improved recoveries of lead and cadmium in urine (¢ 92 %). A sampling temperature 150 uC enabled us to skip the drying period, thus a significantly reduced temperature program was obtained. The accuracies of the measurements of Cd and Pb in the Seronorm urine materials were in good agreement with the recommended values: 4. 1 ¡ 0. 1 mg L 21 of Cd (recommended 5) and 92 ¡ 1 mg L 21 of Pb (recommended 85).

In {{the present}} work a direct method for the {{determination}} of arsenic in petroleum derivatives has been developed, comparing {{the performance of a}} commercial transversely heated platform atomizer (THPA) with that of a transversely <b>heated</b> <b>filter</b> atomizer (THFA). The THFA results in a reduction of background absorption and an improved sensitivity as has been reported earlier for this atomizer. The mixture of 0. 1 % (m/v) Pd+ 0. 03 % (m/v) Mg+ 0. 05 % (v/v) Triton X- 100 was used as the chemical modifier for both atomizers. The samples (naphtha, gasoline and petroleum condensate) were stabilized {{in the form of a}} three-component solution (detergentless microemulsion) with the sample, propan- 1 -ol and 0. 1 % (v/v) HNO 3 in a ratio of 3. 0 : 6. 4 : 0. 6. The characteristic mass of 13 pg found in the THFAwas about a factor of two better than that of 28 pg obtained with the THPA; however, the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were essentially the samefor both atomizers (1. 9 and 6. 2 μg L− 1, respectively, for THPA, and 1. 8 and 5. 9 μg L− 1, respectively, for THFA) due to the increased noise observed with the THFA. A possible explanation for that is a partial blockage of the radiation from the hollow cathode lamp by the narrow inner diameter of this tube and the associated loss of radiation energy. Due to the lack of an appropriate certified reference material, recovery tests were carried out with inorganic and organic arsenic standards and the resultswere between 89 % and 111 %. The only advantage of the THFA found in this work was a reduction of the total analysis time by about 20 % due to the ‘hot injection’ that could be realized with this furnace. The arsenic concentrations varied from bLOQ to 43. 3 μg L− 1 in the samples analyzed in this work...|$|E
40|$|I have {{developed}} a novel approach to test for toxic organic substances adsorbed onto ultra fine particulate particles present in the ambient air in Northeast Houston, Texas. These particles are predominantly carbon soot with an aerodynamic diameter (AD) of 3 ̆c 2. 5 μm. If present in the ambient air, many of the organic substances will be absorbed {{to the surface of}} the particles (which act just like a charcoal air filter), and may be adducted into the respiratory system. Once imbedded into the lungs these particles may release the adsorbed toxic organic substances with serious health consequences. I used a Airmetrics portable Minivol air sampler time drawing the ambient air through collection filters samples from 6 separate sites in Northeast Houston, an area known for high ambient PM 2. 5 released from chemical plants and other sources (e. g. vehicle emissions). (1) In practice, the mass of the collected particles were much less than the mass of the filters. My technique was designed to release the adsorbed organic substances on the fine carbon particles by heating the filter samples that included the PM 2. 5 particles prior to identification by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS). The results showed negligible amounts of target chemicals from the collection filters. However, the filters alone released organic substances and GCMS could not distinguish between the organic substances released from the soot particles from those released from the <b>heated</b> <b>filter</b> fabric. However, an efficacy tests of my method using two wax burning candles that released soot revealed high levels of benzene. This suggests that my method has the potential to reveal the organic substances adsorbed onto the PM 2. 5 for analysis. In order to achieve this goal, I must refine the particle collection process which would be independent of the filters; the filters upon heating also release organic substances obscuring the contribution from the soot particles. To obtain pure soot particles I will have to filter more air so that the soot particles can be shaken off the filters and then analyzed by my new technique. ...|$|E

5000|$|While {{the shows}} {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic had much in common they {{differed}} in two important ways. First, the American shows tended to be larger, with seven operators and over thirty projectors not being exceptional. In contrast, the shows in England seldom had more than three operators and ten or so projectors. Second, American shows were generally built around the overhead projector with the liquids in large clock cover glasses. Shows in England and Europe, in contrast, used modified 2" [...] sq. slide projectors which had their Dichroic <b>heat</b> <b>filters</b> (one or both) removed and employed two layers of slide cover glasses with two liquids (oil and water based, in the early days) between each layer. Alternatively different coloured water based dyes were used in each layer, which slowly boiled producing pulsing vapour bubbles when exposed to the heat of the projector lamp with the <b>heat</b> <b>filters</b> removed. Consequently randomly pulsing and moving blobs of colour were projected on the screen creating the light show. Before the projected layers totally dried out a new slide would be switched in the projector slide holder, meanwhile the old glass would be removed, cleaned and refurbished with new dyes and the projection process would continue. The surface tension of the liquids largely retained the mixtures between the glass slides, but the process was nevertheless very messy indeed and operators had their hands almost permanently stained by the dyes. A popular choice of colored liquids for light shows was Flo-Master ink, a product developed for use in permanent marker pens. While this ink was very vivid it also had the problem of staining the operator's hands very deeply.|$|R

In this study it is supposed possible to make the walls of layered construction with layers having different thermal resistivity. Such a layered wall can be modeled electrically as a ladder filter of capacitors and resistors. The input to the ladder is a sinusoidal voltage. Then the following question arises: If the filter capacitors have given values, how should the resistors be chosen so that the output voltage has a given phase lag but least attenuation? It is found possible to answer this question by use of a special variational principle. Applying this analysis to building construction shows how to maximize oscillation of interior temperature with a phase lag of a prescribed number of hours...|$|R
