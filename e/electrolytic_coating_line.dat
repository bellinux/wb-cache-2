40|$|The most {{expensive}} {{component of a}} fuel cell is the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which consists of an ionomer membrane coated with catalyst material. Best-performing MEAs are currently fabricated by depositing and drying liquid catalyst ink on the membrane; however, this process is limited to individual preparation by hand due to the membrane’s rapid water absorption that leads to shape deformation and coating defects. A continuous <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> can reduce the cost and time needed to fabricate the MEA, incentivizing the commercialization and widespread adoption of fuel cells. A pilot-scale membrane <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> was designed for such a task and is described in this paper. Accurate process control is necessary to prevent manufacturing defects from occurring in the <b>coating</b> <b>line.</b> A linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller was developed based on a physics-based model of the coating process to optimally control the temperature and humidity of the drying zones.

Moreover, the salted media at different concentrations allow to unambiguously assess the coating quality in terms of porosity. However, others corrosive media can reveal the slowest reaction without having appeal to a very low frenquency scanning.
