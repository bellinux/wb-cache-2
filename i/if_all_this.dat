Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, {{but it did not}} work. The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but not for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President. Adams resented the intrigue since he felt his service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney's.|$|E

2500|$|A 2001 {{study of}} Red Hat Linux 7.1 {{found that this}} {{distribution}} contained 30 million source lines of code. Using the Constructive Cost Model, the study estimated that this distribution required about eight thousand man-years of development time. According to the study, <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> software had been developed by conventional proprietary means, {{it would have cost}} about $ ( [...] US dollars) to develop in the United States. Most of the source code (71%) was written in the C programming language, but many other languages were used, including C++, Lisp, assembly language, Perl, Python, Fortran, and various shell scripting languages. Slightly over half of all lines of code were licensed under the GPL. The Linux kernel itself was 2.4 million lines of code, or 8% of the total.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{problems}} with this interpretation, however. [...] The chariot {{is not one of}} victory. [...] It would be unusual for a two-horse chariot to be used for the triumph. [...] Also, Tiberius wears the toga. [...] The toga represents civility and peace, not war. [...] Perhaps {{this is a way to}} hand the victory to Augustus’ auguries. [...] Tiberius steps down from the chariot, doing obeisance to Augustus, giving his adoptive parent the triumph and victory. [...] <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> is true, then figure #8 could still be one of two persons, Drusus or Germanicus. [...] By this age, Drusus was probably already dead, having fallen from his horse and suffered irreparable injuries. [...] It could be, then, a representation of Drusus, and his memory, since he was fondly regarded by almost all. [...] Since he is clad in fighting garb, the helmet probably beside him under the chariot, and coincidentally standing next to a horse, this could very well be Drusus. [...] In addition, there are three constellations relating to the three portraits. [...] Drusus would claim Gemini, though the Gemini is quite covert. [...] If the portrait represented Drusus as alive, however, the gem would have been made about the same time as the Ara Pacis and the Altar of Augustus, sometime before 9 B.C., the year of Drusus’ death.|$|E
2500|$|<b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> is true, {{then where}} do the world senses come in? The early empiricists all {{stumbled}} over this point. Hume asserted that all knowledge comes from the senses, and then gave away the ballgame by excepting abstract propositions, which he called [...] "relations of ideas". These, he said, were absolutely true (although the mathematicians who thought them up, being human, might get them wrong). Mill, on the other hand, tried to deny that abstract ideas exist outside the physical world: all numbers, he said, [...] "must be numbers of something: {{there are no such}} things as numbers in the abstract". When we count to eight or add five and three we are really counting spoons or bumblebees. [...] "All things possess quantity", he said, so that propositions concerning numbers are propositions concerning [...] "all things whatever". But then in almost a contradiction of himself he went on to acknowledge that numerical and algebraic expressions are not necessarily attached to real world objects: they [...] "do not excite in our minds ideas of any things in particular". Mill's low reputation as a philosopher of logic, and the low estate of empiricism in the century and a half following him, derives from this failed attempt to link abstract thoughts to the physical world, when it may be more plausibly arguable that abstraction consists precisely of separating the thought from its physical foundations.|$|E
