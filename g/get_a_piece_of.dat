25|$|At Pocono, Earnhardt started {{eighth and}} stayed inside the Top 10 {{most of the}} afternoon. On the last restart, he was behind Brad Keselowski.

The next week at Michigan, Earnhardt started inside the Top 5, but finished 7th, after several cars had different pit strategies.

He writes: [...] "Shot (and shown in Cannes) on 35mm, often in sickly greens and yellows and with deep shadows, Erdely's cinematography is one of the film's major assets, but it wouldn't be half as effective without the soundwork, which plays a major role in suggesting what is happening around Saul, with audiences often forced to rely on the sound to imagine the whole, horrible picture". Writing for The Film Stage, Giovanni Marchini Camia gave the film an A rating, and called it [...] "a towering landmark for filmic fictionalizations of the Holocaust". A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film an A- rating, and praised the movie's unique perspective: [...] "Son of Saul is the rare Holocaust drama that finds actual drama, and not just despair, in the living hell of a concentration camp".
