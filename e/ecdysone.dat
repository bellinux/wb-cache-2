These are switched by the hormone <b>ecdysone.</b> The dry-season forms are usually more cryptic, perhaps offering better camouflage when vegetation is scarce.

25|$|Hydrogen cyanide is {{released}} by the young fronds of bracken when eaten by mammals or insects. Two major insect moulting hormones, alpha <b>ecdysone</b> and 20-hydroxyecdysone, are found in bracken. These cause uncontrollable, repeated moulting in insects ingesting the fronds, leading to rapid death.|$|E
25|$|Prothoracic glands are diffuse, paired glands {{located at}} the back of the head or in the thorax. These glands secrete an ecdysteroid called <b>ecdysone,</b> or the {{moulting}} hormone, which initiates the epidermal moulting process. Additionally it plays a role in accessory reproductive glands in the female, differentiation of ovarioles and in the process of egg production.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone is {{observed}} in most vertebrates. Testosterone and the classical nuclear androgen receptor {{first appeared in}} gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). Agnathans (jawless vertebrates) such as lampreys don't produce testosterone but instead use androstenedione as a male sex hormone. Fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone. Its counterpart in insects is <b>ecdysone.</b> The presence of these ubiquitous steroids {{in a wide range}} of animals suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} and physical {{nature of the}} arthropod exoskeleton limits its ability to stretch or change shape as the animal grows. In some special cases, such as the abdomens of termite queens and honeypot ants means that continuous growth of arthropods is not possible. Therefore, growth is periodic and concentrated into {{a period of time}} when the exoskeleton is shed, called moulting or ecdysis, which is under the control of a hormone called <b>ecdysone.</b> Moulting is a complex process that is invariably dangerous for the arthropod involved. Before the old exoskeleton is shed, the cuticle separates from the epidermis through a process called apolysis. New cuticle is excreted by the underlying epidermis, and mineral salts are usually withdrawn from the old cuticle for re-use. After the old cuticle is shed, the arthropod typically pumps up its body (for example, by air or water intake) to allow the new cuticle to expand to a larger size: the process of hardening by dehydration of the cuticle then takes place. A newly molted arthropod typically is pale in colour; in that state it is said to be teneral or a callow. It generally darkens or otherwise gains colour as its exoskeleton hardens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{moulting}} in insects {{begins with the}} separation of the cuticle from the underlying epidermal cells (apolysis) and ends with the shedding of the old cuticle (ecdysis).

2500|$|... 7-Dehydrocholesterol is a {{zoosterol}} that {{functions in}} the serum as a cholesterol precursor, and is converted to vitamin D3 in the skin, therefore functioning as provitamin-D3. The presence of this compound in human skin enables humans to manufacture vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) from ultraviolet rays in the sun light, via an intermediate isomer pre-vitamin D3. It {{is also found in}} the milk of several mammalian species. In insects it is a precursor for the hormone <b>ecdysone,</b> required for reaching adulthood. It was discovered by Nobel-laureate organic chemist Adolf Windaus.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the arthropods, velvet worms do {{not possess}} a rigid exoskeleton. Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a {{hydrostatic}} skeleton, similarly to many unrelated soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example sea anemones and various worms. Pressure of their incompressible internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it. The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the cuticula; a single layer of epidermis cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues. The cuticula is about a micrometer thick and covered with fine [...] In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of Î±-chitin and various proteins, although not containing collagen. It {{can be divided into}} an external epicuticula and an internal procuticula, which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly water-repellent, the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by respiration, and, as a result, velvet worms can only live in microclimates with high humidity to avoid desiccation. The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papillae, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny scales, lending the skin a velvety appearance (from which the common name is likely derived). It also feels like dry velvet to the touch, for which its water-repellent nature is responsible. Moulting of the skin (ecdysis) takes place regularly, around every 14 days, induced by the hormone <b>ecdysone.</b> The inner surface of the skin bears a hexagonal pattern. At each moult, the shed skin is replaced by the epidermis, which lies immediately beneath it; unlike the cuticula, this consists of living cells. Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the body's longitudinal axis. The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments. The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the body pigment is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, {{but in the case of}} the Peripatopsidae, the body pigment is insoluble in ethanol.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a complex}} {{interaction}} between JH, the hormone <b>ecdysone</b> and vitellogenin.

50|$|The <b>ecdysone</b> {{receptor}} is {{a nuclear}} receptor found in arthropods, where it controls development {{and contributes to}} other processes such as reproduction. The receptor is a non-covalent heterodimer of two proteins, the EcR protein and ultraspiracle protein (USP). It binds to and is activated by ecdysteroids. Insect <b>ecdysone</b> receptors are currently better characterized than those from other arthropods, and mimics of ecdysteroids are used commercially as caterpillar-selective insecticides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ecdysone</b> is a steroidal prohormone of {{the major}} insect molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone, which is {{secreted}} from the prothoracic glands. Insect molting hormones (<b>ecdysone</b> and its homologues) are generally called ecdysteroids. Ecdysteroids act as moulting hormones of arthropods but also occur in other related phyla where they can play different roles. In Drosophila melanogaster, an increase in <b>ecdysone</b> concentration induces the expression of genes coding for proteins that the larva requires, and it causes chromosome puffs (sites of high expression) to form in polytene chromosomes. Recent findings in Chris Q. Doe lab have found a novel role of this hormone in regulating temporal gene transitions within neural stem cells. <b>Ecdysone</b> and other ecdysteroids also appear in many plants mostly as a protection agent (toxins or antifeedants) against herbivorous insects. These phytoecdysteroids have been reputed to have medicinal value and are part of herbal adaptogenic remedies like Cordyceps, yet an ecdysteroid precursor in plants {{has been shown to}} have cytotoxic properties. A pesticide sold with the name MIMIC has ecdysteroid activity, although its chemical structure has little resemblance to the ecdysteroids.|$|E

50|$|An ecdysteroid {{is a type}} of steroid hormones in {{insects that}} are derived from enzymatic {{modification}} of cholesterol by p450 enzymes. This occurs by a mechanism similar to steroid synthesis in vertebrates. <b>Ecdysone</b> and 20-hydroxyecdysone regulate larval molts, onset of puparium formation, and metamorphosis. Being that these hormones are hydrophobic, they traverse lipid membranes and permeate the tissues of an organism. Indeed, the main receptor of these hormone signals - the <b>ecdysone</b> receptor - is an intracellular protein.|$|E

50|$|In Drosophila, {{there are}} {{extensive}} changes {{made to the}} nervous system during metamorphosis. Metamorphosis is triggered by <b>ecdysone,</b> and during this period, extensive pruning and reorganization of the neural network occurs.

Adding or removing ecdysteroids from the animal's diet then gives a convenient way to turn the inserted gene on or off (see <b>ecdysone</b> receptor). At usual doses, 20-hydroxyecdysone appears to have little or no effect on animals that do not have extra genes inserted; it also has high bioavailability when taken orally, so it is useful for determining whether the transgene has been taken up effectively.
