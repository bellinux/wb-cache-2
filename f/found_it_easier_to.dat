5|$|Cagney {{remained}} in retirement for 20 years, conjuring {{up images of}} Jack L. Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> rebuff others, including a part in The Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E
5|$|Early script drafts had Henry accidentally kill Louise Mortimer, but {{producers}} {{were never}} satisfied with this development, thinking Henry would have failed if she died. Writers also posited that Henry's father's murder involved revenge {{after he had}} an affair, but the producers and Gatiss <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> mention he died because he learned of Franklin's experiments with the hallucinogenic gas. The ending also changed; the final scene had originally involved Moriarty entering the Tower of London but that was held back for the following episode.|$|E

5|$|Narayan uses a sarangi {{obtained}} from Uday Lal and built in Meerut in the 1920s or 1930s in his concerts and recordings. He plays on foreign harp strings {{to produce a}} clearer tone. Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument and added a fourth string, but removed it because it hindered playing. In the 1940s, he exchanged gut with steel for the first string and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> play, but reverted to using only gut strings because the steel string altered the sound.|$|E
5|$|Episode IIs soundtrack {{was first}} {{released}} as an album on July 7, 2004 as Xenosaga II: Jenseits Von Gut und Böse Movie Scene Soundtrack by Victor Entertainment. Including only Kajiura's work, the album spans two discs and 40 tracks {{and has a}} duration of 1:52:26. Another soundtrack album for the game, Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse Soundtrack, was released by Namco and Brady Games as a promotional extra for the Brady Games strategy guide for the game. The 11-track CD again excluded the work of Hosoe, instead sampling Kajiura's pieces. Released on February 17, 2005, the album has a duration of 30:25. The Movie Scene album reached position #46 on the Japanese Oricon charts. In the liner notes for Movie Scene Soundtrack, Kajiura claims that she felt that her work for the game was different from her previous pieces, as {{it was more of}} a soundtrack, with the individual tunes fitting more closely together. She also said that she <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> compose tracks that fit with the worldview that Mitsuda had created for the first game, rather than invent her own. She also notes that she intended tracks 1—4 to be a single, continuous piece, although they were broken up in the game; she intended tracks 20 and 21 the same way.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the overall}} Vietnamese {{military}} performance {{was not as}} successful as Định's guerrilla activities. On June 5, 1862, Định broke with the Nguyễn army after the court's plenipotentiary Phan Thanh Giản and another official, Lam Duy Hiep, signed the Treaty of Saigon. This agreement ceded the three southern provinces of Gia Định, Định Tường and Biên Hòa to France; they became the colony of Cochinchina. The treaty was accompanied by financial payments to France, religious concessions to missionaries and commercial opportunities for European merchants. Militarily, {{the withdrawal of the}} Nguyễn army deprived the resistance of the logistical support that could be provided by a regular force. It also permitted the French to concentrate their efforts against a single antagonist. Politically, the treaty provided, for those Vietnamese who needed one, a legal basis to collaborate with the French on Cochinchinese soil. As a result, the colonial forces <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> recruit militia and administrative personnel among Vietnamese who had been too afraid or too embarrassed to serve the French openly before the 1862 treaty. Định then allied himself with Võ Duy Dương to form the Movement of Popular Self Defense (Phong Trao Nhan Dan Tu Ve), creating an operations base in Đồng Tháp.|$|E

The original video was planned to be titled The Annoying Apple, but when he started animating the video he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> put features on an orange than an apple and make it clear.|$|E
25|$|Such an {{accomplishment}} is {{more significant than}} it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons. First, {{it could be used}} to improve navigation and trade between Miletus's colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second, Thales would probably have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> convince the Ionian city-states to join in a federation in order to push the Median threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.|$|E
25|$|Germany invaded Norway in April 1940. The {{country was}} {{completely}} occupied by June. There were about 1,800 Jews in Norway, persecuted by the Norwegian Nazis. In late 1940, the Jews were banned from some occupations and in 1941 all Jews had to register their property with the government. Also in 1940, Germany invaded Denmark. The country was overrun {{so quickly that}} there was no chance of organizing resistance. Consequently, the Danish government stayed in power and the Germans <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> work through it. Because of this, few measures were taken against the Danish Jews before 1942.|$|E

25|$|New France {{allocated}} concessions {{all along}} lake Champlain to French settlers and built forts {{to defend the}} waterways. In colonial times, Lake Champlain {{was used as a}} water (or, in winter, ice) passage between the Saint Lawrence and Hudson valleys. Travelers <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> journey by boats and sledges on the lake rather than go overland on unpaved and frequently mud-bound roads. The lake's northern tip at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (known as St. John in colonial times under British rule), is a short distance from Montreal. The southern tip at Whitehall (Skenesborough in revolutionary times) is a short distance from Saratoga, Glens Falls, and Albany, New York.|$|E
25|$|In early 1916, the Germans {{had more}} and better {{equipment}} for trench warfare, with good quality hand grenades, rifle grenades and trench mortars; the Germans made more effort to repair and improve defences and with a homogeneous army, <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> move artillery, ammunition and men along the front. A substantial cadre of the pre-war trained officers and conscripts remained, to lead the wartime recruits. British tunnellers achieved an ascendancy over their German equivalents but in ground operations, the number of operational machine-guns and the volume and accuracy of artillery fire, had more effect than individual skill and bravery; the quantity of heavy guns often determined the course of engagements. The success of a local attack left the victors vulnerable to a counter-attack and captured positions were often more costly to hold, than the previous positions.|$|E
25|$|The Makins came {{to police}} {{attention}} on 11 October 1892 when worker James Hanoney was clearing a clogged underground drain {{in the backyard}} of a home in Burren Street, Macdonaldtown, and found it blocked with the remains of two infants. Investigators examined records to trace the Makins, who had moved again to Chippendale. The Makins and four of their daughters were arrested, though only John and Sarah were charged. Police exhumed remains from the backyards of eleven homes that the Makins had occupied since 1890. The bodies of twelve infants were recovered, though some sources say thirteen. Prosecutors believed the Makins sought to profit by taking in babies for childcare payments, and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> kill the children and deceive the parents to continue receiving money. One of their victims was Horace Murray, whose clothing was identified by his mother Amber.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, {{the parents}} of a 6-year-old boy in Miami sued the police {{department}} for firing a Taser at their child. The police said the boy was threatening to injure his own leg with a shard of glass, and said that using the device was the safest option to prevent the boy from injuring himself. Nevertheless, the boy's mother told CNN that the three officers involved probably <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> reason with her child. Also in 2004, a 12-year-old girl skipping school and drinking alcohol was Tasered in Miami-Dade while she was running from police and started to run into traffic. The Taser was successfully deployed to stop her from being hit by cars or causing an automobile accident. In March 2008, an 11-year-old girl was subdued with a Taser. In March 2009, a 15-year-old boy died from alcohol-induced excited delirium in Michigan after being Tasered.|$|E
25|$|As {{she became}} older, {{she was given}} a Lutheran governess, Frau von Bielfeld; her {{daughter}} Lisette was three years older, {{and served as a}} companion to Louise. Lisette got her interested in romantic novels long before many other girls her age. Bielfeld was highly educated, but died after only five years, in October 1782. Despite Frau von Bielfeld's attention to education, Louise's studies were much neglected, and she forgot much of what had been taught her. As a consequence, Bielfeld left shortly before she died, and was replaced with her approval by a new thirty-year-old governess from the countryside, Fraulein von Keller; Louise and Keller soon formed a strong attachment. Previously, Bielfeld had <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> complete Louise's schoolwork and show it to her parents, thus ending in little real improvement and understanding on Louise's part. Keller on the other hand was less educated and in need of instruction, consequently imbuing in Louise a taste for study.|$|E
25|$|Manga {{made their}} way only {{gradually}} into U.S. markets, first in association with anime and then independently. Some U.S. fans became aware of manga in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, anime was initially more accessible than manga to U.S. fans, {{many of whom were}} college-age young people who <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> obtain, subtitle, and exhibit video tapes of anime than translate, reproduce, and distribute tankōbon-style manga books. One of the first manga translated into English and marketed in the U.S. was Keiji Nakazawa's Barefoot Gen, an autobiographical story of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima issued by Leonard Rifas and Educomics (1980–1982). More manga were translated between the mid-1980s and 1990s, including Golgo 13 in 1986, Lone Wolf and Cub from First Comics in 1987, and Kamui, Area 88, and Mai the Psychic Girl, also in 1987 and all from Viz Media-Eclipse Comics. Others soon followed, including Akira from Marvel Comics' Epic Comics imprint, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind from Viz Media, and Appleseed from Eclipse Comics in 1988, and later Iczer-1 (Antarctic Press, 1994) and Ippongi Bang's F-111 Bandit (Antarctic Press, 1995).|$|E
