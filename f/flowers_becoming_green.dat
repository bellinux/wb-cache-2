40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to aim in general to {{understand}} the perception of industries in India – a fast growing economy, towards green philosophy and to investigate further what initiatives those industries have taken for <b>becoming</b> <b>green.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The study is exploratory in nature and attempts to understand the behaviour of three types of industries, namely, durable, non-durable and services towards green philosophy. Findings – Results of the study reflect that industries in India, in general have a positive view for practicing green philosophy. They feel <b>becoming</b> <b>green</b> will help them in gaining the competitive advantage and will support them in sustainable growth. Also the industries that have a positive attitude towards greening have taken some measures and initiatives in this direction to establish a sustainable competitive advantage for succeeding in today’s highly challenging and dynamic global markets. Research limitations/implications – The present exploratory study provides a starting-point for further research. Researchers can further explore whether industries using green philosophy were able to register a competitive advantage and could gain added market share and profits by <b>becoming</b> <b>green.</b> They can investigate the reason behind this green attitude, whether industries are using green practices for cutting costs in turn to increase their profits or whether they have a genuine concern for environmental protection and society’s welfare and therefore adopting green practices in their industry. Originality/value – Most of such studies in thefield of green marketing and social economics are done in developed countries and remain conspicuously missing in the context of fast developing Asian countries. This research is a step to filling this gap and providing a platform for further research in this area...|$|R

40|$|Green {{management}} and going green {{are not as}} clear cut and easy as hyped by the general media. While going ecologically green is indeed beneficial and appropriate, the process and procedure of <b>becoming</b> <b>green</b> is anything but easy. Firstly, turning green is largely not a legal requirement, but a voluntary process. Thus, even though LEED (which {{is by far the}} more publicly known green certification standard) governs the certification of the green management effort, it is not a compulsory condition for practitioners to go green. Secondly, even with the encouragement of incentives to comply, practitioners are skeptical in <b>becoming</b> <b>green</b> due to: (a) a lack of true understanding of the benefit of ecologically friendly procedures (the practice of profits versus the theory of benefits); (b) lack of short term gain in life cycle costing (practitioners want instant incentives); and (c) mostly, because it is not a legal requirement {{for the vast majority of}} municipalities.

2500|$|Depending on temperatures, 40–80 {{days after}} bud break {{the process of}} {{flowering}} begins with small flower clusters appearing on {{the tips of the}} young shoots looking like buttons. Flowering occurs when average daily temperatures stay between 1520°C (5968°F) which in the Northern Hemisphere wine regions is generally around May and for the Southern Hemisphere regions around November. A few weeks after the initial clusters appear, the flowers start to grow in size with individual <b>flowers</b> <b>becoming</b> observable.

50|$|The {{expansion}} of the railway system in the 19th century led to the export of vegetable products, including <b>flowers,</b> <b>becoming</b> a profitable business for Cornwall. The Revd. Canon Arthur Townshend Boscawen (1862-1939), rector of Ludgvan from 1893 to 1939, was instrumental in founding the Cornish anemone industry. He also introduced broccoli as a commercial crop from imported German seed. The wet climate and relatively poor soil of Cornwall make it unsuitable for growing many arable crops, but the conditions are ideal for growing the rich grass required for dairying, leading {{to the production of}} Cornwall's other famous export, clotted cream. Though it has declined significantly agriculture is still of economic importance.|$|R
