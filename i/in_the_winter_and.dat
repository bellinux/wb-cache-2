5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification {{as the rest of}} Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter)</b> <b>and</b> caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific, {{migration}} {{patterns are}} poorly characterized. Although some fin whales are apparently present year-round in the Gulf of California, {{there is a}} significant increase in their numbers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> spring. Southern fin whales migrate seasonally from relatively high-latitude Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer to low-latitude breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding areas is still unknown, since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean.|$|E

5|$|It {{undertakes}} seasonal {{movements in}} response to the availability of water and food. African birds move southwards in the southern summer to breed and return north <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> <b>and</b> Asian populations are highly nomadic due to the variability of rainfall. This species has strong colonising tendencies, having expanded its range in Mexico, the US and the West Indies in recent decades. Wandering birds can turn up far beyond the normal range, sometimes staying to nest, as in Morocco, Peru and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|More than 330 {{species of}} birds were {{recorded}} in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country. Millions of migratory birds pass through the Persian Gulf region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> autumn months. One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn. The many islands and shallow seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Socotra cormorant; up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar islands.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} filmed exterior {{scenes in}} Illinois <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> {{the spring of}} 2001, using real weather conditions such as snow, rain, and mud for the scenes. Mendes considered the usage of bleak weather conditions and the intended coldness of Gassner's exterior locations to define the characters' emotional states. Pullman became a key location to reflect this theme, having several settings, including the town's historic Florence Hotel, easily redressed by the crew for the film. Filming concluded in June 2001.|$|E
5|$|The mounded prairie {{region is}} located {{on top of the}} plateaus, {{characterized}} by many species grasses and wildflowers around the vernal pools, with mounds of soil created by erosion. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a plant endemic to the Table Rocks, grows near these pools. They bloom for about ten days in April. When filled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> early spring, the pools are also a known habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi), a threatened species.|$|E
5|$|The {{spreading}} {{of organisms}} is facilitated when risk factors are present. Alcoholism {{is associated with}} Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobic organisms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; smoking facilitates the effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella pneumophila. Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae is more common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> <b>and</b> should be suspected in persons aspirating {{a large amount of}} anaerobic organisms.|$|E

5|$|Butlin's {{inspiration}} for his holiday empire {{had come from}} a holiday to Barry Island in his twenties, when he had been locked out of his B all day by his landlady. He finally decided to build the last and smallest of the camps there in 1965. Butlin took out a 99-year lease on the headland at Nell's Point, Barry Island, in 1966. Building work began there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E
5|$|Local music {{institutions}} {{include the}} Athens Symphony Orchestra, Athens Choral Society (founded in 1971), Athens Youth Symphony and the Athens Folk Music and Dance Society.

The first performance came in 1979; the Orchestra now has two regular performances, one {{in the summer and}} one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> <b>and</b> has also done shows for young people, pops concerts and Christmas concerts. In 1996, the Athens Symphony moved into its modern home, the Classic Center Theatre in downtown Athens.|$|E
5|$|Skyline Drive was {{originally}} lined with miles of chestnut log guardrails. However, the guardrails rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced. The Marys Rock Tunnel was partially lined with concrete in 1958 to prevent icicles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> water seepage in the summer. In 1983, the Federal Highway Administration began work to replace {{several of the}} original stone walls on the drive with concrete walls that used the original stone as a veneer. The road {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1997. On September 22, 2005, Skyline Drive was designated a National Scenic Byway. Skyline Drive was designated a National Historic Landmark in October 2008 for its pioneering place in the development of national parks in the eastern United States.|$|E

5|$|Some {{populations of}} cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and {{distinguishing}} {{between the two}} can be difficult for this species. In many areas populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the northern hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> return in the spring. Migration in western Africa {{is in response to}} rainfall, and in South America migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the non-breeding season. Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (Ardeola grayii) on the south-eastern coast of India and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The Maine Coon {{is a long}} {{or medium}} haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter {{on the head and}} shoulders, and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> thinner during the summer.|$|E
5|$|These sparrows feed {{primarily}} on seeds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> insects {{in the spring}} and summer. The birds are often territorial, with males guarding their territory through song and displays. Flight is awkward for this species, which prefers to hop along the ground for locomotion. They are monogamous and breed during spring. Two to five eggs are laid in the bird's nest, which is cup-shaped and well hidden. Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small raptors, while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles. They have been known to live for up to three years, two months. Although the species has been classified as least concern, or unthreatened with extinction, some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct.|$|E
