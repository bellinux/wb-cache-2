Results on {{plasma heating}} in {{experiments}} with {{neutral beam injection}} (NBI) and {{ion cyclotron resonance heating}} (ICRH) at the fundamental <b>harmonic</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> minority in deuterium plasma in the Globus-M spherical tokamak are presented. Numerical simulation of fast ion trajectories was performed in the plasma configurations reconstructed from magnetic measurements {{with the help of the}} EFIT code. Energy spectra of slowing down fast ions were measured with tangentially and perpendicularly directed neutral particle analysers in a wide range of energies. Reliable H-mode transition was achieved after the change of the toroidal magnetic field direction. The ion drift now is directed towards the lower X-point, which exists inside the vessel even in a limiter configuration. The most stable H mode transition was achieved in NBI experiments. Also L-H transition was observed in ohmic heating (OH) regime and at ICRH in limiter and divertor magnetic configurations. By means of multi-channel multi-pulse Thomson scattering (TS) diagnostic we observed a formation of a steep density gradient after the L-H transition. Flat density distribution in the plasma bulk was sustained during all the H-mode period. Modeling of transport processes in the L and H-modes was performed with the help of the ASTRA code. The calculated energy confinement times are consistent with the ITER scalings. It is shown that in the ion heat conductivity remains neoclassical the H-mode and no barrier is formed for the ion temperature profile. The particle diffusion coefficient is reduced sufficiently inside the transport barrier region. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of electrostatic ion cyclotron waves by a perpendicular ion beam in the F-region ionosphere is described. The ion beam experiment {{was part of}} the Porcupine program and produced electrostatic hydrogen cyclotron waves just above <b>harmonics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hydrogen</b> cyclotron frequency.

Observations show that ion distributions in the equatorial region are often anisotropic and that these distributions excite ion cyclotron waves below the proton gyrofrequency and near the <b>harmonics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hydrogen</b> cyclotron frequency. It is suggested that downcoming right-hand circularly polarized waves acquire a left-hand circularly polarized component at the crossover frequency and may tunnel through a stop zone to altitudes where they contribute to ion heating...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{in a new}} regime of ion Bernstein wave (IBW) heating {{has been carried out}} using 130 MHz high power transmitters in the JIPP T-IIU tokamak The heating regime utilized the IBW branch between the 3 rd and 4 th <b>harmonics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hydrogen</b> ion cyclotron frequencies. This harmonic number is the highest among those used in the IBW experiments ever conducted. The net radio-frequency (RF) power injected into the plasma is around 400 kW, limited by the transmitter output power. Core heating of ions and electrons was confirmed in the experiment and density profile peaking was found to feature the IBW heating (IBWH). The peaking of the density profile was also found when IBW was applied to the neutral beam injection heated discharges. An analysis by use of a transport code with these experimental data indicates that the particle confinement should be improved in the plasma core region on the application of IBWH. It is also found that the ion energy distribution function observed during IBWH has less high energy tail than those in conventional ion cyclotron range of frequency heating regimes. The observed IBWH-produced ion energy distribution function is in a reasonable agreement with the calculation based on the quasi-linear RF diffusion / Fokker-Planck model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{diminishing}} of impurities {{concentration in}} the discharge and the loop voltage decrease was achieved in the Globus-M spherical tokamak {{as a result of}} technological improvements. During experiments on density limit investigation in OH and NBI heating regimes the average density in 0. 4 T magnetic field was reached in excess of 1. 1 · 1020 m- 3 with gas puff supply only. The role of core long wave MHD fluctuations and their coupling with peripherial modes is outlined. Greenwald limit was achieved. The NBI fast particles slowing down spectrum was measured and found to be in agreement with classical Coulomb scattering theory. During NBI low plasma density regimes with overheated ions and high density regimes with features of electron heating were obtained and studied.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{are pushing for}} long wavelength driver pulses for High Harmonic Generation (HHG). The advantage of longer wavelengths is that the cut-off <b>of</b> the <b>harmonic</b> spectrum can be increased {{without the need for}} large electric fields. Large electric field is undesirable because it leads to large plasma generation which reduces harmonic generation due to phase mismatch and ground state depletion. Most of the current literature on HHG uses the Dipole Approximation for calculation <b>of</b> <b>harmonic</b> spectrum. The physical ramification of the Dipole Approximation is that it neglects the magnetic field component to the driver field. It is well known that a charge moving in a magnetic field experiences a Lorentz force. In HHG, harmonics are generated by recombination of an electron wave packet, moving {{under the influence of the}} driver pulse, with its parent atom. The Lorentz force can displace the electron wave packet perpendicular to the direction of polarization and as a result reducing the recombination amplitude. This Lorentz displacement increases as we move towards longer wavelengths and higher intensities. In this thesis, intensity and wavelength limits at which the Lorentz displacement becomes significant have been investigated. By numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, we investigate the optimum driver pulse duration for 400 nm, 800 nm and 2 micron driver pulses for a given harmonic for hydrogen. (cont.) It was found that longer wavelength have smaller efficiencies (neglecting phase matching condition). Finally, the <b>harmonic</b> spectrum <b>of</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> driven by 800 nm pulse predicted by analytic Three Step Model (TSM) has been compared with the harmonic spectrum generated by numerical solution of time-dependent Schrödinger equation. It was found, as the current theories predict, that TSM becomes less reliable as the Keldysh Parameter increases. It was also observed that for low harmonic energies, the TSM spectrum deviates from the numerical spectrum by many orders of magnitude. by Siddharth Bhardwaj. Thesis (S. M.)
