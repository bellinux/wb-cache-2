40|$|The {{composition}} {{of the mixture of}} chemicals in the work environment depends mostly on the temperature of the air or processing temperature of the raw material or the intermediate products. For determination the chemicals in the air FTIR/FT-NIR spectrometer Interspec 301 -X with open optical path and <b>Dräger</b> <b>tubes</b> were used. The toxicology of the gaseous components was determined {{on the basis of the}} scientific literature. On the basis of these investigations and the legislation on the chemicals safety (exposure limits) the health risk assessment model (HRA) was worked out. This model connects the hazards in the work environment and the health risk to the workers and also gives the possibility to the medical personnel to determine the frequency of the medical examinations and biomonitoring for the workers continuously working in the hazardous conditions. The novelty of the study includes in the possibility to keep under control the chemicals concentration in the work environment air through the use of HRA model and the measurement with modern measurement equipment (FTIR/FT-NIR).

The occupational illness stages are developed using statistical data of diagnoses of occupational diseases. Conclusion: according to the proposed model, the exposure to toluene and xylene poses justified risk (risk level II), benzene and phenol unjustified risk (risk level III). Recommendations: without any additional control measures applied, the risk for occupational diseases caused by these chemicals is significant; the personal protective equipment should be provided to the workers...|$|R
40|$|Feed {{trials were}} carried out to assess the {{influence}} of crude protein content in finishing pig diets on odour and ammonia emissions. Eight pigs (4 boars and 4 gilts), average initial weight 70. 8 kg (s. e. 3. 167) were housed in two pens that were isolated {{from the rest of}} a pig house at University College Dublin Research Farm, Newcastle, Dublin, Ireland. Four diets containing 130, 160, 190 and 220 g kg− 1 crude protein were fed during six four-week feeding periods (one treatment per room). The first week of the feeding periods served to allow odour build up in the pens and as a dietary adjustment period. The pens had partially slatted floors that were cleaned and had all the manure removed after each four-week period. Odour and ammonia concentrations were measured on days 9, 14, 16, 21 and 23 of each trial period. Odour samples were collected in Nalophan bags and analysed for odour concentration using an ECOMA Yes/No olfactometer. The odour threshold concentration was calculated according to the response of the olfactometry panel members and was displayed in OuE m− 3, which referred to the physiological response from the panel equivalent to that elicited by 40 ppb v− 1 n-butanol evaporated in 1 m 3 of neutral gas. Ammonia concentrations in the ventilation air were measured using <b>Dräger</b> <b>tubes.</b> The odour emission rates per animal for the 130, 160, 190 and 220 g kg− 1 crude protein diets were 12. 1, 13. 2, 19. 6 and 17. 6 OuE s− 1 animal− 1, respectively (P 0. 05). Manipulation of dietary crude protein levels would appear to offer a low cost alternative, in relation to end-of-pipe treatments, for the abatement of odour and ammonia emissions from finishing pig house...|$|R

Headspace samples of infected potatoes and ham were entrained passively on to a SPME fiber and dynamically onto Tenax GR and Chromosorb 103 thermal desorption tubes. Ammonia was identified as the major amine component in all cases. Other amines that accounted in total for less than 5 % of the ammonia peak by total ion current were identified. The potato headspace contained triethylamine, while the ham headspace contained methylamine and dimethylamine, identified by SPME and by both thermal desorption tubes. The Chromosorb 103 also entrained trace amounts of ethyleneamine from the ham headspace.

40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1991 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Association and the Hydrology Section - Arizona-Nevada Academy of Science - April 20, 1991, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, ArizonaNew {{technical}} {{approaches and}} cost cutting alternatives are being utilized {{in the environmental}} engineering field. These unique methods {{are used in the}} mapping, delineation and remediation of contaminated sites. One development which has seen a sudden increase in the recent past is the utilization of soil vapor surveys to map contamination plumes in the vadose zone. Using the soil vapor method, industrial sites and sites containing potential buried drums or underground storage tanks can be quickly evaluated for the presence of volatile contaminants. This information can be especially important in property transactions where buyers desire to protect themselves from potential costly clean-ups. The soil vapor survey consists of sampling volatile vapors in the vadose zone and analysis of the vapors on analytical instruments. The survey targets those contaminants which have volatilized from residues in soils or shallow ground water. One method of sampling soil vapors is penetrating five to ten feet into the sub-surface with a sampling probe. Upon collection of the vapors, concentrations may be measured. The analytical instruments can range from simple <b>Drager</b> <b>Tubes</b> to a laboratory gas chromatograph. The methodology for selecting sampling locations depends on the site. An underground storage tank facility may be approached by completing sampling locations at the tank pit and near the product lines. A grid sampling location map may be used to sample a property with an unknown organic content. Soil vapor surveys have limitations in regards to soil types, sampling depths and constituents being analyzed. However, given the proper conditions, soil vapor surveys can provide qualitative data at lower costs than alternative methods...|$|R

40|$|Information {{is limited}} for the {{exposure}} levels of airborne hazardous substances in swine feed buildings {{that are not}} completely enclosed. Open-style breeding, growing and finishing swine houses in six farms in subtropical Taiwan were studied for the airborne concentrations of endotoxin, dust, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. The air in the farrowing and nursery stalls as partially enclosed was also simultaneously evaluated. Three selected gases and airborne dusts were quantified respectively by using <b>Drager</b> diffusion <b>tubes</b> and a filter-weighing method. Endotoxin was analyzed by the Limulusamoebocyte lysate assay. Average concentration of airborne total endotoxin among piggeries was between 36. 8 and 298 EU/m 3, while that for respirable endotoxin was 14. 1 – 129 EU/m 3. Mean concentration of total dust was between 0. 15 and 0. 34 mg/m 3, with average level of respirable dust of 0. 14 mg/m 3. The respective concentrations of NH 3, CO 2 and H 2 S were less than 5 ppm, 600 – 895 ppm and less than 0. 2 ppm. Airborne concentrations of total dust and endotoxin in the nur-sery house were {{higher than in the}} other types of swine houses. The finishing house presented the highest exposure risk to NH 3, CO 2 and H 2 S.

40|$|Dust {{exposure}} and respiratory health problems were studied among randomly selected {{workers in a}} coal mine in Tanzania. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the personal respirable dust and quartz {{exposure and}} the prevalence of respiratory problems and to present recommendations on how to improve the situation. An epidemiological cross-sectional study was carried out at the Kiwira Coal Mine in Tanzania. Dust exposure was measured during two periods in 2003 and 2004. In total, 204 dust samples were taken from 141 workers. The surveys involved 299 workers randomly selected from 8 job teams including development, mine, underground maintenance, underground transport, washing plant, boiler and turbine, ash and cinders and office workers. The study conducted a face-to-face standardized interview to collect information on demographic characteristics, work history, previous diseases, acute respiratory symptoms, chronic respiratory symptoms and smoking habits. Lung functioning was assessed using a Vitalograph Alpha III portable spirometer according to American Thoracic Society (1995) recommendations. Personal respirable dust was sampled using a SKC Sidekick pump with a flow rate of 2. 2 l · min– 1. Respirable dust samples were analysed for quartz by X-ray diffraction on a silver membrane filter using the US National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety method 7500. The individual cumulative exposure to respirable dust or quartz (mg · year · m– 3) for each worker was estimated. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), ammonia (NH 3), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) gas concentrations were assessed using electrochemical sensors (Dräger PAC III) and using <b>Dräger</b> detector <b>tubes.</b> The statistical methods used in analysing the data included Student’s t-test, analysis of variance, the chi-square test, multiple linear regression models, logistic regression modelling and one- and two-way random effects models. The workers in the development team had the highest exposure to respirable dust and quartz (geometric means 1. 80 mg · m– 3 and 0. 073 mg · m– 3, respectively). The percentages of samples exceeding the threshold limit values of 0. 9 mg · m– 3 for respirable (bituminous) coal dust and 0. 05 mg · m– 3 for respirable quartz, respectively, were higher in the development team (55 % and 47 %) than in the mining team (20 % and 9 %). Drilling in the development team was the work task associated with the highest exposure to respirable dust and quartz (17. 37 mg · m– 3 and 0. 611 mg · m– 3, respectively). The exposure models for the development section showed that blasting and pneumatic drilling time were the major determinants of respirable dust and quartz, explaining 45. 2 % and 40. 7 % of the variance, respectively. In the mining team, only blasting significantly determined respirable dust. For most a priori job teams, the within-worker variance component was considerably higher than the between-worker variance component. The high contrast in exposure between the teams together with the estimated low attenuation of the theoretical curve led to the conclusion that grouping by job team would be appropriate for studying the association between current dust exposure and respiratory effects. Based on the estimated worker-specific mean exposure in the job teams and the job history, the arithmetic mean cumulative exposure for workers who participated in the epidemiological part of the study was 38. 1 mg · year · m– 3 for respirable dust and 2. 0 mg · year · m– 3 for quartz. The prevalence of the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) being less than 0. 7 among the workers was 17. 3 %. Workers in the development team (20. 5 %) had the highest prevalence of FEV 1 % < 80 %. The estimates of the effects of cumulative exposure on FEV 1 /FVC were 0. 015 % per (mg · year · m– 3) for respirable dust and – 0. 3 % per (mg · year · m– 3) for respirable quartz. In logistic regression models, the odds ratios for airway limitation (FEV 1 /FVC < 0. 7) for the workers in the highest decile of cumulative dust and quartz exposure versus the referents were 4. 36 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 06, 17. 96) for dust and 3. 49 (95 % CI 0. 92, 13. 21) for quartz. The upper 10 % of workers grouped by cumulative dust and quartz exposure also had higher odds ratios (OR) for predicted FEV 1 % < 80 % than the reference group OR: 10. 38 (95 % CI 1. 38, 78. 13) for dust and 14. 18 (95 % CI 1. 72, 116. 59) for quartz. The workers from the development team had a higher self-reported prevalence of acute symptoms of breathlessness (OR = 2. 96, 95 % CI 1. 44 – 6. 11) and blocked nose (OR = 2. 47, 95 % CI 1. 10 – 5. 56) than the other production workers. In addition, development workers had more chronic symptoms of breathlessness (17. 0 %) than the other production workers (3. 9 %) (P = 0. 001). The highest decile of exposure to respirable dust was associated with cough (OR = 2. 91, 95 % CI 1. 06 – 7. 97), as was the highest decile of exposure to respirable quartz (OR = 2. 87 (95 % CI 1. 05, 7. 88), compared with the reference. This study showed that workers in a coal mine are exposed to high levels of respirable dust and quartz, especially drillers and blasters. This study also showed that the development workers had more acute and chronic respiratory symptoms than other production workers. It also revealed an exposure–response relationship between respirable coal mine dust and quartz and airway limitation measured by spirometry. Immediate actions that could improve the situation include implementing effective dust control together with improved training and education programmes for the workers. Priority should be given to workers performing drilling and blasting in the development sections of the mine. Further needs include policies on exposure and health surveillance and appropriate enforcement mechanisms in Tanzania...|$|R
