5|$|Around 1954, NATC {{modified}} the sole surviving XAJ-1 to conduct inflight refueling tests using the probe and drogue configuration. The turbojet engine was removed and the fuel <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
5|$|Cladich: The little {{hamlet of}} Cladich above Loch Awe near {{the road to}} Inveraray was a center of weaving {{and almost all of}} the {{inhabitants}} were MacIntyres. A specialty of the industry were men's <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> garters, which were prized at that time for wearing with the highland costume.|$|E
5|$|There were {{periods of}} renewed prosperity. The Cambrian Mills in Newtown was {{purchased}} in 1866 by the Cambrian Flannel Company of Newtown and Llanidloes, which modernized the factory {{so it was}} the most advanced facility in Wales and diversified into making plain and coloured flannels, shawls, whittles, <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> tweeds.|$|E

5|$|When Engine Co. 22 arrived, it {{was ordered}} to pump water on the {{warehouse}}. The company's firefighters entered the warehouse and dragged a hose up a staircase to direct water onto the fourth floor. When heavy black smoke began coming down the stairway, Foreman Garrett B. Lane ordered his firemen to evacuate. Fireman Francis Hart, Jr., became trapped while trying to collect the <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> was forced to flee to the roof and escape over neighboring rooftops.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor's fire company {{existed for}} more than a year before Briarcliff Manor's incorporation. Frederick C. Messinger (a fireman in Kingston for ten years) and {{thirteen}} local men founded the private fire company in 1901. Thirty-six men became the company's charter members on March 4, 1902, and dues were set at 25cents per month. On April 15 of that year, the company took the name Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The company's first equipment was a 1901 hand-drawn chemical apparatus, with a tank containing a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate. Sulfuric acid would be added to the tank, creating carbon dioxide, which would propel the solution through the <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> help extinguish the fire. That first apparatus was white, which Messinger thought more visible than the conventional red in a village without street lights, and the village's engines remain white.|$|E

30|$|There {{is a long}} {{corridor}} the from turbine building to reactor building where there were temporary cables <b>and</b> <b>hoses</b> {{that were used to}} stabilize and cool the reactor cores.

5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Valiant fleet because of metal fatigue in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line tanker aircraft, so the B.1/1A aircraft, now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role, were refitted for this duty. To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible, six B.1A aircraft were converted to B(K).1A standard (later redesignated B.1A (K2P)), receiving a two-point system with a <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> drogue carried under each wing, while the bomb bay remained available for weapons. Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft, with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965, and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965.|$|E
5|$|Towing two scows at {{the time}} of the collision, Stella Maris responded {{immediately}} to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight the fire with their one small <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was at this point that the blast occurred.|$|E
25|$|Between the {{regulator}} and <b>hose,</b> <b>and</b> ideally between <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> torch on both oxygen and fuel lines, a flashback arrestor and/or non-return valve (check valve) should be installed to prevent flame or oxygen-fuel mixture being pushed back into either cylinder and damaging the equipment or causing a cylinder to explode.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} no universally {{accepted}} standard, at least one agency recommends the use of two non-freezing regulators arranged as follows: primary first stage with primary second stage, BCD inflation <b>hose,</b> <b>and</b> submersible pressure gauge (SPG); secondary first stage with secondary second stage (octopus), dry suit inflation <b>hose,</b> <b>and</b> SPG, although only one SPG is needed for a single cylinder or manifolded twins.|$|E

25|$|Stealth has a {{scene where}} EDI {{attempts}} to refuel at a large blimp-like fuel carrier, but is denied access to the aircraft. In response, EDI shoots the drogue off the <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> attaches directly to the hose.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{solution is}} to use metal pipes to transfer water but these are costly to deliver and assemble. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) covered <b>hoses</b> <b>and</b> Nitrile rubber (NBR) covered hoses {{have a lot of}} advantages compared to metal pipes. It is easy to deliver, assemble <b>and</b> disassemble <b>hoses</b> <b>and</b> long sections of NBR- <b>and</b> TPU-covered <b>hoses</b> reduce the possibility of leakage in connecting parts. These large-diameter NBR- <b>and</b> TPU-covered <b>hoses</b> are called fracking hoses.|$|R

25|$|Some divers use {{a primary}} {{regulator}} on a 7-foot <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> a secondary on a necklace, {{this is useful}} when {{it may be necessary}} for the divers to swim in single file. the reason for the primary being on a long hose is to ensure the donated regulator is known to be working.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean that there is no variation. There are some {{procedures}} such as emergency donation of air which are quite strongly polarized between those who advocate donation of the secondary (octopus) regulator and those who advocate donating the primary regulator. Length of regulator <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> position of the secondary second stage depend on the donation technique.|$|E

25|$|A {{non-return}} valve is usually fitted to the breathing hoses where they {{connect to the}} mouthpiece. This prevents any water that gets into the mouthpiece from going into the inhalation <b>hose,</b> <b>and</b> ensures that once it is blown into the exhalation hose that it cannot flow back. This slightly increases the flow resistance of air, but makes the regulator easier to clear.|$|E
25|$|Some {{historic}} systems {{used for}} pioneering aerial refueling used the grappling method, where the tanker aircraft unreeled the fuel <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> the receiver aircraft would grapple the hose midair, reel {{it in and}} connect it so that fuel can be transferred either {{with the assistance of}} pumps or simply by gravity feed. This was the method used on the Question Mark endurance flight in 1929.|$|E
