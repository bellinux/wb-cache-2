25|$|Todd's {{spiritual journey}} was crafted {{as a man}} who wanted {{forgiveness}} for his past misdeeds. In the story, he reasons that he does not deserve forgiveness; this contributes to him embracing his worst qualities. Malone was intrigued by telling this type of character aspect, and felt that it worked better due to Howarth being an actor who would not let Todd acquire redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he initiated a gang rape on her. Despite the character's eagerness to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt that these good deeds should never make Todd feel any less horrible for having raped Marty.|$|E

During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would have to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that his life had changed forever due to the attack first.

Barr was even part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were [...] "in denial". On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Barr admitted that the word [...] "incest" [...] could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the [...] "darkest time" [...] in her life. She told Oprah, [...] "I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs... to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that I had some mental illness...

[...] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to scrutinize the actions of others." [...] Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence. Others defended the album {{on the basis of the}} group's right to freedom of speech, and cited the fact that Ice-T had portrayed a police officer in the film New Jack City. Ice-T is quoted as saying that [...] "I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment. I needed people to come in and say 'Ice-T has grounds to make this record.'

A reviewer from the publication The Backlot listed the song at number eleven on their [...] "Kylie Minogue's Best Songs, In Honor of Her Birthday" [...] and said [...] "This stylistic mishmash (featuring a deep Celtic sound that, maybe, Alison Krauss could fiddle along with) is a hard-driving, adrenalized, sexualized quest for freedom.

[...] Online critic Adrian Denning from his website Adriandenning.co.uk said [...] "Too Far flows well into the impressive, eastern flavored Cowboy Style.

[...] Sputnikmusic highlighted the track as an album stand out, commenting [...] "Cowboy Style a funky western jam that might possibly get country fans to do a line dance, this is the mother to Madonna's [...] "Don't Tell Me".

500|$|Malone {{stated that}} Todd {{believes}} {{that he does not}} deserve forgiveness, which contributes to him embracing his worst qualities, something Malone felt worked better due to Howarth's acting choices, which prevented Todd from acquiring redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> he initiated her rape. As well as having Todd risk his freedom from prison and save Marty from a car crash, Todd donates his own blood to Marty to ensure she survives. A year later, he risks his life to save Patrick, Marty's lover, from death; this act leads to Todd's presumed death. Despite having the character yearn to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt his good deeds should never make him feel any less horrible for having raped Marty. [...] Initially, Howarth disagreed, and did not consider the storylines to be redemptive. [...] " [...] not being redeemed at all," [...] he said. [...] "Todd, as I see it, is looking for a way to overcome this rage so he can live in society again. From now on, his menace will be on the surface, not exploding. It's more interesting if his violence is on the surface and that he play against it. That's where the subtlety is." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{obtain the}} graphic details {{seen in the}} game, Rubin, Gavin, and Baggett {{researched}} visibility calculation in video games that followed Doom and concluded that extensive pre-calculation of visibility would allow the game to render {{a larger number of}} polygons. Following experimentation in free-roaming camera control, the team settled with a branching rail camera that would follow along next to, behind, or in front of the character, generally looking at him, moving on a [...] "track" [...] through the world. Because only 800 polygons could be visible on the screen at a time, parts of the game's landscape would be hidden from view using trees, cliffs, walls, and twists and turns in the environment. Because the production used an entirely Silicon Graphics and IRIX-based tool pipeline, the programmers used $100,000 Silicon Graphics workstations instead of the $3,000 personal computers that were the standard at the time. Gavin created an algorithmic texture packer that would <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the 512 × 240 video mode left too little texture memory. Meanwhile, Baggett created bidirectional 10x compressors that would reduce the 128-megabyte levels down to 12 megabytes and allow them to be compatible with the PlayStation's 2-megabyte random access memory. The levels proved to be so large that the first test level created could not be loaded into Alias PowerAnimator and had to be cut up into 16 chunks. Each chunk took about 10 minutes to load even on a 256-megabyte machine. To remedy the situation, Baggett created the DLE, a level design tool where component parts of a level were entered into a text file, with a series of Adobe Photoshop layers indicating how the parts were combined. To code the characters and gameplay of the game, Andy Gavin and Dave Baggett created the programming language [...] "Game-Oriented Object LISP" [...] (GOOL) using LISP syntax.|$|E

[...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that {{it is the first time}} she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings.
