This paper describes a probability model for prediction of fatigue failures of aluminum disc wheels, which intends to better link the prediction using simulation results with historical test data. Finite element models of 54 aluminum wheels, which are already physically tested, are constructed to simulate the <b>dynamic</b> cornering <b>fatigue</b> test. Their mean stresses and stress amplitudes during the fatigue loading cycle are calculated and plotted on a two-dimensional plane. Matching with historical test data, the failure probability contour can be drawn. For a new wheel, the failure probability of <b>dynamic</b> cornering <b>fatigue</b> test can be read directly from this probability contour. The test result of the new wheel can be added into the set of historical test data and the failure probability contour is updated.

Two types of CFRP strengthening techniques, CFRP sheets and CFRP deck, are applied to both the damaged and undamaged bridges. For the case of damaged bridge, two through-thickness crack sizes, 3 [*]mm and 6 [*]mm in depth, are assumed at midspan of the steel girders. Furthermore, effects {{of the number of}} steel girders on the <b>dynamic</b> and <b>fatigue</b> responses are also considered. The results show that the maximum responses of composite bridges occur for dual lane cases. By using CFRP as a strengthening material, the maximum stress and deflection of the steel girders reduce and consequently increase the fatigue life of the girders. After introducing initial crack into the steel girders of the composite bridges, the fatigue life of the bridges is dramatically reduced. However, the overall performance of the damaged composite bridge can be improved by using CFRP, albeit with less effectiveness. Therefore, if cracks are found, steel welding must be performed before strengthening the composite bridge by CFRP...|$|R

An experimental ball-on-flat test configuration was employed for both static and <b>dynamic</b> contact <b>fatigue</b> testing. In house designed test rig was used to study static cyclic loading contact fatigue behaviours of brittle polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in contact with balls made of different materials, i. e.

A modified four ball test machine was used to study <b>dynamic</b> rolling contact <b>fatigue</b> behaviours of thermally sprayed molybdenum and titanium coatings in contact with steel balls in dry and seawater conditions. The static contact <b>fatigue</b> and the <b>dynamic</b> contact <b>fatigue</b> test results revealed that counterface material, loading magnitude, lubricant and the environment {{play a vital role in}} controlling failure modes and the extent of damage.

A total of 60 nickel-titanium (NiTi) instruments (30 Reciproc and 30 WaveOne) from three different lots, each of which was 25 mm in length, were tested.

For the static and dynamic tests, a cast Ni-Cr-Mo-Ti alloy metal block with an artificial canal measuring 1. 77 mm in diameter and 20. 00 mm in total length was used. A scanning electron microscope was used to determine the type of fracture. Statistical analyses were performed on the results. The WaveOne instrument was less flexible than the Reciproc (p < 0. 05).

The load was 50 % of the torque produced during a maximal voluntary contraction, and the exercise ended when the ankle range of motion declined to 50 % of control. The maximal torque of the triceps surae and the electromyographic (EMG) activities of the soleus and medial gastrocnemius were studied in response to voluntary and electrically induced contractions {{before and after the}} fatiguing task and after 5 min of recovery. Reflex activities were also tested by recording the Hoffmann reflex (H reflex) and tendon reflex (T reflex) in the soleus muscle. The results indicated that whereas the maximal voluntary contraction torque, tested in isometric conditions, was reduced to a greater extent (P < 0. 05) at 20 degrees of plantar flexion (- 33 %) compared with the neutral position (- 23 %) of the ankle joint, the EMG activity of both muscles was not significantly reduced after fatigue. Muscle activation, tested by the interpolated-twitch method or the ratio of the voluntary EMG to the amplitude of the muscle action potential (M-wave), as well as the neuromuscular transmission and sarcolemmal excitation, tested by the M-wave amplitude, did not change significantly after the fatiguing exercise. Although the H and T reflexes declined slightly (10 - 13 %; P < 0. 05) after fatigue, these adjustments did not appear to have a direct deleterious effect on muscle activation. In contrast, alterations in the mechanical twitch time course and postactivation potentiation indicated that intracellular Ca(2 +) -controlled excitation-contraction coupling processes most likely {{played a major role in}} the force decrease after <b>dynamic</b> <b>fatiguing</b> contractions performed for short duration.
