In all three conifers, all tracheids of the newly forming outermost <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> were filled with water or cytoplasm {{during the period from}} May to August. However, many tracheids in the transition zone from earlywood to latewood lost water in September, presumably through drought-induced cavitation.

In the second and third <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> from the cambium of all three conifers, the lumina of most tracheids in the transition zone from earlywood to latewood contained no water.

40|$|Abstract − The wood quality {{measurement}} methods are of increasing {{importance in the}} wood industry. One of the main goals of the wood industry is to produce new high quality products with higher marketing value. The wood strength and stiffness are significant factors considering wooden products. These factors {{are related to the}} wood species, to the number and type of knots and to the mean <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> width and its deviation to name a few. The logs can be measured and imaged in the forest machinery and thus the measurement based decisions can be made as early as possible on the production chain. This paper focuses on an aspect of the <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> width estimation from the images taken in forest machinery. The focus is on the spectral reflectance of the log ends for optimal <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> visibility. The average spectral reflectance of the log end does not indicate how well the <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> are visible. Therefore a more sophisticated analysis of the <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> visibility is performed to four tree species based on the twodimensional spatial spectral analysis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Annual</b> <b>ring</b> {{formation}} {{is considered a}} source of information to investigate the effects of environmental changes causedby temperature, air pollution, and acid rain on tree growth. A comparative investigation of <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> growth of Cryptomeriajaponica in relation to environmental changes was conducted at two sites in southern Korea (Haenam and Jangseong). Three wood disks from each site were collected from stems at breast height and <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> growth was analyzed. <b>Annual</b> <b>ring</b> area at two sites increased over time (p > 0. 05). Tree ring growth rate in Jangseong was higher than that inHaenam. <b>Annual</b> <b>ring</b> area increment in Jangseong was more strongly correlated with environmental variables than thatin Haenam; <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> growth increased with increasing temperature (p < 0. 01) and a positive effect of NO 2 concentrationon <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> area (p < 0. 05) could be attributed to nitrogen deposition in Jangseong. The correlation of annualring growth increased with decreasing SO 2 and CO 2 concentrations (p < 0. 01) in Jangseong. Variation in annual growthrings in Jangseong could be associated with temperature changes and N deposition. In Haenam, <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> growth wascorrelated with SO 2 concentration (p < 0. 01), and there was a negative relationship between precipitation pH and annualring area (p < 0. 01) which may reflect changes in nutrient cycles due to the acid rain. Therefore, the combined effects ofincreased CO 2, N deposition, and temperature on tree ring growth in Jangseong may be linked to soil acidification in thisforest ecosystem. The interactions between air pollution (SO 2) and precipitation pH in Haenam may affect tree growthand may change nutrient cycles in this site. These results suggested that <b>annual</b> tree <b>ring</b> growth in Jangseong was morecorrelated with environmental variables than that in Haenam. However, the further growth of C. japonica forest at twosites is at risk from the long-term effects of acid deposition from fossil fuel combustion...|$|R

For this aim, every <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> width was measured on the cross-section wheels of Turkish red pine supplied from ten research points around the Kemerköy (Gökova) thermal power plant (KTPP). The fly ash collected from the surfaces of the needles and the <b>annual</b> growth <b>ring</b> of Turkish red pine in the polluted points were investigated by energy dispersive spec-trometer (EDS). The elemental analysis of the <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> were performed considering the fly ash elemental composition because the main pollutant source was the fly ash emitted from KTPP chimney smoke. With EDS analyses, some elements such as Al, Si, Mg, K, Fe, Ca, S, Zn, Ti, and Nb were determined in the fly ash. These elements accumulated in ATRs from the KTPP fly ash. They not only accumulated in <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> formed after KTPP began operation but also accumulated in ATRs formed before KTPP started.
