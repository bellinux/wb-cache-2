Three different diameters (0. 012, 0. 02 and 0. 04 mm), three different lengths (9, 12 and 19 mm) and two different types (nylon and polypropylene) <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> were investigated. Fibre volume (v%) or fibre weight per unit volume of concrete are commonly used parameters for fibre addition, but are dependent parameters on diameter <b>of</b> <b>fibres.</b> This study reports a better parameter for the expression <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> addition which is independent of diameter, namely, number <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> per cubic centimeter (N). When 12 mm length polypropylene fibre addition is expressed by v%, the minimum requirement for spalling protection is v = 0. 20 % for 0. 04 mm diameter fibres and v = 0. 05 % for 0. 02 mm diameter fibres. If the fibre addition is expressed in N, the minimum requirement is N = 133 /cm 3 for both cases regardless <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> diameter. Hence, the diameter <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> has limited effect on spalling protection of concrete. If the fibre addition is expressed in v%, the diameter seems {{to have an effect}} {{due to the fact that}} parameter v% is a function of diameter.

It is clear from the clinical studies that have been reviewed that there remains a paucity of controlled data, and a great deal more research is needed before widespread use <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> supplemented diets can be supported. Perhaps of greater interest academically is the potentially beneficial effects that appear to be exerted by the VFA's, liberated as a consequence of colonic bacterial fermentation <b>of</b> <b>fibre,</b> on morphology and function of ileal and colonic mucosa. Although {{there are a number of}} potential applications <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> supplemented enteral diets in this area, more research is required before any firm recommendations can be made about recommending their use. The one exception concerns patients with the nutritionally inadequate short bowel syndrome.

It was found that the magnitude of the heat transfer coefficient was above water at equivalent experimental conditions at very low fibre concentrations, but progressively decreased until it was below water at slightly higher concentrations. It was found that the heat transfer was affected by varying fibre properties, such as fibre length, fibre flexibility, fibre chemical and mechanical treatment, the variation <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> from different parts of the tree as well as the different pulping methods used to liberate the fibres from the wood structure.
