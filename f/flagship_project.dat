2500|$|Stanley Wolpert {{writes that}} Radcliffe in his initial maps awarded Gurdaspur {{district}} to Pakistan {{but one of}} Nehru’s and Mountbatten’s greatest concerns over the new Punjab border {{was to make sure}} that Gurdaspur would not go to Pakistan, since that would have deprived India of direct road access to Kashmir. As per [...] "The Different Aspects of Islamic Culture", a part of UNESCO’s Histories <b>flagship</b> <b>project,</b> recently disclosed documents {{of the history of the}} partition reveal British complicity with the top Indian leadership to wrest Kashmir from Pakistan. Alastair Lamb, based on the study of recently declassified documents, has convincingly proven that Mountbatten, in league with Nehru, was instrumental in pressurizing Radcliffe to award the Muslim-majority district of Gurdaspur in East Punjab to India which could provide India with the only possible access to Kashmir. Andrew Roberts believes that Mountbatten cheated over India-Pak frontier and states that if gerrymandering took place in the case of Ferozepur, it is not too hard to believe that Mountbatten also pressurized Radcliffe to ensure that Gurdaspur wound up in India to give India road access to Kashmir.|$|E
