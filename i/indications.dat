40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} a preoperative decision model for accurate <b>indication</b> of systemic therapy in early-stage breast cancer using multiparametric MRI at 7 -tesla field strength. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients eligible for breast-conserving therapy were consecutively included. Patients underwent conventional diagnostic workup and one preoperative multiparametric 7 -tesla breast MRI. The postoperative (gold standard) <b>indication</b> for systemic therapy was established from resected tumor and lymph-node tissue, based on 10 -year risk-estimates {{of breast cancer}} mortality and relapse using Adjuvant! Online. Preoperative <b>indication</b> was estimated using similar guidelines, but from conventional diagnostic workup. Agreement was established between preoperative and postoperative <b>indication,</b> and MRI-characteristics used to improve agreement. MRI-characteristics included phospomonoester/phosphodiester (PME/PDE) ratio on 31 -phosphorus spectroscopy (31 P-MRS), apparent diffusion coefficients on diffusion-weighted imaging, and tumor size on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) -MRI. A decision model was built to estimate the postoperative <b>indication</b> from preoperatively available data. RESULTS: We included 46 women (age: 43 - 74 yrs) with 48 invasive carcinomas. Postoperatively, 20 patients (43 %) had positive, and 26 patients (57 %) negative <b>indication</b> for systemic therapy. Using conventional workup, positive preoperative <b>indication</b> agreed excellently with positive postoperative <b>indication</b> (N = 8 / 8; 100 %). Negative preoperative <b>indication</b> was correct in only 26 / 38 (68 %) patients. However, 31 P-MRS score (p = 0. 030) and tumor size (p = 0. 002) {{were associated with the}} postoperative <b>indication.</b> The decision model shows that negative <b>indication</b> is correct in 21 / 22 (96 %) patients when exempting tumors larger than 2. 0 cm on DCE-MRI or with PME>PDE ratios at 31 P-MRS. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperatively, positive <b>indication</b> for systemic therapy is highly accurate. Negative <b>indication</b> is highly accurate (96 %) for tumors sized ≤ 2, 0 cm on DCE-MRI and with PME≤PDE ratios on 31 P-MRS...|$|R

40|$|In {{breast cancer}} therapy, the <b>indication</b> for {{systemic}} therapy is typically based on prognostic markers from the surgical excision specimen. If such is unavailable, for instance prior to tumor ablation therapy, the <b>indication</b> for adjuvant systemic therapy may be assessed from pretreatment biopsies. The effect {{of differences in}} tumor characteristics between biopsy and excision specimen on agreement in <b>indication</b> for systemic therapy is, however, largely unknown. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the agreement in eligibility for systemic therapy between preoperative and postoperative assessment. Secondly, to identify which patient-, tumor- or lymph node characteristics may influence this agreement. In this retrospective study, 300 consecutive female patients with primary invasive breast carcinoma on biopsy were included. <b>Indication</b> for systemic therapy was determined separately from biopsied tissue and from excision specimens using national guidelines based on adjuvant! online. Agreement was assessed, and patient-, tumor- and lymph node characteristics affecting agreement analyzed. Agreement in tumor characteristics between biopsy and excision specimen varied from high (ER-status: 99 %), to lower (tumor grade: 62 %, tumor size: 59 %, and lymph node status: 67 %). Without preoperative sentinel node biopsy (SNB), agreement on systemic therapy exists in 77 % of patients (kappa =  0, 547). Positive pretreatment <b>indication</b> for systemic therapy was highly indicative of the postoperative <b>indication</b> (PPV =  94 %). Negative <b>indication</b> was, however, only indicative in 67 % of patients. Conversely, with preoperative SNB, agreement on negative <b>indication</b> was raised to 89 %. Agreement was especially high for ER-negative status, tumor grade 3, tumor size > 2 cm, lymph node positivity at biopsy and a negative preoperative SNB. A positive <b>indication</b> for systemic therapy from biopsy is highly indicative for a positive <b>indication</b> from the excision specimen. When the <b>indication</b> is negative, additional stratification using preoperative SNB raises the agreement. Still, discordance occurs in 1 out of 10 patients...|$|R
