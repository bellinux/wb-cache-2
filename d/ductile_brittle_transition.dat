30|$|We {{employed}} {{a combination of}} nanoindentation and AFM techniques to investigate the contact-induced deformation behavior of GaN films on c- and a-axis sapphire substrates. We observed three separate scratch processes in the <b>ductile,</b> <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> (elastic–plastic deformation), and brittle regions. AFM morphological studies of the bulge edge scenarios provided evidence for significant reductions in the average scratch depth for the GaN/c-axis sapphire. It suggested that the substrate orientation dominated the extent of ploughing in the GaN epilayers during the scratching process. In addition, this discrepancy suggested that c-axis sapphire–grown GaN epilayers have higher shear resistance than those grown on a-axis sapphire. Pile-up events indicated the generation and motion of individual dislocations measured under the critical brittle transition part of the scratch track, result in ductile and/or brittle properties.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVolcanic eruptions are {{regulated}} by the rheology of magmas {{and their ability to}} degas. Both detail the evolution of stresses within ascending subvolcanic magma. But as magma is forced through the <b>ductile</b> <b>brittle</b> <b>transition,</b> new pathways emerge as cracks nucleate, propagate, and coalesce, constructing a permeable network. Current analyses of magma dynamics center on models of the glass transition, neglecting important aspects such as incremental strain accommodation and (the key monitoring tool of) seismicity. Here, in a combined-methods study, we report the ﬁrst high-resolution (20 μm) neutron-computed tomography and microseismic monitoring of magma failure under controlled experimental conditions. The data reconstruction reveals that a competition between extensional and shear fracturing modes controls the total magnitude of strain-to-failure and importantly, the geometry and efﬁciency of the permeable fracture network that regulates degassing events. Extrapolation of our ﬁndings yields magma ascent via strain localization along conduit margins, thereby providing an explanation for gas-and-ash explosions along arcuate fractures at active lava domes.

It is often supposed that in pre-cracked specimens, many carbides fracture in the plastic zone of the pre-crack, and that eventually fracture propagates from one of these to cause fracture of the whole specimen.

In this study, low temperature aging embrittlement of types 304 L and 316 L {{stainless steel}} welds with 10 % ferrite was investigated {{on the basis of}} changes in mechanical properties and microstructure after aging up to 20, 000 h at 335, 365 and 400 degrees C. Spinodal decomposition and G-phase precipitation in the ferrite was observed after aging which lead to embrittlement in the material. In contrast to the small effect on tensile properties, the impact toughness was significantly degraded after aging. Charpy impact test of the aged samples showed decrease in upper-shelf and lower-shelf energy and increase in <b>ductile</b> <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> temperature. Large increase in the microhardness of ferrite phase was observed with no change in austenite hardness. The embrittlement in 316 L weld was higher compared to 304 L weld for similar aging condition.

A constant activation energy was determined for 304 L weld in the temperature range 335 - 400 degrees C, however, 316 L weld showed different activation energy values in each temperature range.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} the influence of aluminium layers used as protective coatings of aircraft turbine engine blades upon durability of ŻS 6 U nickel base superalloy under the conditions of short time creep. The conditions of cracks formation and growth in specimens with aluminium coatings have been analysed while taking into account the microstructure properties of coatings as well as the microstructure of specimen core material. Design/methodology/approach: The creep tests have been performed on MTS apparatus in the conditions corresponding to the extreme operating conditions of aircraft engine blades. The specimens were heated in a resistance furnace up to the temperature of 950 ºC and then constant axial force was applied which induced stress σo= 300 MPa in their cross-section. Findings: The obtained results have proved a significant influence of the type, protective coating thickness and the specimen core structure upon the secondary creep rate. Research limitations/implications: To ensure the most effective use of aluminium protective coatings {{it is important to understand}} the creep mechanisms in temperature lower than DBTT (<b>ductile</b> <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> temperature).

40|$|Abstract. Soda-Lime {{glass is}} a very hard and brittle {{material}} which is commonly used as window panels and many other common applications. Due to its low fracture toughness {{it is very difficult}} to machine and obtain good surface finish under nornal cutting conditions. Hence, machining has to be done in ways to avoid brittle fracture on the finished machined surface. Such machining is only possible under ductile mode machining conditions when the removal of material is performed in the plastic state. However, ductile mode machining requires that during machining the temperature generated in the cutting zone in the working temperature range of glass to avoid crack formation during machining. This makes all types of machining of glass an extremely challenging affair, given the current state and mode of mechanical machining. This research paper elucidates the results of an experimental study for determination of critical depth of cut as a function of cutting parameters in high speed end milling of soda-lime glass. The critical depth is defined as the depth of cut at which crack formation the material is initiated for a given high speed attachment. In determining the critical depth as well as the <b>ductile</b> <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> depth, machining was performed on a tapered surface. Vibration signals from an accelerometer in time domain (amplitude vs. time display) and the surface characteristics were used in identifying the critical depth of cut.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} detailed microstructure-mechanical property {{relationships in the}} weld heat affected zone (HAZ) of commercially fabricated API 5 L grade X 70 and X 80 line pipe steels. High strength line pipe steels are widely used for the transmission of energy such as crude {{oil and natural gas}} and provide an important service. Although the combination of high strength and good toughness can be achieved in the base metal (BM) through the adoption of clean steelmaking, advanced thermomechanical controlled processing (TMCP) technology and tailored alloy design, the welding thermal cycles can dramatically change the properties in the HAZ. Microalloying addition of Ti is employed to control austenite grain coarsening at the peak temperature in the HAZ. The formation of thermally stable TiN precipitates is effective in control of grain growth in the HAZ. This study investigated the microstructure and mechanical properties of both the actual steel welds and the critical regions produced by Gleeble weld simulation of X 70 steels with different Ti/N ratios ranged from 1. 88 to 4. 88. Moreover, the microstructure and properties in the simulated HAZ of high Nb X 80 steel produced by high temperature processing (HTP) were studied. The mechanical properties in the weld zone of commercially fabricated line pipes are critical to the in-service operation and reliability of the pipelines. The microstructure of two-pass submerged arc welding (SAW) joints with various Ti/N ratios, including BM, HAZ and weld metal (WM), was examined by optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The hardness profiles across the welds were also recorded. The strength and Charpy impact toughness of the BM {{did not appear to be}} influenced by Ti/N ratio, within the range evaluated. The toughness of actual welds (V-notch sectioned 50 % HAZ+ 50 % WM) tested at a series of temperatures did not show any correlation with the Ti/N ratio in the studied range. To elucidate the influence of Ti/N ratio on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a typical commercial line pipe welds, Gleeble thermomechanical simulation was performed to critically assess the different subzones within the actual weld HAZ, with specific attention directed to the coarse grained heat affected zone (CGHAZ). The microstructure of the simulated specimens, over a range of Ti/N ratios was characterised by means of OM, SEM, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The microstructure of simulated CGHAZs mainly consisted of a relatively coarse austenite grain size containing packets of aligned bainitic ferrite laths, with a small volume fraction of martensite-austenite (M-A) constituent finely dispersed throughout the microstructure. Evaluation of the prior austenite grain size, transformed microstructure and hardness revealed subtle differences in mechanical properties as a function of Ti/N ratio. The results confirmed that stoichiometric ratio of Ti/N provided optimum austenite grain size control and therefore higher CGHAZ toughness. Intercritically reheated coarse grained heat affected zone (IC-CGHAZ) is another critical region in the HAZ of two-pass SAW joints. The simulated IC-CGHAZ was produced for steels over a range of Ti/N ratios. The microstructure and mechanical properties of simulated IC-CGHAZ were evaluated over the entire intercritical temperature range. The IC-CGHAZ exhibited extremely low toughness, and there was no correlation with Ti/N ratio in the studied range of Ti and N concentrations. The beneficial effect of near-stoichiometric Ti/N ratio observed in CGHAZ did not translate to IC-CGHAZ due to the negative effect of blocky M-A constituent along the prior austenite grain boundaries. Moreover, the IC-CGHAZ toughness gradually improved as the intercritical temperature increased, but did not return to the values of the original CGHAZ due to the presence of isolated large M-A particles and coarse microstructure. Significance of M-A constituent to toughness is firstly related to the location of particles along prior austenite grain boundaries, followed by the size of individual M-A particles. For the high Nb, high temperature processed (HTP) steel, the microstructure and properties of simulated CGHAZs over a range of welding cooling time, from 800 °C to 500 °C (Δt 8 / 5), to represent different welding processes and production rates. The HTP steel maintained HAZ fracture toughness over a wide range of heat inputs (HIs), as evidenced by 20 °C lower <b>ductile</b> <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> temperature (TB) compared to the conventional X 70 steel. This was attributed to the more homogeneous microstructure, much finer prior austenite grain size and lower fraction of dispersed M-A islands. Finally, HTP X 80 grade steel, conventional X 70 grade steel and HSLA 65 steel were selected to investigate the influence of Nb concentration on the grain coarsening behaviour in simulated HAZ. The HTP steel with high Nb content (~ 0. 11 wt. %) showed lower degree of grain coarsening at peak temperature of 1350 °C compared to the other two steels with lower Nb contents...|$|E

Recently, tremendous {{efforts have been}} made in understanding the machining mechanics, especially wear mechanism of diamond tools in SPDT of silicon. However, the localised transition of machining mode from <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> as a result of progressive tool wear has not been well understood yet. In this paper both experimental and numerical simulation studies of SPDT were performed in an effort to reveal the underlying phenomenon of <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> (DBT) as a consequence of diamond tool wear. Series of facing and plunging cuts were performed and the profile of machined surface was evaluated together with the progression of tool wear. The transition stages from <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> were identified by analysing the surface profiles of plunging cuts using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a 2 D contact profilometer and a white light interferometer. The progressive degradation of the cutting edge of diamond tool and its wear mechanism was determined using Least Square (LS) arc analysis and SEM. The study reveals that at initial tool wear stage, the <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> initiates with the formation of lateral cracks which are transformed into brittle pitting damage with further tool edge degradation. Numerical simulation investigation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was also conducted in this paper in order to gain further insight of variation of stress on the cutting edge due to tool wear and its influence on <b>brittle</b> to <b>ductile</b> <b>transition.</b> A significant variation in frictional resistance to shear deformation as well as position shift of the maximum stress values was observed for the worn tools. The magnitude and distribution of hydrostatic stress were also found to change significantly along the cutting edge of new and worn diamond tools...|$|R
40|$|Austempered {{ductile iron}} (ADI) is a {{relatively}} new material that is increasingly finding space in industrial application. ADI possesses a unique combination of hardness and toughness that is not typical of most ferrous materials, where an increase in strength is invariably accompanied by a decrease in toughness and vice versa. Although the superiority of ADI is well documented in literature, there is still widespread scepticism application because not all properties are well known. This paper aims to determine the <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> temperature (DBTT) of ADI in order to establish its suitability for cryogenic applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{fracture}} behaviour of ferritic/ferritic martensitic steels in <b>Ductile</b> to <b>Brittle</b> <b>Transition</b> (DBT) {{region is}} well captured by Master Curve approach, {{except in the}} upper region of transition due to ductile tearing prior to cleavage. The fracture toughness behavior in the upper region of DBT is generally censored by Master Curve. In this work the Master Curve approach is modified to extend its applicability to the upper region of transition. The ductile tearing in the upper region of transition, increased sampled volume and constraint increment are addressed in this work using constraint parameter Tstress and numerical analyses using GTN damage...|$|R
40|$|The ADN 420 {{ferritic}} steel (A 615 steel Grade 60 [420]), used as reinforcing bars (rebar) in concrete, shows {{the so called}} <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> <b>transition.</b> Room temperature {{is located on the}} lower third region of the transition zone. In this work, the fracture toughness of this steel working at room temperature was studied statistically. For such a purpose, 125 compact test specimens were machined from commercial bars and tested at room temperature to determine the Jc and KJc critical fracture toughness values. Several continuous probability functions with threshold parameter were adjusted to the J and K datasets...|$|R
40|$|The {{deformation}} and fracture {{response of}} a bulk metallic glass (BMG) post-annealing above the {{glass transition temperature}} is examined. The toughness of the glass-matrix composite exhibits a sharp transition beyond a critical volume fraction of crystallization to values as low as that of brittle silicate glass. Instrumented indentation tests supplemented by impact tests were used to study this <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> exhibited by the partially crystallized samples. Indentation on the anneal-embrittled specimens shows lateral cracks in addition to cracks along the corners. The applicability of the Poisson's ratio-toughness correlation with respect to partially crystallized samples is also investigated...|$|R
40|$|Coarse grain heat {{affected}} zone (HAZ) of F 460 steel was simulated by a Gleeble 3800 thermo-mechanical simulator. The microstructure, critical event of the HAZ formed at various heat inputs (E) were characterized and determined by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and cleavage fracture stress &# 963; f was also calculated by ABAQUS software. Based on above systematic analysis, the intrinsic mechanism of ductile-brittle transition for F 460 steel {{heat affected}} zones with different heat inputs were revealed. The results indicate that:with the improvement of heat input, the microstructures in sequence are a minority of lath martensite and massive fine lath bainite, more lath bainite with less granular bainite, more granular bainite with less lath bainite, bulky of granular bainite; and the maximum size of the original austenite grain and bainite packet becomes bigger with the improvement of heat input. The size of bainite packet is critical event of the cleavage fracture for coarse grain {{heat affected zone}} specimens with various heat inputs by comparing the relationships among residual crack length, original austenite grain size and bainite packet size. With the decreasing of the bainitic packet, the <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> temperature decreases. In addition, cleavage fracture stress &# 963; f is also calculated by ABAQUS software, &# 963; f gradually decreases {{with the increase of}} the heat input, which can explain the intrinsic mechanism of <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> temperature T k with the change of the heat input...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} bulk {{constitutive model}} is {{used with a}} new cohesive zone model that is stress state and rate-dependent in order to simulate the <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> failure <b>transition</b> in polycarbonate. The cohesive zone model is motivated by experimental evidence that two different critical energies per unit area of crack growth exist in glassy polymers. A higher energy state is associated with ductile failure (slow crack growth), while a lower energy state is associated with brittle failure (fast crack growth). The model is formulated so that as rate or stress state changes within a simulation, the fracture energy and thus fracture mode may also change appropriately. The <b>ductile</b> to <b>brittle</b> <b>transition</b> occurs when the cohesive opening rate is over a threshold opening rate and when the stress state is close to plane strain in a fracture specimen. These effects are coupled. The principal contribution of this work {{is that this is}} the first time a single set of material input parameters can predict the transition from slow to fast crack growth as test loading rate and sample thickness are varied. This result enlisted the use of an advanced constitutive model and the new cohesive zone model with rate and stress-state dependencies in three-dimensional finite element analysis.
