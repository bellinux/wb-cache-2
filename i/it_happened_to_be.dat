5|$|In 1009 Symeon {{was sent}} into exile near Paloukiton, {{a small village}} near Chrysopolis on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. According to one account, he was left by church {{authorities}} alone and without food, {{in the middle of}} winter. There he found a deserted and ruined chapel that had been dedicated to Saint Macrina. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on land owned by one of Symeon's spiritual children, Christopher Phagouras, who donated the land and proceeds to start a monastery.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} space within which an object {{can be said}} to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> near its aphelion, and found itself {{slightly}} within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricitythat is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

Ausmus had his only at bat during extra-innings, with the score at 4–4. Ausmus led off the 10th inning with his second homer of the season, and the Astros rallied for a 6–4 win.|$|E

Cruyff offered his shirt to Muhren and went to the basket to pick another one at random. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the number 14.

25|$|After Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss {{and elected}} to bat first, openers Murali Vijay and Mike Hussey {{put on an}} opening {{partnership}} of 87 until Vijay was dismissed for 42 (from 32 balls) in the 11th over. Mike Hussey was joined by IPL's leading run scorer Suresh Raina and they scored at a brisk rate to reach 160 when Hussey was dismissed in the eighteenth over for 54 (from 43 balls). Suresh Raina who had scored an imposing 73 (from 38 balls) with five sixes was dismissed off the last ball as Chennai reached a formidable total of 190. In reply, the Knight Riders lost their captain Gautam Gambhir cheaply for 2 in the first over. However, they recovered as Manvinder Bisla (89 from 48 balls) and Jacques Kallis (69 from 49 balls) added 136 for the second wicket. Soon after Bisla's dismissal in the 15th over, the Knight Riders lost wickets at regular intervals and after Kallis was caught out by Ravindra Jadeja off the bowling of Ben Hilfenhaus at 18.5 overs, the Knight Riders required 16 runs from the last 7 balls. Shakib Al Hasan {{appeared to have been}} caught by Murali Vijay off the very next delivery from Hilfenhaus but <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a no-ball and amid the celebrations, Shakib Al Hasan had completed two runs and retained the strike and hit a four the very next ball. Needing 9 runs to win from the last over, Manoj Tiwary hit consecutive fours to secure victory for the Knight Riders. Manvinder Bisla was declared Man of the Match for his 89 from 48 balls which included five sixes and eight fours.|$|E

500|$|In late 1927 {{or early}} 1928, there {{arrived at the}} Warsaw Customs Office from Germany a package that, {{according}} to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment. [...] The German firm's representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, {{as it had been}} shipped with other equipment by mistake. [...] His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology. [...] And since <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample time to look into the matter.
