40|$|Here we {{investigate}} theoretically and numerically the coupling between surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in monolayer graphene sheet arrays {{that have a}} period {{much smaller than the}} wavelength. We show that when the collective SPP is excited with an out-of-phase illumination, the beam tends to propagate toward the opposite direction of the Bloch momentum, reflecting a negative coupling between the constituent SPPs. In contrast, for <b>in-phase</b> <b>illumination,</b> the incident beam is split into two collective SPPs that are highly collimated and display low propagation loss. Moreover, the coupling between the individual SPPs results in a reduction of the modal wavelength of the SPP in comparison with that of a single graphene sheetThe work is partially supported by the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR) under Grant Nos. 0921450030, 0921540099, 0921540098 and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China under Grant No. 2009 DFA 52300 for China-Singapore collaborations.
