The downstream farmers are less dependent on the pangasius revenue to household income than those in the mid- and up-stream regions (58 % compared to 86 %). This might be the result from lessons learned upstream. Pangasius farming in the downstream region started after the price dip due to the USA import ban (Tung et al. 2004), and the fluctuation of the pangasius market price stimulated downstream farmers to maintain other components of their farm, such as the high yielding orchards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:The {{increase}} of irretrievable river water withdrawals and regulation of river flow {{has a negative}} effect on the natural regime of the Aral Sea. The Amu Darya River and the Syr Darya River Basins are the largest irrigated fanning areas. Their favorable soil and climatic conditions ensure guaranteed yields of various crops on irrigated lands. Since 1961, for the drastic {{increase of}} irretrievable river water withdrawal, mainly for irrigation, the inflow of river water into the Aral Sea has started to decrease significantly, accordingly the sea's hydrological and hydrochemical regimes disrupted dramatically. The sea level has continued to drop as evaporation exceeds inflow. This negatively transforms the natural environment and worsens socio-economic conditions in Priaralie as a whole, especially in the lower reaches of Amu Darya and Syr Darya, where natural conditions are largely determined by the sea's impact. At present, this causes desertification of the nonirrigated zone in the <b>deltas,</b> <b>spreading</b> to new areas as the Aral Sea dries out...|$|R

At the top the green and fertile area of the <b>Delta</b> <b>spreads</b> like the graceful leaves and foliage. The stem is perhaps a little twisted, for the Nile makes a vast bend in flowing through the desert. South of Khartoum the likeness is again perfect, and the roots of the tree begin to stretch deeply into the Soudan. I can imagine no better illustration of the intimate and sympathetic connection between Egypt and the southern provinces. The water--the life of the Delta--is drawn from the Soudan, and passes along the channel of the Nile, as the sap passes up the stem of the tree, to produce a fine crop of fruit above. The benefit to Egypt is obvious; but Egypt does not benefit alone. The advantages of the connection are mutual; for if the Soudan is thus naturally and geographically an integral part of Egypt, Egypt is no less essential {{to the development of the}} Soudan.

40|$|While the Gaussian copula {{model is}} {{commonly}} used as a static quotation device for CDO tranches, its use for hedging is questionable. In particular, the <b>spread</b> <b>delta</b> computed from the Gaussian copula model assumes constant base correlations, whereas we show that the correlations are dynamic and correlated to the index spread. It might therefore be expected that a dynamic model of credit risk, which is able to capture the dependence between the base correlations and the index spread, will have better hedging performances. In this paper, we compare <b>delta</b> hedging of <b>spread</b> risk based on the Gaussian copula model, {{to the implementation of}} jump-to-default ratio computed from the dynamic local intensity model. Theoretical and empirical analysis are illustrated by using the market data in {{both before and after the}} subprime crisis. We observe that <b>delta</b> hedging of <b>spread</b> risk outperforms the implementation of jump-to-default ratio in the pre-crisis period associated with CDX. NA. IG series 5, and the two strategies have comparable performance for crisis period associated with CDX. NA. IG series 9 and 10. This shows that, although the local intensity model is a dynamic model, it is not sufficient to explain the joint dynamic of the index spread and the base correlations, and a richer dynamic model is required to obtain better hedging results. Moreover, although different specifications of the local intensity can be fitted to the market data equally well, their hedging results can be significant different. This reveals substantial model risk when hedging CDO tranches...|$|R

The method {{developed}} {{in this paper}} is motivated by Peskin’s immersed boundary (IB) method, and allows one to model the motion of flexible membranes or other structures immersed in viscous incompressible fluid using a fluid solver on a fixed Cartesian grid. The IB method uses a set of discrete <b>delta</b> functions to <b>spread</b> the entire singular force exerted by the immersed boundary to the nearby fluid grid points. Our method instead incorporates part of this force into jump conditions for the pressure, avoiding discrete dipole terms that adversely affect the accuracy near the immersed boundary. This has been implemented for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using a high-resolution finite-volume method for the advective terms and a projection method to enforce incompressibility. In the projection step, the correct jump in pressure is imposed {{in the course of}} solving the Poisson problem. This gives sharp resolution of the pressure across the interface and also gives better volume conservation than the traditional IB method.

The empirical model developed uses estimates of transfer costs to generalise Ravallion&rsquo;s model of spatial market integration to allow for threshold effects. A sequential testing strategy is used to test for market segmentation, the number of thresholds, long-run integration, informational efficiency and the Law of One Price within an error correction framework. We find neither threshold effects nor weak evidence of paddy market integration between northern and southern Vietnam. There is, however, evidence of both threshold effects and stronger market integration within the Red and Mekong River <b>deltas.</b> Whenever price <b>spreads</b> exceed their thresholds, at least 60 % of price changes are transmitted between regional markets within a month. Nonetheless, the instantaneous version of the Law of One Price only holds for a few regimes and market pairs.
