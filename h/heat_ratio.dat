2500|$|Each {{one of the}} {{assumptions}} listed below adds {{to the complexity of}} the problem's solution. As the density of a gas increases with rising pressure, the intermolecular forces play a more substantial role in gas behavior which results in the ideal gas law no longer providing [...] "reasonable" [...] results. At {{the upper end of the}} engine temperature ranges (e.g. combustor sections – 1300 K), the complex fuel particles absorb internal energy by means of rotations and vibrations that cause their specific heats to vary from those of diatomic molecules and noble gases. At more than double that temperature, electronic excitation and dissociation of the gas particles begins to occur causing the pressure to adjust to a greater number of particles (transition from gas to plasma). Finally, all of the thermodynamic processes were presumed to describe uniform gases whose velocities varied according to a fixed distribution. Using a non-equilibrium situation implies the flow field must be characterized in some manner to enable a solution. One of the first attempts to expand the boundaries of the ideal gas law was to include coverage for different thermodynamic processes by adjusting the equation to read pVn = constant and then varying the n through different values such as the specific <b>heat</b> <b>ratio,</b> γ.|$|E

An analysis was performed to derive gap <b>heating</b> <b>ratios</b> which {{would result in the}} best fit of test data; provide an assessment of open gap response, and supply the definition of gap filler requirements on the Orbiter. A comparison was made of these <b>heating</b> <b>ratios</b> with previously derived ratios in order to verify the extrapolation of the wing glove data to Orbiter flight conditions. The analysis was performed with the Rockwell TPS Multidimensional Heat Conduction Program for a 3 -D, 2. 0 -inch thick flat RSI tile with 255 nodal points. The data from 14 tests was used to correlate with the analysis.

Comparing to a recent empirical estimate for this turbulent <b>heating</b> <b>ratio</b> in the high-speed solar wind, the prediction shows good agreement with the empirical estimate for R >~ 0. 8 AU, but predicts less ion heating than the empirical estimate at smaller heliocentric radii. At these smaller radii, the turbulent heating prescription, calculated in the gyrokinetic limit, fails because the turbulent cascade is predicted to reach the proton cyclotron frequency before Landau damping terminates the cascade. These findings suggest that the turbulent cascade can reach the proton cyclotron frequency at R ~ 0. 8 AU, this turbulent heating prescription contains all of the necessary physical mechanisms needed to reproduce the empirically estimated proton-to-total <b>heating</b> <b>ratio.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures, accepted to Astrophysical Journa...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of flows over a single expansion ramp nozzle with side walls was carried out at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The tests were performed at a free-stream Mach number of 7 in the hypersonic wind tunnel H 2 K of the wind tunnel department in Cologne. The Reynolds number, nozzle pressure <b>ratio,</b> and the <b>heat</b> capacity <b>ratio</b> were varied in order to study {{the performance of the}} scramjet nozzle at different flight altitudes and run conditions. The effects of different <b>heat</b> capacity <b>ratios</b> have been investigated by using gases with higher and lower <b>heat</b> capacity <b>ratios</b> than air.
