40|$|Patients with cardiac implantable {{electrical}} devices should take precautions {{when exposed to}} electromagnetic fields. Possible interference {{as a result of}} proximity to electromagnets or electricity flow from electronic tools employed in clinical odontology remains controversial. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine in vitro the capacity of dental equipment to provoke electromagnetic interference in pacemakers and <b>implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> <b>defibrillators.</b> Six electronic dental instruments were tested on three <b>implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> <b>defibrillators</b> and three pacemakers from different manufacturers. A simulator model, submerged in physiological saline, with elements that reproduced life-size anatomic structures was used. The instruments were analyzed at differing distances and for different time periods of application. The dental instruments studied displayed significant differences in their capacity to trigger electromagnetic interference. Significant differences in the quantity of registered interference were observed with respect to the variables manufacturer, type of cardiac implant, and application distance but not with the variable time of application. The electronic dental equipment tested at a clinical application distance (20 cm) provoked only slight interference in the pacemakers and <b>implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> <b>defibrillators</b> employed, irrespective of manufacturer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Many {{patients}} with <b>implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> <b>defibrillators</b> experience depressive symptoms. In addition, avoidance behavior {{is a common}} problem among {{patients with}} <b>implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> <b>defibrillators.</b> We examined the association between avoidance behaviors and depressive symptoms in patients with <b>implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> <b>defibrillators.</b> Method: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional study with self-completed questionnaires between May 2010 and March 2011. We measured avoidance behaviors (avoidance of places, avoidance of objects, and avoidance of situations) and depressive symptoms (using the Beck Depression Inventory, Version II) in 119 participants. An avoidance behaviors instrument was developed for this study and we confirmed its internal consistency reliability. Results: Ninety-two (77. 3 %) patients were aged older than 50 years, and 86 (72. 3 %) were men. Fifty-one (42. 9 %) patients reported “avoidance of places”, 34 (28. 6 %) reported “avoidance of objects”, and 63 (52. 9 %) reported “avoidance of activity”. Avoidance behavior was associated with increased odds {{for the presence of}} depressive symptoms (OR 1. 31; 95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 62). Conclusions: This was the first study to identify the relationship between avoidance behavior and depressive symptoms among patients with <b>implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> defibrillators; however, there are a few methodological limitations...|$|R

40|$|Background: In at-risk {{patients}} with left ventricular dysfunction, <b>implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> <b>defibrillators</b> (ICDs) prolong life. <b>Implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> <b>defibrillators</b> are increasingly implanted for primary prevention and therefore into lower risk patients. Trial data {{have demonstrated the}} benefit of these devices but does not provide an estimate of potential lifespan-gain over longer time periods, e. g. a patient's lifespan. Methods: Using data from landmark ICD trials, lifespan-gain was plotted against baseline annual mortality in the individual trials. Lifespan-gain was then extrapolated to a time-horizon of > 20 years while adjusting for increasing ‘competing’ risk from ageing and non-sudden cardiac death (pump failure). Results: At 3 years, directly observed lifespan-gain was strongly dependent on baseline event rate (r = 0. 94, P 20 years were greatest in lower risk patients (∼ 5 life-years for 5...|$|R
40|$|<b>Implantable</b> <b>cardioverter</b> <b>defibrillators</b> are {{life-saving}} devices for many patients with cardiac disease. Recipients of these devices, nevertheless, often suffer from progressive comorbid and cardiac conditions. Therefore, physicians should anticipate {{situations in which}} the defibrillator is no longer desired by the patient or no longer medically appropriate. Near the end of life, many of these patients may decline cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The coman-agement of do-not-resuscitate orders and implanted defibrillators can be confusing to patients and physicians alike since the former proscribe the use of electrical cardioversion while the latter pro-vide this precise treatment. Although the use of implanted defi-brillators has important ethical implications, few studies have ex-amined these issues, and guidelines {{have not yet been}} developed to assist physicians in caring for patients who have received de-fibrillators.
