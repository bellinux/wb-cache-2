40|$|In case of poldering, it {{has been}} {{considered}} that the groundwater table behind a polder merely depends on the water level of the <b>intercepting</b> <b>drain</b> round a polder. If the leakage into a polder from its surroundings cannot be disregarded, the groundwater table falls alld wells run dry in the surroundings. In this case, it has effects upon not only the agriculture but also the daily life remarkably. In order to prevent the lowering of the grollndwater table in the surroundings, {{it is necessary that}} thg adequate level and width of the <b>intercepting</b> <b>drain</b> are considered. In this report, we deal with the several models of geological structules cohsidefed as an effect on the lowering of the groundwater table in the surroundings and develop the simplest method determining the width of the <b>intercepting</b> <b>drain</b> in each case...|$|E
50|$|The Salt River is a {{formerly}} navigable hanging {{channel of}} the Eel River which flowed about 9 mi from near Fortuna and Waddington, California, to the estuary at the Pacific Ocean, until siltation from logging and agricultural practices essentially closed the channel. It was historically an important navigation route {{until the early}} 20th century. It presently <b>intercepts</b> and <b>drains</b> tributaries from the Wildcat Hills along {{the south side of}} the Eel River floodplain. Efforts to restore the river began in 1987, permits and construction began in 2012, and water first flowed in the restored channel in October 2013.|$|R
60|$|The {{greater part}} of the country between Sikkim and the sea is a dead level, {{occupied}} by the delta of the Ganges and Burrampooter, above which the slope is so gradual {{to the base of the}} mountains, that the surface of the plain from which the Himalayas immediately rise is only 300 feet above the sea. The most obvious effect of this position is, that the prevailing southerly wind reaches the first range of hills, loaded with vapour. The same current, when deflected easterly to Bhotan, or westerly to Nepal and the north-west Himalaya, is <b>intercepted</b> and <b>drained</b> of much moisture, by the Khasia and Garrow mountains (south of Assam and the Burrampooter) in the former case, and the Rajmahal hills (south of the Ganges) in the latter. Sikkim is hence the dampest region of the whole Himalaya.|$|R
50|$|In {{geotechnical}} engineering, an interceptor ditch {{is a small}} ditch or channel {{constructed to}} <b>intercept</b> and <b>drain</b> water to an area {{where it can be}} safely discharged. These are used for excavation purposes of limited depth made in a coarse-grained soils. These are constructed around an area to be dewatered. Sump pits are also placed at suitable intervals for installation of centrifugal pumps to remove the water collected in an efficient manner. In fine sands and silts, there may be sloughing, erosion or quick conditions. For such type of soils the method is confined to a depth of 1 to 2 m. Interceptor ditches are most economical for carrying away water which emerge on the slopes and {{near the bottom of the}} foundation pit. Its size depends on the original ground slope, runoff area, type of soil and vegetation, and other factors related to runoff volume.|$|R
40|$|The Iowa Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) is {{a highly}} targeted, performance-based water quality program {{focusing}} on the reduction of nitrate loads to surface waters through the restoration of strategically designed and located wetlands that <b>intercept</b> tile <b>drains</b> from upper-lying cropped lands. The following narrative and illustrated report details annual and cumulative performance accomplishments including a brief background, executive summary, accomplishments, and monitoring data. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize financial and active site data. Table 3 is a cumulative program summary. Background: Approved on August 17, 2001, the Iowa CREP is available in thirty-seven counties in the tiledrained region of North-Central Iowa. Wetland restoration {{is one of the}} most promising strategies for reducing nitrate transport to water resources from row-cropped lands, and research conducted at Iowa State University has demonstrated that strategically located and properly sized wetlands remove 40 - 90 % of the nitrate in tile drainage from upper-lying croplands. The effect of wetlands on watershed scale nitrate reduction is largely determined by the watershedâ€™s tota...|$|R
40|$|Entanglement, {{being at}} the heart of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, is a {{necessary}} ingredient in processing quantum information. Cooper pairs in superconductors - being composites of two fully entangled electrons - can be split adiabatically, thus forming entangled electrons. We fabricated such electron splitter by contacting an aluminum superconductor strip at the center of a suspended InAs nanowire; terminated at both ends with two normal metallic <b>drains.</b> <b>Intercepting</b> each half of the nanowire by gate - induced Coulomb blockaded quantum dot strongly impeded the flow of Cooper pairs due to large charging energy, while still permitting passage of single electrons. Here, we provide conclusive evidence of extremely high efficiency Cooper pairs splitting via observing positive average (conductance) and time (shot noise) correlations of the split electrons in the two opposite drains of the nanowire. Moreover, The actual charge of the injected quasiparticles was verified by shot noise measurements...|$|R
40|$|The South Wellesley Islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria, {{northern}} Australia, {{were the}} recent {{focus of a}} palynological investigation which found vegetation change during the Holocene was driven by coastal progradation and regional climate. Here, we present new elemental data from x-ray fluorescence core scanning which provides non-destructive, continuous and high resolution analysis from three wetlands across Bentinck Island, {{the largest of the}} South Wellesley Islands. Elemental data and grain size analyses are combined with lead- 210 (210 Pb) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) carbon- 14 (14 C) dates. An open coastal environment was present 1250 cal. a BP on the south east coast of Bentinck Island, with sediment supply incorporating fluvial deposition and detrital input of titanium and iron from eroding lateritic bedrock. Prograding shorelines, dune development and river diversion formed a series of swales parallel to the coast by ~ 800 cal. a BP, forming the Marralda wetlands. Wetlands developed at sites on the north and west coasts ~ 500 and ~ 450 cal. a BP, respectively. Geochemical and grain size analyses indicate that wetlands formed as accreting tidal mudflats or within inter-dune swales that <b>intercepted</b> groundwater <b>draining</b> to the coastal margins. The timing of wetland initiation indicates localised late-Holocene sea level regression, stabilisation and coastal plain development in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Elemental data provide new records of wetland development across Bentinck Island, highlighting the value of a multi-proxy approach to understanding environmental change during the Holocene in tropical northern Australia...|$|R
50|$|The {{measures}} {{that can be}} achieved to reduce the effects of water can be shallow or deep. Shallow drainage work mainly intercepts surface runoff and keeps it away from potentially unstable areas. In reality, on rocky hillsides this type of measure alone is usually insufficient to stabilise a hillside. Deep drainage is the most effective. Sub horizontal drainage is very effective in reducing pore-pressure along crack surfaces or potential breakage surfaces. In rocks, the choice of drain spacing, slope, and length is dependent on the hillside geometry and, more importantly, the structural formation of the mass. Features such as position, spacing and discontinuity opening persistence condition, apart from the mechanical characteristics of the rock, the water runoff mode inside the mass. Therefore, only by <b>intercepting</b> the mostly <b>drained</b> discontinuities can there be an efficient result. Sub horizontal drains are accompanied by surficial collectors which gather the water and take it away through networks of small surface channels.|$|R
40|$|Variability of flow {{in shallow}} drains {{installed}} in a grazing catchment in South Australia was partly caused by the enormous variability each winter in the saturated thickness of the texture-contrast soils and their hydraulic conductivity. High variability {{has been found in}} other trails of shallow drains but the causes were not well understood. This study found that perched water tables are not always found on top of the B horizon. The depth and thickness of saturation varies with landscape position (between texture-contrast soil types) and also varies seasonally at one landscape position. Because drains are on a gradient, they pass through a variety of texture-contrast soils. These soils may have different soil chemistry, physical properties and depth saturation. The presence of sodic subsoils with low hydraulic conductivity has a major impact on drainage volumes, particularly through flow. In some years the <b>drains</b> <b>intercepted</b> deep, perched water or groundwater, which rose into the collection zone of the shallow drain. Flow from the drains in the study catchment was compared to that from other catchments with texture-contrast soils. Drain flows are high variable and dependent on localised soil conditions, making flow prediction difficult. Despite this, a clear relationship was found between average annual catchment drain flow and annual rainfall. Drains installed across waterlogged paddocks with texture=contrast soils in southern Australia will average 10 mm flow (2. 5 % of annual rainfall) when annual rainfall is 400 mm, increasing to 100 mm (14 %) when rainfall is 700 mm.

40|$|Proceedings of the 1999 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 30 and 31, Athens, Georgia. To lessen {{soil erosion}} {{due to high}} animal {{stocking}} rates on small Georgia dairies, the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS) recommends a system that utilizes geotextile material covered with crusher run gravel as a soil cover in high animal traffic areas. Soil erosion is dramatically reduced, yet due to the large accumulation of manure, questions remain concerning water quality with these systems. At a 120 cow dairy in Oglethorpe county Georgia, a loafing lot utilizing this system was constructed on a Pacolet sandy loam soil (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Kanhapludult). Runoff water and leachate were characterized by storm events for water balance and chemical information. Surface runoff water typically contained levels of NHâ‚„-N, and Pâ‚„-P that exceeded EPA guidelines for surface water. Sub-surface drainage <b>intercepted</b> by tile <b>drains</b> had Nâ‚ƒ-N levels ranging from 10 to 40 ppm exceeding the EPA drinking water standard. It is recommended that surface water running off improved loafing lots either be routed to a wastewater lagoon for irrigation, or to adjacent hay fields to reduce the impact of excess nutrients to surface waters.
