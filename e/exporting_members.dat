30|$|Different {{scenarios}} are implemented and discussed where RTA’s initial benefits and losses experience considerable changes following the RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries. The analysis underlines important redistributions {{of the benefits}} and losses between importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries and between consumers and producers. Also, {{the implications of these}} adjustments for global welfare are found not to be necessarily different in {{the presence or absence of}} regional trading blocs. This outcome is revealed through the illustrated scenarios which show equivalence of these implications with and without the RTA in place. This paper also presents and discusses some analytical considerations in the case of vertical agricultural markets where RTA preferential schemes cover imports of upstream (primary or intermediate) and downstream (final) products.|$|R
40|$|In United States–Certain Country of Origin Labeling Requirements, the Appellate Body (2 ̆ 2 AB 2 ̆ 2) of the World Trade Organization (2 ̆ 2 WTO 2 ̆ 2) {{ruled that}} the United States 2 ̆ 7 country-of-origin {{labeling}} regulations (2 ̆ 2 COOL 2 ̆ 2) on beef and pork products violated the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade 2 ̆ 7 s (2 ̆ 2 TBT 2 ̆ 2) National Treatment (2 ̆ 2 NT 2 ̆ 2) Principle. Aimed at promoting informed consumer choice, COOL required retailers to disclose the covered products 2 ̆ 7 origin. In prior decisions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (2 ̆ 2 GATT 2 ̆ 2) art. III: 4, the AB correctly rejected protectionist rules that unnecessarily encumbered consumer choice by adversely affecting conditions of competition for imports. In US–COOL, however, the AB formalistically transposed such GATT jurisprudence into TBT analysis, equating private action in compliance with neutral, transparency-promoting labeling rules to private action in compliance with capricious, opacity-inducing distribution rules. This article argues that, while GATT NT-jurisprudence should enlighten analysis under the TBT, WTO adjudicators should not allow <b>exporting</b> <b>Members</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceived entitlement to trade volumes—which may well be premised on continued opacity and uninformed consumer choice—to interfere with importing Members 2 ̆ 7 origin-neutral regulations...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco {{companies}} and tobacco <b>exporting</b> <b>members</b> of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have initiated {{an increasing number}} of disputes in national, regional and worldwide jurisdictions and investor-state arbitrations challenging the legal consistency of tobacco control measures - such as Australia's 'Tobacco Plain Packaging' legislation and regulations - with international trade, investment and intellectual property law. The defendant countries and non-governmental organizations tend to justify tobacco-control measures by invoking public health provisions in international economic law (IEL), domestic constitutional laws, public health legislation, human rights law and the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) ratified by 177 UN member states. This article begins by asking how the fragmented systems of multilevel health, economic and human rights law and governance should be interpreted and coordinated in order to promote their mutual legal coherence. It then explores how multilevel courts should 'administer justice' in tobacco control disputes with due regard to their diverse national and international jurisdictions, applicable laws and methods of legal interpretation. The article concludes that multilevel judicial administration of justice in tobacco control disputes requires judicial cooperation in applying 'constitutional methodologies' (e. g. regarding 'balancing' of competing rights, proportionality of restrictions, reasonable judicial justifications promoting 'public reason'), mutually 'consistent interpretations' (e. g. based on the 'integration principle' limiting legal 'fragmentation') and 'judicial comity' (e. g. regarding rule of law, respecting 'margins of appreciation', protecting 'access to justice') so as to avoid incoherent judgments. The main lesson from the more than 2500 years of legal and political experiences - e. g. since the ancient Constitution of Athens (500 BC) - with collective protection of 'public goods' (res publica) demanded by citizens remains the need for limiting abuses of power through multilevel 'republican constitutionalism' providing for legal, judicial and democratic accountability mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the international legal discipline on public subsidies carried out in this monograph is mainly founded on a critical examination of the relevant disputes. The volume begins with {{the study of the}} rules on subsidies in the 1947 GATT, so as to single out both its positive features and its flaws. This historical overview intends to highlight the goals that the WTO Agreements had to accomplish in order to fill the gaps in the international regulation of subsidies. The research continues with an in-depth exam of the relevant rules in the WTO Agreements, based on several rulings issued by the panels and the Appellate Body throughout the last fourteen years. First, the monograph is directed to reconstruct the notion of subsidy and to check as well if the notion provided by the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) has a general nature and could also apply to other Agreements, in particular to the special category of agricultural subsidies, regulated by the Agreement on Agriculture. This question – addressed both by the doctrine and the case law – has been settled by assuming that WTO Agreements are part of a single system of rules. Therefore it seems necessary to find solutions that could preserve its consistency, including the contextual application of different Multilateral Agreements. This aspect is further discussed in the final part of the study, that deals with the {{analysis of}} the rules on agricultural subsidies. The examination of the disputes settlement bodies reports shows that prohibited subsidies – especially “export” subsidies – are more challenged than “actionable” subsidies. Hence, one cannot consider that Uruguay Round negotiators fully succeeded in establishing more precise rules for the definition of the concepts of “injury” and “causal link” and in rendering the so-called “effect-based norms” provided for in the Agreement more effective. Thus, the provision of actual prohibitions turns itself into an essential means to limit these measures that distort international trade and that are commonly used during times of economic crisis. The book also analyses the remedies established by the WTO system – with particular reference to the SCM Agreement – in order to offset the distortive use of subsidies. As in the past, the imposition of countervailing duties is currently the most rapid and effective means to re-establish a balance between the industries of the importing and the <b>exporting</b> <b>Members.</b> This unilateral action is therefore widespread and is subject to “quasi-jurisdictional” review by the DSB, in order to avoid abuses that could turn into protectionist practices. Nevertheless, this international trade area is also characterised by a wider access to the multilateral mechanism of disputes settlement if compared to the past. The research deeply focuses on the problems raised by these two competing options allowed to Member States under the system...|$|E

30|$|The {{formation}} of an RTA is expected to generate various implications for agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries. This is because the {{formation of}} an RTA, which promotes intra-regional increases in agricultural trade flows, would eventually magnify market competition levels. In this context, several studies (e.g., Krugman, 1991; Frankel, 1997; Perdikis, 2007) noted that reductions in regional and bilateral trade barriers would not only decrease market prices, but would also compel firms in RTAs’ member countries to upgrade their production technologies and to realize more efficient uses of inputs.|$|R
40|$|African {{countries}} {{after independence}} {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century embraced the formation of Free Trade Areas (FTAs), provided for under Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT 1947), as an exception to Article I Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause. FTAs were the adopted anodyne to reverse systemic underdevelopment wrought by departing colonialists from Europe and the emergence of the European Union. Sub-Saharan Africa encompasses West Africa, and accounted for 1. 1 per cent of world trade in 1991. West African share of world exports with the exception of Nigeria fell from 1. 6 % in 1980 to 0. 6 per cent in 2006. In 1963 Africa’s share of world exports was 5. 7 per cent and imports accounted for 5. 2 per cent, while in 2006 Africa’s share of exports had declined to 3. 1 per cent and imports 2. 4 per cent. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) 5 FTA is relatively unknown in the United States, unlike the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), which came into effect on January 1, 1994. ECOWAS is a model FTA on the successful abolition of visas amongst its members. A brief history of western dominated international trade regime is necessary, in order to understand why West African countries’ attempts to form a customs union resulted into a free trade area. This paper analyzes the debate whether FTAs create trade or distort trade, and examines the arguments around their role in facilitating the growth pace of developing countries. The impact of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on developing countries is analyzed through the prism of the constructive school of international relations, and the normative constructs of the realist school. The paper appraises the international economic law regime, through the establishment of ECOWAS in 1975 by fifteen contiguous states in West Africa, to promote inter-regional trade and remove all barriers to labor, capital and ultimately establish a single currency for its fifteen countries. A critical legal analysis is carried out on the implementation of the goals of ECOWAS, and the modification of its treaty through additional protocols; to guarantee, peace, security and democracy in West Africa as a sine qua non for engaging the global economic community in a symbiotic relationship. The paper concludes that ECOWAS has achieved peace and democracy in West Africa, despite limited resources, but its percentage share of world trade fell from 1. 6 per cent in 1980 to 0. 6 per cent in 2006, excluding oil <b>exporting</b> <b>members.</b> The paper observes that ECOWAS has a lot of homework to do in lowering rules of origin requirements for goods manufactured in its member countries, provision of public infrastructure, enabling access to credit by entrepreneurs, in order to promote regional trade and access to the global economy...|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} for achieving {{this result is}} as follows. The <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> state zero-rates the VAT. This means that the member state of the exporting merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The importing member state [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to the importing member state at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges VAT on resale in the normal way.|$|R

30|$|This paper shows {{changes in}} the initial {{benefits}} and losses from RTAs and depicts their redistributions following the RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries. It is important to underscore the relevant study by Anania and McCalla (1995) that examined the implications of some domestic and trade policies, which are commonly used in developing countries, for the distribution of benefits from agricultural technology improvements. Using a partial equilibrium framework, Anania and McCalla (1995) identified different cases where policy interventions increase, reduce, or do not impact the overall benefits from agricultural technology improvements. Yet, in all cases, the distribution of benefits from agricultural technology improvements {{is found to be}} different with policy interventions.|$|R
30|$|This paper aims {{to enhance}} our {{understanding}} of the relationship between RTAs and agricultural technology and productivity. The implementation of an RTA is expected to induce increases in market competition levels, in domestic markets through increases in imports and in foreign markets through increases in exports. These increases in market competition levels could eventually result in important implications for agricultural technology and productivity in importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries of regional trading blocs. This paper examines these implications in the context of Viner’s (1950) conventional partial equilibrium framework with perfectly elastic foreign supply schedules faced by the importing member country, and in the context of Pomfret’s (1986) extended partial equilibrium framework depicting upward-sloping foreign supply schedules for the importing member country.|$|R
30|$|Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) {{represent}} a prominent {{feature of the}} current international trading system. For instance, the number of RTAs that {{have been reported to}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) exceeded 500 in 2012 (WTO, 2012). RTAs normally encompass reductions (or eliminations) of policy trade barriers (e.g., tariffs, non-tariff barriers) between member countries. Also, RTAs often bring about higher levels of business cooperation and trade facilitation measures (e.g., development of regional trade-enhancing infrastructure) between member countries that further promote intra-regional trade flows. RTAs are commonly associated with increases in intra-regional trade flows in agricultural productsa. Naturally, such increases in intra-regional trade would be accompanied with a rise in market competition levels, in domestic agricultural markets for producers in importing member countries and in foreign regional agricultural markets for producers in <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries.|$|R

50|$|The {{decline in}} coffee exports {{in the mid-1980s}} {{resulted}} largely from the depletion of stocks that had earlier cushioned exports as production declined. <b>Exports</b> to <b>members</b> of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) have remained fairly stable since 1983, but <b>exports</b> to non-ICO <b>members,</b> of which East Germany has been {{by far the most}} important market in the late 1980s, have declined. The fall in sales to the non-ICO market has eroded coffee earnings because these sales have traditionally been at substantially higher prices than those to ICO members. Exacerbating the decline in production and exports has been the depressed world market for coffee; from February 1986 to August 1987, ICO indicator prices dropped by more than 20 percent.|$|R
50|$|When {{a vendor}} in one member state sells goods {{directly}} {{to individuals and}} VAT-exempt organisations in another member state and the aggregate value of goods sold to consumers in that member state is below €100,000 (or the equivalent, e.g. in the UK as of April 2013 it is £79,000) in any 12 consecutive months, then such a sale of goods may qualify for a distance sales treatment. Distance sales treatment allows the vendor to apply domestic place of supply rules for determining which member state collects the VAT. This means that VAT is charged at the rate applicable in the <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> state. However, there are some additional restrictions to be met. For instance, supply of new motor vehicles like cars, trucks and boats does not qualify. As well, a compulsory VAT registration is required for a supplier of excisable goods to the UK (like tobacco and alcohol).|$|R

30|$|Turning to the RTA <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> country F, the post-upgrading {{gains from}} the RTA formation, which are {{equivalent}} to the area [CιIιXιVι[*]+[*]KιGιWι], are higher than the pre-upgrading gains, which are {{equivalent to the}} area [CIXV[*]+[*]KGW] (see previous section). Specifically, the net post-upgrading increases in country F’s welfare, resulting from a higher price received on additional exports, {{is equivalent to the}} area [CιCιιιVιιVι]. Meanwhile, the pre-upgrading gains and the post-upgrading gains in country F’s producer surplus (i.e., the areas [KGW] and [KιGιWι], respectively) are equivalent by construction under the current scenario. Turning to the non-RTA member country J, the losses from the RTA formation are attenuated, being reduced from the pre-upgrading adjustments area [P 4 UYP 5 [*]+[*]UVY] (see previous section) to the post-upgrading adjustments area [P 4 ιUιYιP 5 ι[*]+[*]UιVιYι]. Hence, given that [UVY] is equivalent to [UιVιYι] by construction, the post-upgrading losses are lower than the pre-upgrading losses by the area [UιιUYYιι]. The latter is derived from the lower quantities subjected to an RTA-induced lower price.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{develop a}} simple, formal {{framework}} for clarifying the tradeoffs involved in choosing between a fixed and {{flexible exchange rate}} system. They apply this framework to the countries of Africa's CFA Zone, which have maintained fixed parity with the French franc since independence. Because a few agricultural products and natural resources dominate their <b>exports,</b> <b>member</b> countries of Africa's CFA Zone have suffered frequent shocks in terms of trade. A flexible exchange rate could possibly have alleviated the costs of these external shocks. On the other hand, CFA member countries have managed to maintain lower inflation levels than their neighbors. The fixed exchange rate of the CFA Zone acts as a credible committment. The government"ties its own hands"so {{that it will not}} be tempted to use the exchange rate, thereby eliciting lower wage and price increases from the private sector. Weighing this benefit against the costs of nonadjustment to external shocks, the authors conclude that fixed exchange rates have been a bad bargain for the CFA member countries.

40|$|Standard theory {{says that}} a country's welfare is {{unaffected}} by being excluded from a small regional trade agreement. But for most products,"small"countries and regional trade agreements do have some measure of market power. Such market power can arise if (1) supply is geographically concentrated; (2) tastes differ; (3) there is product differentiation (such as quality); (4) transport costs are high; (5) the principal importing countries impose quantitative restrictions; and (6) there is hysterisis because of irreversible costs. The authors show, based on two case studies, that regional trade agreements among small countries may have negative welfare implications for outside countries. In the first case, they find that Argentina's cattle and beef exports to Peru fell when Peru formed a regional trade agreement (the Andean Pact) with various countries, including Colombia, and exporter of the same products. Argentina also lost because of the higher unit price it received on its exports to Peru. Interestingly, Venezuela's entry into the Andean Pact (that is, {{the formation of a}} larger bloc) seems to have resulted in a welfare gain for the outside country (Argentina). In the second case, rather than examine whether formation of the Central American Common Market (CACM) had a negative impact on outside countries (for which they lacked data), they examine the impact of the CACM's breakdown on member countries. Although the CACM has essentially been trade-diverting for manufactures, it seems to have been trade-creating for white maize, with both importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries gaining from the regional trade agreement. So, one would expect that a breakdown of the CACM, which resulted in member countries becoming relatively more"outsiders"to the bloc, may have led to a decline in the welfare of both the <b>exporting</b> and importing <b>member</b> countries. This is supported by the data, and implies that if one of the five member countries had been left out of the CACM, it would have been worse off where white maize was concerned.
