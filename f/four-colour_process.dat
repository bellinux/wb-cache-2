This process was chosen as it gave a higher quality for the fine line-work than the industry standard <b>four-colour</b> <b>process</b> (CMYK). As computer and software technology has advanced, and the cost reduced, many clubs {{are now in a}} position to print their own maps. This enables clubs to print the six colours together (map and overprinting symbols) using that same <b>four-colour</b> <b>process,</b> but with a reduction in quality over traditional printing. Printing costs can be minimised by using standard stock sizes of paper e.g. A4 or Letter. It is important to use the correct type of paper: both the weight and the coating affect the usability of the final map.|$|E

40|$|Single photons are {{excellent}} quantum information carriers: {{they were used}} in the earliest demonstrations of entanglement(1) and in the production of the highest-quality entanglement reported so far(2, 3). However, current schemes for preparing, processing and measuring them are inefficient. For example, down-conversion provides heralded, but randomly timed, single photons(4), and linear optics gates are inherently probabilistic(5). Here we introduce a deterministic process-coherent photon conversion (CPC) -that provides a new way to generate and process complex, multiquanta states for photonic quantum information applications. The technique uses classically pumped nonlinearities to induce coherent oscillations between orthogonal states of multiple quantum excitations. One example of CPC, based on a pumped four-wave-mixing interaction, is shown to yield a single, versatile process that provides a full set of photonic quantum processing tools. This set satisfies the DiVincenzo criteria for a scalable quantum computing architecture(6), including deterministic multiqubit entanglement gates (based on a novel form of photon-photon interaction), high-quality heralded single-and multiphoton states free from higher-order imperfections, and robust, high-efficiency detection. It {{can also be used to}} produce heralded multiphoton entanglement, create optically switchable quantum circuits and implement an improved form of down-conversion with reduced higher-order effects. Such tools are valuable building blocks for many quantum-enabled technologies. Finally, using photonic crystal fibres we experimentally demonstrate quantum correlations arising from a <b>four-colour</b> nonlinear <b>process</b> suitable for CPC and use these measurements to study the feasibility of reaching the deterministic regime with current technology(4, 7). Our scheme, which is based on interacting bosonic fields, is not restricted to optical systems but could also be implemented in optomechanical, electromechanical and superconducting systems(8 - 12) with extremely strong intrinsic nonlinearities. Furthermore, exploiting higher-order nonlinearities with multiple pump fields yields a mechanism for multiparty mediation of the complex, coherent dynamics...|$|R
50|$|<b>Four-colour</b> <b>process</b> is {{when the}} artwork is created and then {{separated}} into four colours (CMYK) which combine to create {{the full spectrum of}} colours needed for photographic prints. This means a large number of colours can be simulated using only 4 screens, reducing costs, time, and set-up. The inks are required to blend and are more translucent, meaning a compromise with vibrancy of colour.|$|E
50|$|Wood {{engraving}} {{is generally}} a black-and-white technique. However, {{a handful of}} wood engravers also work in colour, using three or four blocks of primary colours—in a way parallel to the <b>four-colour</b> <b>process</b> in modern printing. To do this, the printmaker must register the blocks (make sure they print {{in exactly the same}} place on the page). Recently, engravers have begun to use lasers to engrave wood.|$|E
5000|$|Spectral {{printing}} {{is the art}} {{and science}} of reproducing the spectra of a scene-referred image, by means of hard-copy printing using more than four process-colour printing inks namely cyan, magenta, yellow and black and their lighter versions. The additional secondary inks are {{often referred to as}} spot colours. As opposed to normal <b>four-colour</b> <b>process</b> printing, the aim of spectral printing is to eliminate or reduce [...] metamerism either due to illuminant or observer.|$|E
5000|$|While Andrews’ output {{prior to}} 1996 {{tends to be}} {{in black and white}} or monochrome, around this time he {{introduces}} colour into his work. The Weather Series (1996) begins the artists’ extended investigation into the processes of colour generation and the <b>four-colour</b> separation printing <b>processes.</b> [...] For Andrews, weather provides an analogy for the quickly changing circumstances of life, likening it to his own experience of living with HIV. [...] Andrews’ method of homemade colour separation evokes both the 19th-century painting technique of Pointillism: “in which small, distinct dots of pure color are applied in patterns to form an image”, and the Ben-Day dots of mechanical printing. Beyond these references, Andrews’ uses the technique to, at the same time, evoke the alchemy of vision and break its mechanics down. As a result, Andrews creates works that “hover at legibility.” [...] “The pixilation or dot matrix completely obscures details, making specifics impossible to see. We can't grasp the full picture.“ [...] The series of rubbed-crayon drawings, The Quick and the Dead (2004), feature stills derived from video footage of the Iraq war. By drawing the viewer’s eye back {{to the surface of the}} work, he creates ambiguities of meaning. Considered in relation to the source material Andrews uses, the work has political implications, “suggesting the impossibility of knowing the circumstances and contexts of what they depict.” [...] The artist has stated the series is “my response to the lack of photographic evidence of the war...information was really only available on websites at that time. The disposability of these media images is in stark contrast to the effects on the lives of those involved.“ [...] Andrews also used 600 drawings from the series to create one minute animation, The Quick and the Dead (2004).|$|R
5000|$|For color processes, an {{individual}} black and white, [...] "screened" [...] negative {{is used to}} represent each color in a <b>four-colour</b> <b>process</b> (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black) to be printed on a printing press. A screened negative has varying sizes of dots arranged in a particular pattern to represent greater or lesser density of image. Typically, a 150 dots-per-inch screen is used to create each printing negative, though this will varying depending on the application, where a magazine may use 200 line screens and a newspaper may use 120 to 133 line screen. The screen is rotated at successively varied angles {{to ensure that the}} dots do not print exactly on top of one another.|$|E
