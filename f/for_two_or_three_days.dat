5|$|<b>For</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> Rome {{remained}} {{without an}} emperor. By April 11, Macrinus had proclaimed himself emperor and assumed {{all of the}} imperial titles and powers, without waiting for the Senate. The army backed his claim as emperor and the Senate, so far away, was powerless to intervene. Macrinus never returned to Rome as emperor and remained based in Antioch {{for the duration of}} his reign. Macrinus was the first emperor to hail from the equestrian class, rather than the senatorial and also the first emperor of Mauretanian descent. He adopted the name of Severus, in honor of the Severan dynasty, and conferred the imperial title of Augusta to his wife Nonia Celsa and the title of Caesar and name of Antoninus to his son Diadumenianus in honor of the Antonine dynasty, thus making him second in command. At the time of Diadumenian's accession he was eight years old.|$|E
5|$|The period {{also saw}} the {{development}} of charter fairs in England, which reached their heyday in the 13th century. From the 12th century onwards, many English towns acquired a charter from the Crown allowing them to hold an annual fair, usually serving a regional or local customer base and lasting <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> The practice increased {{in the next century}} and over 2,200 charters were issued to markets and fairs by English kings between 1200 and 1270. Fairs grew in popularity as the international wool trade increased: the fairs allowed English wool producers and ports on the east coast to engage with visiting foreign merchants, circumnavigating those English merchants in London keen to make a profit as middlemen. At the same time, wealthy magnate consumers in England began to use the new fairs as a way to buy goods like spices, wax, preserved fish and foreign cloth in bulk from the international merchants at the fairs, again bypassing the usual London merchants.|$|E
25|$|The Party was {{confirmed}} in {{office in the}} 1976 elections. Between 1976 and 1981 Malta went through difficult times and the Labour government demanded that the Maltese tighten their belts in order to overcome the difficulties Malta was facing. There were shortages of essential items; the water and electricity supplies were systematically suspended <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> a week. Political tensions increased, notably on Black Monday, when following an attempted assassination of the Prime Minister, the premises of the Times of Malta were burned and {{the house of the}} Leader of Opposition was attacked.|$|E

25|$|Minor {{cases of}} malaria are kept {{at the field}} {{ambulance}} <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in the hospital tents, and then sent back to their units. More serious cases, including all the malignant ones, were evacuated as soon as possible, after immediate treatment. All cases got one or more injections of quinine. Between 15 May and 24 August, the 9th and 11th Light Horse Regiments, participated in a quinine trial. Every man in one squadron {{of each of the}} two regiments was given five grains of quinine daily by mouth and the remainder none. During the trial 10 cases of malaria occurred in the treated squadrons while 80 occurred in the untreated men giving a ratio of 1:2.3 cases.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the islands}} of Vanuatu in the South Pacific, people believe that illness usually is caused by sexual {{misconduct}} or anger. [...] "If you are angry <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> sickness will come," [...] said one local man. The therapy that counters this sickness is confession. The patient, or a family member, may confess. If no one confesses an error, the patient may die. The Vanuatu people believe that secrecy is what gives power to the illness. When the error is confessed, it no longer has power over the person.|$|E

He says it was run by Iraqi Kurds, not by al-Qaeda. They were training to use improvised incendiary grenades to fight Saddam Hussein. He donated a few hundred British pounds to that camp and a third training camp. [...] A Pentagon spokesman said Begg spent five days in early 1998 at Derunta, an al-Qaeda-affiliated Afghan training camp. Defense Department officials said that Begg's sworn statements state he trained at Derunta and two other Afghan camps. He denied saying that, but acknowledged signing some documents while in custody because he feared for his life.|$|E
2500|$|Without the {{availability}} of antibiotics at the time, medical personnel {{found that it was}} beneficial to get the flu victims out of crowded hospitals, where many of them would die, and into tents where they would get a lot more fresh air. [...] According to Draper, [...] "if we could bed [...] down in tents which were furnished by the National Guard, more of them lived. [...] If we got them into bed {{in the early stages of}} the disease the chances of living were far better. [...] If they stayed around <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> and finally went to bed, because they couldn't do anything else—they would very likely die." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{documentary}} film [...] (1988) attributes Monk's quirky behavior to mental illness. In the film, Monk's son {{says that his}} father sometimes did not recognize him, and he reports that Monk was hospitalized on several occasions owing to an unspecified mental illness that worsened in the late 1960s. No reports or diagnoses were ever publicized, but Monk would often become excited <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> then pace for days after that, after which he would withdraw and stop speaking. Physicians recommended electroconvulsive therapy as a treatment option for Monk's illness, but his family would not allow it; antipsychotics and lithium were prescribed instead. [...] Other theories abound: Leslie Gourse, {{author of the book}} Straight, No Chaser: The Life and Genius of Thelonious Monk (1997), reported {{that at least one of}} Monk's psychiatrists failed to find evidence of manic depression (bipolar disorder) or schizophrenia. Another physician maintains that Monk was misdiagnosed and prescribed drugs during his hospital stay that may have caused brain damage.|$|E

After one incident where the drummer had disappeared <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> Corgan [...] "put the hammer down", according to Vig, and had Chamberlin perform the drum part for [...] "Cherub Rock" [...] until his hands bled. Due to Corgan's urging, Chamberlin checked into a rehab clinic. Corgan told Spin later that year, [...] "You know, I gave them {{a year and a}} half to prepare for this record... I'm surrounded by these people who I care about very much, yet they continue to keep failing me." [...] Corgan explained that he began to take the actions of others personally; he said, [...] "If you really think about it, of course, someone doesn't do the job because they're lazy, or they don't think it's important. But I took it as, 'You're not worth going home and working on the song.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The French {{opened their}} {{trenches}} around Tournai on 30 April, exactly {{in accordance with}} the memorial presented by Saxe to Versailles in December 1744. Saxe entrusted the investment to Löwendahl, while he himself turned his attention towards the gathering Allied army. The true intentions of the French were not discovered by the allies until 28 April. [...] "After a good deal of variety and contradiction," [...] wrote Cumberland's secretary, [...] "our advices <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> past agree that the enemy's army is before Toumai". Due to indecision the allies had not begun their march until 30 April, reaching Soignies on 2 May where they were detained due to bad weather. On 5 May the allies reached Cambron. Here, a reserve corps was formed under the Hanoverian general, Moltke, and detached towards Leuze where 50 French squadrons under Du Chayla were stationed as a corps of observation. Du Chayla at once withdrew in the direction of Tournai, but he had achieved his objective: he had satisfied himself as to which road the allies would approach.|$|E
2500|$|... `Abdu'l-Bahá {{taught that}} Christ's resurrection was a spiritual resurrection {{and that the}} {{accounts}} in the Gospels are parables. [...] `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote: [...] "We explain, therefore, the meaning of Christ's resurrection in the following way: After the martyrdom of Christ the Apostles were perplexed and dismayed. The reality of Christ, which consists in His teachings, His bounties, His perfections and His spiritual power, was hidden and concealed <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after His martyrdom, and had no outward appearance or manifestation — indeed, {{it was as though}} it were entirely lost. For those who truly believed were few in number and even those few were perplexed and dismayed. The Cause of Christ was thus as a lifeless body. After three days the Apostles became firm and steadfast, arose to aid the Cause of Christ, resolved to promote the divine teachings and practice their Lord's admonitions, and endeavoured to serve Him. Then did the reality of Christ become resplendent, His grace shine forth, His religion find new life, and His teachings and admonitions become manifest and visible. In other words the Cause of Christ, which was like unto a lifeless body, was quickened to life and surrounded by the grace of the Holy Spirit." ...|$|E
