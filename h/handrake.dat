The process of applying handbrakes is time consuming, and exposes Rio Tinto personnel to associated safety hazards. Engineering calculations that were performed estimate a reduction in both the number of occasions handbrakes need to be applied, and the number of handbrakes that are required for application. These estimates were verified successfully through field trial work, and as a result, changes to operating rules and procedures can be implemented. This will both reduce the Rio Tinto personnel’s exposure to potential safety hazards relating to handbrake application, as well as reducing delays in the transportation of iron ore from mine to port...|$|R
