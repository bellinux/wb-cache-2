50|$|A later {{study using}} more data {{than in the}} Olivieri study found no {{evidence}} of that long-term therapy with <b>deferiprone</b> caused progression of hepatic fibrosis.

5000|$|In 1996, a {{controversy}} erupted {{with regard to}} the safety and effectiveness of <b>deferiprone.</b> Koren believed the drug was effective for certain patients. Olivieri of Toronto believed the drug was unsafe and ineffective. Following the initial controversy surrounding this drug trial in Toronto, Koren sent five anonymous harassing letters to colleagues and later denied having done so. Two independent inquiries by the CAUT and CPSO found that Koren had lied about sending the anonymous letters and only admitted guilt when confronted with DNA evidence against him. Both also found academic misconduct with respect {{to the way in which}} he published the research article cited above on the safety and effectiveness of <b>deferiprone.</b> CAUT accepted [...] "the parties’ submissions that this misconduct should not be represented as fraudulent" [...] and further remarked that [...] "It was the behaviour that preceded the research misconduct that the Committee found most unsettling." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Deferiprone</b> (tradenames include Ferriprox) is a {{drug that}} chelates iron and is used to treat iron {{overload}} in thalassaemia major. [...] It was first approved for use in treating thalassaemia major in 1994 and had been licensed for use in Europe and Asia for many years while awaiting approval in Canada and the United States. [...] On October 14, 2011, it was approved {{for use in the}} US under the FDA’s accelerated approval program.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1989, Olivieri {{was part}} of a group {{evaluating}} the use of a drug, <b>deferiprone,</b> in treating persons with the blood disorder thalassaemia. Starting from 1985, this work included a clinical trial partly funded by Apotex. During the course of the trial, Olivieri became concerned about evidence that pointed to the drug being inefficacious for some patients. Olivieri informed both the research ethics board that was monitoring the study and Apotex, the drug maker. The research ethics board instructed Olivieri to inform participants about her concerns. Apotex responded by noting that Olivieri had signed a confidentiality agreement as part of the drug trial and that informing participants about her concerns, the validity of which Apotex disputed, would violate that confidentiality agreement. In 1996, Apotex threatened to vigorously pursue legal remedies against her if she disclosed her conclusions to patients. Olivieri disclosed her concerns to her patients and Apotex ended the portion of the study in which she was participating. In 1998, the New England Journal of Medicine published a paper by Olivieri and seven other authors, with further study results suggesting that <b>deferiprone</b> led to progressive hepatic fibrosis.|$|E
50|$|For those {{unable to}} {{tolerate}} routine blood draws, {{there is a}} chelating agent available for use. The drug deferoxamine binds with iron in the bloodstream and enhances its elimination in urine and faeces. Typical treatment for chronic iron overload requires subcutaneous injection {{over a period of}} 8-12 hours daily. Two newer iron chelating drugs that are licensed for use in patients receiving regular blood transfusions to treat thalassaemia (and, thus, who develop iron overload as a result) are deferasirox and <b>deferiprone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{half-life}} of deferasirox {{is between}} 8 and 16 hours allowing {{once a day}} dosing. Two molecules of deferasirox are capable of binding to 1 atom of iron which are subsequently eliminated by fecal excretion. Its low molecular weight and high lipophilicity allows the drug to be taken orally unlike deferoxamine which has to be administered by IV route (intravenous infusion). Together with <b>deferiprone,</b> deferasirox seems {{to be capable of}} removing iron from cells (cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes) as well as removing iron from the blood.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of the {{inherited}} blood disorder thalassemia {{depends upon}} the level of severity. For mild forms of the condition, advice and counseling are often all that are necessary. For more severe forms, treatment may consist in blood transfusion; chelation therapy to reverse iron overload, using drugs such as deferoxamine, <b>deferiprone,</b> or deferasirox; medication with the antioxidant indicaxanthin to prevent the breakdown of hemoglobin; or {{a bone marrow transplant}} using material from a compatible donor, or from the patient's mother. Population screening has had some success as a preventive measure.|$|E
50|$|Selectivity is {{determined}} by various factors. In the case of iron overload, which may occur in individuals with β-thalessemia who have received blood transfusions, the target metal ion is in the +3 oxidation state and so forms stronger complexes than the divalent ions. It also forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. deferoxamine, a naturally occurring siderophore produced by the actinobacter Streptomyces pilosus and was used initially as a chelation therapy agent. Synthetic siderophores such as <b>deferiprone</b> and deferasirox have been developed, using the known structure of deferoxamine as a starting point. Chelation occurs with the two oxygen atoms.|$|E
50|$|Thalassemia {{results in}} nontransferrin-bound iron being {{available}} in blood {{as all the}} transferrin becomes fully saturated. This free iron is toxic to the body since it catalyzes reactions that generate free hydroxyl radicals. These radicals may induce lipid peroxidation of organelles like lysosomes, mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic membranes. The resulting lipid peroxides may interact with other molecules to form cross links, and thus either cause these compounds to perform their functions poorly, or render them non-functional altogether. This iron overload may be treated with chelation therapy. Deferoxamine, <b>deferiprone</b> and deferasirox are the three most widely used iron-chelating agents.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Nancy Olivieri ~ Dr. Olivieri {{received}} {{legal advice}} {{and support from}} the CMPA in a case involving clinical trials of a drug called <b>deferiprone,</b> or L1. The drug's manufacturer, Apotex, tried to prohibit Dr. Olivieri from informing patients of the risks of L1, and hoped that she would cave to their threats of legal action against her because the cost of hiring legal counsel could be prohibitive. The CMPA played an instrumental role in protecting Dr. Olivieri's professional reputation and in asserting her belief that her ethical duty to her patients and research subjects outweighed any legal obligations she might have had under a confidentiality agreement between herself and Apotex.|$|E
50|$|His other {{research}} concerned removal of iron from multiple transfused patients with thalassaemia major and other refractory anaemias. In 1976, Richard Propper and David Nathan suggested {{the use of}} subcutaneous desferrioxamine to prevent death from iron overload in these diseases. The same year Hoffband's group confirmed {{the success of this}} new therapy. In 1987, the first use of a clinically effective oral iron chelating agent, <b>deferiprone,</b> was reported from his group including George Kontoghioghes and Beatrix Wonke and in 1998, the first use of combination iron chelation therapy. These advances have substantially improved the life expectancy of many thousands of sufferers from these blood disorders.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{no current}} cure for {{superficial}} siderosis, only treatments to help alleviate the current symptoms {{and to help}} prevent the development of further symptoms. If a source of bleeding can be identified (sources are frequently not found), then surgical correction of the bleeding source can be performed; this {{has proved to be}} effective in halting the development of further symptoms in some cases and has no effect on symptoms that have already presented. Patients with superficial siderosis are often treated with <b>deferiprone,</b> a lipid-soluble iron chelator, as this medication has been demonstrated to chelate iron in the central nervous system. [...] While on this drug you wil need a frequent blood test (weekly) {{to keep an eye on}} the blood levels as this drug is known to lower certain blood levels such as the neutrophils and WBC (white blood count) and etc. While it is ok if these levels go low in the average person, if they go low while taking <b>Deferiprone</b> Ferriprox it can cause life threatening infections that can result in death. Alleviation of the most common symptom, hearing loss, has been varyingly successful through the use of cochlear implants. Most people do not notice a large improvement after successful implantation, which is most likely due to damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) and not the cochlea itself. Some people fare far better, with a return to near normal hearing, but there is little ability to detect how well a person will respond to this treatment at this time.|$|E
50|$|It {{was founded}} by Dr. Khwaja Abdul Hamied as 'The Chemical, Industrial & Pharmaceutical Laboratories' in 1935 in Mumbai.The name of the Company was changed to 'Cipla Limited' on 20 July 1984. In the year 1985, US FDA {{approved}} the company's bulk drug manufacturing facilities. Led by the founder’s son Yusuf Hamied, a Cambridge-educated chemist, the company became a global icon for its role in defying Western multinational pharmaceutical companies {{in order to provide}} generic AIDS and other drugs to treat poor people in the developing world.In 1994, Cipla launched <b>Deferiprone,</b> the world’s first oral iron chelator. In 2001, Cipla offered medicines (antiretrovirals) for HIV treatment at a fractional cost (less than $350 per year per patient).|$|E
50|$|When {{comparing}} <b>deferiprone</b> to deferoxamine, {{it should}} be noted that they both bind iron with similar efficiency. However, drugs with different properties are able to access different iron pools. DFP is smaller than deferoxamine and can thus enter cells more easily. Also, at the pH of blood, the affinity of DFP for iron is concentration dependent: at low DFP concentrations, the iron-drug complex breaks down and the iron is donated to another competing ligand. This property accounts for the observed tendency of DFP to redistribute iron in the body. For the same reason, DFP can ‘shuttle’ intracellular iron out to the plasma, and transfer the iron to deferoxamine which goes on to expel it from the body.|$|E
50|$|Stability {{constant}} values are exploited {{in a wide}} variety of applications. Chelation therapy is used in the treatment of various metal-related illnesses, such as iron overload in β-thalassemia sufferers who have been given blood transfusions. The ideal ligand binds to the target metal ion and not to others, but this degree of selectivity is very hard to achieve. The synthetic drug <b>deferiprone</b> achieves selectivity by having two oxygen donor atoms so that it binds to Fe3+ in preference to any of the other divalent ions that are present in the human body, such as Mg2+, Ca2+ and Zn2+. Treatment of poisoning by ions such as Pb2+ and Cd2+ is much more difficult since these are both divalent ions and selectivity is harder to accomplish. Excess copper in Wilson's disease can be removed by penicillamine or Triethylene tetramine (TETA). DTPA has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of plutonium poisoning.|$|E
5000|$|Treatment of {{individuals}} with CDA usually consist of frequent blood transfusions, but this can {{vary depending on the}} type that the individual has. [...] Patients report going every 2-3 weeks for blood transfusions. In addition, they must undertake chelation therapy to survive; either deferoxamine, deferasirox, or <b>deferiprone</b> to eliminate the excess iron that accumulates. Removal of the spleen and gallbladder are common. Hemoglobin levels can run anywhere between 8.0 g/dl and 11.0 g/dl in untransfused patients, the amount of blood received by the patient is not as important as their baseline pre-transfusion hemoglobin level. This is true for ferritin levels and iron levels in the organs as well, it is important for patients to go regularly for transfusions in order to maximize good health, normal ferritin levels run anywhere between 24 and 336 ng/ml, hematologists generally do not begin chelation therapy until ferritin levels reach at least 1000 ng/ml. It is more important to check iron levels in the organs through MRI scans, however, than to simply get regular blood tests to check ferritin levels, which only show a trend, and do not reflect actual organ iron content.|$|E
40|$|<b>Deferiprone</b> is {{indicated}} for “the treatment {{of patients with}} transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes when current chelation therapy is inadequate. ” Safety and effectiveness have not been established in other chronic anemias. Research Questions: 1. How does <b>deferiprone</b> compare to other iron chelation therapy—deferoxamine and deferasirox—in the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassemia syndromes? 2. Is <b>deferiprone</b> safer than deferoxamine or deferasirox? 3. Does <b>deferiprone</b> or the iron chelators reduce morbidity and mortality associated with iron overload in thalassemia? Conclusions: Significant morbidity and mortality are associated with iron overload in patients with thalassemia syndromes. Presently, <b>deferiprone</b> represents the only option for patients for whom deferoxamine and deferasirox are contraindicated or prove to be inadequate in reducing iron burden. There is insufficient evidence to compare the efficacy of <b>deferiprone</b> with the other oral agent, deferasirox. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether <b>deferiprone</b> {{is more effective than}} currently available therapy. Italian guidelines indicate there is no strong evidence <b>deferiprone</b> in monotherapy or in combination with deferoxamine is superior to deferoxamine alone. 1, 2 Accordingly, the FDA has approved <b>deferiprone</b> as second-line therapy for patients with thalassemia syndromes who have had inadequate response with deferoxamine or deferasirox. Furthermore, Italian and U. S. guidelines recommend that clinicians consider <b>deferiprone</b> in combination with deferoxamine as an option in patients with cardiac symptoms or cardiomyopathy...|$|E
