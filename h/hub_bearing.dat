50|$|Pfeffelbach was {{as early}} {{on as the}} Middle Ages already a parish <b>hub.</b> <b>Bearing</b> witness to this is the church {{building}} with its spolia from Roman times that was mentioned in the 1124 document, but which is nonetheless likely much older and might not be Pfeffelbach’s very ﬁrst church building. According to the 1124 document, Pfeffelbach was, along with Konken and Altenglan, one of three chapels of ease of the Church of Kusel, and {{was said to be}} held by the Abbey of Saint-Remi but belonged woth regard to ecclesiastical organization to the Archbishopric of Mainz. After several conversions, only the churchtower was still preserved. Beyond that, {{little is known about the}} Church of Pfeffelbach in Middle Ages. In 1534, the Dukes of Zweibrücken introduced the Reformation. The last Catholic priest was Nikolaus Becker. The ﬁrst Lutheran pastor was said to be Johannes Gelanus, while towards the end of the century, Pastor Heinrich Gossenberger was working in the village, but was generally held to be a drunkard, becoming so well known for this that tales are told about him in Pfeffelbach to this day. Beginning in 1588, Count Palatine Johannes I forced all his subjects to convert to Reformed belief as espoused by John Calvin. In the Saxe-Cobourg Principality of Lichtenberg and later on, in the Prussian Rhine Province, the Protestant church establishment in Pfeffelbach found its way into today’s Evangelical Church in the Rhineland (a full member of the Evangelical Church in Germany). The Duke of Saxe-Cobourg decreed the merger of the two Protestant denominations in 1818, and the decision handed down by a synod in Baumholder in 1820 instituted the “complete union” of the two denominations, Lutheranism and Calvinism. The now united Evangelical Church of the Principality of Lichtenberg belonged in Prussian times after 1834 within the Rhenish Provincial Church to the church district of Sankt Wendel. Fundamentally, this organizational structure remains in place even today. The village’s Roman Catholic Christians belong, in line with their historical development, to the deaconry of Kusel, and they also attend services in Kusel. During the 18th century, the church in Pfeffelbach could also be used simultaneously. In earlier times, a few Jews also lived in the village as the Dukes’ Schutzjuden.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{computationally}} efficient {{finite element}} analysis model of the rotary forging process for assembling a wheel <b>hub</b> <b>bearing</b> assembly is presented. The analysis model is composed of a part of material defined by two artificial planes of symmetry, which is to reduce computational time taken in simulating the holistic process. Three cases of 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° analysis models for simulating rotary forging processes are studied to validate the present {{finite element analysis}} model. The predictions at their planes of symmetry and mid-planes are investigated and compared with the experiments, revealing that the predictions at the mid-planes are in good agreement with the experiments for all the cases while those at the planes of symmetry are to the contrary. Thus, the 60 ° analysis model is recommended for both computational efficiency and solution reliability. With the present finite element analysis model, one hour of computational time with PC can be sufficient enough to obtain valuable information about such rotary forging processes as the wheel <b>hub</b> <b>bearing</b> assembly making process...|$|E

A replaceable circular brush is fixedly mounted on {{the opposite end of the}} standoff support and can be used for cleaning tubes and pipes of various diameters, lengths and configurations. The turbine, standoff support, and brush spin in unison relative to a <b>hub</b> <b>bearing</b> that is fixedly attached to a wire upstream of the assembly.

40|$|The 4 "t"h meeting aims to {{exchange}} {{the experience and}} knowledge of engineers during several presentations and discussions about new developments required for a reliable, time and cost reducing validation of the wheel/hub assembly. Tremendous development of the wheel performance, described by {{the ratio of the}} rated load (kg) versus the wheel weight (kg) had taken place during the last 5000 years. Starting from the ratio of 3 for wooden 2 -piece-disc-wheels in Mesopotamia it needed nearly 1000 years to increase the ratio to approx 5 at light-weight spoke wheels for fighting carriages, found in the grave of king Tutenchamon in Egypt. Modern light alloy wheels of commercial vehicles reach values up to 160 kg/kg. Additionally the comlex design of the modern systems for cars and commercial vehicles comprising wheel, brake, <b>hub,</b> <b>bearing,</b> spindle and hub carrier, including different materials and their treatment, fasteners, press-fits, require an appropriate testing procedure. The variable loading conditions, caused by operational wheel forces, brake and torque moments including heating, may result in changing tolerances and press-fits during operation and consequently in different damage mechanisms. This can be simulated in the Biaxial Wheel Test Machine, whereby corresponding load programs are necessary. An overview about all biaxial test machines in usage at the end of 1999 is shown in the introduction. The total number is 17 for cars, 7 for commercial vehicles and 1 for trains. The six presentations of this meeting were consequently concentrated on: (a) recommendations for a standardization of load programs of the German Wheel Committee, (b) the simulation of brake and torque events and (c) the possibility for a numerical stress analyses and fatigue life assessment.

40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} {{automotive}} sector and stringent safety requirements {{have led to}} the need for more sophisticated feedback mechanisms for the vehicle systems. One of the major breakthrough is anticipated with the use of estimated loads with help of a Load Sensing Bearing. Load Sensing Bearing is a concept in which strain is measured on a <b>hub</b> <b>bearing</b> unit with help of strain gauges and this measured strain is used to estimate the load generated between the road surface and the tire. Different kind of algorithms to estimate the load from the measured strain on a bearing are found in literature. These algorithms are based on the signal analysis and filtering of the measured strain signals. Moreover, the position of strain gauges to measure the strain on bearing are decided based on the intuition. It is expected that if the model of the internal load distribution of a bearing is included in the estimation process, in conjunction with the measured strain, the developed algorithm can give more accurate estimation of a load. A methodological approach of estimating an applied moving load from the measured strain and using the information of a load distribution is developed using a representative beam model. Also, the effect of different parameters affecting the estimation of load is quantified using the strain-load relation. To get an estimation of an applied moving load on an average sense, least square analyses were introduced. It was found that if the information of the uncertainties in parameters is included to estimate the load with help of the Weighted Least Square, the results were significantly improved. Further, in absence of the information about the uncertainty in parameters, usefulness of the iterative reweighting least square – a heuristic least square method – is also checked. Least square methods also gave insight to the suitability of different strain measurement positions by the measure of a goodness of fit. It is concluded that if the information of load distribution and uncertainty in parameter is used, in addition to the measured strain, to estimate the applied moving load; the resulting estimation is accurate up to 2. 5 % with 95 % confidence bounds for a certain strain measurement positions using Weighted Least Square method. This methodology will be useful for further exploration in the field of a Load Sensing Bearing to improve the load estimation and as well as to formulate the optimization strategy for the placement of strain gauges on the bearing.

5000|$|A {{dead axle}} (or <b>hub</b> and <b>bearings)</b> {{is much less}} common than the live axle setup used on most mini choppers. As opposed to a [...] "live" [...] axle, where the axle spins along with the wheel, this axle does not spin. The wheel or <b>hub</b> has {{built-in}} <b>bearings</b> {{to allow it to}} spin.

This allows the engine to be mounted which makes the bike's drive train much more rigid and reliable. There are also other advantages to this type of axle, including the possibility of a cleaner and more attractive rear axle area, but this setup is often more expensive than a live axle and custom parts are much more difficult to locate.|$|R
