5|$|The magician John Nevil Maskelyne {{also criticized}} {{the design of}} the {{experiment}} for taking place under a table. The psychologist Millais Culpin wrote the <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> not scientific and questioned why the <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> done under the table instead of in a more convenient position on top of it. Before the accordion experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the accordion feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's accordion played only two pieces, Home Sweet Home and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E

40|$|The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), a DOE Category A reactor, was {{designed}} to provide an irradiation test environment for conducting a variety of experiments. The ATR Safety Analysis Report, determined by DOE {{to meet the requirements}} of 10 CFR 830, Subpart B, provides versatility in types of <b>experiments</b> that may <b>be</b> conducted. This paper addresses two general types of experiments in the ATR facility and how safety analyses for <b>experiments</b> <b>are</b> related to the ATR safety basis. One type of <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> more routine and generally represents greater risks; therefore this type of <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> addressed with more detail in the safety basis. This allows individual safety analyses for these <b>experiments</b> to <b>be</b> more routine and repetitive. The second type of <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> less defined and is permitted under more general controls. Therefore, individual safety analyses for the second type of <b>experiment</b> tend to <b>be</b> more unique from experiment to <b>experiment.</b> <b>Experiments</b> <b>are</b> also discussed relative to "major modifications" and DOE-STD- 1027 - 92.

5|$|The psychical {{researcher}} Hereward Carrington and spiritualist Herbert Thurston {{have claimed}} the accordion <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> {{not the result}} of deliberate fraud.

5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on {{previous}} shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein structure model.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of condors grew, {{attention}} {{began to focus on}} releasing some back into the wild. In 1988, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America. California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, their numbers are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.|$|E

5|$|Concurrently {{with the}} War of Knives, the United States and France {{were engaged in}} a bout of limited naval warfare in the Caribbean as part of the Quasi-War. In late December 1799 the American armed {{schooner}} <b>Experiment</b> <b>was</b> escorting under convoy the brig Daniel and Mary and the schooners Sea Flower, Mary, and Washington to prevent their capture by French privateers. On 1 January 1800, the convoy was caught in a dead calm off {{the north side of the}} present-day Haitian island of Gonâve, in the Bight of Leogane. Seeing the convoy becalmed, Rigaud sent eleven armed barges out to attack and seize the American vessels.|$|E
