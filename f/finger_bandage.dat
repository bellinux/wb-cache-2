5|$|On January 7, 1989, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center {{to repair a}} Dupuytren's contracture of the ring finger of his left hand. The surgery lasted {{for more than three}} hours and was performed under regional anesthesia. This procedure was done just thirteen days before he left office. For this reason he had a hand and <b>finger</b> <b>bandage</b> the day of his farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5000|$|The police {{thought she}} had been murdered {{elsewhere}} and later dragged into the undergrowth alongside the road. Her remains were examined by Sir Bernard Spilsbury, who discovered coal dust and candle wax on the girl's body, {{as well as a}} piece of ammonia-stained <b>finger</b> <b>bandage</b> lodged against her inner elbow, which had likely dislodged from the hand of her murderer as he deposited her body.|$|E

50|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine in September 2015, Fallon explained that his finger still had limited mobility and that another surgery would be required. He reiterated this point at the 67th Emmy Awards on September 20, 2015, where he appeared in public without his <b>finger</b> <b>bandaged</b> for the first time.|$|R
50|$|He {{eventually}} acquired {{and founded}} many textile factories {{and other companies}} through his company, the Kendall Company, which emphasized product research and scientific processes. His company produced products such as Curity Diapers and Curad <b>finger</b> <b>bandages</b> (those brands are now owned by Covidien). He first turned around the Lewis Manufacturing Company in Walpole and then purchased the manufacturing village of Slatersville, Rhode Island where the Kendall Dean School was named in his honor. Kendall Company produced textiles {{for the government and}} Red Cross during World War I and expanded throughout the twentieth century acquiring manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico.|$|R

50|$|Over a {{thousand}} people were questioned about the murder of Vera Page, with one individual stating that during the very early morning of 15 December, she had seen a man fitting the description of one Percy Orlando Rush pushing a wheelbarrow covered with a red table-cloth {{in the direction of}} Addison Road. Rush quickly became the prime suspect. He was a forty-year-old married man, who worked as a flannel washer in a nearby launderette, and in this occupation he had regularly come into contact with ammonia. Furthermore, he had injured a finger on his left hand in his workplace less than a week prior to Page's murder, and freely admitted to having worn a <b>finger</b> <b>bandage</b> since this date. Unremarked upon at the February, 1932 inquest into Page's murder was the fact that Rush had been previously found guilty of exposing himself to girls.|$|E
50|$|Filming {{occurred}} at the Fox studio and at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. During filming, Donlevy injured his hand, necessitating that two <b>fingers</b> be <b>bandaged.</b> The bandaged hand had to be concealed throughout filming, though it is visible {{at the end of}} the film. Former stars of the silent era Jack Mulhall, Joyce Compton and Mary McLaren have uncredited bit parts.|$|R
50|$|In July 2011, 2 {{days before}} the band was due to perform at Obscene Extreme Festival, guitarist Tim Carley severed {{the end of the}} 5th finger of his left hand in an accident. After some {{reconstructive}} surgery the same day, the band announced all the summer's festival dates would go ahead as planned, albeit with Carley's damaged <b>finger</b> heavily <b>bandaged.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Sore froat," [...] said Florry, in a whisper, {{trying to}} insert her two chubby <b>fingers</b> between the <b>bandage</b> and her chin. [...] "I mussent go outer the garden patch!

60|$|For {{three hours}} more, alone with this gruesome companion, Chris held the Sophie Sutherland before {{the wind and}} sea. He had long since {{forgotten}} his mangled <b>fingers.</b> The <b>bandages</b> had been torn away, and the cold, salt spray had eaten into the half-healed wounds until they were numb and no longer pained. But he was not cold. The terrific labor of steering forced the perspiration from every pore. Yet he was faint and weak with hunger and exhaustion, and hailed with delight the advent on deck of the captain, who fed him all of a pound of cake-chocolate. It strengthened him at once.|$|R
50|$|Since Papa Smurf is sick, Doctor Smurf {{gets more}} work, for example bandaging Jokey Smurf who has accidentally {{hammered}} his own <b>finger</b> (and ends <b>bandaging</b> everything {{save for the}} finger), and recommends three or five potions to each Smurf (save for Grouchy Smurf who, as expected, hates Doctor Smurf and his potions, and hates those Smurfs who drink potions to get better even though they aren't sick).|$|R
500|$|McG said he {{felt the}} appeal of the series was its mix of an [...] "Office style comedy" [...] and an action series, and added that Chuck's work place [...] "is {{designed}} to be as dangerous as the spy world." [...] Although Chuck's apartment is set in Echo Park, the pilot was shot in El Cabrillo in Hollywood. [...] After the series was picked up, the apartment and the building's courtyard were re-created on a Warner Bros. soundstage. The exterior shots of the Burbank Buy More where Chuck and Morgan work are of a former Mervyn's store in the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park. Chuck's <b>fingers</b> are <b>bandaged</b> at one point due to injuries Zachary Levi sustained while playing Call of Duty.|$|R
6000|$|An {{interval}} elapsed, and {{he heard}} a sound below like the rustling sound of a woman's dress. It advanced up the stairs, and stopped. A female scream rent the atmosphere of guilt. A man's voice below exclaimed [...] "Hullo!" [...] A man's feet ascended the stairs. Mr. Godfrey felt Christian <b>fingers</b> unfastening his <b>bandage,</b> and extracting his gag. He looked in amazement at two respectable strangers, and faintly articulated, [...] "What does it mean?" [...] The two respectable strangers looked back, and said, [...] "Exactly the question {{we were going to}} ask YOU." ...|$|R
50|$|On July 27, 2008, Honky Tonk Man {{almost had}} {{the index finger}} {{of his right hand}} severed during a public {{appearance}} in Canada before an Ultimate Championship Wrestling show in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. He was making an appearance at Boston Pizza in Charlottetown several hours before the show when someone wanted to take a photo with him with both men clashing guitars. When the guitars collided, the neck of Honky Tonk Man's guitar turned and sliced into Honky Tonk Man's finger, almost severing it. Honky was immediately taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital where doctors stitched the <b>finger</b> and <b>bandaged</b> it. Honky made his appearance at the Ultimate Championship Wrestling show several hours later. He was unable to wrestle his scheduled match due to the injury and was replaced by Trash Canyon, whom he managed from ringside. Honky Tonk Man, although injured and in obvious pain, sang his theme song twice in the ring.|$|R
60|$|My {{hands had}} been dressed twice or thrice in the night, {{and again in}} the morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the <b>fingers.</b> It was <b>bandaged,</b> of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a cloak, loose over my {{shoulders}} and fastened at the neck. My hair had been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concerns}} {{as with any}} other application of biometrics for identification and authentication can be manifold. There is, for example, the possibility of voter disenfranchisement when characteristics typically used to identify or verify voters might become unavailable (e.g. <b>bandaged</b> <b>finger,</b> loss of a finger, failure to acquire due to dirt or fingerprint quality degradation). Similarly, there are also claims of potential logistical and procedural [...] "new problems" [...] that biometric identification devices can bring to an election cycle: increasing costs (initial purchase costs of biometric readers and infrastructure, costs linked to maintenance, storage and upgrades) and resources' allocation (human, time, material); additional training of commissions and polling staff, technological failures that could disenfranchise voters; and extra data storage that demands higher security.|$|R
500|$|On the {{subsequent}} Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen generally interspersed hard-rocking song sequences after {{every three or}} four numbers in order to give Weinberg's hands a chance to recover. Weinberg's wife Becky unintentionally triggered one of the tour's most celebrated episodes. She was a fan of the This Week with David Brinkley television program and invited panelist George Will to the Washington-area Capital Centre show. After seeing the band perform, Will became convinced that they were exemplars of hard-working patriotism and traditional American values; he wrote, [...] "... consider Max Weinberg's <b>bandaged</b> <b>fingers.</b> [...] The rigors of drumming have led to five tendonitis operations. He soaks his hands in hot water before a concert, in ice afterward, and sleeps with tight gloves on." [...] Will further decided that Springsteen might endorse Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential campaign and talked to the campaign, which later led to Reagan's famous extolling of Springsteen at a stop in Hammonton, New Jersey and Springsteen's subsequent negative response.|$|R
60|$|Vainly did Antonina, in {{the midst}} of the despair that still possessed her, yearn for a word from his lips or a glance from his eyes; vainly did her {{trembling}} <b>fingers,</b> tearing the <b>bandages</b> from her robe, stanch the blood on his wounded hands; vainly did her voice call on him to fly and summon help from his companions in the camp! His mind was far away, brooding over the legends of the battle-fields of his ancestors, remembering how, even in the day of victory, they slew themselves if they were crippled in the fray, how they scorned to exist for other interests than the interests of strife, how they mutilated traitors as Goisvintha had mutilated him! Such were the objects that enchained his inward faculties, while his outward senses were still enthralled by the horrible fascination that existed for him in the presence of the assassin by his side. His very consciousness of his existence, though he moved and breathed, seemed to have ceased.|$|R
50|$|On 2 April, Lill-Erik {{walks over}} to Olga in class 5 C and asks to get together, and then tells her it's just an April fool. Olga replies with {{reminding}} him such jokes are only allowed on 1 April. During Easter Bert notices his old female friend Paulina in town, and Björna throws snuff after her and blames it on Bert. Lill-Erik is not in sight, fearing the Easter Bunny. After the Easter break, Bert notices Emilia accidentally having cut herself in her finger during the break, and walks towards her pat her lightly on her hand and say something kind, when he accidentally gets stuck with his own <b>finger</b> in the <b>bandage,</b> and removes his finger, which brings Emilia's thumb with him, which goes bent backward and swaged. Emilia is required {{to go with her}} arm in esmarch bandage for weeks, and words can't describe how much Bert wants to apologize, and instead he just walks away.|$|R
