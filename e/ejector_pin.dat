25|$|The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated {{mechanism}} normally {{found in}} rifles, {{as opposed to}} the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The slide which acts as the bolt carrier has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The slide rides rearward on two rails {{on either side of the}} barrel, both with action springs around them, with a large pin inside the camming surface in the rear of the bolt that causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. A cylindrical mechanism on the left side of the bolt, called the bolt stabilizer assembly, prevents the bolt from rotating freely as the slide moves, enabling it to align correctly with the barrel again as the slide moves it forward. The spring loaded <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and releases tension from the ejector, causing the case to fly out, becoming released from the extractor claw in the process. The slide reaches its rear-most travel, then rides forward again under tension of the springs around the slide rails, the bottom lug of the bolt pushes a new round into the chamber, then the bolt locks up and the gun can be fired again once the trigger is released.|$|E

One of the main drawbacks of the process is the tendency of the tools to be damaged during part ejection 1. At De Montfort University a successful AIM™ moulding cycle has been developed in which simple shapes from polypropylene are produced and the ejection forces required are measured. Two different ejection methods are used; one uses conventional <b>ejector</b> <b>pins</b> and the other uses a conformal ejector pad. The tool surface roughness is measured before and after moulding to observe any changes caused by ejection. Results show that <b>ejector</b> <b>pins</b> require a lower ejection force than a conformal ejector pad and this may contribute to longer tool life for the AIM™ process. Possible reasons for the results are discussed along with recommendations for further work...|$|R

These kits are usually available under the Pit-Road label in Japan {{and under the}} Trumpeter label {{in the rest of}} the world.Trumpeter's ship models have included a rising number of parts, but quality is still disputed due to insufficient research and some recent releases have been over-engineered.

50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a roller locked bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker sleeve, bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the <b>ejector</b> <b>pin.</b> This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|E

Die casting is often encountered with many problems, few of such problems are blowholes, improper filling, scratch marks, weld lines, cracks, cold shut, porosity, blisters, <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> marks, etc. usually these defects are caused due to improper design of dies, or due to incorrect parameters such as injection pressure, cycle time, cooling circuits and other such parameters.
