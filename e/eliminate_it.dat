5|$|Batavian {{control of}} the Dutch Cape Colony was a serious risk to British {{shipping}} rounding the Cape of Good Hope, and a substantial force under Sir George Keith Elphinstone was sent from Britain to <b>eliminate</b> <b>it.</b> Arriving in early August, Elphinstone initially attempted to intimidate the governor into surrender, but eventually authorised a landing at Simon's Town. On 7 August the expeditionary force fought a skirmish at Muizenberg and clashes continued throughout August. A major Dutch attack on 3 September was forestalled {{by the arrival of}} a large fleet of Indiamen carrying British reinforcements, and as these troops came ashore the outnumbered Dutch surrendered. A much-delayed Batavian expeditionary force, sent to retake {{control of the}} Cape, arrived in August 1796, but was out-manoeuvered and forced to surrender by Elphinstone at the Capitulation of Saldanha Bay.|$|E
5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to <b>eliminate</b> <b>it</b> from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.|$|E

25|$|Orgasm {{disorders}} are persistent delays {{or absence of}} orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase in at least 75 percent of sexual encounters. The disorder can have physical, psychological, or pharmacological origins. SSRI antidepressants are a common pharmaceutical culprit, as they can delay orgasm or <b>eliminate</b> <b>it</b> entirely. A common physiological culprit of anorgasmia is menopause, where one in three women report problems obtaining an orgasm during sexual stimulation following menopause.|$|E

25|$|This method {{starts to}} fail when the noise source {{is close to}} the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more {{strongly}} and the common-mode rejection of the receiver will fail to <b>eliminate</b> <b>it.</b> This problem is especially apparent in telecommunication cables where pairs in the same cable lie next to each other for many miles. One pair can induce crosstalk in another and it is additive {{along the length of the}} cable. Twisting the pairs counters this effect as on each half twist the wire nearest to the noise-source is exchanged.|$|E

25|$|As for the Russian Orthodox Church, Soviet {{authorities}} {{sought to}} control it and, in times of national crisis, to exploit it for the regime's own purposes; but their ultimate goal was to <b>eliminate</b> <b>it.</b> During {{the first five years}} of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests. Many others were imprisoned or exiled. Believers were harassed and persecuted. Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited. By 1941 only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence prior to World War I.|$|E
25|$|Some suburbs number their east-west {{streets in}} a {{continuation}} of the Chicago pattern, and even more number their houses according to the Chicago grid. A few suburbs also number their north-south avenues according to the Chicago grid, although such numbering vanished from Chicago itself long ago (the alphabetical naming scheme was devised to help <b>eliminate</b> <b>it).</b> For example, the 54th/Cermak terminus of the Pink Line is located near the intersection of 54th Avenue and Cermak Road (22nd Street) in Cicero. This is 54 blocks west of State Street in Chicago. A minor street 54½ blocks west of State Street would be called 54th Court.|$|E
25|$|Many psychometricians {{are also}} {{concerned}} with finding and eliminating test bias from their psychological tests. Test bias {{is a form}} of systematic (i.e., non-random) error which leads to examinees from one demographic group having an unwarranted advantage over examinees from another demographic group. According to leading experts, test bias may cause differences in average scores across demographic groups, but differences in group scores are not sufficient evidence that test bias is actually present because the test could be measuring real differences among groups. Psychometricians use sophisticated scientific methods to search for test bias and <b>eliminate</b> <b>it.</b> Research shows that it is usually impossible for people reading a test item to accurately determine whether it is biased or not.|$|E

25|$|The Left Bipod Foam Ramp is an {{approximately}} three-foot (one-meter) long aerodynamic component made {{entirely of}} foam. The foam, not normally {{considered to be}} a structural material, is required to bear some aerodynamic loads. Because of these special requirements, the casting-in-place and curing of the ramps may be performed only by a senior technician. The bipod ramp (having left and right sides) was originally designed to reduce aerodynamic stresses around the bipod attachment points at the external tank, but it was proven unnecessary {{in the wake of the}} accident and was removed from the external tank design for tanks flown after STS-107 (another foam ramp along the liquid oxygen line was also later removed from the tank design to <b>eliminate</b> <b>it</b> as a foam debris source, after analysis and tests proved this change safe).|$|E
25|$|Rumsfeld {{resigned}} from Congress in 1969– his fourth term– to serve President Richard Nixon in his administration, {{and he would}} serve {{in a variety of}} executive branch positions throughout the Nixon presidency. In 1969, Nixon sought to reform and reorganize the United States Office of Economic Opportunity, an organization created during the Kennedy administration and greatly expanded as a part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs, rather than <b>eliminate</b> <b>it</b> outright. He appointed Rumsfeld Director of the organization with Cabinet rank. Rumsfeld had voted against the creation of OEO when he was in Congress, and initially rejected Nixon's offer, citing his own inherent belief that the OEO did more harm than good, and he felt that he was not the right person for the job. He only accepted after personal pleas from the president.|$|E
25|$|King Frederick's broad {{strategy}} {{had three}} parts. First, {{he meant to}} seize Saxony and <b>eliminate</b> <b>it</b> {{as a threat to}} Prussia, then use the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into Bohemia, where he might set up winter quarters at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade Moravia from Silesia, seize the fortress at Olmütz, and advance on Vienna to force an end to the war. To begin, Frederick divided his army in three: he placed a small force under Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt in East Prussia to guard against any Russian invasion from the east; he stationed Field Marshal Count Kurt von Schwerin in Silesia with 25,000 soldiers to deter incursions from Moravia and Hungary; finally, he personally led the main Prussian army into Saxony.|$|E

25|$|Yugoslavia and Greece were invaded in April 1941, {{and both}} {{countries}} surrendered {{before the end}} of the month. Germany and Italy divided Greece into occupation zones, but did not <b>eliminate</b> <b>it</b> as a country. Yugoslavia was dismembered, with regions in the north being annexed by Germany and regions along the coast were made part of Italy. The rest of the country was divided into a puppet state of Croatia, which was nominally an ally of Germany, and Serbia, which was governed by a combination of military and police administrators. There were approximately 80,000 Jews in Yugoslavia when it was invaded. The ruling party in Croatia, the Ustashe, not only killed Jews, but murdered and expelled Orthodox Christian Serbs and Muslims. One difference between the Germans and the Croatians was the fact that the Ustashe allowed its Jewish and Serbian victims to convert to Catholicism so they could escape death. Serbia was declared free of Jews in August 1942.|$|E
25|$|On November 17, 1975, {{the police}} began to set forth action {{in order to}} bring down the {{powerful}} Dubois Brothers; they established police task forces and began pressuring the Brothers. After some time the pressure began to deteriorate the Dubois Brothers organization through undercover operations and some of the organizations most notorious and loyal associates began to slip away, become informants or had met violent deaths. The papers and police began stating that never before has the criminal underworld’s law of silence been broken by so many criminals, especially those who were so loyal to the organizations core. Among these numerous informants was Donald Lavoie {{who was one of the}} Dubois Brothers most trusted hitman whose previous occupation had been to eliminate anyone suspected of snitching as well as anyone who they told him to <b>eliminate.</b> <b>It</b> was Donald Lavoie who played the biggest part in the fall of the Dubois Brothers power, when Claude Dubois who had put a bounty on Lavoie’s head, which he just nearly escaped, forcing Lavoie to testify for protection.|$|E
25|$|General medical {{complications}} of mastopexy include bleeding, infection, and the secondary {{effects of the}} anaesthesia. Specific complications include skin necrosis, and dysesthesia, abnormal changes in sensation (numbness and tingling). Serious medical complications include occurrences of seroma, a pocket of locally accumulated serous fluid, and occurrences of hematoma, a local accumulation of blood outside the vascular system. Necrosis of the nipple and necrosis of the skin flap (or both), when it occurs, can either be partial, and heal imperceptibly with wound care, or can be complete, and necessitate reconstruction. A complication of the Anchor mastopexy is the tension-caused wound breakdown at the junction of the three limbs of the incision, yet the scars usually heal without undergoing hypertrophy. Asymmetry of the bust is usually present pre-operatively, and the breast-lift surgery usually does not definitively <b>eliminate</b> <b>it,</b> regardless of the applied mastopexy technique or of the plastic surgeon’s operative expertise. Moreover, a combined mastopexy–breast augmentation procedure can make the surgical revision of breast asymmetry more difficult because of the overstretched tissues of nipple-areola complex. Moreover, a possible, undesirable outcome of the periareolar mastopexy (circumareolar incision) is the underprojection of the corrected breast from the chest wall.|$|E
