Regional and Remote areas were mainly unchanged {{as a result of}} the strategic review and typically receive a service using either Fixed Wireless, using LTE technology, or Satellite.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} higher {{bandwidth}} by customers urges <b>the</b> network providers <b>to</b> upgrade their networks. <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home or <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> curb {{are two of}} the scenarios that are considered. To make a proper assessment on the economic viability, a good estimation of the roll-out costs of the networks are important. Geometric models are easy to use for this estimation, but can be inaccurate. In this paper a new method <b>to</b> enhance <b>the</b> parameters of the geometric model is presented. The performance of this method is shown in comparison with geographic models on real cases both for <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Home as for <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Curb...|$|R

30|$|Fibre based {{networks}} are usually implemented using two infrastructures, <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home (FTTH) and <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> node (FTTN). FTTH {{takes advantage of}} a potential unlimited spectrum, whereas FTTN uses VDSL 2 technology in the last 1000 m <b>to</b> reutilise <b>the</b> operator’s available copper technology. This avoids the need for trenching <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> every home, thus reducing cost, while offering a competitive quality of service. XG-Fast technology can be considered <b>to</b> replace <b>the</b> VDSL 2 in the FTTN scheme.|$|R
