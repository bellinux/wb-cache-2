5|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode was conceived from a joke among Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone about a fish dressed as motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually turned into a joke about Kanye West not understanding a joke about why liking fishsticks made him a gay fish. The way Cartman tries to steal credit for the <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> inspired by real people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business.|$|E
5|$|The regimental colours of green, red and yellow, {{which appear}} on the regimental tie and Stable belt, were decided on in the late 19th century. One officer (who was also a Conservative MP) {{suggested}} green with a red stripe, but this was objected to because it {{was similar to the}} Rifle Brigade. Another officer (a Liberal MP) suggested adding yellow, which was agreed. The <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> that red and yellow were Liberal colours, and the Liberal MP got away with this under his rival's nose.|$|E

50|$|Viola <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> a {{category}} of <b>jokes</b> which <b>are</b> directed towards violas and viola players. The <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> thought to have originated from the 18th century when {{the part of the}} viola was very uncomplicated and often just a filler part, thus attracting musicians who were not usually very talented musically.|$|R
5|$|With the plane, {{they land}} {{on an island}} which has the source for every dirty joke ever made, the base looks similar to a temple-compound from the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. The base is {{inhabited}} with many great minds including Warren Buffett (who was in a deleted scene on the DVD), Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking where they pass their time writing the world's dirty jokes. It is shown that the first dead baby <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> written {{in the era of}} Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, {{along with}} George Pope Morris, the weekly New York Mirror as the daily Evening Mirror in 1844 with a weekly {{supplement}} called the Weekly Mirror, {{in part due}} to the rising cost of postage. By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was Germany's version of N. P. Willis) {{and one of the first}} commercially successful magazine writers in America. In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book The Opal founded by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year, a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary.|$|E

50|$|Identified {{as one of}} {{the simple}} forms of oral {{literature}} by the Dutch linguist , <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> passed along anonymously. They are told in both private and public settings; a single person tells a joke to his friend in the natural flow of conversation, or a set of <b>jokes</b> <b>is</b> told to a group as part of scripted entertainment. <b>Jokes</b> <b>are</b> also passed along in written form or, more recently, through the internet.|$|R
5000|$|The British <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> said to {{have been}} laid to rest when [...] "Peace broke out" [...] {{at the end of the}} war, and {{countries}} agree to a Joke Warfare ban at the Geneva Convention.

5|$|The {{day after}} {{having sex with}} Tammy, Ron comes to work wearing a red shirt and black pants, which prompts Tom to observe that Ron always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex. This <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in the news in November 2009. Andy {{is said to have}} auditioned for the reality {{television}} show Survivor and the television game show Deal or No Deal. During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish to prove he could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though the action is far more appropriate for Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy said she would rather be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|The early stories present Valérian as {{a typical}} square-jawed hero figure, who is strong and {{dependable}} (although an early running <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> that despite being a time-traveller he is always running late, especially when summoned by his boss). However, as the series progresses, he is increasingly portrayed as somewhat knuckle-headed. In World Without Stars (Le Pays sans étoile), he gets recklessly drunk on the colonists' home-made booze, in On the False Earths (Sur les terres truquées), the historian, Jadna, views him as useful only as cannon fodder and nothing else while in Heroes of the Equinox (Les Héros de l'Equinoxe), he comes across as woefully inadequate compared with the champions he is competing against. Although devoted to Laureline, he has been led astray by other women, such as in Heroes of the Equinox and Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} {{animation}} and includes several in-jokes about The Simpsons and the animation industry in general. In a scene depicting the Itchy & Scratchy writer's lounge, {{each of the}} writers shown is a caricature of someone working on The Simpsons at the time. The <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> conceived by the show's animators. Later in the episode, Roger Meyers fires a Harvard alumnus who resembles Simpsons writer Jon Vitti. At the awards ceremony, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{is shown in the}} audience. Lisa is also seen reading a book titled How to Get Rich Writing Cartoons by John Swartzwelder, a Simpsons writer credited with nearly sixty episodes of the show. The credits at the end of Bart and Lisa's Itchy & Scratchy episode (shown in very small print) are a copy of the credits at the end of The Simpsons.|$|E

5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman <b>jokes</b> <b>were</b> told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the <b>jokes</b> <b>were</b> told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The <b>jokes</b> have <b>been</b> studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|R

The same <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> rated significantly higher when presented by the robot. We also let one robot tell a joke and have one more robot either laugh, boo, or do nothing. Laughing and booing is significantly funnier than no reaction, {{though there was no}} significant difference between laughing and booing. ...|$|R
25|$|Originally {{the knight}} {{characters}} {{were going to}} ride real horses, but after {{it became clear that}} the film's small budget precluded real horses, the Pythons decided that their characters would mime horse-riding while their porters trotted behind them banging coconut shells together. The <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> derived from the old-fashioned sound effect used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering. This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as Die Ritter der Kokosnuß ('The Knights of the Coconut').|$|E
25|$|The third HMS Black <b>Joke</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} {{built in}} Baltimore in 1824, becoming the Brazilian slave ship Henriquetta. The Royal Navy captured her in September 1827 and purchased {{her into the}} service. The Navy re-named her Black Joke, after an English song of the same name, and assigned her to the West Africa Squadron (or Preventative Squadron). Her role was to chase down slave ships, and over her five-year career she freed many hundreds of slaves. The Navy deliberately burnt her in May 1832 because her timbers had rotted {{to the point that}} she was no longer fit for active service.|$|E
25|$|On 2 April a Spanish 14-gun brig {{fired on}} Black Joke as she {{approached}} the brig. After two hours of exchanging shots, and after suffering several casualties, the brig hoisted a flag of truce. She {{turned out to be}} the Providentia, of 14 guns and a crew of 80 men. She had fired on the Black Joke as Providentias captain had been warned that a Colombian privateer answering to the same description as Black <b>Joke</b> <b>was</b> in the area. Turner therefore released her. Black Joke suffered no casualties; Providentia had numerous of her crew killed and wounded.|$|E
