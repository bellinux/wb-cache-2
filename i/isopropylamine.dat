Moreover, after 24 hours of treatment with [ZnCl 2 (<b>isopropylamine)</b> 2] under the above-mentioned conditions, 70 % of the initial enzymatic activity is still retained by catalase extracts while the activity of control untreated extracts drops to 17 % of the initial value.

Moreover, [ZnCl 2 (<b>isopropylamine)</b> 2] induces precipitation of a large amount of contaminant proteins present in the catalase extracts.

40|$|International audiencePseudomonas sp. strain KIE 171 {{was able}} to grow with <b>isopropylamine</b> or L-alaninol [S-(+) - 2 -amino- 1 -propanol] as the sole carbon source, but not with D-alaninol. To {{investigate}} the hypothesis that L-alaninol is an intermediate in the degradation of <b>isopropylamine,</b> two mini-Tn 5 mutants unable to utilize both <b>isopropylamine</b> and L-alaninol were isolated. Whereas mutant KIE 171 -BI transformed <b>isopropylamine</b> to L-alaninol, mutant KIE 171 -BII failed to do so. The two genes containing a transposon insertion were cloned, and the DNA regions flanking the insertions were sequenced. Two clusters, one comprising eight ipu (<b>isopropylamine</b> utilization) genes (ipuABCDEFGH) and the other encompassing two genes (ipuI and orf 259), were identified. Comparisons of sequences of the deduced Ipu proteins {{and those in the}} database suggested that <b>isopropylamine</b> is transported into the cytoplasm by a putative permease, IpuG. The next step, the formation of gamma-glutamyl-isopropylamide from <b>isopropylamine,</b> ATP, and L-glutamate, was shown to be catalyzed by IpuC, a gamma-glutamylamide synthetase. gamma-Glutamyl-isopropylamide is then subjected to stereospecific monooxygenation by the hypothetical four-component system IpuABDE, thereby yielding gamma-glutamyl-L-alaninol [gamma(L-glutamyl) -L-hydroxy-isopropylamide].

Presumably, L-alaninol is oxidized by an alcohol dehydrogenase to yield L- 2 -aminopropionaldehyde or it is deaminated by an ammonia lyase to propionaldehyde.

40|$|Glyphosate {{is noted}} for being {{non-toxic}} in fishes, {{birds and mammals}} (including humans). Nevertheless, the degree of genotoxicity is seriously controversial. In this work, various concentrations of a glyphosate <b>isopropylamine</b> salt were tested using two methods of genotoxicity assaying, viz., the pink mutation assay with Tradescantia (4430) and the comet assay with nuclei from staminal cells of the same plant. Staminal nuclei were studied in two different forms, namely nuclei from exposed plants, and nuclei exposed directly. Using the pink mutation assay, <b>isopropylamine</b> induced a total or partial loss of color in staminal cells, a fundamental criterion utilized in this test. Consequently, its use is not recommended when studying genotoxicity with agents that produce pallid staminal cells.
