These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep.

Shuffling <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> significant factor, t[*]=[*]−[*] 4.65, p[*]<[*]. 001 {{with a negative}} coefficient, indicating that shuffling the films, i.e., disturbing the narrative flow of the media, reduced the RT, in other words unshuffled films are more engaging than shuffled films. The choice of film itself <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> significant factor, t[*]=[*] 3.14, p[*]<[*]. 002, RTs were overall slower for About Time than The Good. This suggests that different films and hence different prolonged activities will lead to different attentional profiles. In terms of the audio, the loudness of the sound track (RMS), <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> significant factor, t[*]=[*] 4.92, p[*]<[*]. 001, the louder the film the longer the RT. This is indicative that audio <b>is</b> <b>an</b> engaging experience for the participant, but also might indicate that the loudness of the audio may mask the tone.|$|R
