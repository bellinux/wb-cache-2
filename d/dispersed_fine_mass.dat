The system utilizes the principle of virtual impactors to concentrate ambient particles in the size range 0. 1 - 2. 5 microns (aerodynamic diameter; dp) by drawing them {{through a series of}} three virtual impactors. Each impactor contains the majority of ambient <b>fine</b> <b>mass</b> (dp < 2. 5 microns aerodynamic diameter) in a bleed flow (minor flow) that is 20 % of the total flow entering the virtual impactor.

Two kinds of long-fibre fractions are studied, thermo-mechanical pulp and chemical softwood pulp. Fibre and <b>fines</b> <b>mass</b> fraction ranges are 0. 25 – 1. 0 % and 0 – 0. 75 %, respectively.

40|$|A {{chemical}} {{mass balance}} receptor model based on organic compounds {{has been developed}} that relates source contributions to airborne <b>fine</b> particle <b>mass</b> concentrations. Source contributions to the concentrations of specific organic compounds are revealed as well. The model is applied to four air quality monitoring sites in southern California using atmospheric organic compound concentration data and source test data collected specifically {{for the purpose of}} testing this model. The contributions of up to nine primary particle source types can be separately identified in ambient samples based on this method, and approximately 85 % of the organic fine aerosol is assigned to primary sources on an annual average basis. The model provides information on source contributions to <b>fine</b> <b>mass</b> concentrations, <b>fine</b> organic aerosol concentrations and individual organic compound concentrations. The largest primary source contributors to <b>fine</b> particle <b>mass</b> concentrations in Los Angeles are found to include diesel engine exhaust, paved road dust, gasoline-powered vehicle exhaust, plus emissions from food cooking and wood smoke, with smaller contribution from tire dust, plant fragments, natural gas combustion aerosol, and cigarette smoke.

These attributes include the seasonal dynamics of <b>fine</b> root <b>mass</b> and length, the depth distribution of fine roots, fine root width and, most importantly, the annual appearance and disappearance of fine roots. The principal objectives {{of this study}} were two-fold: (1) to compare these attributes of fine roots between plant communities and (2) to compare the results of the two methods used to quantify the attributes: (1) harvesting roots from forest soil with soil cores and (2) photographing roots growing against the windows of minirhizotron boxes. The plant communities that were sampled are characteristic of the region and are designated as follows from lowest elevation (782 m) to highest elevation (1347 m) : (1) xeric ridge, (2) cove hardwoods, (3) low elevation mixed oak, (4) high elevation mixed oak, and (5) northern hardwoods. <b>Fine</b> root <b>mass</b> varies seasonally in this temperate region with lowest and highest mass in the spring and autumn, respectively. <b>Fine</b> root <b>mass</b> and <b>fine</b> root <b>mass</b> appearance were lowest in the cove hardwood community and highest in the low elevation mixed oak community. The total length of fine roots was highest in the xeric ridge community and lowest in the low elevation mixed oak community. The high total root length in the xeric ridge community was due to the presence of an exceptionally dense mat of very fine roots found there.

The comparatively fine austenite grain size was due to both Ti-Nb precipitates and solute Nb. The Charpy V-notch (CVN) testing revealed that the HTP steel exhibited excellent toughness in CGHAZ, which was indicated by the low ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT).
