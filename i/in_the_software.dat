Many plug-ins for Plex Media Server leverage WebKit to display videos from online sources using the same Adobe Flash and Silverlight players that the sources provide for web browsers. This basically means that the server needs to render the streaming video on an offscreen WebKit canvas before capturing it, transcoding it and streaming it to the server. This software chain sometimes causes issues depending on the server configuration, and on the version of the app <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> chain.|$|E
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{the status of}} determining the components of observable modeling that may need upgrading in navigation software {{to take advantage of}} the higher accuracy potentially available through 32 -GHz (Ka-band) range, Doppler, and delta-differential one-way ranging (delta-DOR) measurements. Areas inves-tigated include (1) high-precision station-location models, (2) Earth-orientation models, (3) a light-time solution, and (4) spacecraft dynamics modeling. JPL soft-ware used for radio very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) applications in geody-namics and astrometry was a reference for high-accuracy station-location models, and JPL software used in precision gravity-field determination provided other in-sights to improved observable modeling. The study reveals that station-location models <b>in</b> <b>the</b> navigation <b>software</b> are complete to the centimeter level, with the exception of the ocean loading and diurnal and semi-diurnal variations in UT 1 and polar motion. Since the last updates to <b>the</b> station-location models <b>in</b> <b>the</b> navigation <b>software</b> (1991), it has been established that there are additional centimeter-level models of tidal terms in UT 1 and polar motion that should be added. Improvements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light-time solution implemented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gravity-reduction <b>software</b> should be realized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next-generation navigation <b>software,</b> <b>in</b> which extended numerical precision in representing time exists.
