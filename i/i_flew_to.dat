Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. <b>I</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not care what the world thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her and kissed her. That was not being done in 1961." ...|$|E

Musician said about the album: [...] "Loup Garou is subtle in nuance but staggering in scope, it connects the dots between all of the artist's sacrosanct influences, often {{within the framework of}} a single song... All of it is on the money, performed from the heart..." [...] Loup Garou featured a duet with Brenda Lee; DeVille said: [...] "She didn't know who the hell I was. I just called her up, played the song for her, and she loved it. She had her business people check me out, and they reported that I was big in Europe and had been recording for twenty years. So <b>I</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Nashville ... That's got to go down in my book {{as one of the most}} memorable experiences in my career." ...|$|E

2500|$|Digital Spy asked Scherzinger to {{describe}} Killer Loves sound, {{during an interview}} she replied said [...] "the album is largely produced by RedOne, I wanted something explosive that could be staged live in a full performance and I needed music to match the intensity. That's what he did. It's raw, dangerous and big. That's what I {{want to be on}} stage. It's a different energy to Lady Gaga. The music is more rock, funk and soul inspired." [...] Killer Love sees Scherzinger duet with two male vocalists. On the ballad, [...] "Power's Out", she duets with English recording artist Sting. Speaking of their collaboration, which took place with both singers in the same studio, Scherzinger said [...] " [...] energy is very commanding, in a subtle way. He is giving, generous and kind. <b>I</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Boston for his show with The Police. I met him and he was everything and more than I thought. I felt like we were doing yoga when we were singing. He was such an easy guy to work with... Singing on the same mic you are really close. He had fresh breath. No broccoli in the teeth." [...] David Renshaw from PopDash said the song borrowed elements and the sound from The Police, a band Sting was previously lead singer of, and in particular their 1983 hit single [...] "Every Breath You Take". The other duet is with Enrique Iglesias, on his 2010 single [...] "Heartbeat". The version featured on Killer Love is the [...] "Rude Well's Open Heart Remix".
