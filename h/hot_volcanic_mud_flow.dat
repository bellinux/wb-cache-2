Sakurajima. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>mud</b> <b>flows</b> take place there about 100 times a year. The results of the surveys demonstrated that the actual shearing force of a <b>volcanic</b> <b>mud</b> <b>flow</b> on Mt. Sakurajima was from 0. 46 to 2. 50 kgf/cm 2. The actual impact force caused by collisions of big stones, which were contained in a <b>mud</b> <b>flow,</b> with the channel bottom was calculated theoretically at about 15 {{times greater than the}} dead loads of the stones. The collision of stones in a <b>mud</b> <b>flow</b> caused great abrasion of concrete, A great number of <b>volcanic</b> <b>mud</b> <b>flows</b> take place every year on Mt. Sakurajima in spite of little rainfall. They often damage both dams and channels, and also threaten the inhabitants of Sakurajima. In this study, the magnitude of the actual shearing force of a <b>volcanic</b> <b>mud</b> <b>flow</b> was researched in order to make clear the mechanism of the destruction and the abrasion of a dam or a concrete channel in torrents of Mt. Sakurajima. The data were analyzed by the theories of hydraulics and the collision of an elastic body.

These magnetite grains were concentrated by flowing streams as magnetite placer deposits in the various sedimentary layers that compose the bogus ark structure.

This verdurecovered island surrounded by a blue sea is an ideal place to become acquainted with earth processes and products. Moreover, many of these geologic features are readily reached by automobile. The logs given on the following pages have been made for an autoist travelling the main highways around the island starting at the Kamehameha statue on King Street, Honolulu (pl. 1).

The mileage reads up if driving clockwise around the island and down if going counterclockwise. The route from Haleiwa to Wahiawa is over the new highway not shown on plate 2. Likewise, the route to Waianae is over the new Waipahu cut-off, although this road is not shown on plate 2.

Preliminary results were obtained as follows; 1. The measurement was made on the total magnetic force and the surface resistivity at the Shiramizudani area, the half up of Mt. Yakedake. The analitical results obtained elucidate the spatial distribution of both <b>volcanic</b> sediments and <b>mud</b> <b>flow</b> deposits around this area. 2. The paleomagnetic method was developed to investigate the temperature conditions when the volcanic sediments were embeded. The method was applied to classify the volcanic sediments (originated from Nakao pyroclastic flow c. a. 2500 to 1500 years B. P.) into three types; pyroclastic flow deposit, hot lahar deposit and cold lahar deposit. 3. Three observatory stations were established for the continuous monitoring of electric self-potential, geomagnetic total force, ground temperature and steam temperature conditions around the Yakedake area. Preliminary data observed at Nakao Station, the foot of Mt.

More than 600 hectares of productive land, housing and industrial areas, as well as infrastructures have been submerged. To date, after more than six years, there is no sign that the eruption will end in the near future. The contents of mud are predominantly SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 in crystalline form.

5000|$|At this time, {{the best}} {{documented}} occurrences of unfossilized buried upright trees occur within the historic and late-Holocene volcanic deposits of Mount St. Helens (Skamania County, Washington) and of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. At Mount St. Helens, both unfossilized and partially fossilized trees {{have occurred in}} many outcrops of <b>volcanic</b> debris and <b>mud</b> <b>flows</b> (lahars) and pyroclastic flow deposits, which date from 1885 to over 30,000 BP., along the South Toutle and other rivers. Late Holocene forests of upright trees also occur within the volcanic deposits of other Cascade Range volcanoes. In {{the space of a}} few years after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the erosion of loose pyroclastic deposits covering the slopes of the mountain generated a series of volcanic lahars, which ultimately buried large parts of the countryside along major streams draining these slopes beneath several meters of volcanic sediments. The repeated deposition of sediments by volcanic lahars and by sediment-filled rivers not only created innumerable polystrate trees, but also [...] "polystrate" [...] telephone-poles, churches, and houses, over a period a few years. The volcanic deposits enclosing modern upright trees are often virtually identical in their sedimentary structures, external and internal layering, texture, buried soils, and other general character to the volcanic deposits containing the Yellowstone buried forests.
