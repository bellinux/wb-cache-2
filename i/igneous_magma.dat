Recent (1990-2000) geological studies and rock age dating by geologists from Oxford Brookes University shows that the gneisses probably formed around 620-600 million years ago during the Late Pre-Cambrian Age Cadomian Orogeny. The quartz diorite sheets were intruded during this Cadomian deformation and metamorphic event.|$|E
50|$|Working {{on local}} Precambrian {{basement}} rocks, Sederholm instigated a map-making programme that, between 1899 and 1925, published many maps {{and descriptions of}} their geological history. Gneisses in the areas he studied (the so-called Baltic Shield) were often of mixed composition, with layers of granitic rock being interleaved with metamorphic rock.

50|$|There {{is also a}} {{tendency}} for metasomatism between the <b>igneous</b> <b>magma</b> and sedimentary country rock, whereby the chemicals in each are exchanged or introduced into the other. Granites may absorb fragments of shale or pieces of basalt. In that case, hybrid rocks called skarn arise, which don't have the characteristics of normal igneous or sedimentary rocks. Sometimes an invading granite magma permeates the rocks around, filling their joints and planes of bedding, etc., with threads of quartz and feldspar. This is very exceptional but instances of it are known and it may take place on a large scale.|$|E

50|$|The scapolite limestones {{and contact}} {{metamorphic}} rocks. As silicates rich in calcium, {{it is to}} be expected that these minerals will be found where impure limestones have been crystallized by contact with an <b>igneous</b> <b>magma.</b> Even marialite (the variety richest in soda) occurs in this association, being principally obtained in small crystals lining cavities in ejected blocks of crystalline limestone at Vesuvius and the craters of the Eifel in Germany. Scapolite and wernerite are far more common at the contacts of limestone with intrusive masses. The minerals that accompany them are calcite, epidote, vesuvianite, garnet, wollastonite, diopside and amphibole. The scapolites are colorless, flesh-colored, grey or greenish; occasionally they are nearly black from the presence of very small enclosures of graphitic material. They are not in very perfect crystals, though sometimes incomplete octagonal sections are visible; the tetragonal cleavage, strong double refraction and uniaxial interference figure distinguish them readily from other minerals. Commonly they weather to micaceous aggregate, but sometimes an isotropic substance of unknown nature is seen replacing them. In crystalline limestones and calc-silicate rocks they occur in small and usually inconspicuous grains mingled with the other components of the rock. Large, nearly idiomorphic crystals are sometimes found in argillaceous rocks (altered calcareous shales) that have suffered thermal metamorphism. In the Pyrenees there are extensive outcrops of limestone penetrated by igneous rocks described as ophites (varieties of diabase) and lherzolites (peridotites). At the contacts scapolite occurs in a great number of places, both in the limestones and in the calcareous shales that accompany them. In some of these rocks large crystals of one of the scapolite minerals (an inch or two in length) occur, usually as octagonal prisms with imperfect terminations. In others the mineral is found in small irregular grains. It is sometimes clear, but often crowded with minute enclosures of augite, tourmaline, biotite and other minerals, such as constitute the surrounding matrix. From these districts also a black variety is well known, filled with minute graphitic enclosures, often exceedingly small and rendering the mineral nearly opaque. The names couzeranite and dipyre are often given to this kind of scapolite. Apparently the presence of chlorine in small quantities, which may often be detected in limestones, to some extent determines the formation of the mineral.|$|E

Addition of 20 weight percent of CaO-rich material to a vapor-saturated albite liquid introduces the successive phase fields plagioclase + L + V, wollastonite + L + V, and plagioclase + wollastonite + L + V: addition of 20 to 25 percent produces a small field just above the solidus for plagioclase + wollastonite + nepheline + L + V, with nepheline present in trace amounts; crystallization of the liquid yields little additional nepheline: 25 percent or more of CaO-rich material causes complete crystallization because the solidus temperature increases abruptly, then more nepheline develops and melilite, rankinite, and larnite are stabilized in a series of subsolidus phase fields. Thus, about 20 weight percent of limestone must be assimilated before a feldspathic melt becomes sufficiently desilicated to yield nepheline. Even if enough superheat is available to permit solution of so much limestone, assimilation causes crystallization before desilication proceeds very far, and the formation of feldspathoids in quantity results only from subsolidus reactions. Limestone assimilation releases CO_ 2, which also tends to induce crystallization of a hydrated magma. A magma would be forced to crystallize as syntexis proceeds, and the local formation of alkalic silica-undersaturated rocks in reaction zones at limestone contacts with silica-saturated <b>igneous</b> <b>magmas</b> is to be expected.

5000|$|All <b>igneous</b> <b>magmas</b> contain {{dissolved}} gases (water, carbonic acid, hydrogen sulfide, chlorine, fluorine, boric acid, etc.).Of these {{water is the}} principal, and was formerly believed to have percolated downwards from the Earth's surface to the heated rocks below, but is now generally admitted to {{be an integral part}} of the magma. Many peculiarities of the structure of the plutonic rocks as contrasted with the lavas may reasonably be accounted for by the operation of these gases, which were unable to escape as the deep-seated masses slowly cooled, while they were promptly given up by the superficial effusions. The acid plutonic or intrusive rocks have never been reproduced by laboratory experiments, and the only successful attempts to obtain their minerals artificially have been those in which special provision was made for the retention of the [...] "mineralizing" [...] gases in the crucibles or sealed tubes employed. These gases often do not enter into the composition of the rock-forming minerals, for most of these are free from water, carbonic acid, etc. Hence as crystallization goes on the residual melt must contain an ever-increasing proportion of volatile constituents. It is conceivable that in the final stages the still uncrystallized part of the magma has more resemblance to a solution of mineral matter in superheated steam than to a dry igneous fusion. Quartz, for example, is the last mineral to form in a granite. It bears much of the stamp of the quartz which we know has been deposited from aqueous solution in veins, etc. It is at the same time the most infusible of all the common minerals of rocks. Its late formation shows that in this case it arose at comparatively low temperatures and points clearly to the special importance of the gases of the magma as determining the sequence of crystallization.|$|R

25|$|In igneous petrology, geologists {{attempt to}} learn more about {{volcanic}} systems through the record in <b>igneous</b> rocks.

Quaternary {{volcanism}} has been taking place only in the inner arcs. The Quaternary volcanic rocks are composed of a basalt ― andesite ― dacite ― rhyolite suite, of which andesite and dacite of the calc-alkali series are predominant. The rocks vary markedly from the Pacific side to the marginal sea side, and are associated with basalts which vary from tholeiitic to alkalic basalt types, as follows: Pacific side [...] Marginal sea side Tholeiite series(T) High-Al basalt ser. (H) Alkali rock series(A) Calc-alkali ser. (CT) Calc-alkali series(CH) Calc-alkali series(CA) 183 major element chemical analyses of the Quaternary volcanic rocks of Hokkaido are now available. Spatial zonation of the rocks is well represented in alkali - silica relations. Marked iron enrichment in the intermediate rocks {{is found in the}} tholeiite series. Trace elements were determined on 42 selected rocks. The contents of REE, Ba, U, Th and Hf increase with silica. The rocks of the marginal sea side are particularly enriched in these elements. The abundance of Sc, Cr, V and Co decreases with increasing silica content. It is noted that Sc and V behave as iron. The three groups, T & CT, H & CH and A & CA, are well distinguished from each other in the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, i. e. T & CT has distribution patterns vary similar to the ocean ridge tholeiite, showing a tendency toward depletion or equality of light REE over heavy REE, whereas A & CA has a marked enrichment of light REE over heavy REE. There is no essential difference in the REE pattern between the calc-alkali rocks and the associated basaltic rocks in each group, suggesting a common source for them. A negative Eu anomaly is a characteristic feature of the calc-alkali rocks, though this anomaly does not always appear. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios were determined on 49 samples. The ratios of the rocks of the Kurile are extremely low (0. 7028 ― 0. 7039), and those of the north Honshu arc are also low (0. 7026 ― 0. 7057). The Sr-isotope ratios of basalt to dacite in a single volcano are almost identical and exhibit a small range of variation without systematic change.

25|$|The {{crystallisation}} of <b>igneous</b> rocks from <b>magma</b> {{depends on}} a number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as lattice energy, melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, olivine appears first, followed by pyroxene, amphibole, biotite mica, orthoclase feldspar, muscovite mica, quartz, zeolites, and finally hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend towards increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of hydroxide and fluoride anions in addition to oxides. Many metals can substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo weathering, transport, and deposition, sedimentary rocks like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. Metamorphism also can occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.|$|R
40|$|The {{granitic}} {{rocks are}} subdivided into four series: tholeiitic, alkaline, calc-alkaline and mobilizates.

The rocks formed from crustal anatexis are subdivided into those formed from igneous rocks (I-type granites) and those formed from meta-sedimentary rocks (S-type granites).

Results from MESSENGER spacecraft have shown that its surface is FeO-poor (2 - 4 wt%) and S-rich (up to 6 - 7 wt%), which confirms the reducing nature of its silicate mantle.

40|$|The {{kinematic}} {{and dynamic}} scaling of dilute multiphase mixtures in magmatic systems {{is the only}} guarantee for the geological verisimilitude of laboratory experiments. We present scaling relations that can provide a more complete framework to scale dilute magmatic systems because they explicitly {{take into account the}} complexity caused by the feedback between particles (crystal, bubble, or pyroclast) and the continuous phase (liquid or gas). We consider three canonical <b>igneous</b> systems: <b>magma</b> chambers, volcanic plumes, and pyroclastic surges, and we provide estimates of the proposed scaling relations for published experiments on those systems. Dilute magmatic mixtures can display a range of distinct dynamical regimes that we characterize with a combination of average (Eulerian) properties and instantaneous (Lagrangian) variables. The Eulerian properties of the mixtures yield the Reynolds number (Re), which indicates the level of unsteadiness in the continuous phase. The Lagrangian acceleration of particles {{is a function of the}} viscous drag and gravity forces, and from these two forces are derived the Stokes number (ST) and the stability number (ΣT), two dimensionless numbers that describe the dynamic behavior of the particles within the mixture. The compilation of 17 experimental studies relevant for pyroclastic surges and volcanic plumes indicates that there is a need for experiments above the mixing transition (Re> 104), and for scaling ST and ΣT. Among the particle dynamic regimes present in surges and plumes, some deserve special attention, such as the role of mesoscale structures on transport and sedimentary processes, or the consequences of the transition to turbulence on particle gathering and dispersal. The compilation of 7 experimental studies relevant to magma bodies indicates that in the laminar regime, crystals mostly follow the motion of the melt, and thus the physical state of the system can be approximated as single phase. In the transition to turbulence, magmas can feature spatially heterogeneous distributions of laminar regions and important velocity gradients. This heterogeneity has a strong potential for crystals sorting. In conclusion, the Re-ST-ΣT framework demonstrates that, despite numerous experimental studies on processes relevant to magmatic systems, some and perhaps most, geologically important parameter ranges still need to be addressed at the laboratory scale...|$|R

We report geological and geophysical evidence showing that Pliocene sills emplaced in the upper levels of brittle continental crust of the Colorado Plateau in the San Rafael subvolcanic field (Utah) became gravitationally unstable by mechanically altering the overlying sedimentary rocks. These sills grew into structures that we recognize as domes and plugs at the current level of exposure. Some of these plugs continued to transport magma to shallower levels of the continental crust and eventually acted as conduits feeding volcanic eruptions.

40|$|A {{temporal}} and spatial relationship between plume magmatism, cratonic lithosphere and the occurrences of orthomagmatic Ni-Cu and platinum-group element (PGE) sulphide mineralisation has been documented in the literature. However the underlying causes for this correlation {{have yet to be}} resolved – is there an inherent feature of the cratonic lithosphere and its mantle ‘keel’ that controls mineralisation? Or is this correlation purely a preservational bias in the geological record? Scotland has experienced multiple tectono-magmatic events and provides an ideal testing ground, or ‘framework’, in which to assess the role of lithospheric mantle on chalcophile element (Ni and Cu) and precious metal (PGE and Au) abundances through time. Given the well-documented geological history of the region (including several suites of mantle xenoliths), coupled with exploration campaigns in Greenland (with which Scotland has comparable geology), this thesis aims to assess the contributions and influences of lithospheric mantle vs. asthenospheric mantle during melting and mineralisation. It also evaluates the Ni-Cu-PGE mineralisation potential for Scotland, particularly in a Noril’sk-type conduit-hosted setting within the British Palaeogene Igneous Province (BPIP). The earliest major tectono-magmatic event following cratonisation of the North Atlantic Craton (NAC) occurred c. 2. 4 Ga during Palaeoproterozoic extension, forming the maficultramafic Scourie Dyke Swarm. Despite evidence for lithospheric mantle melting at this time, the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) below the Scottish portion of the NAC did not become severely depleted in sulphides or PGE. Instead, spinel lherzolite mantle xenoliths from this region (e. g., Loch Roag) record an influx of carbonatite-associated sulphides at this time, enriched in PGE, and providing a deeper indication of continental extension that may be correlated to carbonatitic intrusions in Greenland. Subsequent collision and orogenesis of the NAC in the late Palaeoproterozoic (c. 1. 9 to 1. 7 Ga) represents a second significant tectonomagmatic event, recorded in the Scottish SCLM as sulphide (re-) melting and formation of discrete Pt-sulphide minerals (cooperite). Hence the lithospheric mantle here became appreciably enriched in precious metals during the Palaeoproterozoic, but crucially this preserved multiple co-existing populations of sulphides, distinct in their petrographic setting and geochemistry. Cratonic basement and associated mantle lithosphere are absent in the southern terranes of Scotland. This provides a direct comparison between lithospheric mantle geochemistry for Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic terranes north of the Great Glen Fault vs. Palaeozoic terranes south of the Great Glen Fault. Rifting of Rodinia and opening of the Iapetus Ocean in the late Neoproterozoic thus marks a significant change in geodynamic setting. This is especially apparent in the concentration of cobalt in lithospheric mantle sulphides, which appears to be inherently linked with the formation and/or later destruction (subduction) of oceanic crust during the Grampian event of the Caledonian orogeny. The impingement of the proto-Icelandic mantle plume initiated in the Palaeogene {{at the base of the}} NAC lithospheric mantle keel of Scotland and Greenland. The earliest Palaeogene magmas are enriched in Pt (i. e., have a high Pt/Pd ratio), whilst subsequent magmas associated with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean have successively lower Pt/Pd ratios. High Pt/Pd ratios are therefore coincident with magmas that have intruded through cratonic lithosphere. The SCLM at the margin of this region is known to be Pt-enriched (with cooperite) and therefore the changing Pt/Pd ratio of North Atlantic <b>Igneous</b> Province <b>magmas</b> suggests a fundamental interaction between the mantle plume and pre-enriched SCLM. Thus, whilst the concentration of metals, particularly Ni and Cu, is largely based on the high degree of asthenospheric mantle melting associated with the plume itself, the ratio of precious metals, such as Pt/Pd, can be strongly influenced by SCLM geochemistry. Overall, the intricate subtleties of metasomatic signatures recorded by mantle xenolith sulphides (or populations of sulphides) could allow for metallogenic ‘mapping’ of the upper mantle. This may identify areas of geochemical and mineralogical ‘preconditioning’, and together with geophysical constraints such as major lithospheric lineaments, it may be possible to establish the craton-specific fertility of a region. Finally, in order for orthomagmatic sulphide mineralisation to occur, magmas must achieve sulphur saturation in the upper crust, forming an immiscible sulphide liquid and thereby collecting PGE and chalcophile elements, possibly to economic grades. Thus a crucial part of assessing the mineralisation potential of a region must entail an investigation into the causes and locations of S-saturation. Given that crustal sulphur contamination is a common trigger for magmatic S-saturation, this thesis establishes the first S-isotopic (δ 34 S) framework for western Scotland in order to identify areas of sulphur contamination in the BPIP. In Scotland, the most readily available and S-rich rocks occur in the Mesozoic Hebrides Basin. Sulphur contamination of BPIP rocks is widespread and both S-saturation and S-undersaturation can be observed, suggesting that the region may be extremely fertile for orthomagmatic Ni-Cu-PGE mineralisation. By reconstructing the Hebrides Basin stratigraphy we can assess locations of contamination, even if these are above the current level of exposure (and since removed by erosion), and in some situations sulphide liquid sinking may be demonstrated, suggesting further possibilities for mineralisation present ‘up-stream’ in magmatic conduits. In conclusion, the Scottish BPIP represents a new exploration frontier not yet identified by industry for orthomagmatic Ni-Cu-PGE mineralisation. The conclusions are based on approximately 500 rock samples from across Scotland, which have been analysed for major elements and over thirty trace elements (including PGE) and S-isotopes.

40|$|The {{majority}} of economic gold deposits in NSW {{are associated with}} Ordovician-aged igneous rocks and are examples of the Cu-Au porphyry-skarn-epithermal association commonly developed in convergent margin to orogenic settings. They are among the oldest porphyry Cu-Au deposits in the Pacific Rim region. They are similar to younger deposits in terms of tectonic setting and structure, but the largest are chemically distinct, being associated with shoshonite magmas (Cadia, Ridgeway and Northparkes). The Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB) porphyries are subdivided into four sub-groups based mainly on their age relative to development of the Lachlan Transverse Zone (LTZ) structure. Two subgroups pre-date the LTZ, one group is syn-LTZ and one group post-dates the LTZ. No mineralisation has been found or reported among pre-I. TZ porphyries. but it is common in post-. l Z_ porphyries. Petrographic analysis and microprobe results establish {{a wide range of}} primary and secondary features within the Ordovician rocks examined in this study. Cale alkaline to shoshonitic affinities are supported by the variable abundance of primary K-feldspars. Primary mineral phases such as pyroxenes and igneous magnetite provide an indication of fractioning mineral assemblages responsible for <b>igneous</b> trends in <b>magma</b> chemistry. The hydrothermal mineral assemblages documented in these LFB study areas are characteristic of younger Cu-Au Porphyry style mineralisation. As expected, the most pervasive alteration is associated with highly mineralised shoshonitic Ordovician rocks at Ridgeway, and Cadia. the less strongly mineralised calc alkaline Ordovician rocks at Cargo. Copper Ilill and Fairholme. are correspondingly less strongly altered overall. although secondary mineral assemblages are locally abundant. Many varieties of oxides and carbonates are observed at the different study localities. Most of the studied samples conform to igneous chemical trends because they are weakly altered, although post magmatic processes, such as veining, are detectable in certain trends. The K 2 O enrichment of the studied samples is consistent with subductionmoditied mantle wedge sources. A few effects, such as the high Fe 203 contents of some Ridgeway samples, probably reflect porphyry-style hydrothermal alteration processes. Host rocks at the Cadia and Ridgeway are entirely alkalic on the K 2 O versus SiO 2 plot and shoshonitic on the Total Alkalies versus SiO 2 plot. Igneous rocks at the other deposits display a range of compositions between low K tholeiites to shoshonites that in some cases reflects multiple igneous suites. The LREE and L 1 LE enrichments, and HFSE depletions (Nb, Ta and Ti) of the magmas associated with these deposits are characteristics of a subduction-related tectonic setting. They all fall in the volcanic-arc granite and syn-collisional granite field of the Nb-Y tectonic discrimination diagram. Several magma types are identified by differences in the HFSE and REE trends. Differences in the extent and style of magma fractionation are evident in the trace element data. The Ridgeway samples define a wider range of trace element concentrations than the Cadia samples that may indicate a greater extent of fractionation during emplacement of the Ridgeway magmas. Fairholme samples display a high Nh and /If trends that are distinct from the main fields on Zr variation diagrams. Compositional differences between larger Cu-Au deposits, Cadia-Ridgeway and smaller deposits, Copper Ifill, Cargo and Fairholme are evident in terms of Nb-Ta depletion and variation. The smaller deposits show constant Nb/Ta or negative Nb/Ta trends that extend to high Nb. The larger deposits display positive Nb/Ta trends that do not extend to high Nb. This distinction reflects a difference of preferential incorporation of Nb in a mineral phase (magnetite). Comparisons between Cadia-Ridgeway and other shoshonite (altered samples of Bajo de la Alumbrera, Argentina), calc alkaline magmas from New Zealand and rocks from other areas indicate that Nb/Ta is not directly correlated with the shoshonitic classification, K 2 O vs. SiO 2, and that the Cadia-Ridgeway Nb and Ta variation is not the result of alteration. The fact that the weakly altered LFB Capertee shoshonites exhibit a narrow range of Nb and low Nb/Ta suggest the shoshonite trend for the LFB as a whole is a steep one on the Nb/Ta versus Nb plot. The results of this study could provide important information for exploration within the LFB. Only the Cadia and Ridgeway deposits display a wide range of Nb/Ta values and lack the near-horizontal trend seen for other localities associated with smaller deposits. The tectonic evolution of the LFB is a major factor contributing to occurrence of large porphyry Cu-Au deposits. The sequence of important events, however, commences with sub-crustal generation of oxidised magma and finishes with efficient Cu-Au accumulation by hydrothermal processes at favourable structural sites. The increase in Au-Cu deposit size from small (Copper Hill-Cargo) to world class (Cadia-Ridgeway) indicates the importance of magma composition during this process. The most obvious differences between the Cadia-Ridgeway and New Zealand rocks is that the latter are volcanic in origin and associated with an arc-back arc system. Therefore, they did not form in a tectonic regime suitable for the evolution of porphyries and the focussed movement of hydrothermal fluids during dilatant episodes. As a result, they are not linked to mineralisation despite having Nb-Ta and Nb/Ta variations that are typical of the high oxidation states in Au-prospective magmas of the LFB...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The Bornaward area {{is located}} in the Northeastern Iran (in the Khorasan Razavi province) 28 km {{northwest}} of the city of Bardaskan at 57 ˚ 46 ΄ to 57 ˚ 52 ΄ N latitude and 35 ˚ 21 ΄ to 35 ˚ 24 ΄E longitude. The Taknar structural zone, situated in the North central Iranian micro continent, is part of the Lut block (Forster, 1978). The Taknar zone is an allochthonous block bounded by the Darouneh and Taknar major faults. Much of this zone consists of metarhyolite-rhyodacite volcanic rocks, and rhyolitic tuff with interlayers of sandstone and dolomite (Taknar Formation). Analytical Results ICP-MS analysis of REE and minor elements of samples of the Bornaward metarhyolites was carried out at the ACME Laboratory in Vancouver, Canada. U-Pb dating of the metarhyolites was performed on isolated zircons in Crohn's Laser Lab, in Arizona (Gehrels et al., 2008). Measurement of Rb, Sr, Sm and Nd isotopes and (143 Nd/ 144 Nd) i and (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i ratios took place in the radioisotope laboratory of the University of Aveiro in Portugal. Petrography The volcanic rocks are porphyritic, commonly containing phenocrysts of orthoclase and rarely sanidine, quartz and intermediate plagioclase in a groundmass of fine-grained quartz and feldspar. An alteration has produced oriented needles of sericite and clay minerals, clusters of fine-grained green biotite and clots of epidote and chlorite. Geochemistry The compositions of the volcanic rocks are calc alkaline and high K- calc alkaline. The obtained Shand index (Al 2 O 3 /(CaO+Na 2 O+K 2 O) is above 1. 1, in the peraluminous S-type granite field (Chappell and White, 2001). Plotted on the TAS diagram (Middlemost, 1994), all the metarhyolite-rhyodacite samples are located in the sub-alkaline field and the majority fall into the rhyolite group. The metarhyolite-rhyodacites show enrichment of LREE with a moderately ascending pattern ((La/Yb) N= 2. 51 - 10. 11 and La= 46. 45 - 145. 48). Europium shows a negative anomaly (Eu/Eu*= 0. 23 - 0. 71). U-Pb zircon geochronology Measurement of U-Pb isotopes of the Bornaward metarhyolite zircons of sample BKCh- 103, indicates an age of 552. 23 + 4. 73,- 6. 62 Ma (Upper Precambrian). Sr-Nd isotopes The Sr ratios of the metarhyolites (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) were found to fall in the range of 0. 688949 to 0. 723435 and the Nd ratios (143 Nd/ 144 Nd) i were in the range of 0. 511701 to 0. 511855. These values indicate that the metarhyolites of samples BKCh- 12, BKCh- 103 and BKCh- 177 were affected by hydrothermal alteration since their (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) I ratios are high. The Sr ratios suggest that the more negative Nd anomaly and the more negative ɛNd(552) of the samples BKCh- 12, BKCh- 103 and BKCh- 177 indicate that these lavas originated in an enriched upper mantle source and/or lower continental crust. In contrast, two recent examples (Xua et al., 2005) can be related to sialic continental crust with significant contamination. Petrogenesis The Bornaward metarhyolite- rhyodacites show an enriched pattern for Rb, Th, U, K, Pb, Nd and Y relative to the primitive mantle, while Ba, P, Ti, Sr, Zr and Nb show a reduction as a result of fractional crystallization. Based on isotopic correlations of 207 Pb/ 204 Pb vs 206 Pb/ 204 Pb, the primitive source of the Bornaward metarhyolite- rhyodacites is the lower continental crust. This part of the continental crust is only slightly depleted in Pb. Consequently, it has a low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio (Samples BKCh- 138 and BKCh- 198). In contrast, the samples of BKCh- 12, BKCh- 103 and BKCh- 177 have high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios that could be the result of significant contamination to parts of the continental crust with very high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (Karimpour et al., 2011). Results and Conclusions The calc-alkaline compositions of samples BKCh- 12, BKCh- 103 and BKCh- 177, the high K- calc alkaline of samples BKCh- 138 and BKCh- 198 of the Bornaward metarhyolites and the higher temperature overgrowth of plagioclase on lower temperature microcline phenocrysts can be a reason for entrance lavas with different generations. The distinct isotopic characteristics of the two groups of rhyolitic samples are the reasons for two different sources for the production of these lavas: 1) partial melting of an enriched mantle reservoir or lower continental crust, and 2) sialic continental crust with high contamination. With respect to the Bornaward metarhyolite- rhyodacites with (143 Nd/ 144 Nd) i ratios from 0. 511701 to 0. 511855, geochemical characteristics and the high volume of volcanic rocks in the area, their formation can be attributed to a continental rift environment. This rift system can be formed by initiation of a plume in the upper mantle beneath East Iran during Neoproterozoic time. References Chappell, B. W. and White, A. J. R., 2001.
