The rewind release is situated at the base. Long time exposure is accomplished by sliding a switch next to the shutter release to the left, before or while depressing the release button. It must be returned to terminate the exposure. At the right-hand camera front is a wide accessory shoe taking a selenium exposure meter, which couples to the shutter speed dial. The camera stayed in production for one year before it was replaced by the Canonflex R2000, adding the 1/2000 sec. shutter speed.|$|E

5000|$|Physicist Étienne-Jules Marey {{began using}} the {{technique}} to more closely study movement, flight, and exercise. He {{soon discovered that}} by overlapping celluloid prints {{on top of one}} another, he was able to see phases of movement and study their relations to each other in a single frame. [...] Georges Demeny, Marey’s assistant, developed even further applications for the reproduction of movement, primarily in creating a simple projector called the stroboscope. He and German photographer Ottomar Anschutz shared the development of projecting technology, using chronophotographs and projectors to create movement much like the projection we know today. Anschutz carried this concept even further, developing chronophotographs to run through his projectors as entertainment. Anschutz then managed to develop a folding <b>hand</b> <b>camera</b> with a “focal-plane shutter,” an early model of a folding bellows, and a flatbed-type press camera that allowed photos to be taken at 1/1000 second exposures. This enabled a faster setup of Muybridge’s multiple-camera system, able to take more exposures faster due to the rapidity of the shutter speed. He also invented a personal viewer for his chronophotographs, a revolving disk in which the photos could be viewed with illumination from an electric spark (rather than projection). Chronophotographic inventions following those of the “inventors of the cinema” (Muybridge, Marey, Demeny, and Anschutz) became the foundations upon which cinematic film was created.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} robust {{extraction}} of visual odometry from {{a sequence of}} images obtained by an eye in <b>hand</b> <b>camera</b> configuration is addressed. A novel approach toward solving planar template based tracking is proposed which performs a non-linear image alignment for successful retrieval of camera transformations. In order to obtain global optimum a biometaheuristic is used for optimization of similarity among the planar regions. The proposed method is validated on image sequences with real as well as synthetic transformations and found to be resilient to intensity variations. A comparative analysis of the various similarity measures as well as various state-of-art methods reveal that the algorithm succeeds in tracking the planar regions robustly and has good potential {{to be used in}} real applications...|$|E

30|$|Knowledge {{about the}} {{environment}} and the recording setup is an important factor for designing automated visual detectors because it enables the derivation of constraints and visual clues that facilitate detection. In an uncontrolled environment like wildlife video, as investigated in this work, the identification of robust constraints and clues is difficult. The video material we investigate has been captured by different people with a <b>hand</b> <b>camera.</b> Recordings were partly made in an ad hoc fashion. This means that we cannot make assumptions {{about the environment}} and the camera operation. As a consequence, we have to rely on the very basic visual cues such as shape, texture, motion, and color for the detection of elephants. Prior to the design of our method, we have investigated the suitability of the different visual cues.|$|E
40|$|Semantic scene {{classification}} {{based only}} on low-level vision cues has had limited success on unconstrained image sets. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>camera</b> metadata related to capture conditions provides cues independent of the captured scene content {{that can be used}} to improve classification performance. We consider three problems, indoor-outdoor classification, sunset detection, and manmade-natural classification. Analysis of camera metadata statistics for images of each class revealed that metadata fields, such as exposure time, flash fired, and subject distance, are most discriminative for each problem. A Bayesian network is employed to fuse content-based and metadata cues in the probability domain and degrades gracefully even when specific metadata inputs are missing (a practical concern). Finally, we provide extensive experimental results on the three problems using content-based and metadata cues to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed integrated scene classification scheme...|$|E

The algorithm is being developed for both the captured and the real time images. The root algorithm that is being used in this paper is Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) for background subtraction that is an effective background mixture model for the background subtraction or foreground detection. Hence, a Human Machine Interface (HMI) has been developed by exploiting this method further...|$|E

40|$|Personal indoor {{localization}} {{is usually}} accomplished by fusing information from various sensors. A common {{choice is to}} use the WiFi adapter that provides information about Access Points that {{can be found in the}} vicinity. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art approaches to WiFi-based localization often employ very dense maps of the WiFi signal distribution, and require a time-consuming process of parameter selection. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>camera</b> images are commonly used for visual place recognition, detecting whenever the user observes a scene similar to the one already recorded in a database. Visual place recognition algorithms can work with sparse databases of recorded scenes and are in general simple to parametrize. Therefore, we propose a WiFi-based global localization method employing the structure of the well-known FAB-MAP visual place recognition algorithm. Similarly to FAB-MAP our method uses Chow-Liu trees to estimate a joint probability distribution of re-observation of a place given a set of features extracted at places visited so far. However, we are the first who apply this idea to recorded WiFi scans instead of visual words. The new method is evaluated on the UJIIndoorLoc dataset used in the EvAAL competition, allowing fair comparison with other solutions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{segmentation}} of foreground {{objects in}} camera images {{is a fundamental}} step in many computer vision applications. For visual effect creation, the foreground segmentation {{is required for the}} integration of virtual objects between scene elements. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>camera</b> and scene estimation is needed to integrate the objects perspectively correct into the video. In this paper, discontinued feature tracks are used to detect occlusions. If these features reappear after their occlusion, they are connected to the correct previously discontinued trajectory during sequential camera and scene estimation. The combination of optical flow for features in consecutive frames and SIFT matching for the wide baseline feature connection provides accurate and stable feature tracking. The knowledge of occluded parts of a connected feature track is used to feed an efficient segmentation algorithm which crops the foreground image regions automatically. The presented graph cut based segmentation uses a graph contraction technique to minimize the computational expense. The presented application in the integration of virtual objects into video. For this application, the accurate estimation of camera and scene is crucial. The segmentation is used for the automatic occlusion of the integrated objects with foreground scene content. Demonstrations show very realistic results. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a delta telerobot that a human operator works on a given task through the eye and hand of the robot. The Delta robot is installed with eye in <b>hand</b> <b>camera</b> and controlled by an open architecture controller that is configured to control the robot to follow the motion of the selectable HMI devices. The evaluation task is a three dimensional “connect the dot ” game in which the robot is tele-operated with visual feedback to go point to point from position 1 to 6. The task performance is used to evaluate {{the performance of}} the total system that involves a robot, human factors, HMI, and environment. Three HMI devices including a manual pulse generator, Kinect camera, and a PHANToM OMNI Haptic Device are benchmarked. The result demonstrates that the Haptic with guided force is the best when compared to the others. In addition, the telerobot system can improve the time to completion by 30 % and positioning accuracy by 50 %, compared to human in the human scaled task. Then we investigate the effect of time delay of the delta telerobot with the Haptic. The result demonstrates that the time delay, that exceeds 100 ms, is proportion to both time to completion and positioning error in telerobot task, while the time delay below 100 ms gives no effect...|$|E
