The trial function blending is achieved using a technique similar to the ‘Coons patch ’ method that is widely used in computer-aided geometric design.

This procedure involves a judicious choice of functions called the transition (T) functions that have unit values on the BE-TR interface and zero values on the FE-TR interface.

The heavy chains are held together by disulfide bridge(s) located {{in the part of}} the molecule that is attached to the cell membrane. By limited proteolysis of the histocompatibility antigens evidence was obtained suggesting that the heavy chain may consist of three compact domains connected by more extended stretches of polypeptide chain.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{problems}} with both material and geometrical nonlinearities are of practical importance in many engineering applications, e. g. geomechanics, metal forming and biomechanics. Traditionally, {{these problems are}} simulated using an adaptive finite element method (FEM). However, the FEM faces many challenges in modeling these problems, such as mesh distortion and selection of a robust refinement algorithm. Adaptive meshless methods are a more recent technique for modeling these problems and can overcome the inherent mesh based drawbacks of the FEM but are computationally expensive. To {{take advantage of the}} good features of both methods, in the method proposed in this paper, initially the whole of the problem domain is modeled using the FEM. During an analysis those elements which violate a predefined error measure are automatically converted to a meshless zone. This zone can be further refined by adding nodes, overcoming computationally expensive FE remeshing. Therefore an appropriate coupling between the FE and the meshless zone is vital for the proposed formulation. One of the most widely used meshless methods, the element-free Galerkin method (EFGM), is used in this research. Maximum entropy shape functions are used instead of the conventional moving least squares based formulations'. These shape functions posses a weak Kronecker delta property at the boundaries of the problem domain, which allows the essential boundary conditions to be imposed directly and also helps to avoid the use of a transition region in the coupling between the FE and the EFG regions. Total Lagrangian formulation is preferred over the updated Lagrangian formulation for modeling finite deformation due to its computational efficiency. The well-established error estimation procedure of Zienkiewicz-Zhu is used in the <b>FE</b> <b>region</b> to determine the elements requiring conversion to the EFGM.
