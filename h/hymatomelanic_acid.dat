40|$|After {{separation}} of the <b>hymatomelanic</b> <b>acid</b> fraction more lipid components can be recovered from humic acids by Soxhlet extraction with other solvents than ethanol (i. e., methylene chloride-methanol). The composition of these remaining mixtures has been investigated on the humic acids of three soils encompassing different properties in terms of pH, carbon content and associated vegetation (a Typic Xerochrept, a Typic Rendoll and a Typic Xerorthent). The <b>hymatomelanic</b> <b>acid</b> fraction of these samples has been studied elsewhere (ref. 1). Unsubstituted fatty acids generally predominate in both successive extracts, although distinct distributions are characteristics in each case. Important qualitative differences have been observed for other components, namely steroidal ketones and hydroxy acids. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Curie-point pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} {{has been}} used to chem ically characterize fulvic acid, humic acid, <b>hymatomelanic</b> <b>acid</b> and polysaccharide fractions of a representative soil. A detailed study of all the pyrolysis products was made. By comparing {{the results of this study}} with previous pyrolysis data for lignins, degraded lignins. polysaccharides, proteins, etc., we have been able to obtain more detailed information aboul the chemical composition of the pyrolysis products from different soil organic matter fractions. It is shown that fulvic acid fractions consist mainly of polysaccharide and/or carbohydrates and polyphenols, that humic acid and humin fractions are complex mixtures of several biopolymers such as polysaccharides, partially degraded lignins, peptides and lipids and that the <b>hymatomelanic</b> <b>acid</b> fraction represents mainly lipid materials...|$|E
40|$|Peat {{and various}} peat {{preparations}} {{have been successfully}} used in balneology. When considering the biological effects of peat, humic substances {{have been found to}} be of particular importance. The content of humic, <b>hymatomelanic</b> and fulvic <b>acids</b> as well as main characteristics of peat were measured in three areas with balneological potential, selected according to previous research and mapping of Estonian peatlands. It appeared that the content of bioactive substances in the sampled peat layers was relatively high. The concentrations were highest in the Parika peatland: humic acids 39. 3 %, <b>hymatomelanic</b> <b>acids</b> 19. 3 % and fulvic acids 1. 3 %. The main factors influencing the levels of bioactive substances were the degree on humification (more humified peat had higher concentrations) and peat type (forest(pine) –cottongrass composition increased the concentration levels). As lipids had high correlation with <b>hymatomelanic</b> <b>acids</b> and trace elements with fulvic acids, the mentioned components could be respectively bound to these humic substances...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry {{have been}} used for the analysis of the <b>hymatomelanic</b> <b>acids</b> of four soil samples (a Typic Xerorthent, a Typic Rendoll and two Typic Xerochrepts, on shale and on granite) encompassing a wide diversity of properties in terms of pH, organic carbon, nitrogen content and associated vegetation. These humic fractions are largely composed of distributions of C 12 -C 34 fatty acids where microbial and higher plant contributions may be observed. Mixtures of C 27 -C 29 stera- 3, 5 -dien- 7 -ones are also present, representing microbial oxidation products of Δ 2 -sterols. Despite the wide diversity of soils considered no major qualitative differences have been observed. In all cases the corresponding <b>hymatomelanic</b> <b>acids</b> are composed of a rather uniform pattern of aerobic microbial components together with higher plant lipids. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
