5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Although {{cardiovascular}} risk <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, {{are associated}} with a higher risk of onset and course of AD, statins, which are cholesterol lowering drugs, have not been effective in preventing or improving the course of the disease.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of {{cavities}} {{play a vital role}} in moulding costs, so does the complexity of the part's design. Complexity can be incorporated into many <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> as surface finishing, tolerance requirements, internal or external threads, fine detailing or {{the number of}} undercuts that may be incorporated.|$|E

5|$|Stars {{can also}} vary in {{luminosity}} because of extrinsic <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> as eclipsing binaries, {{as well as}} rotating stars that produce extreme starspots. A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.3 to 3.5 {{over a period of}} 2.87 days.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities (such as intellectual disability) have shown self-harm being dependent on environmental <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> as obtaining attention or escape from demands.

5|$|The {{pale blue}} {{color of the}} dot {{is the result of}} {{polarization}} and scattering of the light reflected from Earth. The polarization in turn depends on various <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> as cloud cover, exposed areas of oceans, forests, deserts, snow fields etc.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} {{solar energy}} {{that could be}} used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.|$|E

5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|Abuse during {{childhood}} is {{accepted as a}} primary social factor increasing the incidence of self-harm, as is bereavement, and troubled parental or partner relationships. <b>Factors</b> <b>such</b> as war, poverty, and unemployment may also contribute. Self-harm is frequently described as an experience of depersonalisation or a dissociative state. As many as 70% of individuals with borderline personality disorder engage in self-harm. An estimated 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorders engage in self-harm at some point, including eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting, and head-banging.|$|E

5|$|Ages for star {{clusters}} {{can be estimated}} by comparing the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for the cluster with theoretical models of stellar evolution. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> as convective overshoot, in which a convective zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E
5|$|Although {{increasing}} {{echelons of}} the scale correspond to stronger winds, the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects. Lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms, depending on <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> as local terrain, population density and total rainfall. For instance, a Category2 hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely do more damage than a large Category5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region. In fact, tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties, especially from flooding and landslides.|$|E
5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
