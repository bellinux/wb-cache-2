5|$|After the 1971 primary, Combs {{retired from}} {{politics}} and resumed his law practice, maintaining {{an office in}} Frankfort. He continued to represent large coal companies, drawing the ire of local environmentalist and author Harry M. Caudill, who asserted that Combs claimed to represent the powerless while actually representing the powerful. He was active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rural Housing and Development Corporation and served on the Council on Higher Education. He also served on President Jimmy Carter's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament.|$|E
5|$|After the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several {{attempts}} were made to revive the organisation, culminating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Socialist International (Second International) in 1889. This, in turn, was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over World War I. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the Labour and Socialist International, supporters of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks had already set up the Communist International (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International. This was organised on a democratic centralist basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the body as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Although the British {{authorities}} had prohibited the American Neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell {{from entering the}} UK, the NSM managed to smuggle him in via Ireland to attend a summer camp in August 1962. There, the NSM took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Union of National Socialists (WUNS), at which Jordan was elected 'world führer' and Rockwell as his heir. Among those in attendance were the Neo-Nazi Savitri Devi and the former SS officer Fred Borth.|$|E
5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms or groups, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E

5|$|Born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) to an Afrikaner {{mother and}} a Lithuanian Jewish father, he moved to Northern Rhodesia, became {{involved}} with the trade unions, and entered the colonial legislative council in 1938. There, he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia (the latter under white self-government, the former under the colonial office). Although unsuccessful, he succeeded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, a state within the British Empire that sought to retain predominant power for the white minority while moving in a progressive political direction, in contrast to apartheid South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these new}} rules, {{football}} remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations, which involved interlocking interference, like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths. A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide {{resulted in a}} threat by President Theodore Roosevelt to abolish the game unless major changes were made. In response, sixty-two colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905, and these proceedings resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).|$|E

In 2006 it was renamed the Neath and Tennant Canals Trust. They have worked alongside the two Canal companies, Neath Port Talbot Council, and a wide range of funders and bodies working for regeneration of the Neath valley, to enable significant sections of the canals to return to use.|$|E

5|$|By now the Commandos {{started to}} move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into four brigades to {{spearhead}} future Allied landing operations. The previous Special Service Brigade Headquarters was replaced by Headquarters Special Services Group under command of Major General Robert Sturges. Of the remaining 20 Commando units, 17 were used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four Special Service brigades. The three remaining Commandos (Nos. 12, 14, and 62) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate on smaller scale raids. The increased tempo of operations, together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties, forced their disbandment by the end of 1943. The small scale raiding role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his early}} {{resolution}} {{not to allow}} politics to impede upon his legal career, Maxwell's resolute support of the Union during the American Civil War, and of the statehood movement for West Virginia, refocused his priorities. Maxwell's political affiliation had been Republican, and he became actively involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state of West Virginia in 1863. Just weeks prior to the state's creation on June 20 of that year, he began his political career {{when he was elected}} to represent the Third Senatorial District in the inaugural session of the West Virginia Senate in June 1863. During his tenure in the senate, which lasted until 1866, Maxwell served as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In his position as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he played a prominent role in the passage of the state's earliest legislation.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 he was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13th Ustaše Assault Company and by 1943 had attained {{a seat in the}} Croatian Parliament. Between 1942 and 1943 he {{was involved}} in recruiting students to join Ante Pavelić's personal bodyguard and was promoted to the rank of major. He held the position of head of the Ustaše University Headquarters and Ustaše Youth until January 1945, when he was appointed Commissioner for Physical Education and Sport. Blažeković fled Zagreb from the advancing Yugoslav Partisans in May 1945 and ended up in a refugee camp in Salzburg, Austria. In August, he was arrested by American forces who extradited him to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946. He was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947, sentenced to death, and executed the same day.|$|E
