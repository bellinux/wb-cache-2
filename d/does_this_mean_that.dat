Umberto Eco expressed delight that the award had been given to someone who [...] "does not belong to the traditional academic world." [...] However, 86-year-old Italian literary critic Carlo Bo was mystified: [...] "I must be too old to understand. What <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>That</b> everything changes, even literature has changed." [...] Fo's fellow Italian laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini expressed bewilderment when asked for her thoughts and wondered if Fo were Italian. Mario Luzi, a poet regarded as a likely next Italian recipient at the time, slammed the phone down on one reporter: [...] "I'll say only this. I've just about had it up to here!" [...] Reaction from the English-speaking world was also particularly fierce, with representatives from many English-speaking countries regarding Fo's work as unfashionable and outdated, belonging to the 1970s and 1980s. U.S. playwright Tony Kushner, however, expressed his approval, writing: [...] " [...] has dedicated his genius to making everything he touches debatable. [...] is brave and perhaps even reckless because it subjects Literature, and prizes, and Newspapers of Record, to the Fo effect". When he accepted the award, Fo presented a specially devised piece called Contra jogulatores obloquentes (Against Jesters of Irreverent Speech) alongside some paintings, with this later being described as [...] "undoubtedly the most flamboyantly theatrical and comical acceptance speech ever seen at the Swedish Academy." ...|$|E

6000|$|This fact, {{that the}} name of Elohim is applied to a ghost, or disembodied soul, {{conceived}} as {{the image of the}} body in which it once dwelt, is of no little importance. For {{it is well known that}} the same term was employed to denote the gods of the heathen, who were thought to have definite quasi-corporeal forms and to be as much real entities as any other Elohim. [5] The difference which was supposed to exist between the different Elohim was one of degree, not one of kind. Elohim was, in logical terminology, the genus of which ghosts, Chemosh, Dagon, Baal, and Jahveh were species. The Israelite believed Jahveh to be immeasurably superior to all other kinds of Elohim. The inscription on the Moabite stone shows that King Mesa held Chemosh to be, as unquestionably, the superior of Jahveh. But if Jahveh was thus supposed to differ only in degree from the undoubtedly zoomorphic or anthropomorphic [...] "gods of the nations," [...] why is it to be assumed that he also was not thought of as having a human shape? It is possible for those who forget that the time of the great prophetic writers is at least as remote from that of Saul as our day is from that of Queen Elizabeth, to insist upon interpreting the gross notions current in the earlier age and among the mass of the people by the refined conceptions promulgated by a few select spirits centuries later. But if we take the language constantly used concerning the Deity in the books of Genesis, Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, or Kings, in its natural sense (and I am aware of no valid reason which can be given for taking it in any other sense), there cannot, to my mind, be a doubt that Jahveh was conceived by those from whom the substance of these books is mainly derived, to possess the appearance and the intellectual and moral attributes of a man; and, indeed, of a man of just that type with which the Israelites were familiar in their stronger and intellectually abler rulers and leaders. In a well-known passage in Genesis (i. 27) Elohim is said to have [...] "created man in his own image, in the image of Elohim created he him." [...] It is [...] "man" [...] who is here said to be the image of Elohim--not man's soul alone, still less his [...] "reason," [...] but the whole man. It is obvious that for those who call a manlike ghost Elohim, there could be no difficulty in conceiving any other Elohim under the same aspect. And if there could be any doubt on this subject, surely it cannot stand in the face of what we find in the fifth chapter, where, immediately after a repetition of the statement that [...] "Elohim created man, in the likeness of Elohim made he him," [...] it is said that Adam begat Seth [...] "in his own likeness, after his image." [...] <b>Does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Seth resembled Adam only in a spiritual and figurative sense? And if that interpretation of the third verse of the fifth chapter of Genesis is absurd, why does it become reasonable in the first verse of the same chapter? ...|$|E
