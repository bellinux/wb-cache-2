50|$|Property {{crime in}} Winnipeg has dropped immensely over the years. From the early 1990s to mid-2000s, Winnipeg {{had a huge}} auto-theft problem, where the rate peaked at 2,165.0 per 100,000 residents, in 2006. For a comparison, the 2006 rate in Canada was 4.5 times lower, at 487 auto-thefts per 100,000 residents. From 2000 to 2007, the rate only dipped below 1,500.0, one time, very slightly, in 2002 at 1,497.8. These rates were by far {{the highest in the}} country. Because of these insanely high rates, Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI), to combat auto theft, {{established}} financial incentives for motor vehicle owners to install ignition <b>immobilisers</b> in their vehicles. It now requires owners of high-risk vehicles to install <b>immobilisers.</b> This has proven to be successful as the auto-theft rate has been on a constant drop since 2006 (in total a 562.1% drop). In 2008 the rate was 1,059.6, in 2009; 692.7, 2010; 555.8, 2011; 341.5 and in 2012 the rate was 327.0. Other than motor theft, other property crimes have been dropping as well. Regarding the latest statistics year (2012), the theft rate has dropped every year since 2003, the break & enter rate has been going down since 1991, although not on a constant slope, but a bumpy downhill ride, and the mischief rate has gone down every year since 2005. However the arson rate seems to be on a trend upwards from 2007.|$|R
40|$|Within the {{ambulance}} care in Uppsala County a vacuum splint {{is used to}} immobilize fractures on extremities. The research available on which method of immobilizing to prefer during pre-hospital treatment is limited.   The purpose of this pilot {{study was to examine}} the perceptions of {{the ambulance}} personal in Uppsala County on the issue of usability of SAM-splint and vacuum splint when immobilizing extremities. The project was also aimed at researching if SAM-splint could be seen as an alternative or a complement to vacuum splint, and to get an apprehension on any evident differences in patients’ perceived pain when treated with the two different approaches.   A descriptive comparative study was carried out. All patients, regardless of age and sex, with the need of immobilizing supposed fractures, were included.   Patients with suspected femur fracture, collum fracture, or where pre-hospital care was not possible or in question, was excluded. The collection of data was done using a questionnaire designed by the students responsible for the project. The ambulance personal completed the questionnaire after having concluded the treatment.   The result showed that all patients with fractures to their extremities were immobilized. There were no evident differences in how the personal experienced the application of the two methods of immobilizing, but rather they were generally both perceived as easy to use. In Uppsala, where the paramedics had access to both SAM-splint and vacuum splint, the SAM-splint was the predominant choice.   Based on this pilot study it can be established that the ambulance personal experienced the methods for immobilizing as easy in the event of fractures to the extremities. The SAM-splint is to be seen as a complement to the vacuum splint. Any difference in perceived patient rated pain connected to the different methods of immobilizing was not to deduce. Inom ambulanssjukvården i Uppsala län används vakuumsplint för <b>immobilisering</b> av extremitetsfrakturer.

Patienter med misstänkt femurfraktur, collumfraktur eller där prehospital <b>immobilisering</b> ej varit möjlig eller aktuell exkluderades. Insamling av data har skett med hjälp av ett frågeformulär utformat av projektansvariga studenter.

I Uppsala där ambulanspersonalen hade tillgång till både SAM-splint och vakuumsplint valdes övervägande SAM-splint.   Med detta pilotprojekt som grund kan sägas att ambulanspersonalen ansåg att immobiliseringsmetoderna var enkla att använda vid extremitetsfrakturer.

Syfte: Syftet med studien var att undersöka förekomsten av radiologiskt fastställda spinala skador hos patienter som immobiliserats prehospitalt efter trauman, samt på vilka indikationer denna <b>immobilisering</b> gjordes. Metod: En kvantitativ retrospektiv studie där 288 journaler granskades i ambulansens journalsystem MobiMed 3. 0 och i sjukhusets journalsystem Cosmic. Därefter analyserades resultaten i SPSS deskriptivt och grafiskt, med chi 2 -test samt med oberoende t-test. Resultat: Resultatet visade att av de 246 patienter som genomgått en radiologisk undersökning fanns en konstaterad spinal skada hos 48 patienter, vilket motsvarade cirka 17 %. Alla inkluderade patienter hade varit utsatta för trubbigt våld och den vanligaste indikationen för <b>immobilisering</b> var smärta/ömhet över kotpelaren.

This {{even though there}} is a lack of randomized controlled studies regarding this practice. Many studies points to the risks regarding spinal immobilization why it is of importance to further examine the practice. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of radiologically confirmed spinal injuries in patients immobilized after prehospital trauma and on what indications this immobilization was done Method: A quantitative retrospective study of 288 medical records acquired from the ambulance medical record system Mobimed 3. 0 and the hospital's medical record Cosmic were examined. The results were analyzed in SPSS descriptive and graphic, with chi 2 -test and independent t-test. Result: The results show that of the 246 patients who underwent a radiological examination, 46 had a spinal injury, approximately 17 %. All of the included patients had been exposed to blunt trauma and the most common indication for immobilization was pain/tenderness over the spine. The mean age of the patients with spinal injuries was significantly higher than the mean age of those without spinal injuries. A significant difference was also found between patients with pain/tenderness over the spine and spinal injury and those without spinal injury. Conclusion: A greater number of patients had a spinal injury in this study compared with previous studies, although the majority of the patients had no spinal injury. This means that the majority of the patients were exposed to a potentially unnecessary procedure that lacks scientifically evidence. More studies about immobilization are required to reduce the patients' potential suffering in connection with prehospital immobilization. ...|$|R

40|$|Foreword Despite {{significant}} {{reductions in}} recent years, acquisitive property crime remains {{the single largest}} crime category, with over 700, 000 offences recorded annually by police in Australia.

While there is a variety of ways of engaging with manufacturers, government regulation may ultimately be required if other approaches prove unsuccessful. This paper examines the lessons that can be learned {{as a result of the}} regulation of motor manufacturers to install electronic <b>immobilisers</b> on all new cars from July 2001, which has contributed to significant reductions in vehicle crime over the past decade. Eight generic lessons for future regulation of crime prevention design in consumer products are outlined.

50|$|The {{first phase}} of the project, the {{internal}} and external renovation of the station building, took place in 2013. Work was completed by December of that year and the building was re-opened on 4 January 2014. The new Raoul Mille library has been incorporated into the station's former waiting room and the building now houses multimedia rooms, meeting rooms and a climate-controlled storage basement. The second phase of the project involves the restoration of the train shed site. There are plans for a shopping centre, cinema, sports facilities, housing and underground car park, and the return of Gustave Eiffel's listed train shed. The plans were initially opposed by councillor Jean Claude Mari. However, he dropped legal proceedings in November 2014, allowing the city of Nice and the developers to begin work. The underground car park had been completed by the middle of 2016 and it is anticipated that the renovation of the former train shed will be completed by 2017 with other facilities expected to open during the second quarter of 2018.

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{synthesis}} {{of a range}} of siloxane functionalized Ru(arene) Cl(N,N) complexes allowing for the {{synthesis of}} novel MCM- 41 and SBA- 15 immobilized ruthenium(II) catalysts, is described in this thesis. Two distinctly different approaches were envisaged to achieve successful heterogenization of these siloxane functionalized complexes. Condensation of the siloxane functionalized complexes, C 2. 4 -C 2. 6 (siloxane tether attached to imine nitrogen) and C 3. 5 -C 3. 7 (siloxane tether via the arene ring), with the surface silanols of the synthesized silica support materials MCM- 41 and SBA- 15, afforded immobilized catalysts IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 6 (siloxane tether attached to imine nitrogen) and IC 4. 7 -IC 4. 12 (siloxane tether via the arene ring). Model and siloxane functionalized complexes C 2. 1 -C 2. 6 were prepared by the reaction of diimine Schiff base ligands L 2. 1 -L 2. 6 with the [Ru(p-cymene) 2 Cl 2] 2 dimer. A second, novel, approach involved the introduction of the siloxane tether on the arene ligand of the complex. Cationic arene functionalized Ru(arene) Cl(N,N) complexes, C 3. 1 -C 3. 4, were prepared with varying N,N ligands including bipyridine and a range of diimine ligands, with either propyl or diisopropyl(phenyl) substituents at the imine nitrogen (greater steric bulk around the metal center). The reaction of these propanol functionalized complexes with 3 -(triethoxysilyl) propyl isocyanate, afforded urethane linked siloxane functionalized complexes C 3. 5 -C 3. 8, where the siloxane tether is attached to the arene ring of the complex. The complexes were fully characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy, ESI-MS analysis and microanalysis. Suitable crystals for the alcohol functionalized complex C 3. 1 were obtained and the resultant orange crystals were analyzed by single crystal XRD. The heterogenized catalysts, IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 12, were characterized by smallangle powder X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption (BET) surface analysis to name but a few. ICP-OES allowed for direct comparison of the model and immobilized systems during catalysis ensuring that the ruthenium loadings were kept constant. The application of the model complexes C 2. 1 -C 2. 3 and C 3. 1 -C 3. 3, as well as their immobilized counterparts, IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 12, as catalyst precursors in the oxidative cleavage of alkenes (1 -octene and styrene), were investigated. The proposed active species for the cleavage reactions was confirmed to be RuO 4 (UV-Vis spectroscopy). In general it was observed that at lower conversions, aldehyde was formed as the major product. Increased reaction times resulted in the conversion of the formed aldehyde to the corresponding carboxylic acid. For the oxidative cleavage of 1 -octene using the systems with the siloxane tether attached to the imine nitrogen, the immobilized systems outperformed the model systems in all regards. Higher conversions and selectivities of 1 -octene towards heptaldehyde were obtained when using immobilized catalysts IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 6, as compared to their non-immobilized model counterparts (C 2. 1 -C 2. 3) at similar times. It was found that the immobilized catalysts could be used at ruthenium loadings as low as 0. 05 mol %, compared to the model systems where 0. 5 mol % ruthenium was required to give favorable results. Complete conversion of 1 -octene could be achieved at almost half the time needed when using the model systems as catalyst precursors. The activity of the model systems seems to increase with the increase in steric bulk around the metal center. These model and immobilized systems were also found to cleave styrene affording benzaldehyde in almost quantitative yield in some case (shorter reaction times). The systems, with the siloxane tether via the arene ring, were found to be less active for the cleavage of 1 -octene when compared to the above mentioned systems (siloxane tether attached to the imine nitrogen). The immobilized systems IC 4. 7 -IC 4. 12 performed well compared to their model counterparts, but could not achieve the same conversions at the shorter reaction times as were the case for IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 6. This lower activity was ascribed to the decreased stability of these systems in solution compared to the above mentioned systems with the tether attached to the imine nitrogen. This was confirmed by monitoring the conversion of the complex (catalyst precursor) to the active species in the absence of substrate (monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy). It was observed that model complex C 3. 1 could not be detected in solution after 1 hour, compared to complex C 2. 2 which was detected in solution even after 24 hours. Experiments were carried out where MCM- 41 was added to a solution of model complex C 2. 2 under typical cleavage reaction conditions. A dramatic increase in the conversion was achieved when compared to a reaction in the absence of MCM- 41. An investigation into the effect of the support material on the formation of the expected active species was carried out using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The presence of the active species, RuO 4, could be observed at shorter reaction times in the presence of MCM- 41. This suggested that the silica support facilitates the formation of the active species from the complex during the reaction, therefore resulting in an increased activity. It was also observed that RuO 4 is present in solution in reactions where the immobilized catalyst systems are used after very short reaction times, compared to the prolonged times required for this to occur as is the case for the model systems. Model and immobilized catalysts, C 2. 1 -C 2. 3 and IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 6, were also applied as catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of various ketones. The immobilized systems could be recovered and reused for three consecutive runs before the catalysts became inactive (transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone). Moderate to good conversion were obtained using the immobilized systems, but were found to be less active their model counterparts C 2. 1 -C 2. 3. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die sintese van `n reeks siloksaan gefunksioneerde Ru(areen) Cl(N,N) komplekse, wat die sintese van nuwe MCM- 41 en SBA- 15 geimmobiliseerede rutenium(II) katalisatore toelaat, word in hierdie tesis beskryf.

Model en siloksaan gefunksioneerde komplekse C 2. 6 -C 2. 6 is berei deur die reaksie tussen Schiff basis ligande, L 2. 1 -L 2. 6, en die [Ru(p-simeen) 2 Cl 2] 2 dimeer. `n Tweede, nuwe benadering wat die sintese van komplekse met die siloksaan ketting geheg aan die areen ligand behels, is ook gevolg. Kationiese areen gefunksioneerde Ru(areen) Cl(N,N) komplekse, C 3. 1 -C 3. 4, is berei deur die N,N ligande rondom die metaal sentrum te wissel vanaf bipiridien tot `n reeks diimien ligande met propiel of diisopropielfeniel substituente by die imien stikstof. Hierdie propanol gefunksioneerde komplekse is met 3 -(triëtoksiesiliel) propiel-isosianaat gereageer om sodoende die uretaan gekoppelde siloksaan gefunksioneerde komplekse C 3. 5 -C 3. 8 op te lewer. Al die komplekse is ten volle gekaraktariseer deur van FT-IR spektroskopie, KMR (1 H and 13 C) spektroskopie, ESI-MS analise en mikroanalise gebruik te maak. In die geval van model kompleks C 3. 1, is `n kristalstruktuurbepaling ook uitgevoer. Die heterogene katalisatore, IC 4. 1 - IC 4. 12, is gekaraktariseer deur poeier X-straaldiffraksie, skandeer- en transmissieelektronmikroskopie, termogravimetriese analise (TGA), induktief gekoppelde plasma optiese emissie spektroskopie (IKP-OES) en BET oppervlak analises, om net `n paar te noem. IKP-OES het ons toegelaat om `n direkte vergelyking te tref tussen die model en geimmobiliseerde sisteme tydens die katalise reaksies. Model komplekse C 2. 1 -C 2. 3 en C 3. 1 -C 3. 3, sowel as hul geimmobiliseerde eweknieë IC 4. 1 - IC 4. 12, is vir die oksidatiewe splyting van alkene (1 -okteen en stireen) getoets. Die voorgestelde aktiewe spesie wat tydens hierdie reaksie gevorm word, RuO 4, is bevestig deur van UV-Vis spektroskopie gebruik te maak. Oor die algemeen is dit gevind dat aldehied oorheersend gevorm word by laer omsetting. Wanneer die reaksietyd verleng is, is daar gevind dat die aldehied na die ooreenstemmende karboksielsuur omgeskakel is. Wanneer die geimmobiliseerde katalisatore gebruik is tydens die oksidatiewe splitsing van 1 -okteen, het die sisteme, met die ketting geheg aan die imien stikstof, deurgangs beter as die model sisteme gevaar. Hoër omskakelings van 1 -okteen en hoë selektiwiteite vir heptaldehied is behaal wanneer die geimobiliseerded katalisatore IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 6 met die nie-geimmobiliseerde model sisteme (C 2. 1 - C 2. 3) vergelyk is by dieselfde reaksietye. Die geimobiliseerde sisteme kon by rutenium beladings van so laag as 0. 05 mol % gebruik word. Dit is in teenstelling met die model sisteme waar 0. 5 mol % rutenium nodig was om die reaksie suksesvol te laat plaasvind. Die totale omskakeling van 1 -okteen is bereik in die helfte van die tyd wat nodig was wanneer die model sisteme gebruik is. Dit is gevind dat die aktiwiteit van die model sisteme toeneem met `n toename in die steriese grootte van die ligand rondom die metaal. Beide die model en geimmobilseerde sisteme kon ook gebruik word vir die oksidatiewe splyting van stireen. Bensaldehied kon in kwantitiewe opbrengs gevorm word in sommige gevalle. `n Laer aktiwiteit vir die oksidatiewe splyting van 1 -okteen is vir die sisteme waar die siloksaan ketting aan die areen ligand geheg is, waargeneem. Hoewel die geimmobiliseerde sisteme IC 4. 7 -IC 4. 12 beter as hul model eweknieë gevaar het, kon die aktiwiteite wat met IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 6 bereik is nie geewenaar word nie. Hierdie laer aktiwiteit is toegeskryf aan die verlaagde stabiliteit van dié sisteme in oplossing in vergelyking met IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 6 (ketting geheg aan die imine stikstof). Die stabiliteit van beide sisteme is getoets deur die omskakeling van die model komplekse (C 2. 2 en C 3. 1; katalise voorgangers) na die aktiewe spesie te monitor (UV-Vis spektroskopie). Na 1 uur kon die model kompleks C 3. 1 nie meer in die oplossing waargeneem word nie. In teenstelling kon model kompleks C 2. 2 nog selfs na 24 uur in die oplossing bespeur word. Om die rol van die silika materiale tydens die reaksie te ondersoek, is `n eksperiment uitgevoer waar MCM- 41 by `n oplossing van kompleks C 2. 2 gevoeg is. `n Toename in die omskakeling van 1 -okteen is waargeneem in vergelyking met `n reaksie waar geen silika teenwoordig was nie. UV-Vis spektroskopie is gebruik om die invloed van die silika op die vorming van die aktiewe spesie te ondersoek. In eksperimente waar MCM- 41 teenwoordig was, kon die aktiewe spesie, RuO 4, by baie korter reaksietye waargeneem word. Dit wil blyk of die silika materiaal die vorming van die aktiewe spesie vanaf die kompleks aanhelp en sodoende `n toename in die spoed van die reaksie bewerkstellig. RuO 4 kon ook by baie korter reaksietye waargeneem word wanneer die geimmobiliseerde sisteme gebruik is. Beide model en geimmobiliseerde sisteme, C 2. 1 -C 2. 3 en IC 4. 1 -IC 4. 6, is getoets vir die oordrag hidrogenering van verskilende ketone. Dit was moontlik om die geimmobiliseerde sisteme drie keer te herwin en vir daaropvolgende reaksies te gebruik. Vir die geimmobiliseerde sisteme kon egter slegs gemiddelde omskakelings verkryg word en het swakker gevaar as hul model ekwivalente sisteme, C 2. 1 -C 2. 3...|$|R
