Furthermore, we study the impact of female directors on environmental investment in enterprises with different types of ownership and industry attributes. Empirical studies show that when there are only 1 or 2 female directors on the board, no significant impact on the scale of corporate environmental investment can be seen. However, when the number reaches at least 3, female directors have a significantly positive impact on the scale of corporate environmental investment. This confirms critical-mass theory; meanwhile, we find that the empirical results do <b>not</b> indicate any <b>significant</b> correlation when the variable of female directors is measured by the proportion of female directors and the Blau index of gender balance.

40|$|As being {{experienced}} {{in many developing}} countries, Nigeria has been experiencing confirmed capital flight {{which has been a}} problem believed to have adversely affected domestic investment. The existence of this problem is further accentuated by the financial globalisation process which has enabled capital to flow more freely than before between countries of the world. This study examined the relationship between capital flight in Nigeria and investment during the period of financial globalisation with data from 1970 to 2007. The main variables used were exchange rates, investment, Kaopen, financial savings, external reserves and interest rate differential among others. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) technique is used in determining the significant variables in investment and financial globalisation, while Vector Error Correction Mechanism (VECM) was adopted to determine the long-term relationship between investment and capital flight. The study finds that the rate of exchange is significant in investment and financial globalisation but <b>not</b> <b>significant</b> in World Bank’s and Dooley’s estimates of capital flight. The different estimates of capital flight do not significantly impact negatively against investment though it has a long-term negative impact on external reserves of the country. The Dooley’s definition of capital flight is found to more significant in the Nigeria case than the World Bank’s as its impact is negative on the <b>investment,</b> though <b>not</b> <b>significant.</b> This signifies the role of errors and omissions in distorting the estimates of capital flight in Nigeria. The other determinant of capital flight is the interest rate differential in the co-integrating equation. Unusually, the Kaopen measure is significant in the Nigeria’s financial globalisation scenario, which calls for careful foreign exchange rate management to determine the rate of the exchange. The study recommends a cleaner floating of the domestic currency to reduce capital flight, the improvement of the business environment and an increase in the autonomous investment by both public and private sectors in the economy to induce other domestic investments, which will facilitate inflow of capital...|$|R

30|$|Pollution {{abatement}} <b>investments</b> are <b>not</b> statistically <b>significant</b> {{for any of}} {{the types}} of inefficiency scores that are examined. This result indicates that a large quantity of pollution abatement investment decreases capital productivity in manufacturing sectors. One of the reasons for this effect may be that legal considerations involving environmental regulations caused many factories to purchase a large quantity of pollution treatment equipment. However, due to the weakness of regulation implementation in China, these factories only use the abatement equipment during certain specific moments known as a “show”. This practice allows the factories in question to reduce their operational costs of running the equipment. Another reason for the lack of a significant relationship between pollution abatement investments and inefficiency scores may be that our data only reflect the quantity of investments that were devoted to end-of-pipe treatments. Although end-of-pipe treatment equipment directly affects pollution reduction, it does not directly affect the total amount of pollution emissions. This result suggests that environmental regulations and the monitoring of pollutant emissions should be more strictly implemented in China.|$|R

There is mounting concern over rising unemployment and depleting per capita income accruing there-from. We look at the issue in this paper from a long run perspective by examining the nature of the relationship between population growth and a plethora of investment indicators: public, private, foreign and domestic investments. Using asymmetric panels on data spanning from 1977 to 2007, we investigate effects of population growth on investment from Granger causality models. Our findings reveal a long-run positive causal linkage from population growth to only public investment. But for domestic investment, permanent fluctuations in human capital affect changes in other forms of <b>investments.</b> <b>Not</b> unexpected, no <b>significant</b> short-run causal relationship is found. For economic implications, sampled countries should take family planning and birth control policies seriously. Though growth in population may appear not to have an impact on investment in the short spell, in the distant future, it strangles public finances. Therefore measures should be adopted such that, rising unemployment rate resulting from population growth be accommodated by private sector investments. Seemingly, structural adjustments policies implemented by sampled countries have not had the desired investment effects. ...|$|R

Spousal caregivers for partners with chronic illness often report experiencing relational losses in their marital relationships that {{cause them to}} feel less like a spouse {{and more like a}} parent. Because of relationship changes, caregiving spouses may begin to desire companionship and seek extramarital relationships. Through the lens of the investment model and data from Wave 1 of the 2005 - 2006 National Social Life Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), this dissertation investigated the relationship between satisfaction, attitudes towards alternatives, and investment and attitudes towards infidelity. Results from a series of multiple regression analyses suggest that: (a) Individuals identifying as Hispanic expressed more permissive attitudes towards infidelity and those who attended church regularly reported less permissive attitudes towards infidelity, (b) Rewards and not costs were associated with satisfaction in spousal caregivers, and (c) Attitudes towards alternatives was the most influential factor in determining attitudes towards infidelity. Surprisingly, satisfaction and <b>investment</b> were <b>not</b> <b>significant</b> in this sample. These findings suggest that these investment model concepts may hold different meanings for spousal caregivers. However, as this is the first testing of the investment model in a sample of spousal caregivers, further research is needed before conclusions can be made regarding the appropriateness of the investment model when examining relationships in the context of chronic illness among aging couples. Future research should expand on these findings by conducting qualitative and longitudinal research to deepen our understanding of this phenomenon and create therapeutic interventions for working with aging couples experiencing chronic illness.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine whether the {{proceeds}} from stock option exercises can influence on investment in Taiwanese listed firms. Since the proportion of high-tech firms account for the most in Taiwan, the study expects that the sensitivity of R&D expenses to the cash inflows received from exercising stock options is significantly positive, In addition, high percentage of firms in Taiwan are multinational enterprises which tend to invest in oversees where the costs of running businesses are lower. Therefore, the study predicts the effect of exercising stock options on FDI is also statistically positive. The data is collected from Taiwanese Economic Journal database, including 2, 218 firm-year stock option observations from 402 listed firms between 2003 and 2009. Other financial data are merged with the stock option data by hand collecting. The final sample used in the analysis comes to 2, 814 firm-year observations. The panel data analysis is used in the study. Furthermore, in order to investigate whether the influence of the proceeds from stock option exercises on investment can vary cross different financing constraints, the regression discontinuity approach is also employed. The study expects that the effect of the stock option proceeds on investment is greater for firms facing high cost financing. The results indicate the influence of the stock option proceeds on R&D is larger than the influence on FDI. The coefficient estimates explain that $ 0. 948 of each dollar of the proceeds from stock option exercises is assigned to R&D expenditures and 0. 498 of each dollar of the stock option exercise proceeds is allocated to FDI spending. However, the correlation between the proceeds from stock option exercises and <b>investment</b> is <b>not</b> <b>significant</b> when firms face costly external financing...|$|R

50|$|Through most of {{the postwar}} period foreign <b>investment</b> was <b>not</b> a <b>significant</b> part of Japan's {{external}} economic relations. Both domestic and foreign investments were carefully controlled by government regulations, which kept the investment flows small. These controls applied to direct investment {{in the creation of}} subsidiaries under the control of a parent company, portfolio investment, and lending. Controls were motivated by the desire to prevent foreigners (mainly Americans) from gaining ownership of the economy when Japan was in a weak position after World War II, and by concerns over the balance of payments deficits. Beginning in the late 1960s, these controls were gradually loosened, and the process of deregulationn accelerated and continued throughout the 1980s. The result was a dramatic increase in capital movements, with the biggest change occurring in outflows—investments by Japanese in other countries. By the end of the 1980s, Japan had become a major international investor. Because the country was a newcomer to the world of overseas investment, this development led to new forms of tension with other countries, including criticism of highly visible Japanese acquisitions in the United States and elsewhere.|$|R

The work aims to investigate the costs and how the choice of ventilationsystem affects building projects during a long-term period. This report covers costssuch as investment, maintenance and energy but also how they affect residents andbuilders. Building regulations for energy consumption are expected to be tougher;therefore a comparison of two different heat recovery ventilation systems(HRV-system) was made. One system is based on a centrally placed unit that coversthe whole buildings ventilation through vertical shafts. The second system is based onapartment placed unit that only covers the individual apartment’s ventilation. The unitmakes it possible for the individual user to control the ventilation flow. The method used for comparison of the costs was Life Cycle Cost (LCC). It results inthe total cost during a selected calculation period of 20 years, where yearly basedcosts as energy and maintenance is included. Two housing projects in central Uppsalawere chosen as a reference. They were similar in design but with the two differentsystems of ventilation. A questionnaire was handed out to provide experience fromresidents with apartment units. The results were used in the analysis of the systemsand to determine its pros and cons. Information of costs was collected from different companies and resulted intocustomized spreadsheets to determine the cost per apartment. The result shows thatthe difference in <b>investment</b> is <b>not</b> <b>significant</b> between the systems but is big inmaintenance and energy. The biggest difference is maintenance where the apartmentsystems many service points is increasing the cost. Energy consumption for theapartment system leads to higher energy costs than with a central system, even if thecontrol function is used. The explanation is that a central systems fans have lowerpower usage and the heat recovery is more efficient then an apartment system. The conclusion is that a central system has a lower total cost compared to anapartment system during the calculation period. A reason for choosing the apartmentsystem would be if a need to maximize living space is a priority, and the developingphase of the project is well thought thru.

According {{to the findings of}} our empirical study, reduction of the demand uncertainty generally can improve the B 2 B system performances of cost saving, operational efficiency, satisfaction, and new business opportunity. Meanwhile, we also found that companies with low uncertainty on the factor of supply have better B 2 B system performances of turnover and market share than the ones with high uncertainty. However, the uncertainty factors of best-selling books, firm investment, and partner <b>investment</b> may <b>not</b> have <b>significant</b> impacts on the B 2 B system performances. From the perspective of information processing capabilities, enhancement of purchasing/sales/reconciliation functions is critical to the B 2 B systems if the performances of cost saving, turnover, and satisfaction are the most serious concerns of book publishing companies.
