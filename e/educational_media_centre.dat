50|$|Community Radio and Commonwealth <b>Educational</b> <b>Media</b> <b>Centre</b> for Asia (CEMCA): from 2007 onwards, with CEMCA {{being the}} {{implementing}} agency and DR R Sreedher as its director, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India organized more than 40 awareness workshops {{throughout the country}} to create an atmosphere for getting more organisations {{to apply for a}} license for CR. By June 2012, the government had received more than one thousand applications and 400 of them got the Letters of intent LOI. While the initial phase saw more stations in educational campuses an analysis of the 400 LOIs brings out the fact that two thirds of the LOIs have gone to civil society organisations. They find it difficult to launch the station, due to lack of funds, training, human resources and the difficulty in getting the frequency cleared by the WPC wing of the Ministry of Telecommunications. In July 2014, Government of India announced a scheme to support community radio stations and allocated 100 crore for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Rand Afrikaans University, Department of Education, 30 August 1977 The term "Educational {{technology}}" {{is fairly}} new in South Africa. Educational technology {{is much more}} diversified than audio-visual aids. Audio-visual aids which are not meaningfully integrated in instruction, usually contributes very little to real educational innovation and improvement because 1. hardware is emphasised {{to the detriment of}} software; and 2. the great emphasis on hardware leads to frequent swings from the use of one apparatus (e. g. the 16 mm film projector) to another (e. g. television). Educational technology (as opposed to audio-visual aids) is the technically scientific application in teaching, with special reference to the aim and structure of education. Thus mention is being made of the integration of <b>media</b> in instruction. <b>Educational</b> technology can, among other things, come into its own in a <b>Centre</b> for <b>Educational</b> <b>Media.</b> A <b>Centre</b> for <b>Educational</b> <b>Media</b> mainly has the following developmental functions: research, planning, production, evaluation, distribution, utilization and promotion. It also has the task of training with regard to Educational Technology.
