500|$|A {{new video}} {{entitled}} [...] "Call to Action" [...] appeared on YouTube on January 28, 2008, calling for protests outside Church of Scientology centers on February 10, 2008. As {{with the previous}} videos, the two-minute video used a synthesized computer voice and featured stock footage of clouds and sky. The video {{was accompanied by a}} text transcript with British English spelling. The video denied that the group was composed of [...] "super hackers", stating: [...] "Contrary to the assumptions of the media, Anonymous is not 'a group of super hackers.' ... Anonymous is everyone and <b>everywhere.</b> <b>We</b> have no leaders, no single entity directing us." [...] The video said that Project Chanology participants include [...] "individuals {{from all walks of life}} ... united by an awareness that someone must do the right thing." [...] Specific controversies involving the CoS were cited in the video as the explanation for actions by Anonymous.|$|E
500|$|The band {{sought to}} record the album in an {{unconventional}} setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired {{to set up a}} recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house. The band decided that they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said [...] "There are definitely ghosts in the house," [...] and Frusciante felt they were [...] "very friendly. We [...] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness <b>everywhere</b> <b>we</b> go in this house." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{key point}} in Moore's career came {{when she was}} cast by Steven Spielberg to star as {{paleontologist}} Dr. Sarah Harding in —the sequel to his 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park. Filming the big-budget production was a new experience for Moore, and she has said she enjoyed herself [...] "tremendously". It was a physically demanding role, with the actress commenting, [...] "There was so much hanging <b>everywhere.</b> <b>We</b> hung off everything available, plus we climbed, ran, jumped off things... it was just non-stop." [...] The Lost World (1997) finished {{as one of the}} ten highest-grossing films in history to that point, and was pivotal in making Moore a sought-after actress: [...] "Suddenly I had a commercial film career," [...] she said. The Myth of Fingerprints was her second film released in 1997. During its production she met her future husband in director Bart Freundlich. Later that year, Moore made a cameo appearance in the dark comedy Chicago Cab.|$|E
500|$|The Tom Cruise {{video is}} {{referred}} to specifically {{at the start of}} the Anonymous YouTube video posting, and is characterized as a [...] "propaganda video". The video utilizes a synthesized voice and shows floating cloud images using a time lapse method as the speaker addresses the leaders of Scientology directly: [...] "We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form..." [...] The video goes on to state: [...] "We recognize you as serious opponents, and do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail forever against the angry masses of the body politic. Your choice of methods, your hypocrisy, and the general artlessness of your organization have sounded its death knell. You have nowhere to hide because we are <b>everywhere...</b> <b>We</b> are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us." [...] By January 25, 2008, only four days after its release, the video had been viewed 800,000 times, and by February 8, 2008 had been viewed over 2million times. Author Warren Ellis called the video [...] "creepy in and of itself" [...] and a [...] "manifesto, declaration of war, sharp political film".|$|E
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue <b>everywhere</b> <b>we</b> went." [...] In June 1995, the band was {{scheduled}} to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
