RESULTS: Compared to distance correction, monovision resulted in a large reduction in stereoacuity from 17 " to 87 ", a slower walking velocity (p = 0. 001), a reduced horizontal toe clearance of the step edge (p = 0. 035) and, for trials when monovision correction occurred first, a 33...|$|R

Twenty-three myopic subjects (18 and 23 years old) with uncorrected vision had their visual acuity assessed with both standard and reversed contrast optotypes. The study also included 10 myopes with contact lens as well as habitual spectacle correction. The visual acuity for myopes with uncorrected vision was better with reversed than standard contrast optotypes.

40|$|Achromatic {{combinations}} of a diffractive Phase Fresnel Lens and a refractive correcting element {{have been proposed}} for X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy and for microlithography, but considerations of absorption often dictate that the refractive component be given a stepped profile, resulting in a double Fresnel lens. The imaging performance of corrected Fresnel lenses, with and without `stepping' is investigated and the trade-off between resolution and useful bandwidth in different circumstances is discussed. Provided the focal ratio is large, <b>correction</b> <b>lenses</b> made of low atomic number materials {{can be used with}} X-rays in the range approximately 10 [...] 100 keV without stepping.

40|$|Abstract—Methods for {{estimating}} {{motion in}} video sequences {{that are based}} on the optical flow equation (OFE) assume that the scene illumination is uniform and that the imaging optics are ideal. When these assumptions are appropriate, these methods can be very accurate, but when they are not, the accuracy of the motion field drops off accordingly. This paper extends the models upon which the OFE methods are based to include irregular, time-varying illumination models and models for imperfect optics that introduce vignetting, gamma, and geometric warping, such as are likely to be found with inexpensive PC cameras. The resulting optimization framework estimates the motion parameters, illumination parameters, and camera parameters simultaneously. In some cases these models can lead to nonlinear equations which must be solved iteratively; in other cases, the resulting optimization problem is linear. For the former case an efficient, hierarchical, iterative framework is provided {{that can be used to}} implement the motion estimator.

5000|$|Since the {{technology}} became {{widespread in the}} 1970s, SLRs have become the main photographic instrument used by dedicated amateur photographers and professionals. Some photographers of static subjects (such as architecture, landscape, and some commercial subjects), however, prefer view cameras because of the capability to control perspective.

Perspective <b>correction</b> <b>lenses</b> are available in the 35 mm and medium formats to correct this distortion with film cameras, and it can also be corrected after the fact with photo software when using digital cameras. The photographer can also extend the bellows to its full length, tilt the front standard and perform photomacrography (commonly known as 'macro photography'), producing a sharp image with depth-of-field without stopping down the lens diaphram.|$|R
