500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band.

In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>loved</b> it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E
