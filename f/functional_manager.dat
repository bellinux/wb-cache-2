40|$|This paper {{shows that}} top {{management}} structures in large US firms radically {{changed since the}} mid- 1980 s. While the number of managers reporting directly to the CEO doubled, the growth was driven primarily by <b>functional</b> <b>managers</b> rather than general managers. Using panel data on senior management positions, we explore the relationship between changes in executive team composition, firm diversification, and IT investments - which arguably alter returns to exploiting synergies through corporate-wide coordination by <b>functional</b> <b>managers</b> in headquarters. We find {{that the number of}} <b>functional</b> <b>managers</b> closer to the product (product functions i. e., marketing, R&D) increase as firms focus their businesses, while the number of <b>functional</b> <b>managers</b> farther from the product (administrative functions i. e., finance, law, HR) increase with IT investments. Finally, we show that general manager pay decreases as <b>functional</b> <b>managers</b> join the executive team suggesting a shift in activities from general to <b>functional</b> <b>managers</b> - a phenomenon we term functional centralization...|$|R

This integration often requires making <b>functional</b> <b>managers</b> responsible for implementing standardization, thereby limiting business-unit managers’ authority.

40|$|Multi-product rms {{create value}} by sharing {{resources}} to exploit scale economies in functional areas (e. g. manufacturing). We study the organizational barriers that thwart attempts to capture these synergies by integrating related business units. This integra-tion often {{requires that the}} relevant functional area be reassigned from business unit <b>managers</b> to <b>functional</b> <b>managers,</b> who are then responsible for implementing or propos-ing standardization across units. Given this division of labor, realizing value-increasing synergies involves a trade-o ¤ between motivation and coordination. The reason is that motivating managers requires that incentives be narrowly focused around managersarea of responsibility, resulting in <b>functional</b> <b>managers</b> who are endogenously biased toward excessive standardization, and, in turn, in business unit managers who misrepresent local market information to limit standardization. As a result, integration may be value-destroying when motivation is su ¢ ciently important.
