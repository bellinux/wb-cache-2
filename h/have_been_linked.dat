5|$|A few ASD cases <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) {{during the first}} eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> with disease.|$|E
50|$|The paint sludge <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to {{contamination}} {{of food and}} water sources with lead and benzene. The contamination <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to nosebleeds, leukemia, and other ailments among the community.|$|R

5|$|Lead affects {{every one}} of the body's organ systems, {{especially}} the nervous system, but also the bones and teeth, the kidneys, and the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems. Hearing loss and tooth decay <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to lead exposure, as have cataracts. Intrauterine and neonatal lead exposure promote tooth decay. Aside from the developmental effects unique to young children, the health effects experienced by adults are similar to those in children, although the thresholds are generally higher.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphisms (normal variations) in {{particular}} genes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> {{with an increased}} risk of severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as TNFα, mannan-binding lectin, CTLA4, TGFβ, DC-SIGN, PLCE1, and particular forms of human leukocyte antigen from gene variations of HLA-B. A common genetic abnormality, especially in Africans, known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, appears to increase the risk. Polymorphisms in the genes for the vitamin D receptor and FcγR seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.|$|E
5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials {{and the destruction of}} medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records. Research by the TRC revealed that at least 6,000 students had died, mostly from disease.|$|E

5|$|Thought to have {{originated}} in the Far East, toy spaniels were first seen in Europe during the 16th century. They were made famous by their association with King Charles II of England (16301685) and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> with English royalty {{since the time of}} Queen Mary I (15161558). Members of the breed have been owned by Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, and Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Among {{other events}} in the United States that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to the {{conspiracy}} is the Black Tom explosion when, {{on the night of}} 30 July 1916, saboteurs blew up nearly 2 million tons of arms and ammunition at the Black Tom terminal at New York harbour awaiting shipment in support of the British war effort. Although blamed solely on German agents at the time, later investigations by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence {{in the aftermath of the}} Annie Larsen incident unearthed links between the Black Tom explosion and Franz von Papen, the Irish movement, the Indian movement as well as Communist elements active in the United States.|$|E

50|$|Criminal {{offenders}} {{have substantial}} impairment in {{elements of the}} neuromoral circuit. Dysfunction {{in the area of}} the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to the antisocial features of impulsivity and lack of social inhibition. Dysfunction to the anterior cingulate <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to low emotional processing and increased aggressiveness. As in the case of Michael below, damage to the orbitofrontal cortex <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to antisocial and criminal behavior. Damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to antisocial behavior, poor and amoral decision making, and reduced autonomic response to emotionally arousing stimuli. Evidence relating to the function of the neuromoral circuit <b>has</b> <b>been</b> proposed to be a new avenue towards the justice of criminal offenders. Such an application includes the ability to detect lying through fMRI.|$|R

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and puberty, may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to acne, including the androgens testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); high levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E

5|$|In {{the centre}} of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; {{although}} it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> by successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting bascule bridge allowing boats to access the inner harbour. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Weymouth {{for the first time on}} 26 January 1869. A boathouse was built with a slipway by the harbour and is still in use, although the lifeboat is now moored at a pontoon.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and {{ingestion}} {{may lead}} to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds. All inorganic lead compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as probably carcinogenic to humans (Category2A). They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer, brain cancer and lung cancer in humans, although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic. Lead is known to substitute for zinc {{in a number of}} enzymes, including δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.|$|E
5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> {{to an increase in}} the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} enzyme activity <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to {{disease of the}} adrenal gland. Several mutations in PRKACA {{have been found in}} patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2011, former Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr {{was found}} dead {{at his home in}} Salt Lake City. Police told Reuters they were called to Starr's home at 1:42pm and found his body; Starr was 44. Reports later {{surfaced}} that Starr's roommate had seen him mixing methadone and anxiety medication hours before he {{was found dead}}. Later reports indicated Starr's death may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to two different types of antidepressants prescribed to him by his doctor. A public memorial was held for Starr at the Seattle Center's International Fountain on March 20, 2011. A private memorial was also held, which Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney attended according to Mike Inez.|$|E
5|$|Several Scottish clans {{that were}} {{historically}} seated on Lewis {{have traditionally been}} ascribed a descent from Óláfr. The MacLeods claim a descent from Leod (Old Norse Ljótr), who is popularly {{said to have been}} a son of Óláfr. Clan traditions dating to the late 18th century link Leod with Óláfr, and heraldic evidence dating to the late 17th century may be the earliest indication of such a claim; however, recent research into the MacLeods' traditional ancestry has determined such claims of descent from Óláfr are unsupportable. Other Lewis clans <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> with Óláfr in various traditions, such as the Morrisons of Ness and their adversaries the Macaulays of Uig, although there is no supporting evidence that Óláfr left any descendants on the island.|$|E
