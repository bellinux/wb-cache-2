25|$|There are {{two types}} of hybrid formats which contain {{standard}} DVD-Video format video for playback in regular DVD players, and HD DVD video for playback in high definition on HD DVD players. The Combo disc is a <b>dual</b> <b>sided</b> disc with one side DVD and the other HD DVD, each of which can have up to two layers. The Twin disc is a single sided disc that can have up to three layers, with up to two layers dedicated to either DVD or HD DVD. These hybrid discs make retail marketing and shelf space management easier. Another advantage is hardware cross-compatibility. The average consumer does {{not have to worry about}} whether or not they can play a hybrid DVD: any standard home DVD player can access the DVD-encoded content and any HD DVD player can access both the DVD- and HD DVD-encoded content.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} {{a process for}} cost effective, <b>dual</b> <b>sides</b> {{interconnect}} with through silicon vias (TSV’s) is presented. The process flow is optimized for straightforward process integration, not for high density, making it suitable for MEMS applications. It requires only conventional backend processing like PECVD oxide and PVD metallization. To obtain a good PVD step coverage, low aspect ratios tapered through silicon vias are required. Gray-scale lithography is employed to control the via profiles. A process sequence is developed to add the double side metallization process including the TSV’s to an existing single side metallization process. To measure the low-ohmic TSV’s interconnects, special Kelvin structure with <b>dual</b> <b>side</b> interconnect are designed and fabricated on 300 μm thick wafers. A low median value of 36 mΩ was found demonstrating {{the capabilities of the}} process...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of an {{indirect}} heat pump assisted solar domestic hot water (I-HPASDHW) system, where the investigated configuration is called the <b>Dual</b> <b>Side</b> I-HPASDHW system. The study outlines {{the development of an}} Experimental Test Unit (ETU), and focuses on the experimental validation of TRNSYS models. Shortcomings of the system design realized throughout the validation process, as well as weaknesses in the control schemes used to operate the system are also provided. A description of the <b>Dual</b> <b>Side</b> I-HPASDHW system is provided along with the design intent of the system. The corresponding ETU is presented in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ETU’s simulation capabilities. Components of the ETU, such as the heat pump, heat exchanger, and domestic hot water (DHW) tank are characterized in order to provide input data for built-in TRNSYS models, and to develop custom TRNSYS models for the heat pump and heat exchanger. Heat exchanger performance is modelled with a linear correlation, while the heat pump performance is mapped by applying experimental data to three-dimensional surface fitting software. For the purpose of validation, the ETU is used to simulate the performance of the <b>Dual</b> <b>Side</b> I-HPASDHW system under a realistic control scheme. Four full day tests are conducted using data from a fall, winter, and summer day. The full day summer test is repeated with and without electrical backup heating. The TRNSYS model of the <b>Dual</b> <b>Side</b> system is tuned in order to provide the closest match possible between the computer simulation and the measured performance of the ETU. Experimental tests were compared with TRNSYS simulations to reveal some disparity in the results. The majority of simulation error was attributed to inaccuracy in modeling DHW tank temperatures and water circulation patterns. The disparity created by the DHW tank model only resulted in substantial performance deviation when inaccurate DHW temperatures were used directly for vital control decisions. Conclusions were drawn suggesting that the TRNSYS model of the ETU was valid for a majority of operating conditions, often matching experimental tests well within experimental uncertainty. Caution was recommended towards the use of the developed TRNSYS model, where techniques were recommended for tracking and minimizing substantial simulation errors. Several key performance issues affecting the <b>Dual</b> <b>Side</b> I-HPASDHW system were targeted with recommendations for design and control alterations, along with future improvement and optimization studies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for the {{visualization}} and exploration of items associated with multi-value attributes {{for which there is}} overlap of attribute values across the data set. ArchivesZ is a prototype featuring this method and has been designed to support exploration of the metadata describing archival collections. Archival materials are unique and organized into groups, usually based on who created the materials. These groups may vary in size from a small number of folders to many hundreds of boxes. When describing archival materials, archivists note the range of years covered by the records, the size of the collection and the high level subjects of the records. One common metric for communicating the size of a collection is linear feet. A single linear foot is one foot of shelf space occupied by records. ArchivesZ leverages a unique <b>dual</b> <b>sided</b> histogram to support exploration of the multiple subjects assigned to each collection. It combines the <b>dual</b> <b>sided</b> histogram with a more traditional histogram displaying year data to permit tightly coupled, multi-dimensional browsing of subject and time period metadata. By representing the distribution of subjects and time periods using the metric of total aggregate linear feet of associated collections, ArchivesZ permits users to get a better sense of total available research materials than they would by viewing a standard search result list...|$|E
