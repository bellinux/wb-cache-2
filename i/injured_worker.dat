25|$|People who {{are driving}} {{as part of}} their work duties are an {{important}} road user category. First, workers themselves are at risk of road traffic injury. Contributing factors include fatigue and long work hours, delivery pressures, distractions from mobile phones and other devices, lack of training to operate the assigned vehicle, vehicle defects, use of prescription and non-prescription medications, medical conditions, and poor journey planning. Death, disability, or injury of a family wage earner due to road traffic injury, in addition to causing emotional pain and suffering, creates economic hardship for the <b>injured</b> <b>worker</b> and family members that may persist well beyond the event itself.|$|E

In response to these concerns, Cross lowered the minimum building height to [...] and raised the maximum compensation to $1,800.

2500|$|Efforts by {{the federal}} {{government}} to ensure workplace health and safety were minimal until the passage of OSHA. The American system of mass production encouraged the use of machinery, while the statutory regime did nothing to protect workplace safety. For most employers, it was cheaper to replace a dead or <b>injured</b> <b>worker</b> than it was to introduce safety measures. Tort law provided little recourse for relief for the survivors of dead workers or for injured employees. After the Civil War, some improvements were made through the establishment of state railroad and factory commissions, the adoption of new technology (such as the railway air brake), and more widespread availability of life insurance.

5000|$|Benefits are {{generally}} paid until the <b>injured</b> <b>worker</b> returns {{to work or}} is capable of returning to work and suitable work is available. For example, if an <b>injured</b> <b>worker</b> fully recovers from an injury and can return to work, total disability benefits end. Also, even if an <b>injured</b> <b>worker</b> cannot return to his regular job due to a physicians restrictions, compensation ends if the employer offers the employee suitable work. Short of offering a job, the employer/insurer may stop compensation for total disability if it can prove suitable jobs exist in the employees commuting area. If those jobs do not meet or exceed the injured worker's previously established AWW, the employer/carrier {{may have to pay}} either partial disability benefits or a [...] "scheduled award," [...] depending {{on the nature of the}} original injury.|$|E
5000|$|Generally speaking, {{a worker}} {{covered by the}} LHWCA is {{entitled}} to temporary compensation benefits of two-thirds of his average weekly wage while undergoing medical treatment, and then either to a scheduled award for injury to body parts enumerated in [...] or two-thirds of the workers' loss of wages, or wage earning capacity. More specifically, the LHWCA entitles a worker to reasonable and necessary medical benefits and indemnity benefits. There are four categories of disability benefits: temporary total, temporary partial, permanent total, and permanent partial. The difference between the types of benefits depends on whether the <b>injured</b> <b>worker</b> has achieved medical permanency, and whether the <b>injured</b> <b>worker</b> can return to his pre-injury employment, or return {{to some form of}} suitable alternative employment. In certain situations, permanent partial disability benefits are available for retirees.

40|$|Background: In the {{vocational}} rehabilitation of <b>injured</b> <b>workers</b> {{the influence of}} the worker's personality has been neglected. This is despite there being substantial evidence that in chronic pain certain personality factors are significantly related to poorer outcomes. This is a preliminary study that has examined the relationship between personality factors, personality psychopathology and rehabilitation outcomes in <b>injured</b> <b>workers.</b> Method: Data from structured clinical interviews, self report and rehabilitation outcome (cost) were gathered from 36 <b>injured</b> <b>workers</b> with recognized compensation claims for physical and/or psychological workplace injury. Results: Personality factors were associated with poorer outcome, particularly cost and health. Individuals with extreme personality traits experienced poorer health and vocational rehabilitation outcomes. The combination of high Neuroticism and low Extraversion which is a pattern often characterized as anxious and socially avoidant was found to be consistently related to poor health outcomes. Conclusions: The results indicate that considering the type of personality characteristics of <b>injured</b> <b>workers</b> may have important theoretical and practical implications...|$|R
40|$|Attempts {{to develop}} a better {{understanding}} of the interaction between the compensation environment and <b>injured</b> <b>workers</b> suggest that the compensation environment may negatively impact on the psychological wellbeing of <b>injured</b> <b>workers.</b> This study offers a complementary perspective to contemporary quantitative studies exploring the psychosocial aspects of workplace injury and disability, and contributes to the growing body of qualitative data on the interaction of personal and environmental factors influencing recovery from work injury. The beliefs and experience of <b>injured</b> <b>workers,</b> as explored through ethnographic interviewing, offer insight to the social meaning and relationships comprised in the compensation environment and reveal the pervasive impact of workplace injury across personal, social and occupational spheres. Poor claims administration and hostile interpersonal interactions are identified as particular sources of frustration and discontent for <b>injured</b> <b>workers.</b> Strong themes of perceived injustice emerge as a potentially valuable area for future research in improving the outcomes of compensable injury.
