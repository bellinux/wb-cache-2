30|$|The key {{question}} {{in the context of}} storage of health data is always with regard to the purpose. The GDPR provides several <b>exemptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>derogations</b> for the use of health data, e.g. in the context of research or public health purposes under certain conditions. Typical procedures in this context include the application of ethical standards for scientific research as mentioned in Recital 33 and the implementation of organisational and technical safeguards as mentioned in Article 89 including anonymisation, pseudonymisation and encryption [2]. Pseudonymisation is generally recommended as long as the research purposes can be fulfilled in this manner. With the condition of such safeguards, the GDPR creates exemptions for researchers to process sensitive health data even beyond the purposes for which they were collected. In addition, the GDPR provides some room for manoeuvre for national regulations (derogations defined by a law) in this context. It is clearly emphasised, however, that <b>exemptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>derogations</b> for research purposes should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers, insurance or banking companies (Recital 54, [1].|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{goals of}} the "Lisbon strategy" - whose aim is to boost {{competitiveness}} and employment in the EU - is to extend {{the benefits of the}} internal market and of freedom of movement to the service industries. The draft directive on services which the European Commission is submitting to the European Parliament is part of this strategy. Before MEPs decide their positions on this extremely complex issue, the Internal Market and Social Affairs Committees of the EP decided to seek the views of experts at a public hearing held on 11 November in Brussels. Services generate between 50 % and 70 % of GDP in the Union and account for 60 % to 70 % of new jobs. The service industries could grow even more if they did not face a whole range of obstacles. The directive is intended to give a legal framework to this sector and thus facilitate the free movement of services and the right for service providers to set up in different Member States, while also providing legal certainty for providers and customers. However, services cannot all be treated the same, for various political and legal reasons. Firstly, for some services, legislation already exists or is in the pipeline, e. g. competitiveness, posting of workers and refunding of healthcare costs. Secondly, each country has its own traditions and political sensitivities, for example on services of general interest. Nevertheless, the directive is not proposing to place services in different categories. On the contrary, the Commission says it should adopt a single, standard approach and that the way to accommodate differences is by means of <b>exemptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>derogations...</b>|$|E

40|$|People {{are confronted}} with {{injustice}} and innocent victims on a regular basis. Reactions toward victims can range from going {{to great lengths to}} help or support the victims in order to alleviate their ill fate to harsh negative reactions often resulting in blaming and derogating the victims for what happened to them. In my dissertation, I addressed two questions regarding social justice and reactions toward victims of injustice. Why do people blame innocent victims? And how can we transform derogatory reactions into more benevolent reactions? Previous research has shown that victim blaming <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> paradoxically stem from people’s belief in a just world (BJW). Innocent victims threaten the BJW and victim blaming <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> help restore the belief. Research even showed that negative reactions are enhanced when the victim is similar to the observer, presumably because victim similarity enhances experienced BJW threat. I added to these findings by showing that perpetrator similarity influences victim blaming <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> in a similar manner. Hence, proximity of the injustice in a broader sense seems to influence experienced BJW threat and subsequent reactions to resolve the threat. In subsequent studies, I showed that in today’s future-oriented society people experience more personal uncertainty. To deal with these aversive feelings, people hold on to the BJW more strongly and victim blaming <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> are enhanced. Together, these lines of research help gain progressive insights into the psychological underpinnings of the paradoxical negative reactions toward innocent victims of injustice. The second part of the dissertation was devoted to incorporating the more benign reactions toward innocent victims of injustice that do occur in real life, but that have received only minor attention in social justice research. I investigated the processes that influence whether people are more prone to make sense of this injustice by either negative or positive reactions. My results indicate that people become spontaneously avoidance motivated and self-focused, when confronted with innocent victims of injustice. These factors make derogatory reactions toward victims a likely strategy {{to make sense of the}} injustice. However, these reactions can be counteracted and may even be transformed in more benign ways of dealing with injustice, such as support and help for the victims involved, by instilling an other-focus or an approach motivation. With the research presented in this dissertation, I showed that making sense of injustice can be accomplished both by benign and derogatory reactions to innocent victims...|$|R
