40|$|Charge-state {{calculations}} {{based on}} density-functional theory {{are used to}} study {{the formation energy of}} hydrogen in wurtzite and zinc-blende GaN as a function of Fermi level Comparison of these results reveals notable differences including a 0. 56 <b>eV</b> <b>lower</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> for H 2 in wurtzite, and different configurations for H 2 and H- in the two crystal structures. Furthermore, H+ is found to be equally stable at bond-centered and anti-bonding sites in wurtzite, whereas it is unstable at a bond-centered site in zinc blende. These differences are due to distinct features of the two crystal structures including: the lower symmetry of wurtzite which provides a wider selection of bonding sites for H+, and the existence of extended three-fold symmetric channels oriented along the c-axis in wurtzite which provide more favorable bonding configurations for H 2 and H-. N-H+ stretch-mode vibration frequencies, clustering of ? 3 + in p-type material, and diffusion barriers for H" are also investigated in wurtzite GaN. A diffusion barrier of 1. 6 eV is found for H- in wurtzite GaN, significantly lower than a previous estimate, and a tendency for H+ clustering in p-type material is found...|$|E
40|$|CuInSe_ 2 (CIS) {{solar cells}} are {{promising}} candidates for thin film photovoltaic applications, one key limitation in their performance is surface recombination in these thin films. We demonstrate that passivating CIS films with Trioctylphosphine Sulfide (TOP:S) solution increases photoluminescence (PL) intensity {{by a factor}} of ∼ 30, which suggests that this passivation significantly reduces surface recombination. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that TOP:S forms both –S and –P bonds on the CIS film surface, which leads to a ∼ 4 -fold increase in the surface Na peak intensity. This value is significantly higher than what would be expected from high temperature annealing alone, which has been linked to improvements in surface morphology and device efficiency in CIGS solar cells. We use Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) to measure the solid-state transport of Na within CIS films with and without passivation. EDS spectra on CIS film cross-sections reveals a saddle-shaped Na profile in the as-fabricated films and a concentration gradient towards the film surface in the passivated films, with 20 % higher surface Na content compared with the unpassivated films. We employ Hybrid (B 3 PW 91) Density Functional Theory (DFT) to gain insight into energetics of Na defects, which demonstrate a driving force for Na diffusion from bulk towards the surface. DFT Calculations with TOP:S-like molecules on the same surfaces reveal a ∼ 1 <b>eV</b> <b>lower</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> for the Na_(Cu) defect. The experiments and computations in this work suggest that TOP:S passivation promotes Na diffusion towards CIS film surfaces and stabilizes surface Na defects, which leads to the observed substantial decrease in surface recombination...|$|E

30|$|It is {{well-known}} that efficient p-type doping in ZnO thin films is extremely hard partially {{due to the}} very limited dopant solubility in high-quality lattice [1, 2]. Dopants are found to distribute along grain boundaries possibly due to the relatively degraded crystalline quality there. Grain boundaries would form low-resistive electrical channels, and the carrier transport is thus dominated by them, which has no practical significance [3]. However, micro-/nanostructured ZnO materials may provide an alternative to realize considerable doping efficiency by utilizing abundant surface areas. Similar as grain boundaries in thin films, surface areas in micro-/nanostructured ZnO are more chemically active, which results in <b>lowered</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> for impurities or defects.
