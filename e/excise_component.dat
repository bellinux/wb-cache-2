40|$|AbstractWe present {{evidence}} that T 3 {{can alter the}} ADP-ribosylation of chromatin associated proteins. Nuclei from GH 1 cells were incubated with [adenylate- 32 P]NAD and the radioactivity incorporated into histone and non-histone proteins was quantitated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Incubation of GH 1 cells for 24 h with T 3 lowered by 40 – 70 % the [32 P]ADP-ribose incorporated into nuclear proteins. However, incubation for 3 h with T 3 resulted in a simulation instead of a decrease of in vitro [32 P]ADP-ribose incorporation. The major ADP-ribosylated component electrophoresed as a 120 000 molecular mass non-histone protein, and radiolabeled histones were also observed. The same protein species were observed for all the experimental groups and T 3 affected the extent of ADP-ribosylation but did not alter the sedimentation of the [32 P]ADP-ribosylated <b>components</b> <b>excised</b> from chromatin after micrococcal nuclease digestion...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: To tailor local {{treatment}} {{in breast cancer}} patients {{there is a need}} for predicting ipsilateral recurrences after breast-conserving therapy. After adequate treatment (excision with free margins and radiotherapy), young age and incompletely <b>excised</b> extensive intraductal <b>component</b> are predictors for local recurrence, but many local recurrences can still not be predicted. Here we have used gene expression profiling by microarray analysis to identify gene expression profiles that can help to predict local recurrence in individual patients. METHODS: By using previously established gene expression profiles with proven value in predicting metastasis-free and overall survival (wound-response signature, 70 -gene prognosis profile and hypoxia-induced profile) and training towards an optimal prediction of local recurrences in a training series, we establish a classifier for local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy. RESULTS: Validation of the different gene lists shows that the wound-response signature is able to separate patients with a high (29 %) or low (5 %) risk of a local recurrence at 10 years (sensitivity 87. 5 %, specificity 75 %). In multivariable analysis the classifier is an independent predictor for local recurrence. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that gene expression profiling can identify subgroups of patients at increased risk of developing a local recurrence after breast-conserving therap...|$|R
40|$|Consumer imports {{have played}} {{a vital role in}} the {{development}} of Barbados over the years. It is not difficult to see the link between these imports and indirect taxes since, when consumer items arrive into Barbados, these are subject to import duties, value-added taxes and in some cases, <b>excise</b> duties, all <b>components</b> of indirect taxes, which represent the major tax revenue category of the Government of Barbados. With rising indirect taxes, a Government can use some of these funds to develop a country’s infrastructure and enhance its development. Although some reduction in savings is expected from an expansion in consumer imports (especially if financed by a drawdown in deposits), this loss can be minimised if some of the taxes collected from such an increase are directed into foreign exchange earning activities. This paper uses regression analysis to see to what extent changes in consumer imports will influence indirect taxes in the long and short run between 1970 and 2001. The results show that in the long run, a per unit change in consumer imports will boost indirect taxes by 0. 46 % while in the short run, a similar change in consumer imports will increase indirect taxes sharply by 0. 78 %. This implies a significant impact on Government’s fiscal account in the short run, with some slowing anticipated over the medium and long term. 2...|$|R

Although the immediate aim of such reform is to reduce fiscal imbalances to achieve macroeconomic stability, the long-term goal is to secure more durable improvements in fiscal performance. This study reviews the fiscal reform experience of 36 low-income developing countries that undertook macroeconomic and structural adjustment in the context of the IMF's Structural Adjustment Facility and Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility during the period of 1985 - 95.
