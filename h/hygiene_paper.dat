40|$|A {{cross-linked}} polyacrylate polymer, {{referred to}} as absorbent gelling material (AGM), has been developed for use in <b>hygiene</b> <b>paper</b> products, such as infant diapers (nappies). The fate and effects of this polymer were studied in laboratory models of landfill and aerobic composting. Radiolabelled (14 C) AGM was used to facilitate determination of fate and mass balance. Tests were conducted in 1201 reactors containing a mixture of solid waste and compost or solid waste only, and panty diaper pads. Controlled temperature and leachate recycle were used to accelerate the biological processes. AGM caused no adverse effects {{and most of the}} material remained associated with the diaper pad and surrounding waste. Very little AGM (less than 1 %) biodegraded to CO 2 /CH 4 under landfill conditions, while 2 - 4 % appeared in leachate. The leachate was highly biodegradable aerobically.

40|$|Fine sieves can be {{implemented}} as compact alternatives to primary clarification. Fine sieved fraction (FSF) is a heterogeneous substrate that mainly consists of fibers originating from toilet paper and thus contains a high cellulosic fraction. Resource recovery and energy neutral sewage treatment is nowadays focus of many water authorities. This novel concept led to a new focus on optimisation of digestion processes and enhanced biogas production. In this scope, the main objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the bio-methane potential and maximum methane production rates of FSF, sequestered from raw municipal sewage, for onsite energy recovery towards energy neutrality at wastewater treatment plants.

40|$|Guanidinylated {{chitosan}} (GCS) {{was prepared}} by grafting guanidine oligomers onto chitosan under microwave irradiation. The structure of GCS characterized by FT-IR and 1 H NMR verified the covalent bonding between the guanidine oligomers and chitosan; {{the effects of}} molar ratio, reaction temperature, and time were investigated {{and the degree of}} substitution of GCS reached a maximum of 25. 5 % under optimized conditions in this work. The resulting GCS showed significantly enhanced antimicrobial activities. The results obtained from the dynamic UV absorption of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that the deactivation of E. coli by GCS was due to the destructing of the cell membrane and the prompt release of cytoplasm from the bacterial cells. The adsorption of GCS onto cellulose fibers and the antimicrobial efficiency of the <b>hygiene</b> <b>papers</b> with GCS were also investigated.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Business Administration at Strathmore UniversityThis study set out to explore the effect of product import competition on growth of Small and medium scale manufacturers of tissue and <b>hygiene</b> <b>paper</b> products in Uganda and recommend vi-able strategies/ policies to manufacturers and government to facilitate growth of these enterprises and the industry at large. Case study methodology was used and a combination of qualitative and quantitative data was used. Qualitative and quantitative techniques were used to analyze and interpret the data. Study findings confirmed that product imports indeed affect growth of Small and medium tissue and hygiene product manufacturing enterprises in Uganda. The study also revealed that local manufacturers have low capacity utilization and employ fewer employees than they should because the level of operations cannot sustain the optimal number of employees the company needs due to low revenues. The study also revealed lack of high quality softwood availability {{in the country to}} provide virgin pulp {{to be used as a}} raw material substitute to recycled pulp and paper. This therefore means that the government needs to encourage growth of soft wood trees to provide raw materials for the infant but growing paper products industry. The study further revealed that manufacturers also suffer from counterfeit brands. The study pro-posed a policy/ strategy that manufacturers can use to remain competitive regardless of the level of product import competition.

40|$|Wet {{strength}} {{is one of}} paper’s most important properties. It can be developed by addition of wet strength additives during the fabrication process. Hereby paper products that require high wet strength, such as kitchen towels and bank note paper, are achieved. This study aims to examine new polymers for future use as wet-strength additive in paper. One of them, a natural biopolymer, has in earlier studies proved to work well as wet strength additive. The objective was to find out in what extent this biopolymer could improve wet strength. A final evaluation was based on mechanical testing of sheets made from bleached Kraft fibres modified by the biopolymer. Wet-strength polymers are used to develop or conserve the mechanical strength of paper when wetted. Wet-strength agents are added in various paper products such as: hand towels, <b>hygiene</b> <b>paper</b> and packaging grades. According to the chemical composition of these agents they can act either as protective agents by preventing fibre swelling and protecting already existing bonds, or they form new and water resistant bonds through reinforcement mechanisms. The natural biopolymer has a structure that {{is very similar to}} the cellulose structure. This fact together with the reactive functions of the biopolymer probably makes it possible to adsorb it to cellulose fibres. Pre-treatments of fibres were done by adding 0. 5 and 2 % biopolymer to the paper pulp. The adsorption was evaluated by measuring the surface charge of pre-treated fibres. This most popular wet-strength today is PAE (poly(aminoamide) - epichlorohydrin)) but it has some drawbacks. PAE makes paper stiffer and decreases the absorption capacity which is useful in packaging products but not in tissue paper. Other drawbacks of PAE are its bad repulpability, degradability and toxic monomers. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

Recent grass roots activism in the development community, including the first ever menstrual hygiene day held in 2014, has highlighted the potential impact of menstruation in a poor income setting on women’s rights to sanitation, health and education. However, it has remained largely neglected by International stakeholders ostensibly working towards the realisation of universal human rights.

40|$|Background: The use of {{non-sterile}} gloves (NSG) {{has become}} routine {{in the delivery}} of health care, often for procedures for which they are not required; their use may increase the risk of cross contamination and is generally not integrated into hand <b>hygiene</b> audit. This <b>paper</b> describes a small-scale application and validation of an observational audit tool devised to identify inappropriate use of NSG and potential for cross contamination. Methods: Two observers simultaneously observed the use of NSG during episodes of care in an acute hospital setting. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the audit tool was measured corrected for chance agreement using Kappa. Results: A total of 22 episodes of care using NSG were observed. In 68. 6 % (24 / 35) of procedures there was no contact with blood/body fluid; in 54. 3 % (19 / 35) NSG-use was inappropriate. The IRR was 100 % for eight of 12 components of the tool. For hand hygiene before and after NSG removal it was 82 % (Kappa = 0. 72) and 95 % (Kappa = 0. 87). Conclusions: In this small-scale application of a glove-use audit tool we demonstrated over-use and misuse of NSG and potential for cross transmission on gloved hands. The audit tool provides an effective mechanism for integrating glove use into the audit of hand hygiene behaviour. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:In a {{world in}} which {{successful}} learning is believed to rest on the methods of teaching and the performance of students is determined by teacher quality, it is clear that teachers are the backbone of student learning attainments. In such a scenario, teacher development, welfare, motivation, and satisfaction are crucial for better teaching performance. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to determine the motivator and hygiene factors among excellent teachers in Malaysia and to explore factors that lead to satisfaction and cause dissatisfaction among excellent teachers in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantitative design to determine the motivator and hygiene factors among excellent teachers. For the sample size, 306 excellent teachers participated in this study and data were analysed using principle component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to determine the dominant factor among Herzberg’s motivator and hygiene factors. Findings: From the findings, the results showed that the satisfaction of excellent teachers was low in terms of “personal growth” (motivator) and “supervision” (<b>hygiene).</b> The <b>paper</b> concludes by calling upon the Malaysian Ministry of Education (MoE) to consider both motivator and hygiene factors, and what causes satisfaction and dissatisfaction among excellent teachers. Research limitations/implications: This study has some limitations to be considered, especially in terms of sample size. The low number of excellent teachers participating in this study is due to the scarcity of face-to-face data collection, in that an online survey was deemed to be the only means to reach the excellent teachers. This is due to the lack of a list of excellent teachers in some state districts, making it difficult to determine those schools which have excellent teachers. In addition, it is also due to logistical and geographical difficulties in reaching certain schools and meeting the excellent teachers. In recognition of such difficulties in undertaking research on excellent teachers in Malaysia, the researchers in this study urge the Malaysian MoE, as well as state districts and regional offices, to update the profile of excellent teachers by creating records and a list of all excellent teachers in Malaysia to facilitate future research. In this scenario, the findings of this study should be used with caution and not be generalized to other contexts, schools, regions, or states. Practical implications: To be fully cognizant about the excellent teachers’ scheme was introduced to uplift the standard of teaching in Malaysia, and the recipients of this scheme or status (excellent) are considered to be the “cream of the crop” in the teaching profession in Malaysia and for non-excellent teachers to emulate, it is vital to look into their well-being as well as their growth. With the results of this study, the authors can say that the implications for practice touch many aspects of the professional and personal development of Malaysian excellent teachers. Specifically, it is imperative that the factors that intrinsically and extrinsically motivate excellent teachers in Malaysia and the causes of dissatisfaction are identified. In addition, the implications also place emphasis on paving ways for the personal growth of excellent teachers and to provide leeway for them to pursue their own personal happiness. Furthermore, the implications of the lack of proper supervision of school principals on excellent teachers should be avoided, and, in general, hygiene factors could be used as positive implications to improve excellent teachers’ teaching practices an performance. Originality/value: This research is original as it calls MoE attention to the well-being of excellent teachers in Malaysia. As excellent teachers in Malaysia are selected and promoted among teachers in Malaysia in order to improve teaching and learning in Malaysia. They are appointed to be a role model for other teachers to emulate. With this position, excellent teachers are expected to contribute to the development of their schools and others and they can be posted anywhere as well as called at any time for help. Therefore, it is worthy to know how satisfied those excellent teachers are regarding government policy. Hence, it is important to know what motivates and satisfies them...|$|R
