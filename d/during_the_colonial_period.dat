5|$|The cathedral was {{constructed}} {{over a period}} of over two centuries, between 1573 and 1813. Its design is a mixture of three architectural styles that predominated <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> Renaissance, Baroque and Neo-classic.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to}} other parts of the Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy. It lacked deposits of gold or other precious metals, nor did it have established native civilizations to subject to the encomienda.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century Madagascar had {{the most}} {{developed}} and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two-thirds of}} its present {{territory}} were occupied <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> as the remaining third consisted of the Patagonian Plateau, which remains sparsely populated to this day.

5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period</b> and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution.

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> in the 19th century, Kanaks were {{recruited}} or enslaved, to perform unfree labour {{in places such}} as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to India, Japan, South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were unprepared for the arrival of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E
5|$|The wars {{destroyed}} the old civilian bureaucracy that had governed {{the region for}} centuries, as {{institutions such as the}} audiencias were eliminated and many Peninsular officials fled to Spain. The Catholic Church, which had been an important social and political institution <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> initially came out weakened {{by the end of the}} conflicts. As with government officials, many Peninsular bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the Vatican were regularized. Then as the Church recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of European colonists and explorers, First Nations {{followed}} {{a wide array of}} mostly animistic religions. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> the French settled along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River, specifically Latin Rite Roman Catholics, including a number of Jesuits dedicated to converting indigenous peoples; an effort that eventually proved successful. The first large Protestant communities were formed in the Maritimes after the British conquest of New France, followed by American Protestant settlers displaced by the American Revolution. The late nineteenth century saw the beginning of a substantive shift in Canadian immigration patterns. Large numbers of Irish and southern European immigrants were creating new Roman Catholic communities in English Canada. The settlement of the west brought significant Eastern Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe and Mormon and Pentecostal immigrants from the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{turmoil of}} the Congo Crisis destabilised Central Africa {{and helped to}} ignite the Portuguese Colonial War, {{especially}} the war of independence in neighbouring Angola. Angolan nationalists had long had close ties with the Congo where many had lived as exiles. The União dos Povos de Angola (UPA), an Angolan nationalist organisation which drew support from the Angolan Bakongo, was supported ABAKO politicians who had hopes of rebuilding the Kingdom of Kongo, altering the borders established <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period.</b> Believing that the independence of Congo was the first stage in this process, the UPA launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt in 1961, igniting the conflict in Angola that would last until 1974. The Congolese, later Zairian, governments continued to provide support to Angolan rebels and even participated directly in the subsequent Angolan Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Various {{forms of}} Chinese {{architecture}} exist throughout Indonesia with marked differences between {{urban and rural}} areas and among the different islands. Architectural developments by the Chinese in Southeast Asia differ from those in mainland China. By blending local and European (Dutch) design patterns, numerous variations of fusion styles emerged. Chinese architecture in Indonesia has manifested in three forms: religious temples, study halls, and houses. Cities <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period</b> were divided into three racial districts: European, oriental (Arabs, Chinese, and other Asians), and indigenous. There usually were no physical boundaries among the zones, except for rivers, walls, or roads in some cases. Such legal boundaries promoted high growths in urban density within each zone, especially in the Chinese quarters, often leading to poor environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1703 and 1753, reducciones were {{established}} at San José and San Andrés on Lake Petén Itzá, Santa Ana {{just south of}} the lake, and at San Luis, Santo Toribio and Dolores in the south (not to be confused with Dolores del Lakandon). Each of these mission towns had its own minister who answered to the vicario general with the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo. In {{the first decades of the}} 18th century, churches were built in five colonial towns: Dolores, Remedios, San Andrés, San José and Santo Toribio. The church in Dolores was built in 1708; the construction was probably overseen by Juan Antonio Ruiz y Bustamante. In 1699 there were nine priests in Petén but thereafter there was usually a shortage of clergy in colonial Petén. In spite of the objections of the Dominicans who had been working in southern Petén, the Franciscans continued to provide clergy from Yucatán, and it was the Franciscans who oversaw the spiritual welfare of Petén <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of the ice trade of the 19th century, snow and ice had been collected and stored to use in the summer months {{in various parts of the}} world, but never on a large scale. In the Mediterranean and in South America, for example, there was a long history of collecting ice from the upper slopes of the Alps and the Andes during the summer months and traders transporting this down into the cities. Similar trading practices had grown up in Mexico <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period.</b> The Russians collected ice along the Neva River during the winter months for consumption in Saint Petersburg for many years. Wealthy Europeans began to build ice houses to store ice gathered on their local estates during the winter from the 16th century onwards; the ice was used to cool drinks or food for the wealthiest elites.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona I {{planted a}} pair of royal fig trees {{at the far end}} of the Bevato {{compound}} and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and jacarandas planted by the French <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period.</b> The figs that shade the esplanade are believed to be imbued with hasina enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to wash away the sins of the nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or prayers to honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} public film {{display in the}} country were Italian newsreels of key events <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period.</b> Growing out of the Somali people's rich storytelling tradition, the first few feature-length Somali films and cinematic festivals emerged in the early 1960s, immediately after independence. Following {{the creation of the}} Somali Film Agency (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as riwaayado were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry. Epic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of video technology and national television networks. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, marketing strategies and production techniques.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{infrastructure}} of Malaysia {{is one of}} the most developed in Asia and ranked 8th in Asia and 25th in the world. Malaysia is ranked 19th in the world for its quality roads, quality of port infrastructure and quality of air transport infrastructure but ranked 39th in quality of electricity supply. Its telecommunications network is second only to Singapore's in Southeast Asia, with 4.7million fixed-line subscribers and more than 30million cellular subscribers. The country has seven international ports, the major one being the Port Klang. There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as Technology Park Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park. Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns. Although rural areas have been the focus of great development, they still lag behind areas such as the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The telecommunication network, although strong in urban areas, is less available to the rural population.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary source}} of {{information}} about the reign of Andrianampoinimerina is Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, a Malagasy language book relating the oral history of the Merina kings as collected by a Jesuit missionary, Francois Callet, in the late 19th century. Prior to the eventual release of a French language translation in the 1950s, references to the king in academic and popular writing <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period</b> de-emphasized his role as a conduit of traditional religious power and authority, instead glorifying his administrative practices in an attempt to bring greater credibility to the colonial government as a vehicle for building upon and strengthening the principles of good governance that he introduced. Beginning in the 1970s, historians began to focus more on the spiritual aspects of his role as king, and researchers questioned and compared sources in an effort to arrive at a more factual and balanced history of Andrianampoinimerina and his reign.|$|E
