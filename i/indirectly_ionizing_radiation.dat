40|$|Traditional dosimetric {{devices are}} {{inherently}} point dose dosimeters (PDDs) {{and can only}} measure {{the magnitude of the}} radiation exposure; hence, they are one-dimensional (1 D). To measure the magnitude and spatial location of dose within a volume either several PDDs must be used at one time, or one PDD must be translated from point-to-point. Using PDDs for spatially distributed, two-dimensional (2 D), dosimetry is laborious, time consuming, limited in spatial resolution, susceptible to positioning errors, and the currently accepted approach to measuring dose distribution in 2 D. This work seeks to expand the current limits of <b>indirectly</b> <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> dosimetry by using radiochromic film (RCF) for a high-resolution, accurate dosimetry system. Using RCF will extend the current field of radiation dosimetry to spatially quantitative 2 D and three-dimensional (3 D) measurements. This work was generalized into two aims. The first aim was the development of the RCF dosimetry system; it was accomplished by characterizing the film and the readout devices and developing a method to calibrate film response for absolute dose measurements. The second aim was to apply the RCF dosimetry system to three areas of dosimetry that were inherently volumetric and could benefit from multiple dimensional (2 D or 3 D) dose analysis. These areas were representative of a broad range of radiation energy levels and were: low-mammography, intermediate-computed tomography (CT), and high-radiobiologcal small animal irradiation and cancer patient treatment verification. The application of a single dosimeter over a broad range of energy levels is currently unavailable for most traditional dosimeters, and thus, was used to demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of the RCF dosimetry system. Two types of RCF were characterized for this work: EBT and XRQA film. Both films were investigated for: radiation interaction with film structure; light interaction with film structure for optimal film readout (densitometry) sensitivity; range of absorbed dose measurements; dependence of film dose measurement response as a function of changing radiation energy; fractionation and dose rate effects on film measurement response; film response sensitivity to ambient factors; and stability of measured film response with time. EBT film was shown to have the following properties: near water equivalent atomic weight (Z eff); dynamic dose range of (10 - 1 - 10 2) Gy; 3 % change in optical density (OD) response for a single exposure level when exposed to radiation energies from (75 - 18, 000) kV; and best digitized using transmission densitometry. XRQA film was shown to have: a Zeff of ~ 25; a 12 fold increase in sensitivity at lower photon energies for a dynamic dose range of 10 - 3 - 100 Gy, a difference of 25 % in OD response when comparing 120 kV to 320 kV, and best digitized using reflective densitometry. Both XRQA and EBT films were shown to have: a temporal stability (&# 916;OD) of ~ 1 % for t > 24 hr post film exposure for up to ~ 20 days; a change in dose response of ~ 0. 03 mGy hr- 1 when exposed to fluorescent room lighting at standard room temperature and humidity levels; a negligible dose rate and fractionation effect when operated within the optimal dose ranges; and a light wavelength dependence with dose for film readout. The flat bed scanner was chosen as the primary film digitizer due to its availability, cost, OD range, functionality (transmission and reflection scanning), and digitization speed. As a cost verses functionality comparison, the intrinsic and operational limitations were determined for two flat bed scanners. The EPSON V 700 and 10000 XL exhibited equal spatial and OD accuracy. The combined precision of both the scanner light sources and CCD sensors measured The RCF dosimetry system was applied to three novel areas from which a benefit could be derived for 2 D or 3 D dosimetric information. The first area was for a 3 D dosimetry of a pendant breast in 3 D-CT mammography. The novel method of developing a volumetric image of the breast from a CT acquisition technique was empirically measured for its dosimetry and compared to standard dual field digital mammography. The second area was dose reduction in CT for pediatric and adult scan protocols. In this application, novel methodologies were developed to measure 3 D organ dosimetry and characterize a dose reduction scan protocol for pediatric and adult body habitus. The third area was in the field of small animal irradiation for radiobiology purposes and cancer patient treatment verification. Two methods for small animal irradiation were analyzed for their dosimetry. The first technique was within a gamma irradiator environment using a 137 Cs source (663 keV), and the second, a novel approach to mouse irradiation, was developed for fast neutron (10 MeV) irradiated by a Tandem Van de Graff accelerator in a 2 H(d,n) 3 He reaction. For the patient cancer treatment, RCF was used to verify a 3 D radiochromic plastic, PRESAGETM, using multi-leaf collimation (MLC) on a medical linear accelerator (LINAC) with 6 MV x-rays. The RCF and PRESAGE TM dosimeters were employed to verify a simple respiratory-gated lung treatment for a small nodule; the film was considered the gold standard. In every case, the RCF dosimetry system was verified for accuracy using a traditional PDD as the golden standard. When considering all areas of radiation energy applications, the RCF dosimetry system agreed to better than 7 % of the golden standard, and in some cases within better than 1 %. In many instances, this work provided vital dosimetric information that otherwise was not captured using the PDD in similar geometry. This work demonstrates the need for RCF to more accurately measure volumetric dose. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of orphan sources, analyzing the radiological protection problems in case of finding and securing of these sources with {{particular attention to the}} following aspects: • Operators safety and security; • Exposed population safety and security; • The identification of dangerous areas to the managing and timing of rescue operations. These points are also the main problems to be met by the persons in charge to decide on securing of the radiological source. In this paper, after defining the characteristics that the radiological sources must have to be defined orphan, the authors examine the fundamental radiometric parameters. The aim of this work is to develop a software that needs as boundary conditions the dose rate measured at a certain distance from the source and a hardware access to the web and allows to perform a geo-referencing of radiological risks on maps available in the network. A particular attention has been dedicated to the theoretical model and support tools for decision chosen for the operators responsible for the securing of the radiological source. This research has: • define the conceptual model of a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) oriented to the problem of radiation hazard identifying the requirements of both the component "mobile" than to support a Control Room; • developed the prototype of the software for terminal operators in the field that allows access via the web to make geo-referencing expeditious source location and dose rate measured at a certain distance from the source of maps available online; • developed the prototype of the Operating Room components according to the paradigm SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), which allows usability through OGC web services within the platform of processing of SDSS Intergraph I 2 RMS. In this paper the fundamental radiometric parameters and the main protective measures are presented and then the architecture of the software system is described with a detailed analysis of the first results obtained with the software prototype developed in order to demonstrate that this tool allows the management of the radiological emergency by operators and in particular by decision makers simplifying the management of the safety and security operations. 2 1. Introduction Radioactive sources are used throughout the world for many applications; particularly in industry, medicine and research. The risks associated with such uses is strictly connected to their physical characteristics: activity, types of radionuclides, methods of manufacture, etc [...] In case of conventional application the risks associated are usually well known and their activities are generally normed. In the European Union provisions on the protection of population and workers against the risks of ionizing radiation are given with EURATOM directives, assimilated by the EU States. In Italy the main guidelines are contained in Legislative Decree no. March 17, 1995, n. 230, as amended. The problems related to sources, so-called "orphan", (which, for various reasons, are not under control) are different. These sources may be found by people (workers or citizens) unaware of their nature and possible risks, which may also be involved in serious radiation injuries with fatal outcome. The sealed orphan sources are regulated by Decree 6 February 2007, n. 52, implementing the EURATOM Directive 2003 / 122 /EC, which provides, among other things, the preparation by the Prefect of a provincial action plan, in accordance with the National Plan of emergency, to guarantee the safety in case of discovery or suspected presence of orphan sources in the territory. The sealed sources may also present special risks due to the small dimensions, often lower than those of a pen, which does not allow an easy identification. Rather frequently is the case of sources which, contained in metal casing, have been gathered by scrappers and flow rates in steel plants where, at times, have been fused with consequent problems of contamination. To protect against such events, melting plants have to equip themselves of radiometric instrumentation for control the metal scrap in input, so as {{to reduce the risk of}} accidental introduction of radioactive sources in the processing cycle. Such monitoring is provided in Article 157 of Legislative Decree no. 230 / 95 and subsequent amendments. However, even these control systems cannot avoid the presence of radioactive materials. As part of the Community Action in the field of radioactive waste (Council Resolution of 15 June 1992 on the renewal of the Community Action Plan in the field of radioactive waste, OJ C 158, 25. 6. 1992), the European Commission published a study on the management and disposal of disused sealed radioactive sources in the European Union (Angus et al., management and disposal of disused sealed radioactive sources in the European Union, EUR 1886, 2000.). Sometimes the competent national authorities are faced with situations where the sources are not managed properly or are left without any control, with the possibility that can result in serious health consequences for workers or the population. The chances of these kind of risks increase when the sources are no longer used and are simply stored or left unattended for long periods. In fact, we see a loosening of controls between the time when the sources are withdrawn from use and the time they are returned to the farmers for the purpose of reuse or treated as waste and subject to the system of management of radioactive waste. The health and economic consequences of accidents which result in inadequate control of sources can be particularly severe. 2. Radiological characteristics to measure radiological risks The main radiological characteristics, and particularly those useful for the present work, are commonly divided into: 1. Source: • Activities • Constant range 2. Field Values: • Exposure • Kerma (the kerma is actually a size of dose, but its measurement in air is also used as the field value) 3. Values of the dose • Absorbed dose; • Dose Equivalent; • Effective Dose. Among these variables there is a direct relationship: Source FieldDose The suitable instrumentation for detecting the presence of radiation and to perform 3 measurements of field, the dose and to detect the type of radionuclide is available. 3. In field operations with unknown radiological source In the case of operation with the presence of orphan source, the operators (in most of the cases) are working with a source with unknown characteristics. External exposure of an operator may be limited by observing the following rules: 1) reducing the irradiation time: the value of the dose in fact increases linearly with the intensity of the radiation and with time (Figure 1). Figure 1 : Dose vs time trend The operation must therefore be planned carefully in order to minimize, as far as possible, the intervention times. In any case, however, should not be exceeded dose values established by law. Three quantities are defined dose: the absorbed dose (D), the equivalent dose (H) and the effective dose (E). The equivalent and effective doses relate the amount of radiation received by a person with the resulting biological damage, and for this reason are called radio-protection quantities. In order to plan operation with sealed source (in absence of contamination risk) the most important value is the effective dose (E). 2) increasing the distance. Taking into account a generic distance d from the source, the value of the field, in terms of intensity of exposure, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and directly proportional to the activity, and is expressed by the equation (1) : 2 d A I X    (1) where: Ix = Exposition Intensity [C/(Kg*h) ], Г = Gamma specific constant (it is a characteristics of each radionuclides), [(C*m 2) / (Kg*h*Bq) ], A = Source activity [Bq], d = Source distance [m]. The trend of intensity versus the distance is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 : Intensity vs distance trend It is evident how is important to organize rescue operations keeping the greatest possible distance from the source. From the knowledge of the field, in the case of exposure to the whole body with the radiation  (our case study) it is possible calculate the values of the doses that can be assumed. 3) Using a screen/shield to reduce the intensity of radiation. The radiation, propagating in space, interact with matter in their passage causing an ionization that can be direct (for the alpha and beta radiation) or indirectly (for the gamma radiation and neutron). The interaction between radiation and matter and the different penetration capacity are function of:  the type of radiation;  its energy;  the characteristics of the crossed material. 4 Alpha radiation rapidly convert their kinetic energy in material ionization, with a modest path. The freed electrons, in turn, cause a secondary ionization. Following a possible excitation of the atom, an emission of electromagnetic radiation of low energy (non-ionizing) it is also possible. Alpha radiation are arrested by less than 10 cm of air or by a simple sheet of paper. In the case of irradiation of people, such radiation stop on the very first layer of the skin and only in case of high energy (about 7 MeV) can reach the "germinative layer" of the skin, at a depth of 70 micrometers. These radiations are therefore not dangerous in case of external irradiation. The scenario changes in case of internal contamination of the human body (with internal irradiation), where the damage would be led directly to organs and tissues. Beta radiation and electrons have modest capacity of penetration of matter but still higher than those of alpha particles. These radiation can move in air for about 4 m or 4 mm in water (for energies with order of magnitude of 1 MeV). The germinative layer of the skin is achieved by particles with energies above 70 keV. PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) used by firefighters provide good shielding. In the air are produced dozens of ionizations per centimeter path. As a result of excitation of the atoms of the material crossed by beta radiation there is the re-emission of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. The strong deceleration of the beta particles can cause an emission of X-ray-called "bremsstrahlung. " The emission has an increases intensity proportional with the atomic number of the irradiated material. The phenomenon constitutes a risk greater than the one of the beta radiation from which it derives, being X-rays more difficult to shield. It is useful do not use materials with a high atomic number to shield beta radiation. A good shielding of the beta radiation is also given by a first layer of material of low density, which reduces the production of X-rays, and by a later high density, to shield the X-rays produced. <b>Indirectly</b> <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> (X and gamma rays and neutrons) have an high penetration capability. Gamma radiation is absorbed by huge length of matter. The interaction mechanism between matter and radiation are three (and it depends by energy and matter characteristics). At low energies the photoelectric effect prevails, at medium energies the Compton effect prevails and at great energies the pairs creation prevails. While for the charged particles the beam of radiation is slowed down in an almost uniform mode and is stopped almost simultaneously, for photons the beam is reduced as it progresses within the material, and the photons that continue on their path maintain the same initial energy. For such radiation it is important to refer to the so called half-value layer (HVL), or half-value thickness through which the initial intensity of the incident radiation is halved. These thicknesses are a function both of the type of the crossed material that the energy of the radiation. The X and gamma radiation are effectively attenuated by materials with a high atomic number, such as lead. Neutrons do not interact with the electrons of the atoms of the materials crossed, but only with the nucleus, causing various reactions as a function of energy, including the emission of charged particles and gamma rays. During an operation with the presence of radioactive source sealed, there is an immediate need to delimit an area beyond which must be kept the population. This area should have dimensions not less than those of the so-called "area of concern", so as to ensure that outside it does not exceed the legal limit of 1 mSv effective dose. The limits of the of the attention area can be determined analytically with the data of the source(if known) or following in field measures of intensity and dose. In first instance is necessary to determine the area of attention for the population. This is possible by making measurements of field intensity or dose, depending on the instruments available. After that, with the knowledge of the value of the intensity of dose and the relative distance is uniquely identifies the intensity-distance curve, so you can plan the intervention (Figure 3). Multiple measurements are necessary to reduce the errors Figure 3 : Operation with an unknown source Assuming that the operators is working with a tool that gives us the intensity value of the effective dose. At a distance d 1 the operator measures an intensity value of effective dose IE 1. The value of IE 1 compared to the values (unknown) of activity A and the constant Г is (2) : 5 2 1 1 d A I E   (2) Taking into account a generic distance d 2,the value of intesity can be espressed as in equation (3) : 2 2 2 d A I E   (3) obtaining the value ГxA by (2) and (3) it is possible write the equation (4) 2 2 2 1 1 2 I xd I xd E E  (4) and calculate the effective intensity IE 2 at a generic distance d 2 (5) : 2 2 2 1 2 1 d d I I x E E  (5) By the equation (5) (setting the intensity values of effective project for the operation) is possible to calculate the relative distances and in particular the width of the attention area. 4. Proposal for a geo-referenced program to improve the rescue operations From this analysis it is clear that the primary task for responders is to protect the population from the risks arising from exposure to ionizing radiation and then promptly define the so-called “attention area” (working in safety and security condition of course). It is possible identify, in an analytical way, the size of this “attention area” in few seconds and to carry out calculations of the dose assumed by those who remain in the irradiated area. One of the problems that can be put in the immediate is that related to the possible evacuation of buildings or the closure of roads that are dealing with irradiation phenomena. The principal needs are two: o - locate the area actually affected by the radiation problem; - evaluate the possibility to move the source by a distance sufficient to avoid at least the evacuation of particular buildings, such as hospitals or allow the reopening of communication routes important. The authors thought that the achievement of this task can be facilitated by geo-referencing the results of radiological calculations. For this reason the authors have developed a software (interfaced with GEOMEDIA) for this case,an unknown source, by applying the equation outlined above, taking as a simplifying assumption that the source is punctual. In the first screen of the software developed, called "CALCOLI", can be typed the intensity values measured in Sv/h, the distance to which the measurement was taken and the estimated time of operation. By setting these boundary conditions the software developed can calculate the values attention are, the operating distance and the in-field distance for special rescues teams, as well as the distance of attention for the population in case of non-removal of the source, conventionally identified for a residence time of 365 days (Figure 4 -See end of document – devo impostarle nel documento). Figure 4 : Mask Calculations After that the software user can pass to the second screen, where there is a road map of the world. On the left there is a zoom slider and darts to move the vision of the map, an operation which can also be performed with the mouse in order to frame the area concerned (See Figure 5 See end of document – devo impostarle nel documento). Figure 5 : Mask map The display of the various areas of attention is possible by clicking on the "draw" (after signing on the map the source point). The identification of the source point can be done manually by clicking with the mouse on the point identified or by entering the coordinates of latitude and longitude values. In Figure 6 (See end of document – devo impostarle nel documento) was simulated the presence of a source with the interesting area of focus Policlinico Tor Vergata University. The software immediately gives a map of the area to evacuate. See four areas identified by four circles. The largest is the attention area for the population. Figure 6 : Area of radiological risk The code developed is a web application built with Silverlight. Silverlight is a Microsoft technology that allows to deploy RIAs (Rich Internet Application). The programming language used is C # (C sharp). Regarding the map, has 6 been used for the control Silverlight Bing Map, component developed by Microsoft. Bing Map control provides functions that allow, in giving input coordinates, to draw the map. This software has been interfaced with the software GEOMEDIA (QUI ENTRI TU ANDREA) ……… 5. Conclusion Orphan sources are a potential danger to the population. In case of their occurrence is important to take the necessary radiation protection measures, such as evacuation or closure of areas adjacent to quickly identify the areas affected by the radiation hazard. The use of a geo-referenced software makes more simple to achieve good safety and security standards. It is clear how such tool, providing an overview of the scenario and in particular the areas involved, can facilitate the operations of operators equipped with a handheld computer with web access. The detection of a different area in which place safely, temporarily, the source is relatively simple and can be readily verified using the software. The program can also be a useful aid for companies that deal with transport of radioactive sources, with the possibility to check, for the intended path, the areas potentially affected as a result of an accident with the exposure source. The program, finally, may be potentiated with a mask for the case of known source, for which it is known in addition to the type of radionuclide activity value, as well as with the inclusion of other fields for the evaluation of additional elements such as values of doses taken by those who is the field of radiation.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that treatment of mammalian cells with <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> is associated with activation of gene expression. Although the signal transduction pathways stimulated by <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> remain unclear, our previous findings indicate that radiation induces specific genes at the transcriptional level. The present work has examined the effects of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> on the transcription factor NF-kappa B. The results demonstrate that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> activates DNA binding of nuclear factor (NF) kappa B. This effect was detectable at 2 grays (Gy) and reached a maximum at 5 - 20 Gy. At a dose of 20 Gy, the increase in NF-kappa B binding activity was maximal at 2 - 4 h and then declined to pretreatment levels. The results also demonstrate that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> transiently increases NF-kappa B mRNA levels. However, the finding that induction of NF-kappa B binding to DNA occurs in the presence of cycloheximide indicates that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> activates preexisting NF-kappa B protein.

40|$|The p 53 {{protein is}} one of the major tumor {{suppressor}} proteins. In response to DNA damage, p 53 is prevented from degradation and accumulates to high levels. <b>Ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> leads to hypophosphorylation of the p 53 ubiquitin ligase Mdm 2 at sites where phosphorylation is critical for p 53 degradation and to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt/PKB, a kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits GSK- 3. GSK- 3, which normally phosphorylates Mdm 2, is inactivated in response to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> We show that p 53 accumulates in lymphoblasts from patients with the hereditary disorder ataxia telangiectasia in response to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> despite the absence of a functional ATM kinase. Also, knockdown of ATR did not prevent p 53 accumulation in response to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> Instead, p 53 stabilization in response to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> depended on the inactivation of GSK- 3 and the presence of Akt/PKB. Akt/PKB is a target of DNA-PK, a kinase that is activated after <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> Correspondingly, down-regulation of DNA-PK prevented phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and GSK- 3 after <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> and strongly reduced the accumulation of p 53. We therefore propose a signaling cascade for the regulation of p 53 in response to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> that involves activation of DNA-PK and Akt/PKB and inactivation of GSK- 3 and Mdm 2...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> induces the expression of certain cytokines, such as TNF a/cachectin. However, there is presently no available information regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of cytokine gene expression by <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> In this report, we describe the regulation of the TNF gene by <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> in human myeloid leukemia cells. The increase in TNF transcripts by x rays was both time- and dose-dependent as determined by Northern blot analysis. Similar findings were obtained in human peripheral blood monocytes. Transcriptional run-on analyses have demonstrated that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> stimulates the rate of TNF gene transcription. Furthermore, induction ofTNF mRNA was increased in the absence of protein synthesis. In contrast, <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> had little effect on the half-life ofTNF transcripts.

In this work we use the results of computational simulations to approximate the <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> from such events as well as longer term increases in cosmic ray flux.

The detection of drug candidates to prevent reproductive system from damage caused by <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> is urgent. We aimed to investigate the protective role of taurine on the injury of mouse spermatocyte-derived cells (GC- 2) subjected to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> Methods: mouse spermatocytes (GC- 2 cells) were exposed to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> with or without treatment of Taurine. The effect of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> and Taurine treatment on GC- 2 cells were evaluated by cell viability assay (CCK 8), cell cycle and apoptosis.

Results: Taurine significantly inhibited the decrease of cell viability, percentage of apoptotic cells and cell cycle arrest induced by <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> Western blot analysis showed that taurine significantly limited the ionizing radiation-induced down-regulation of CyclinB 1 and CDK 1, and suppressed activation of Fas/FasL system pathway. In addition, taurine treatment significantly increased the expression of Nrf 2 and HO- 1 in GC- 2 cells exposed to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation,</b> two components in antioxidant pathway.
