In this paper, we consider a nano-motion stage driven by a walking piezo actuator, which contains four bimorph piezo legs. We propose a (model-based) optimization method to derive waveforms that result in optimal <b>driving</b> <b>properties</b> of the walking piezo motor. A model of the stage and motor is developed incorporating the switching behavior of the drive legs, the contact deformation, and stick-slip effects between the legs and the stage. The friction-based driving principle of the motor is modeled using a set-valued friction model, resulting in a model in terms of differential-algebraic inclusions. For this model, we developed a dedicated numerical time-stepping solver. Experiments show a good model accuracy in both the drive direction and the perpendicular direction. The validated model is used in an optimization, resulting in waveforms with optimal <b>driving</b> <b>properties</b> of the stage at constant velocity. Besides the model-based optimization, also a direct experimental data-based waveform optimization is performed. Experiments with the optimized waveforms show that compared to existing sinusoidal and asymmetric waveforms in literature the <b>driving</b> <b>properties</b> can be significantly improved by the model-based waveforms and even further by the data-based waveforms...|$|E

A regression model for Singapore&# 039;s office property market for the period from June 1992 to December 2005 was constructed.

40|$|Elasticity—where systems {{acquire and}} release {{resources}} {{in response to}} dynamic workloads, while paying only for what they need—is a <b>driving</b> <b>property</b> of cloud computing. At the core of any elastic system is an automated controller. This paper addresses elastic control for multi-tier application services that allocate and release resources in discrete units, such as virtual server instances of predetermined sizes. It focuses on elastic control of the storage tier, in which adding or removing a storage node or “brick ” requires rebalancing stored data across the nodes. The storage tier presents new challenges for elastic control: actuator delays (lag) due to rebalancing, interference with applications and sensor measurements, {{and the need to}} synchronize the multiple control elements, including rebalancing. We have designed and implemented a new controller for elastic storage systems to address these challenges. Using a popular distributed storage system—the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) —under dynamic Web 2. 0 workloads, we show how the controller adapts to workload changes to maintain performance objectives efficiently in a pay-as-you-go cloud computing environment. 1...|$|R

On the anticipation level of this model, nominal trajectories for the path and the speed profile of the vehicle along a given course are determined by reducing the driving task to a parametric optimal control problem and using an efficient direct collocation method for its solution. Typical optimality criteria and control-state constraints serve to depict <b>driving</b> <b>properties</b> of different driver types. On the stabilization level, a nonlinear position controller guides the full vehicle dynamics model along the prescribed trajectories in real-time. This synthetic driver model allows easy implementation of different driving strategies to simulate {{a wide range of}} driver types and vehicles.

40|$|Microvalves play an {{important}} role in fluid control in micro total analysis systems (µTAS). Previous studies have reported complex fabrication processes for making microvalve elements in a channel. Hence, there is a need for a simpler microvalve fabrication method for achieving throughput improvement and cost reduction in µTAS. In this study, we propose a simple fabrication method for a magnetically driven microvalve array using a photosensitive composite. The composite was prepared by mixing a photoresist and magnetic particles of pure iron. The simple fabrication process was performed by using a laminating layer composed of a sacrificial part and the composite in a channel. The microvalve elements were fabricated by one-step photolithography using the processability of the sacrificial layer and composite. Further, we demonstrated the magnetic <b>driving</b> <b>property</b> of the fabricated microvalve array device. Compared to devices containing non-driving microvalves, the flow rate was decreased by 50 %, and the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet increased by up to 4 kPa with increase in driving microvalve elements.

40|$|The {{effect of}} cell size on the {{out of plane}} {{compressive}} crushing response of circular cell polycarbonate honeycomb is presented. The results are a continuation of a study originally done by Mellquist and Waas, 2002. Experiments were conducted on hexagonal cell honeycombs {{ranging in size from}} 1 to 14 cells. The results show that no scaling factor can be determined for the crushing load based on sample size, but that stability appears to be a <b>driving</b> <b>property.</b> Specimen cross-section shapes that have an arrangement of cells with higher orders of symmetry provide greater stability and are less imperfection sensitive and therefore have higher crushing loads. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to better understand the behavior of the honeycombs during crushing and to validate experimental results. An FEA model developed during the previous work (a 7 cell model) has been expanded to multiple sizes. The results are presented and show that the model can accurately predict how different size honeycombs will perform under crushing loads.

An {{area that is}} occupied by the moved particles is proposed, as a desirableevaluation method for a reflective display. To compare the driving property of the particle-moving method withthat of the reported simple particle-loading method, two panels are fabricated, according to the different particleinsertionmethods, in the same panel condition, of which the width of ribs is 30 μm, the cell size is 220 μm × 220 μm,the cell gap is 116 - 120 μm, the q/m value of the black particles is + 1. 8 μC/g and that for the white particles is - 4. 3 μC/g. The particle-moving method has a filtering effect which excludes the non-moving particles, inserting only movableparticles into the respective cell, so that a panel fabricated by the particle-moving method can drive most of theparticles in a cell. Also, most of the particles move at the threshold voltage of 40 V, with enhanced reflectivity. Thedriving property is also verified by measurement of the occupation rate of the moved particles...|$|E

It is defined as the rate of change of surface tangent planes as a surface coordinate curve is transversed in uniform increments of arc length...|$|E

One example of vehicle stabilizing systems is vehicle rollover warning and assist system which has to rely on a relatively accurate height of center of gravity estimate in order to be implemented in vehicles e_ciently and would otherwise be considered useless. In this thesis a literature study on the height of center of gravity in heavy vehicles in general and semitrailers in particular is conducted at Scania CV and emphasis is towards a model relying as little as possible on data from outside the tractor.

The estimation tool is tested on Scania semitrailers with di_erent suspension con_gurations and the result shows that the height of center of gravity can be estimated as close as 4. 1 (cm) from the real value for 4 x 2 Gen 2 Scania tractor and 3. 3 (cm) for 4 x 2 Gen 3 Scania tractor...|$|E

Using neural networks for modeling carbonizing in fluidized bed is caused by several nets' features: non linear character, ability to generalize the results of calculations for data out of training set, no need for mathematical algorithms describing influence changes input parameters on modeling materials properties. The neural network structure is designed and special prepared by choosing input and output parameters of process. The method of learning and testing neural network, the way of limiting nets structure and minimizing learning and testing error are discussed.
