40|$|There {{are several}} {{relations}} which may {{fall short of}} genuine identity, but which behave like identity in important respects. Such <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> discrimination have recently {{been the subject of}} much philosophical and technical discussion. This paper aims to complete their technical investigation. <b>Grades</b> <b>of</b> indiscernibility are defined in terms of satisfaction of certain first-order formulas. <b>Grades</b> <b>of</b> symmetry are defined in terms of symmetries on a structure. Both of these families <b>of</b> <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> discrimination have been studied in some detail. However, this paper also introduces <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> relativity, defined in terms of relativeness correspondences. This paper explores the relationships between all the <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> discrimination, exhaustively answering several natural questions that have so far received only partial answers. It also establishes which grades can be captured in terms of satisfaction of object-language formulas and draws connections with definability theory. This is the author accepted manuscript. It is currently under indefinite embargo pending publication by Duke University Press...|$|R
