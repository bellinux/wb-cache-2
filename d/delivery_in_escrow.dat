40|$|It is {{not known}} to date how to {{partially}} share the factors of an integer (e. g., an RSA modulus) with verifiability. We construct such a scheme on exploitation of a significantly lowered complexity for factoring n = pq using a non-trivial factor of OE(n). 1 Introduction Partial key escrow purports to add {{a great deal of}} difficulty to mass privacy intrusion which is possible <b>in</b> ordinary key <b>escrow</b> with abusive authorities while preserving the property of an ordinary <b>escrowed</b> cryptosystem <b>in</b> targeting small number of criminals. <b>In</b> partial key <b>escrow,</b> a portion of an individual's private key with an agreed and proved size will not be <b>in</b> <b>escrow.</b> Key recovery requires a non-trivial effort to determine the missing part. A partial key escrow scheme must render that the determination of the missing key part will only be possible after recovery of the key part <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> (usually with a set of distributed agents who are collectively trusted to share the escrowed key part).

In late 2003, despite challenge rules that money could not be placed <b>in</b> <b>escrow,</b> Randi announced {{that he was willing to}} do so for Browne; Browne did not accept or acknowledge this offer. In 2005, Browne posted a message online that she had never received confirmation of the prize money's existence, despite Randi's claim that he had a certified mail receipt showing Browne's refusal of the package.|$|R

5000|$|Ownership of domains {{held by a}} {{privacy service}} was also {{an issue in the}} RegisterFly case, in which a {{registrar}} effectively ceased operations and then went bankrupt.

5000|$|Based on {{data from}} 3 February 2012 to 24 July 2012, an {{estimated}} $15 million in transactions were made annually on Silk Road. Twelve months later, Nicolas Christin, the study's author, {{said in an interview}} that a major increase in volume to [...] "somewhere between $30 million and $45 million" [...] would not surprise him. Buyers and sellers conducted all transactions with bitcoins (BTC), a cryptocurrency that provides a certain degree of anonymity. Silk Road held buyers' bitcoins <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> until the order had been received and a hedging mechanism allowed sellers to opt for the value of bitcoins held <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> to be fixed to their value in US$ at the time of the sale to mitigate against Bitcoin's volatility. Any changes in the price of bitcoins during transit were covered by Dread Pirate Roberts.|$|R
50|$|Source code escrow agents hold {{source code}} of {{software}} <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> just as other escrow companies hold cash. Normally {{you do not}} own or have any rights to the software (including source code) that you are accessing, {{under the terms of}} a regular SaaS or desktop software agreement. This does not usually become an issue until technical problems start to arise, i.e. unexpected service interruptions, downtime, loss of application functionality and loss of data. This can add significant costs to your business and you remain reliant upon the software supplier to resolve these issues, unless you have an <b>escrow</b> agreement <b>in</b> place. <b>Escrow</b> is when the software source code is held by a third party - an escrow agent - on behalf of the customer and the supplier. Information escrow agents, such as the International Creative Registry, hold <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> intellectual property and other information. Examples include song music and lyrics, manufacturing designs and laboratory notebooks, and television and movie treatments and scripts. This is done to establish legal ownership rights, with the independent escrow agents attesting to the information's ownership, contents, and creation date.|$|R
50|$|Environmental {{consulting}} spans a {{wide spectrum}} of industry. The most basic industry that environmental consulting remains prominent in is the commercial estate market. Many commercial lenders rely on both small and large environmental firms. Many commercial lenders will not lend monies to borrowers if the property or personal capital does not exceed the worth of the land. If an environmental problem is discovered property owners that deem themselves a responsible party will most likely reserve monies <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> <b>in</b> order to resolve the environmental impact.|$|R

5000|$|Teachers {{conducted}} more 'raids' on 27 April, demanding of bankers: [...] "Pay your taxes!" [...] and [...] "We want food!" [...] After joining city meetings en masse, they {{proceeded to}} the Chicago Title and Trust Company, which held $10 million of property taxes <b>in</b> <b>escrow.</b> President Holman Pettibone {{spoke to the}} crowd from a second-story window and attempted {{to convince them that}} the company owed nothing to the city. (In fact, Chicago Title and Trust did possess $10 million of unpaid property tax money, held <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> accounts for tax evaders; Pettibone argued that the bank could not legitimately hand them over to the city.) Here, they clashed directly with police and bankers; several teachers were beaten and a large plate-glass window was broken. The National Education Association telegraphed bankers directly, threatening to move the organization's convention (with its 10,000 attendees) away from Chicagoâ€”a potential blow for the upcoming World's Fair.) ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the concept was key <b>escrow.</b> <b>In</b> the factory, any new {{telephone}} or other device with a Clipper chip would be given a cryptographic key, that would then be provided to the government <b>in</b> <b>escrow.</b> If government agencies [...] "established their authority" [...] to listen to a communication, then the key would be given to those government agencies, who could then decrypt all data transmitted by that particular telephone. The newly formed Electronic Frontier Foundation preferred the term [...] "key surrender" [...] to emphasize what they alleged was really occurring.|$|R

2500|$|This {{narrative}} gives a mistaken {{impression of}} the ending. For the trip, Fogg took Â£20,000 - in cash - in a suitcase, amounting to 1/2 of his fortune at the time. The other half of his fortune - the other Â£20,000 was to be held <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> at the bank to pay off his wager if he lost - {{the men on the}} other side of the bet, similarly put Â£20,000 to be held during the wager. Much of what Fogg took with him was spent during the trip, as detailed above. Before the date was discovered, Fogg confessed to Aouda that he was now poor, but she wanted to marry him anyway, as set out above. When the true date was discovered, as above, Fogg collected the Â£20,000 wagered - and his Â£20,000 that was held <b>in</b> <b>escrow,</b> restoring him to his original fortune of Â£40,000 - distributing the remaining balance of his [...] "travel money".|$|R
