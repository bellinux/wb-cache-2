A sub-group of the Mission, with some further British aeronautical design engineers, {{returned to}} Germany from 16-25 July 1945, working out of Freising, to examine the BMW high-altitude test chamber at Munich, as well as German facilities at Stuttgart, Göttingen, Volkenrode, and Kochel, in order to gather more information on German turbine manufacture and to witness the testing of the Goblin on the Munich testbed. The BMW facility, codenamed Herbitus, was designed and operated by Christoph Soestmeyer, and was finished in May 1944. It was used for trials on BMW and Jumo turbine engines, as well as the 801; Soestmeyer reported RLM had intended to build similar facilities at the central Luftwaffe test station, or Erprobungsstelle at Rechlin, and in Berlin, Dessau, and Stuttgart. The test facility was a building 250 ft square and 70 ft high, containing a steel cylindrical altitude chamber some 12 ft in diameter and 30 ft long, with a detachable rear section, allowing engines to be wheeled in and out for testing. It was capable of altitudes of as much as 36,000 ft and test speeds 560 mph. The Mission hoped to test the Derwent V and de Havilland Goblin at altitude. Fedden called it [...] "far in advance of any engine testing plant in England or America", and was sufficiently impressed as to suggest the plant be moved to Britain, but the Americans refused.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} to fault detection (FD) in industrial measurement systems is proposed {{in this paper}} which includes an identification strategy for early detection of {{the appearance of a}} fault. This approach is model based, i. e. nominal models are used which represent the fault-free state of the on-line measured process. This approach is also suitable for off-line FD. The framework that combines FD with isolation and correction (FDIC) is outlined in this paper. The proposed approach is characterized by automatic threshold determination, ability to analyse local properties of the models, and aggregation of different fault detection statements. The nominal models are built using data-driven and hybrid approaches, combining first principle models with on-line data-driven techniques. At the same time the models are transparent and interpretable. This novel approach is then verified on a number of real and simulated data sets of car <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> (both gasoline—Alfa Romeo JTS, and diesel—Caterpillar).

Using two <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>benches,</b> compression ignition (CI) and spark ignition (SI), we have investigated the engine performances and emissions of methyl, ethyl, butyl and pentyl valerate.

In the SI experiments, we observed that the methyl and ethyl valerate have a higher flame speed than PRF 95 which required a slight change of ignition timing to optimize the work output. However, both the performances and the emissions are not significantly modified. In the CI experiments, the blends including butyl or pentyl valerate performed equally well as the diesel. The lower cetane number of the esters slightly increase the ignition delay of the blends without affecting the performances.

40|$|Hydrogen-fueled {{internal}} combustion engines equipped with {{port fuel injection}} offer a cheap alternative to fuel cells and can be run in bi-fuel operation side-stepping the chicken and egg problem of availability of hydrogen fueling station versus hydrogen vehicle. Hydrogen engines with external mixture formation have a significantly lower power output than gasoline engines. The main causes are the lower volumetric energy density of the externally formed hydrogen-air mixture and the occurrence of abnormal combustion phenomena (mainly backfire). Two <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> were used to investigate different means of compensating for this power loss, while keeping oxides of nitrogen (NO x) emissions limited. A single cylinder research engine was used to {{study the effects of}} supercharging, combined with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Supercharging the engine results in an increase in power output. The combination with EGR permits stoichiometric operation and thus low NO x emissions because of the resulting high aftertreatment efficiency. Furthermore, the power output can be varied through the supercharging pressure and the EGR percentage, enabling throttle-less operation and thus higher engine efficiencies. A four-cylinder production gasoline engine was converted to bi-fuel operation and was used to study the effects of continuously variable intake valve timing on power output, efficiency, emissions and the occurrence of backfire when operated on hydrogen. The engine efficiency on hydrogen is compared to gasoline operation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel method to solve analysis and design problems for nonlinear control systems, the classical solutions of which {{rely on the}} solvability, or on the solution itself, of partial differential equations or inequalities. The {{first part of the}} thesis is dedicated to the analysis of nonlinear systems. The notion of Dynamic Lyapunov function is introduced. These functions allow to study stability properties of equilibrium points, similarly to standard Lyapunov functions. In the former, however, a positive definite function is combined with a dynamical system that render Dynamic Lyapunov functions easier to construct than Lyapunov functions. These ideas are then extended to characterize Dynamic Controllability and Observability functions, which are exploited in the model reduction problem for nonlinear systems. Constructive solutions to the L 2 -disturbance attenuation and the optimal control problems are proposed {{in the second part of}} the thesis. The key aspect of these solutions is the definition of Dynamic Value functions that, generalizing Dynamic Lyapunov functions, consist of a dynamical feedback and a positive definite function. In the last part of the thesis a similar approach is utilized to simplify the observer design problem via the Immersion and Invariance technique.

Optical and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses have been conducted both inside and outside injectors of different type and four locations have been identified as the main deposition sites. Furthermore, different coking typologies, i. e., dry and wet coking, have been assessed and discussed. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy images of the deposits on the spray hole walls have revealed that minute quantities of Zn catalyze the coking reactions to a great extent.

40|$|National audienceIn {{order to}} {{increase}} the volumetric efficiency of downsized engines, turbochargers may be used. They allow the increase of the intake pressure and {{are associated with a}} charge air cooler (CAC). The main disadvantage of a downsized turbocharged engine (compared to a naturally aspirated one) is the deterioration of low-end torque caused by the lack of enthalpy of the exhaust gas at low engine speed and load. To investigate this issue, the intake line of a turbocharged Diesel engine was analyzed, focusing on the pressure waves at the inlet [1] [2] which are most often overlooked on these engines in favor of pressure loss reduction. A first step of the study is to identify the potential resonance for the establishment of standing waves at low engine speeds. Experimental tests with different pipe lengths upstream and downstream of the charge air cooler (CAC) were performed on an electrically driven <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> (pulse generator). This was done to study the influence of pressure waves on the air filling of the engine and determine the optimal length of the air circuit.

This allows to characterize the unsteady behavior of this element and to better discern the influence of the upstream and downstream ducts on engine filling.
