50|$|Short fiber {{reinforced}} composites {{are used}} increasingly as a structural material {{because they provide}} superior mechanical properties and can be easily produced by the rapid, low-cost injection molding process, by extrusion and with spray-up technique. An important issue for short fiber thermoplastic composites is void formation and growth during production processes. It {{has been shown that}} voids tend to nucleate at fiber ends, and their content depends on processing conditions, fiber concentration, and fiber length. For example, in an injection molding process bubble growth is suppressed by cooling the material under pressure. Density measurements confirm a much lower void content (-1%) in the injection-molded samples in comparison with the extrudates. Another factor playing an important role in void formation is the cooling rate. While the melt is cooled external surface layers solidify first. These layers restrain the contraction of material within the melt. This leads to internal voiding. As a result, slower cooling rates decrease void content in the composite. Finally, {{it is interesting to note}} that in an extruded structure, longer fibers result in higher void contents. This unexpected behaviour is due to the overcoming of other factors like viscosity, <b>extrusion</b> <b>pressure</b> and shear rate, which make the analysis on this phenomenon very complicated.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper investigates some of {{the effects}} of {{axisymmetric}} die geometry and flowrate during the isothermal extrusion of solid chocolate. Experimental observations, such as the material exhibiting a yield stress, flowrate independence and irreversible deformation, indicate that solid chocolate can be modelled using a rigid perfect plastic constitutive model (usually applied to the characterisation of metal forming processes). Numerically obtained <b>extrusion</b> <b>pressures</b> for a range of area reductions, using a commercial finite element package (ABAQUS) in combination with a remeshing code, are compared to experimental data to determine the uniaxial yield stress of the material.

In the process, aluminum alloy (Al 6063) was heated at 350 °C for one hour, machined and cut to billets size of 11. 95 m x 11. 95 m x 40 m (l × b × h). The billets were extruded through die of 12 mm x 12 mm channel cross-section area, the channel angle was 60 °. Four vegetable based lubricants namely jatropha, neem, castor and cotton seed oils were used. The die was centrally located on the bed of vertical hydraulic testing machine and the billet was inserted into the entrance channel. Lubrication was applied to the billet to decrease its friction and with the channel inner wall. The ram displacement per plunger speed was 1 mm per 1 second respectively. For each lubricant, four samples were extruded through ECAE die to confirm the repeatability of the results and the average values of the <b>extrusion</b> <b>pressure</b> were computed.

Initial stages involved {{the development of a}} method for capturing mechanical destruction acoustic emissions. Consideration was given to mechanical test parameters, vibrations from the test rig, extrudate geometry and ensuring frequency spectra acoustic differences occur. Structural characterisation was developed using x-ray microtomography (XMT). Pore size distributions, volume fraction porosity and average oell wall thickness were taken from XMT images. A three dimensional watershed algorithm was successfully applied to the three dimensional XMT images to segment interconnected-regions into recognisable cells. This stage is required due to the open-cell nature ofextrudate porosity. In order to obtain samples of differing porosity but all other parameters constant an expansion control chamber (ECC) was used.
