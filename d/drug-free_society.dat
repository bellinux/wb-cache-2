This pragmatic approach was motivated {{by the idea that}} a <b>drug-free</b> Dutch <b>society</b> is unrealistic and unattainable, and efforts would be better spent trying to minimize harm caused by recreational drug use. As a result of this gedoogbeleid (lit. [...] "tolerance policy" [...] or [...] "policy of tolerance"), the Netherlands is typically seen as much more tolerant of drugs than most other countries.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{of heroin}} {{maintenance}} programmes {{object to the}} high costs of providing heroin to users. The British heroin study cost the British government £15,000 per participant per year, roughly equivalent to average heroin user's expense of £15,600 per year. Drug Free Australia contrast these ongoing maintenance costs with Sweden's investment in, and commitment to, a <b>drug-free</b> <b>society</b> where a policy of compulsory rehabilitation of drug addicts is integral, which has yielded the one of the lowest reported illicit drug use levels in the developed world, a model in which successfully rehabilitated users present no further maintenance costs to their community, as well as reduced ongoing health care costs.|$|E

RNS don't accept any of the state grants which are available. Bejerot warned of the consequences of an ‘epidemic addiction’, prompted by young, psychologically and socially unstable persons who, usually after direct personal initiation from another drug abuser, begin to use socially nonaccepted, intoxicating drugs to gain euphoria. In 1972, Bejerots' reports were used as one of the reasons for increasing the maximum penalty for grave drug offences in Sweden to 10 years in prison. In 1974 he was called to testify as one of 21 scientific experts on marijuana for a subcommittee of the United States Senate on the marijuana-hashish epidemic and its impact on United States security.|$|E

"The {{objective}} of the Swedish drug policy {{should continue to be}} a <b>drug-free</b> <b>society.</b> The main focus of drug policy is focused and concerted efforts to limit both supply and demand of drugs. Strengthened efforts are needed to strengthen the political priority of the drugs, to improve cooperation between different authorities and between authorities and organisations, to improve the preventive work among other things through the method and skills development, development of care through, inter alia, methodology and skills development and research, develop treatment perspective of prison, streamlining operations in the field of control, improve the methods to comply with drug development and society's efforts, and to increase international cooperation. The government sets up a special national drugs co-ordinator with the task of implementing and monitoring the action plan and sets aside 325 MSEK extra over three years to implement the Action Plan."

50|$|Sweden's {{drug policy}} has {{gradually}} turned from lenient in the 1960s {{with an emphasis}} on drug supply towards a policy of zero tolerance against all illicit drug use (including cannabis). The official aim is a <b>drug-free</b> <b>society.</b> Drug use itself became a punishable crime in 1988; personal usage does not result in jail time if it is not in combination with driving a car. Prevention includes widespread drug testing, and the penalties range from fines for minor drug offenses up to a 10-year prison sentence for aggravated offenses. The condition for suspended sentences could be regular drug tests or submission to rehabilitation treatment. Drug treatment is free of charge and provided through the health care system and the municipal social services. Drug usage that threatens the health and development of minors could force them into mandatory treatment if they don't apply voluntary. If the usage threatens the immediate health or the security of others (such as a child of an addict) the same could apply to adults.|$|E

40|$|In Malaysia the {{response}} to illicit drug use has been largely punitive with the current goal of the Malaysian government being to achieve a <b>drug-free</b> <b>society</b> by 2015. This paper outlines {{the results of a}} desk-based situation assessment conducted over a 3 -week period in 2004. Additional events, examined in 2005, were also included to describe more recent policy developments and examine how these came about. Despite punitive drug policy there has been a substantial {{rise in the number of}} drug users in the country. Over two-thirds of HIV/AIDS cases are among injecting drug users (IDUs) and there has been an exponential rise in the number of cases reported. Further, data suggest high risk drug use practices are widespread. Harm reduction initiatives have only recently been introduced in Malaysia. The successful piloting of substitution therapies, in particular methadone and buprenorphine, is cause for genuine hope for the rapid development of such interventions. In 2005 the government announced it will allow methadone maintenance programmes to operate beyond the pilot phase and needle and syringe exchange programmes will be established to serve the needs of IDUs.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Sweden once enjoyed {{the reputation of being}} the modern society - successful economically and socially, steering a 'middle way' between capitalism and socialism. Even during the 1980 s, it maintained a commitment to full employment and a high standard of state welfare. The work presented here - published between 1988 and 1996 - describes {{the way in which the}} country has faced a series of real and perceived threats from inside and outside its boundaries. While international competition and globalisation have brought about major economic changes with consequences for unemployment, public expenditure and the welfare state, there has also been a concern about the possibility of increased drug-taking, particularly amongst young people. The reaction to the former has been to make cuts in welfare benefits and services but to resist the dismantling of the 'People's Home'. The reaction to the drugs issue has been to follow an abstentionist policy - the restrictive line - with the aim of creating a <b>drug-free</b> <b>society.</b> Both the reluctance to concede the necessity of restructuring the welfare state and the creation of a moral panic around drugs, can be explained by a cultural defence of values which are important to Swedish society - rationality, order and sobriety. Section I of this submission is concerned with the development of drug policy; section II with the decline of the welfare state...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{question}} of whether there is a growing process of rationalization underlying drug policy and drug treatment, {{in the sense of the}} “McDonaldization ” thesis established by Ritzer (2000). Taking Germany as an example, there is some evidence that endeavors to achieve enhanced efficiency may actually lead to a lack of rationality. Here we explore the historical background of this McDonaldization process as it relates to drug policy and treatment in Germany. Is it possible to escape from the “irrationality of rationality, ” that is, the intense efforts directed at efficiency in drug treatment? PROLOGUE While a hamburger and its raw materials are well-known, tangible entities, drug policy and approaches to drug treatment seem to be largely amorphous, much less objective concepts. The conceptual basis for drug policy and treatment is determined by countless established institutions, associations, departments within particular ministries, and the like that cope with its different facets. Proponents of current drug prohibitionist policy envision a world completely free of individuals who consume mind altering substances. Yet, they seek to institutionalize their notions of a better world by using the language of “treatment ” and “care. ” This vision and the language of treatment and care are at odds with each other. The idea of a <b>drug-free</b> <b>society</b> is, so to speak, the raw material of the drug care system – or to put it differently in the sense of Husserl’s phenomenology: The reality of drug care ha...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{highlight}} drug experiences and the significance our interviewee’s ascribe to their drug experiences in conjunction to their everyday lives. In the concluding chapter of this study we have used the collective experiences of the participants to allow us to engage in a dialogue of why it is important to acknowledge the attributes and needs an individual attaches to his/her perspective drug in the field of social welfare in Sweden. Symbolic Interactionism as a theoretical approach is used as the framework for understanding responses of participants in this study. The word “experience” is a comprehensive concept for the sensations that an individual feels. The research has been collected through seven qualitative interviews with seven former drug addicts, who have all abused drugs on a daily basis over a period of four to thirty years. All the participants have been addicted to amphetamine, heroin or crack. The emphasis has been on each participant’s subjective experience of drug abuse and it is their truth that is told in our study. The result of the research shows that when a drug becomes a bearer of meaning- i. e. the needs and attributes the individual crave for, it becomes the central and a long-awaited phenomenon in the person’s life. The individual now de-signs his/her reality on the basis of these needs and attributes that he/she has attached to the drug. However the world becomes ever more complex over time when the individual’s life revolves around the drug experience and no longer fits into the <b>drug-free</b> <b>society.</b> The positive and negative attributes attached to the drug evolves over time and there for changes their perspective to the drug experience thus allowing them to live a drug-free life...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} ideas that have emerged during the course of writing a book on Swedish welfare in the 1990 s. The book is the result of many years of writing about two subjects: Swedish drug policy and the Swedish welfare state. The one very specialised, the other, more general. I first became interested in Swedish drug policy on a research visit to Örebro Län in 1986. A social worker showed me a copy of the county's drug policy programme and explained the significance of the 'restrictive line'. I have spent the years since that visit, trying to understand and explain the Swedish goal of a <b>drug-free</b> <b>society</b> (Gould 1988, 1994, 1996 b). I only began to write about the welfare state in Sweden in the early 1990 s, just as things were beginning to go wrong for the economy (Gould 1993 a, 1993 b, 1996 a, 1999). For the last few years I have intended to write a book on the events covered by the period 1991 - 1998 - the years of a Bourgeois and a Social Democratic Government -which would bring the two halves of my work together. Material for this study has been accumulated over many years. A number of research visits have been made; large numbers of academics, politicians, civil servants, journalists, unemployed people, social workers and their clients have been interviewed; and extensive use has been made of academic, administrative and public libraries. Since September 1991 I have systematically collected articles from Dagens Nyheter about social services, social insurance, health care, employment, social issues and problems, the economy and politics. The journal Riksdag och Departement (Parliament and Ministry), which summarises a wide range of public documents, has been invaluable. Friends and informal contacts have also given me insights into the Swedish way of life. The new book is based upon all of these experiences. This paper will begin with a brief account of major global social and economic changes that have occurred in the last twenty years. This is intended to provide a background to the more recent changes that have occurred in Swedish society in the last decade. It will be suggested that the changes in Sweden, particularly in the field of welfare, have been less severe than elsewhere and that this is due to political, institutional and cultural resistance. The paper will conclude by arguing that Sweden, as an exemplar of an Apollonian modern society, has had much to fear from the Dionysian characteristics of postmodernity...|$|E
