5000|$|According to The New York Times, cases {{involving}} so-called sovereign citizens pose [...] "a challenge {{to law enforcement}} officers and court officials" [...] {{in connection with the}} <b>filing</b> <b>of</b> false notices of liens—a tactic sometimes called [...] "paper terrorism". Anyone can <b>file</b> a notice <b>of</b> <b>lien</b> against property such as real estate, vehicles, or other assets of another under the Uniform Commercial Code and other laws. In most states of the United States, the validity <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> is not investigated or inquired into at the time <b>of</b> <b>filing.</b> Notices <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> (whether legally valid or not) are a cloud on the title of the property and may affect the property owner's credit rating, ability to obtain home equity loans, refinance the property or take other action with regards to the property. Notices <b>of</b> releases <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> generally must be filed before property may be transferred. The validity <b>of</b> a <b>lien</b> is determined by further legal procedures. Clearing up fraudulent notices <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> may be expensive and time consuming. Filing fraudulent notices <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> or documents is both a crime and a civil offense, a tort.|$|R

5000|$|A false lien is {{document}} that purports {{to describe a}} lien, but which has no legal basis, based upon false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations.

The practice was pioneered by the Posse Comitatus. The Bureau of Prisons has responded by treating lien documents and personal information (such as Social Security Numbers) of federal agents, judges, etc. as contraband in federal prisons.|$|R

5000|$|Already {{in prison}} since January 2007 {{for failure to}} pay federal taxes, for {{structuring}} various bank transactions to evade reporting requirements, and for attempting to obstruct administration of the U.S. internal revenue laws, Young Earth Creationist and Sovereign Citizen proponent Kent Hovind had a raft of new charges laid against him for the <b>filing</b> <b>of</b> lis pendens <b>liens</b> on property deemed forfeited to pay for earlier unpaid taxes. The government argued that the <b>filing</b> <b>of</b> these <b>liens</b> had been earlier forbidden by a court. During his incarceration, Hovind relied increasingly on Sovereign Citizen arguments, denying his U.S Citizenship and declaring [...] "Democracy is evil and contrary to God's law". Hovind's co-defendant was Paul J. Hansen, another Sovereign Citizen advocate. In filings before the court relating to the trial, both made lengthy submissions recycling typical Sovereign Citizen tropes, such as [...] "withdrawing consent for the proceedings", denial of jurisdiction, invocation of maritime law, the attempted convocation of unsanctioned citizen grand juries, and which threatened the judge personally. While the jury failed to reach a verdict on the other charges, on March 12, 2015, Hovind {{was found guilty of}} criminal contempt. The judge, however, rendered a judgment of acquittal in favor of Hovind on May 18, 2015, concluding that the relevant court order had lacked specific language prohibiting Hovind from doing what he did. Hansen, who claims he is neither a U.S. citizen nor resident because he lives on [...] "church land", was convicted on two counts of contempt and sentenced to 18 months in prison and three years probation of August 21, 2015.|$|R

50|$|In Mechanics lien law a Preliminary Notice (also {{known as}} a Notice to Owner, Materialmens Notice to Owner, Notice of Furnishing, Contractor/Subcontractors Notice to Owner, and others) is a notice sent by the general contractor, subcontractor, materialmen, {{equipment}} lessors or other parties to a construction project not to create a Mechanics lien but rather to establish the right to file a Mechanics lien {{in the event of}} nonpayment. The distinction is important. If the Preliminary Notice is sent but the claimant's bill is paid, the Preliminary Notice has no further legal effect. However, if the bill is not paid the claimant may now file a Mechanics lien on the owner's property. Most states do not allow the <b>filing</b> <b>of</b> a Mechanics <b>lien</b> without claimants being able to prove they first sent a Preliminary Notice.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} have the record <b>of</b> a <b>lien</b> {{released}} a taxpayer must obtain a Certificate of Release <b>of</b> Federal Tax <b>Lien.</b> Generally, the IRS will not issue a certificate <b>of</b> release <b>of</b> <b>lien</b> until the tax has either been paid in full or the IRS no longer has a legal interest in collecting the tax.
