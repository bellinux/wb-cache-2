5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty <b>is</b> <b>truth,</b> truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E
5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty <b>is</b> <b>truth,</b> truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E
5|$|We {{shall not}} feel that the generalization, {{unqualified}} and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context {{to compete with the}} scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty <b>is</b> <b>truth,</b> truth beauty' has precisely the same status, and the same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair to the complexity of the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant to literature.|$|E

5000|$|The {{being of}} <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> the redoubling [...] of truth within yourself, within me, within him, that your life, my life, his life expresses the truth {{approximately}} in the striving for it, that your life, my life, {{his life is}} approximately the being of the truth in the striving for it, just as the <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> in Christ a life, for he <b>was</b> the <b>truth.</b> And therefore, Christianly understood, <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> obviously not to know the <b>truth</b> but to <b>be</b> the <b>truth.</b> Despite all modern philosophy, there is an infinite difference here, best seen in Christ's relation to Pilate, for Christ could not, could only untruthfully reply to the question [...] "What is truth?" [...] precisely {{because he was not}} the one who knew what <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> but <b>was</b> the <b>truth.</b> Not as if {{he did not know what}} <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> but when one <b>is</b> the <b>truth</b> and when the requirement is to <b>be</b> the <b>truth,</b> to know the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> untruth. For knowing the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> something that entirely of itself accompanies being the truth, not the other way around. And that is why it becomes untruth when knowing the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> separated from being the truth or when knowing the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> made identical with being it, since it is related the other way. <b>Being</b> the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> identical with knowing the truth, and Christ would never have known the truth if he has not been it, and nobody knows more of the truth than what he <b>is</b> of the <b>truth.</b> Practice in Christianity, 1848, Hong, 1991, p. 205-206 ...|$|R

500|$|Marie Krøyer née Triepcke (1867–1940) {{came from}} a well-to-do German family living in Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after {{training}} privately she went to Paris to continue her studies. It was there, in early 1889, that she met Krøyer who immediately fell {{madly in love with}} her. Although he was 16 years her senior, the couple married that summer. In 1891, they settled in Skagen, giving Krøyer ample opportunity to paint portraits of Marie, both indoors and especially on the beach.

500|$|The [...] "Ultimatium" [...] {{at the end}} of {{the second}} volume of Either/Or hinted at a future {{discussion}} of the religious stage in The Two Upbuilding Discourses, [...] "Ask yourself and keep on asking until you find the answer, for one may have known something many times, acknowledged it; one may have willed something many times, attempted it-and yet, only the deep inner motion, only the heart’s indescribable emotion, only that will convince you that what you have acknowledged belongs to you, that no power can take it from you-for only the truth that builds up <b>is</b> <b>truth</b> for you." [...] This discussion is included in Stages on Life's Way (1845).

500|$|The {{narrative}} of Jesus' Passion, Resurrection, and post-Resurrection appearances. The Passion narrative opens with {{an account of}} the Last Supper that differs significantly from that found in the synoptics, with Jesus washing the disciples' feet instead of ushering in a new covenant of his body and blood. This is followed by Jesus' Farewell Discourse, an account of his betrayal, arrest, trial, death, burial, post-Resurrection appearances, and final commission for his followers. It also includes Peter's denial, the institution of the New Commandment and the New Covenant, the promise of the Paraclete, the allegory of the True Vine, the High Priestly Prayer, the ut omnes unum sint, the What <b>is</b> <b>truth?,</b> Jesus' mocking and crowning with thorns, the Ecce homo, the discovery of the empty tomb, the noli me tangere, the Great Commission, and the incredulity of Thomas. The section ends with a conclusion on the purpose of the gospel: [...] "that [...] may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{her role}} as the seductive femme fatale, Ayesha is part of [...] "a long {{tradition}} of male fantasy that includes Homer's Circe, Shakespeare's Cleopatra, and Keats's 'La Belle Dame sans Merci'". Brantlinger identifies the theme of [...] "the white (or at least light-skinned) queen ruling a black or brown-skinned savage race" [...] as [...] "a powerfully erotic one" [...] with its opposite being [...] "the image of the helpless white woman captured by savages and threatened, at least, with rape". The figure of She both inspires male desire and dominates male sovereignty, represented in her conquest of the enlightened Victorians Holly and Leo. The two Englishmen embody the powers of manhood, with Leo a reflection of masculine physicality and Holly a representation of man's intellectual strength; but both are conquered by the feminine powers of She, who rules as much through sex-appeal as through sorcery, immortality, and will. Thus Steven Arata describes her as [...] "the veiled woman, that ubiquitous nineteenth-century figure of male desire and anxiety, whose body <b>is</b> <b>Truth</b> but a Truth that blasts". Similarly, Sarah Gilbert sees the theme of feminine sexuality and authority realised in Ayesha as critical to the novel's success: [...] "Unlike the women earlier Victorian writers had idealised or excoriated, She was neither an angel nor a monster. Rather, She was an odd but significant blend of the two types – an angelically chaste woman with monstrous powers, a monstrously passionate woman with angelic charms".|$|E
500|$|Like many of Keats's odes, [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] {{discusses}} art and art's audience. He {{relied on}} depictions of natural music in earlier poems, and {{works such as}} [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual. Keats reverses this when describing an urn within [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] to focus on representational art. He previously used {{the image of an}} urn in [...] "Ode on Indolence", depicting one with three figures representing Love, Ambition and Poesy. Of these three, Love and Poesy are integrated into [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] with an emphasis on how the urn, as a human artistic construct, is capable of relating to the idea of [...] "Truth". The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities: an attempt at courtship, the making of music, and a religious rite. The figures are supposed to be beautiful, and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic. Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator, the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images. The narrator interacts with the urn {{in a manner similar to}} how a critic would respond to the poem, which creates ambiguity in the poem's final lines: [...] "'Beauty <b>is</b> <b>truth,</b> truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know." [...] The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words, to whom they are speaking, and what is meant by the words, which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator.|$|E
