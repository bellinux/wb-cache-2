2500|$|As the ice {{began to}} melt, the sea began to rise. Initially, sea level rose quickly, about [...] per 1,000 years, {{but then the}} rate declined. On Cape Cod, sea level rose roughly [...] per {{millennium}} between 6,000 and 2,000 years ago. After that, it continued to rise at about [...] per millennium. By 6,000 years ago, the sea level was high enough to start eroding the glacial deposits that the vanished continental ice sheet had left on Cape Cod. The water transported the eroded deposits north and south along the outer Cape's shoreline through {{a process known as}} longshore drift. Those reworked sediments that moved north went to the tip of Cape Cod. The entire town of Provincetown, at the extreme tip of the Cape, is a spit consisting largely of deposited marine sediment that was eroded and transported from farther south along the shore. Those sediments that instead moved south created the islands and shoals of Monomoy. So while other parts of the Cape have dwindled from the action of the waves, these parts of the Cape have grown through the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> in just the last 6,000 years.|$|E

6000|$|A {{letter written}} by Darwin to Professor Alexander Agassiz in May 1881 shows exactly the {{attitude}} which careful {{consideration of the}} subject led him to maintain towards the theory propounded by Mr. Murray:--"You will have seen," [...] he writes, [...] "Mr. Murray's views on the formation of atolls and barrier-reefs. Before publishing my book, I thought long over the same view, but {{only as far as}} ordinary marine organisms are concerned, for at that time little was known of the multitude of minute oceanic organisms. I rejected this view, as from the few dredgings made in the [...] "Beagle", in the south temperate regions, I concluded that shells, the smaller corals, etc., decayed and were dissolved when not protected by the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment,</b> and sediment could not accumulate in the open ocean. Certainly, shells, etc., were in several cases completely rotten, and crumbled into mud between my fingers; but you will know whether this is in any degree common. I have expressly said that a bank at the proper depth would give rise to an atoll, which could not be distinguished from one formed during subsidence. I can, however, hardly believe in the existence of as many banks (there having been no subsidence) as there are atolls in the great oceans, within a reasonable depth, on which minute oceanic organisms could have accumulated to the depth of many hundred feet." ...|$|E
60|$|Ascending to {{the older}} {{tertiary}} formations, I will not again recapitulate the remarks already given {{at the end of}} the Fifth Chapter,--on their great extent, especially along the shores of the Atlantic--on their antiquity, perhaps corresponding with that of the eocene deposits of Europe,--on the almost entire dissimilarity, though the formations are apparently contemporaneous, of the fossils from the eastern and western coasts, as is likewise the case, even in a still more marked degree, with the shells now living in these opposite though approximate seas,--on the climate of this period not having been more tropical than what might have been expected from the latitudes of the places under which the deposits occur; a circumstance rendered well worthy of notice, from the contrast with what is known to have been the case during the older tertiary periods of Europe, and likewise from the fact of the southern hemisphere having suffered at a much later period, apparently at the same time with the northern hemisphere, a colder or more equable temperature, as shown by the zones formerly affected by ice-action. Nor will I recapitulate the proofs of the bottom of the sea, both on the eastern and western coast, having subsided seven or eight hundred feet during this tertiary period; the movement having apparently been co-extensive, or nearly co-extensive, with the deposits of this age. Nor will I again give the facts and reasoning on which the proposition was founded, that when the bed of the sea is either stationary or rising, circumstances are far less favourable than when its level is sinking, to the accumulation of conchiferous deposits of sufficient thickness, extension, and hardness to resist, when upheaved, the ordinary vast amount of denudation. We have seen that the highly remarkable fact of the absence of any EXTENSIVE formations containing recent shells, either on the eastern or western coasts of the continent,--though these coasts now abound with living mollusca,--though they are, and apparently have always been, as favourable for the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> as they were when the tertiary formations were copiously deposited,--and though they have been upheaved to an amount quite sufficient to bring up strata from the depths the most fertile for animal life--can be explained in accordance with the above proposition. As a deduction, it was also attempted to be shown, first, that the want of close sequence in the fossils of successive formations, and of successive stages in the same formation, would follow from the improbability of the same area continuing slowly to subside from one whole period to another, or even during a single entire period; and secondly, that certain epochs having been favourable at distant points, in the same quarter of the world for the synchronous accumulation of fossiliferous strata, would follow from movements of subsidence having apparently, like those of elevation, contemporaneously affected very large areas.|$|E
