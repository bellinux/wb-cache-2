5|$|Padayappas initial {{final cut}} lasted for 22 reels, which was {{considered}} too lengthy. Rather than cut the film, Rajinikanth suggested to Ravikumar to allot two intervals for the film.

Using his prior <b>experience</b> <b>on</b> trimming Nayakan, Haasan was able to cut Padayappa down to 16 reels. When Kumudams reporter Kannan asked Rajinikanth to release the scenes which had been cut as Padayappas sequel, Rajinikanth immediately spoke to Ravikumar about the possibility, but was informed that those reels had been destroyed.|$|E
