50|$|In the {{description}} of the Parish of Heidesheim drawn up sometime between 1667 and 1677 in Johann Sebastian Severus’s Dioecesis Moguntina, it says:“On the edge of the village towards the Rhine one beholds farther away the castle house at the Wintereck which in the year 1626 Samuel Beck, chief cellarmaster at Mainz, acquired for himself and his family along with the forest, meadows, fields and cereal tributes for 800 Gulden and today has outfitted with an appealing building and fruit trees. Towards the end of the Thirty Years' War, the notorious cavalry general Johann von Werth is said to have lived at the castle. After 1650, it ended up with the Barons of Bockenheim, who thereafter held it for roughly 150 years on a <b>heritable</b> <b>lease.</b> The family had entitlement to pewage and burial in the parish church.|$|E

Thereafter the property found itself owned by the Lords - beginning in 1711 Counts - of the Leyen, who administered their scattered holdings on the Moselle and the Rhine first from Koblenz and beginning in 1773 from Blieskastel (Saarpfalz) and gave out the Castle Mill on a <b>heritable</b> <b>lease.</b> Information about the time from 1677 to 1793 is promised by {{the contents of the}} archives of the (beginning in 1806) Princes of the Leyen, which in 1995 ended up in the Rhineland-Palatinate Main State Archive in Koblenz, but hitherto not much of this information has been forthcoming.|$|E
50|$|The {{documents}} include wills, {{donations to}} churches and monasteries, <b>heritable</b> <b>leases</b> of church lands, {{and sales of}} church lands. Sixty or so texts come from between 445 and the mid-7th century, with the latest of this early group being variously dated to 642/3 or 665/6. A late group of texts from the 9th and 10th centuries also exists, but is substantially less well studied.|$|R
