5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, <b>his</b> <b>conduct</b> towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god.

5|$|After this success, he {{was sent}} to Asia Minor, where the Turkish raids on the Byzantine borderlands had become a menace, and where Turkish {{settlers}} had begun encroaching upon imperial territory. He remained there until 1267 and achieved some success, securing the lands around the valley of the Maeander River and restoring the defences of the region. The historian George Pachymeres certainly praised <b>his</b> <b>conduct</b> of these operations, and alleged that the mere mention of his approach caused fear to his enemies.|$|E

Later, he was offered and accepted the same rank solely based on <b>his</b> <b>conduct</b> at Churubusco.|$|E

5|$|Vaulx Carter {{was born}} in August 14, 1863, in western Tennessee, the sixteenth of {{seventeen}} children to Samuel Jefferson Carter. His mother was Anne Vaulx, the elder Carter's second wife. He was raised there for {{the early part of}} his life, but was orphaned along with two of his siblings following his father's death in March 1873 and his mother's the next year. The siblings remained without a guardian until February 1875, when they were adopted by a family member and spent the rest of their childhood in Pennsylvania. In September 1880, Carter passed the entrance examinations for the United States Naval Academy and on the twenty-second of that month, he was admitted into the school, one of four people selected to represent Pennsylvania at the academy in that year's class. In his second year at the school, Carter excelled in English and drawing, but had poor discipline and received 109 demerits; using a point evaluation system, the Naval Academy gave Carter fifty-three out of a possible seventy-six points for <b>his</b> <b>conduct</b> during the year. Between his second and third years, Cater sailed on the U.S.S. Constitution {{as a part of the}} Academy's summer cruise. <b>His</b> <b>conduct</b> worsened that year, and he only excelled in drawing. At the end of the year, Carter received ninety-nine of a possible one-hundred fifty-two points.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, 1st Baronet, GCB (4 June 1746 – 14 November 1816) was {{an officer}} of the British Royal Navy, who saw action in several battles during an {{extensive}} career that was punctuated by a number of highly controversial incidents. Curtis served during the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary Wars and was highly praised in the former conflict for his bravery under fire at the Great Siege of Gibraltar, where he saved several hundred Spanish lives at great risk to his own. His career suffered however {{in the aftermath of the}} Glorious First of June, when he was heavily criticised for <b>his</b> <b>conduct</b> by several influential figures, including Cuthbert Collingwood. His popularity fell further due to his involvement in two highly controversial courts-martial, those of Anthony Molloy in 1795 and James Gambier in 1810.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1971, Thorpe's {{political}} career had stalled. He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did not stand for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for <b>his</b> <b>conduct</b> of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was put aside in a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 10 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, but for the next year performed little beyond routine party duties.|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{to return}} to {{official}} cricket when WSC ended, Chappell resumed as captain of SA in 1979–80, a decision he later regretted. It was a season too far for the increasingly irascible Chappell. Reported by an umpire for swearing in a match against Tasmania, he received a three-week suspension. In his first match after the ban, he was again reported for <b>his</b> <b>conduct</b> {{in a game against}} the touring English team. Given a suspended ban by the ACB, he was then selected for Australia's last three Tests of the season. His Test career finished with scores of 75 and 26 not out at the MCG against England in February 1980. In his final first-class match, SA needed to beat Victoria to win the Sheffield Shield. Although Chappell scored 112, SA lost the match and the shield. Ironically, the umpires voted him the competition's player of the season for a second time.|$|E
5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} case {{went to court}} in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, {{who had gone to}} sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of <b>his</b> <b>conduct.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Invasion of the Waikato, his militia {{unit was}} mobilised {{and it was}} <b>his</b> <b>conduct</b> at Paterangi, where he rescued British {{soldiers}} under fire, that saw him awarded the VC. He was the first recipient of the VC to be a non-regular soldier. After his military service ended, Heaphy served a term as Member of Parliament for Parnell. From 1870 to 1881, he held a variety of civil service positions but his health declined and he moved to Queensland, in Australia, seeking a better climate in which to recover. He died {{a few months after}} his arrival.|$|E
