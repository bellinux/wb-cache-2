5000|$|A {{holding pattern}} for {{instrument}} flight rules (IFR) aircraft {{is usually a}} racetrack pattern based on a <b>holding</b> <b>fix.</b> This fix can be a radio beacon such as a non-directional beacon (NDB) or VHF omnidirectional range (VOR). The fix {{is the start of}} the first turn of the racetrack pattern. Aircraft will fly towards the fix, and once there will enter a predefined racetrack pattern. A standard holding pattern uses right-hand turns and takes approximately 4 minutes to complete (one minute for each 180 degree turn, and two one-minute straight ahead sections). [...] Deviations from this pattern can happen if long delays are expected; longer legs (usually two or three minutes) may be used, or aircraft with distance measuring equipment (DME) may be assigned patterns with legs defined in nautical miles rather than minutes. Less frequent turns are more comfortable for passengers and crew. Additionally, left-hand turns may be assigned to some holding patterns if there are airspace or traffic restrictions nearby.|$|E
40|$|Under current National Airspace System {{operations}} conflict alerts {{for aircraft}} in holding patterns are often missed or in error {{due to the}} fact that trajectories for holding aircraft are not modeled in existing Conflict Alert or Conflict Probe automation. In addition, a controller in one sector may not know when aircraft are holding in a neighboring sector. These factors can lead to an increased potential for loss of separation while aircraft are flying in holding patterns. The objective of this work is to develop a holding function that automatically determines when an aircraft enters a holding pattern, computes a holding region around the pattern, and probes the holding region for conflict with other traffic. Since controller workload is generally high during periods when aircraft are in holding the operational concept of use assumes the holding region is automatically computed and the controller is alerted only if another aircraft is predicted to fly through the holding region. The holding algorithm is applied only to aircraft that would likely go into holding during rush periods, e. g., arrivals to capacity constrained airports. A holding region is computed for aircraft that settle out on a steady outbound course. Initial estimates of the <b>holding</b> <b>fix</b> position, turn radius, and holding pattern leg length are computed and automatically updated as the aircraft flies the pattern. The holding algorithm was implemented in the Center/TRACON Automation System software suit...|$|E

40|$|The {{fact that}} large {{manufacturing}} plants export relatively more than small plants {{has been at}} the foundation of much work in the international trade literature. We examine this fact using Census micro data on plant shipments from the Commodity Flow Survey. We show the fact is not entirely an international trade phenomenon; part of it can be accounted for by the effect of distance, distinct from any border effect. Export destinations tend to be further than domestic destinations, and large plants tend to ship further distances even to domestic locations, as compared with small plants. We develop an extension of the Melitz (2003) model and use it to set up an analysis with model interpretations of ratios between large plant and small plant shipments that can be calculated with the data. We obtain a decomposition of the overall ratio into a term that varies with distance, <b>holding</b> <b>fixed</b> the border, and a term that varies with the border, <b>holding</b> <b>fixed</b> the distance.
