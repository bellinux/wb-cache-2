The series is written by Rucka and Troutman, and <b>each</b> <b>issue</b> focuses on an individual supporting character from the main series.

5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I.

G.I. Joe: Yearbook ran until 1988.|$|E

5|$|Yasuhara {{wanted the}} game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was {{redesigned}} many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The development team read <b>each</b> <b>issue</b> of Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they can avoid making the same mistakes.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{ten years after the}} first US edition ceased, a new version appeared, again as a {{companion}} to F. This time the magazine was quarterly. The debut issue was dated May 1969, and it was edited by Edward L. Ferman—son of Joseph Ferman—who was also the editor of F. There was no statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was straightforward: a novel was presented in <b>each</b> <b>issue.</b> Although these were substantially cut, they still took up most of the magazine, with the result that the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, the contents were of fairly good quality, with contributions from well-known writers. However, the magazine was no more successful than before, and lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last issue was August 1970.|$|E

5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} {{do not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after <b>each</b> <b>issue,</b> a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches.

5|$|In 1986, {{the success}} of A Real American Hero lead Marvel to produce a second title: G.I. Joe: Special Missions which lasted 28 issues. Herb Trimpe was the artist {{for most of the}} run, with Dave Cockrum {{providing}} pencils on several issues. Spinning out of G.I. Joe #50 and set in the same continuity, the series presented more intense violence and a more ambiguous morality than the main title, and the Joes faced enemies who were not related to Cobra. <b>Each</b> <b>issue</b> usually featured a stand-alone mission focusing on a small group of Joes.|$|E
