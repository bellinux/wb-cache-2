5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E

5|$|With Henry VIII’s {{closure of}} the monasteries 1536–41, the advowson and tithes of Llanbadarn Fawr became the {{property}} of the lay owners. Under the later Stuarts the lordship of Llanbadarn had passed to the Earl of Danby, and the rectory to Sir Robert Holmes. By 1660 the tithes belonged to Roger Palmer (1634–1705), who became earl of Castlemaine by virtue (<b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> word) of his wife Barbara (née Villiers) being the mistress of Charles II. Since Castlemaine did not acknowledge Barbara’s five children by Charles (and perhaps other lovers) the tithes of Llanbadarn passed to his nephew James. His daughter Catherine married Giles Chichester of Arlington Court, Devon. They were both Catholics, which forced them to pay heavy taxes. Not all subsequent members of the Chichester family were absentees, however; Sir John Chichester, 1st Baronet, of Arlington Court, was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1831, when he was living in Llanbadarn Fawr. But the income was lost to the church. The tithes were not especially valuable; in the eighteenth century the vicarage was worth only £27 annually; in the fourteenth century they were comparatively small compared with the income from the lands then owned by the church – which passed with the manor or lordship, on the Dissolution of the Monasteries, to the lay owners.|$|E

25|$|A third {{interpretation}} {{relies on}} the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own.

25|$|Divorce is one {{response}} to marital infidelity. Another {{would be to}} seek couple's therapy or counseling.

25|$|The Viennese oyster {{position}} requires great flexibility {{from the}} woman to perform. The female lies {{on her back and}} moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.|$|E
30|$|One {{interpretation}} of this set of results <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> participants performed similarly between the modes; this led the raters to assign similar ratings to their performance during each of <b>the</b> modes. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case, the findings for <b>the</b> analytic scales <b>were</b> {{consistent with those of}} studies on tape-based speaking tests that used the ACTFL holistic scale (Kenyon and Tschirner 2000; Shohamy 2004). Thus, it appears <b>that</b> delivery mode <b>is</b> not a factor that affects the magnitude of scores, regardless of the type of rating scale used. However, more empirical evidence is needed to support this conclusion.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} aspects of the organization of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of those prosecuted were rich men.

25|$|If human {{understanding}} were {{restricted to}} discursive or verbal arguments, then Plato's dialectical discussions could at most {{have reached the}} conclusion that the highest principle was demanded by his metaphysics but also that human understanding could never arrive at that transcendental Being. If so, the only remaining way that the One might be reached (and the Good, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same as the One) is through the possibility of some nonverbal, 'intuitive' access. It is debated whether or not Plato in fact took this route. If he did, he thereby renounced the possibility of justifying every step made by our knowledge with philosophical arguments that can be expressed discursively in words.|$|E

In our planning we have not ignored the problem of ending the war, nor would we ignore it {{in the event of a}} war.
