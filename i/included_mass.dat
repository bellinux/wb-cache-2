2500|$|The {{campaign}} <b>included</b> <b>mass</b> {{protests and}} a prolonged non-payment campaign, and continued {{as long as}} did the tolls. [...] A toll-collector interviewed by the BBC said that abuse of collectors by motorists had been commonplace. Numerous toll opponents were cited for refusing to pay the toll, with around 500 being arrested and 130 subsequently convicted of non-payment. Among those charged was Clodagh Mackenzie, an elderly lady from whom the land necessary for the bridge's arrival in Skye had been compulsorily purchased; the charges against her were subsequently dropped without explanation. [...] Of those convicted, only the first, the SKAT Secretary Andy Anderson, received a (brief) prison term. [...] Those charged with non-payment {{had to make the}} 140 mile round trip to Dingwall sheriff court, again crossing the bridge and where again many refused to pay, incurring a further criminal charge. [...] Robbie the Pict argued that the legal paperwork for the tolls was incomplete, and that consequently the tolls themselves were illegal. [...] In particular he said that the [...] "assignation statement", a licence to charge a toll, had never been given. [...] Interviewed later by the BBC Fiscal Davind Hingston in Dingwall denied this claim, but admitted that he himself had been denied access to many government documents on the case, on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. Hingston told the BBC [...] "As a fiscal I was stuck with that evidence but as a private individual I found it stunning", leading to renewed calls that the convictions of the toll protesters should be quashed - to this the Crown Office reiterated that appeals on these grounds had already been rejected by the courts.|$|E
