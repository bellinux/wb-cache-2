To {{better understand the}} current-voltage (I-V) dependence of ion channels, here we describe and prove a collective diffusion model that quantitatively relates the spontaneous ion permeation at equilibrium to the stationary <b>ionic</b> fluxes <b>driven</b> by small voltages. The model {{makes it possible to}} determine the channel conductance in the linear I-V range from equilibrium simulations without the application of a voltage. To validate the theory, we perform molecular-dynamics simulations on two channels—a conical-shaped nanopore and the transmembrane pore of an α-hemolysin—under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. The simulations reveal substantial couplings between the motions of cations and anions, which are effectively captured by the collective coordinate in the model. Although the two channels exhibit very different linear ranges in the I-V curves, in both cases the channel conductance at small voltages is in reasonable agreement with the prediction from the equilibrium simulation. The simulations also suggest that channel charges, rather than geometric asymmetry, play a more prominent role in current rectification...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Micellization of the ionic {{surfactant}} sodium hexyl sulfate {{has been}} studied using atomistic explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations with and without excess NaCl or CaCl 2. Simulations were performed at surfactant loadings near the critical micellization concentration. Equilibrium micelle size distributions and estimates of the critical micellization concentration obtained from the simulations are in agreement with experimental data. In comparison to the sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant, the shorter alkyl chain of sodium hexyl sulfate results in increased disorder of the micellar core and water exposure of the hydrocarbon tail groups. However, water and ions do not penetrate into the micellar core even for these weakly micellizing surfactants. Excess NaCl is observed to have a minor influence on the micelle structure but excess CaCl 2 induces drastic changes both in the structure and {{the dynamics of the}} micellar system. Furthermore, in the absence of excess salt, sodium hexyl sulfate forms predominantly spherical, disorganized aggregates but an increase in <b>ionic</b> strength <b>drives</b> an increase in aggregate size and leads to prolate aggregates. 1...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{a variety of}} ionic liquids have emerged as greener {{solvents}} {{for use in the}} chemical manufacturing industries. Their unique properties have attracted the interest of chemists worldwide to employ them as replacement for conventional solvents in a diverse range of chemical transformations including biotransformations. Biocatalysts are often regarded as green catalysts compared to conventional chemical catalysts in organic synthesis owing to their properties of low toxicity, biodegradability, excellent selectivity and good catalytic performance under mild reaction conditions. Similarly, a selected number of specific ionic liquids can be considered as greener solvents superior to organic solvents owing to their negligible vapor pressure, low flammability, low toxicity and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic and biological substances, including proteins. A combination of biocatalysts and ionic liquids thus appears to be a logical and promising opportunity for industrial use as an alternative to conventional organic chemistry processes employing organic solvents.

40|$|A mode of {{capillary}} electrochromatography {{for separation of}} <b>ionic</b> compounds <b>driven</b> by electrophoretic mobility on a neutrally hydrophobic monolithic column was developed. The monolithic column was prepared from the in situ copolymerization of lauryl methacrylate and ethylene dimethacrylate to form a C- 12 hydrophobic stationary phase. It was found that EOF in this hydrophobic monolithic column was very poor, even the pH value of mobile phase at 8. 0.

This {{raises the question of}} who gene expression might be regulated in obligate halophiles, which maintain internal salt concentrations of about 5 M. As a model system we have investigated the phage phi H, which infects the archaebacterium Halobacterium halobium. Previous genetic data and transcriptional mapping had suggested a region of the phage genome where a repressor might bind. A modified electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to identify an activity, present only in lysogens, that specifically binds this region. Methylation interference and DNA sequencing were used to identify four similar binding sites, which are arranged so that two copies of a dimer might bind on one face of the DNA helix. Binding of a protein at these sites could block RNA polymerase from initiating a transcript found only during lytic growth. A nearby divergent promoter produces a lysogen-specific transcript, T 6, which encodes a member of the helix-turn-helix family of DNA-binding proteins. By expressing the gene in Escherichia coli, we confirmed that T 6 specifies the DNA binding activity detected biochemically. The data show that the basic DNA-binding motif of repressors can be adapted even for the unfavorable conditions of high salt concentration...|$|R

Using the correspondence {{of the method}} of simulating a 3 + 1 dimensional Dirac-like Hamiltonian for bi-spinor particles into a single trapped ion, one preliminarily obtains the analytical tools for describing ionic state transition probabilities as a typical quantum oscillation feature. For Dirac-like structures driven by generalized Poincaré classes of coupling potentials, one also identifies the SU(2) ⊗SU(2) internal degrees of freedom corresponding to intrinsic parity and spin polarization as an adaptive platform for computing the quantum entanglement between the internal quantum subsystems which define two-qubit ionic states. The obtained quantum correlational content is then translated into the quantum entanglement of two-qubit ionic states with quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its projection onto {{the direction of the}} trapping magnetic field. Experimentally, the controllable parameters simulated by ion traps can be mapped into a Dirac-like system in the presence of an electrostatic field which, in this case, is associated to ionic carrier interactions. Besides exhibiting a complete analytical profile for ionic quantum transitions and quantum entanglement, our results indicate that carrier interactions actively drive an overall suppression of the quantum entanglement.

A previously developed self-consistent scheme (S. Buyukdagli el al., J. Stat. Mech. P 05033 (2011)) and a new simpler variational procedure that self-consistently couple image forces, surface charge induced electric field and pore modified core interactions are used to this aim. For neutral pores, it is shown that with increasing pore size, the theory predicts a transition of the interplate pressure from an attractive to a strongly repulsive regime associated with an ionic packing state, an effect observed in previous Monte Carlo simulations for hard core charges. The role of the range of core interactions in the ionic rejection and interplate pressure is thoroughly analyzed. We show that the physics of the system can be split into two screening regimes. The ionic packing effect takes place in the regime of moderately screened core interactions characterized with the bare screening parameter of the Yukawa potential b 3 /lB, solvation forces associated with these interactions positively contribute to the <b>ionic</b> rejection <b>driven</b> by electrostatic forces and enhance the magnitude of the attractive pressure.

The thermodynamic availability of water (water activity) strictly limits microbial propagation on Earth, particularly in hypersaline environments. A considerable body of evidence indicates the existence of hypersaline surface waters throughout the history of Mars; therefore it is assumed that, as on Earth, water activity is a major limiting factor for martian habitability. However, the differing geological histories of Earth and Mars have driven variations in their respective aqueous geochemistry, with as-yet-unknown implications for habitability. Using a microbial community enrichment approach, we investigated microbial habitability for a suite of simulated martian brines. While the habitability of some martian brines was consistent with predictions made from water activity, others were uninhabitable even when the water activity was biologically permissive. We demonstrate experimentally that high <b>ionic</b> strength, <b>driven</b> to extremes on Mars by the ubiquitous occurrence of multivalent ions, renders these environments uninhabitable despite the presence of biologically available water.

This behaviour includes: in single cation glasses a strong dependence of ion mobility on concentration, and in mixed cation glasses a range of anomalies known collectively as the mixed alkali effect. We argue that this rich phenomenology arises from the emergence during cooling of a well-defined structure in glass melts resulting from the interplay of chemical interactions and thermally <b>driven</b> <b>ionic</b> motions. The new DSM proposes the existence of a new site relaxation process, involving the shrinkage of empty A̅ sites (thus tailored to the needs of A^+ ions), and the concurrent emergence of empty C'&# 146;sites, which interrupt the conduction pathways.

The attained coulo-voltammetric (charge-potential), dynamo-voltammetric (angle-potential) and coulo-dynamic (charge-angle) responses until different cathodic potential limits were analyzed. The dynamo-voltammetric and coulo-dynamic responses from the PPy-HpPS/tape and tape/PPyDBS muscles inform about the reaction <b>driven</b> <b>ionic</b> exchanges in the two PPy films. Electrochemo-dynamical responses from the asymmetric PPy-HpPS/PPy-DBS bilayer muscles are explained using those reactions. Cooperative dynamic effects exist when both layers follow complementary reaction-driven volume changes (swelling/shrinking, or shrinking/swelling) due to complementary entrance/expulsion of ions.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that a planet's ability to support life is intimately {{associated}} with its physical evolution, but many aspects of this link have not been resolved. For example, differing geologic histories {{have the potential to}} drive large-scale differences in the chemistry of planets’ waters, with unknown implications for habitability. In this thesis, I link the geochemical evolution of Mars to the habitability of its associated evaporitic or brine environments, which have been widespread throughout the planet's history. Their habitability is compared with the Earth system, where a chloride-dominated chemistry permits the microbial colonisation of brines with extremely low water availability. By assessing the physicochemical environments in martian brines, I present evidence that high <b>ionic</b> strength, <b>driven</b> to extremes on Mars by the ubiquitous occurrence of divalent ions, can influence habitability even if water availability is high. The importance of this parameter has been overlooked in terrestrial microbiology, likely due to the paucity of environments with high levels of di- or multivalent ions, and its possible mechanics and significance for defining habitat space on Earth and other planets are discussed. Additionally, cultivation techniques and next-generation DNA sequencing were used to identify organisms capable of growth in extreme Mars-relevant brines, which contrast with those typically found in NaCl-rich brines on the Earth. The isolation of a novel sulfate-tolerant Marinococcus strain, and its growth response to fluctuating martian brine compositions are reported. These results show that microbial growth kinetics are defined not merely by additive ion effects, but rather by bulk physicochemical conditions defined by complete ion assemblages. Changes to composition driven by evaporation or freezing can therefore push a brine into more biologically clement conditions by altering a brine’s physicochemical profile The data herein present a strong case that geochemical context is essential to understanding habitability in extreme saline environments. A new framework for predicting brine habitability is required, taking into account the geochemical history of the brine as well as the effects different ionic compositions exert on microorganisms.

40|$|An equifield {{strength}} {{model has}} been established to elucidate the formation mechanism for the highly ordered alumina pore arrays and titanium oxide nanotubular arrays prepared via a common electrochemical methodology, anodisation. The fundamentals of the equifield strength model was the equilibrium between the electric field driven oxidation rate of the metal and electric field enhanced dissolution rate of oxide. During the anodic oxidation of metal, pore initiation was believed to generate based on dissolution rate difference caused by inhomogeneity near the metal/oxide interface. The <b>ionic</b> nanoconvection <b>driven</b> by the electric force exerted on the space charge layer {{in the vicinity of}} electrolyte/oxide interface is established to be the main driving force of the pore ordering at the early stage of the anodisation. While the equifield strength requirement governs the following formation of the single pore and the self-ordering of random distributed pore arrays during the anodisation process. Hexagonal patterned Al 2 O 3 nanopore arrays and TiO 2 nanotubular arrays have been achieved by anodisation of corresponding metal substrates in proper electrolytes. The two characteristic microstructural features of anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) and anodic titanium oxide (ATO) were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The observations of the hemispherical electrolyte/oxide and oxide/metal interfaces, uniform thickness of the oxide layer, as well as self-adjustment of the pore size and pore ordering can be well explained by the equifield strength model. Field enhanced dissociation of water is extremely important in determination of the porosity of anodic metal oxide. The porosity of AAO and ATO films was found to be governed by the relative dissociation rate of water which is dependent on anodisation conditions, such as electrolyte, applied voltage, current density and electric field strength. Using an empirical method, the relations between the porosity of the AAO (ATO) films and the anodisation parameters, such as electric field strength, current density and applied voltage, have been established. Besides, the extent that an external electric field can facilitate the heterolytic dissociation of water molecule has been estimated using quantum-chemical model computations combined with the experimental aspect. With these achievements, the fabrication of anodic metal oxide films can be understood and controlled more precisely. Additionally, the impacts of other factors such as the electrolyte type and the temperature effect on the morphology of the anodic products were also investigated. Some important experimental evidences on the pore diameters variation with applied voltage in the anodisation of aluminium and the titanium were obtained for future investigation of the anodic metal oxide formation processes.

It is unknown whether Na+, K+ATPase isoforms are regulated throughout pregnancy or whether they have a direct role in modulating uterine contractility. We hypothesized that gestation-dependent differential expression of isoforms would affect contractile responses to Na+, K+ATPase α subunit inhibition with ouabain. Our aims were therefore: (1) to determine the gestation-dependent expression of mRNA transcripts, protein abundance and tissue distribution of Na+, K+ATPase isoforms in myometrium; (2) to investigate the functional effects of differential isoform expression via ouabain sensitivity; and (3) if changes in contractile responses can be explained by changes in intracellular [Ca 2 +]. Changes in abundance and distribution of the Na+, K+ATPase α, β and FXYD 1 and 2 isoforms, were studied in rat uterus from nonpregnant, and early, mid-, and term gestation. All α, β subunit isoforms (1, 2, 3) and FXYD 1 were detected but FXYD 2 was absent. The α 1 and β 1 isoforms were unchanged throughout pregnancy, whereas α 2 and α 3 significant decreased at term while β 2 and FXYD 1 significantly increased from mid-term onwards. These changes in expression correlated with increased functional sensitivity to ouabain, and parallel changes in intracellular Ca 2 +, measured with Indo- 1.

However {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the mechanism of separation and forces governing the selectivity of the separation. In this paper a mechanistic study is carried out to determine the main factors and forces influencing the selectivity of separation of whey proteins with CGA generated from ionic surfactants. Two different separation strategies were followed: (i) separation of lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase by anionic CGA generated from a solution of sodium bis-(2 -ethyl hexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT); (ii) separation of beta-lactoglobulin by cationic CGA generated from a solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Separation results indicate that electrostatic interactions are the main forces determining the selectivity however these could not completely explain the selectivities obtained following both strategies. Protein-surfactant interactions were studied by measuring the zeta potential changes on individual proteins upon addition of surfactant and at varying pH. Interestingly strongest electrostatic interactions were measured at those pH and surfactant to protein mass ratios which were optimum for protein separation. Effect of surfactant on protein conformation was determined by measuring the change in fluorescence intensity upon addition of surfactant at varying pH. Differences in the fluorescence patterns were detected among proteins which were correlated to differences in their conformational features which could in turn explain their different separation behaviour. The effect of conformation on selectivity was further proven by experiments in which conformational changes were induced by pre-treatment of whey (heating) and by storage at 4 degrees C. Overall it can be concluded that separation of proteins by <b>ionic</b> CGA is <b>driven</b> mainly by electrostatic interactions however conformational features will finally determine the selectivity of the separation with competitive adsorption having also an effect.

Modal variations and the oscillatory zoning of plagioclase demonstrate that the shallow (P 200 MPa) quartz diorite intrusion was emplaced through a number of magmatic injections. The border zone of the quartz diorite intrusion presents evidence of two main processes: hybridization between andesite and rhyolite magmas and volatile saturation of the mingled magma. Modal differences in the contact zone with respect to the protolith (i. e. peraluminous granite), variations in mineral composition, temperature constraints and K 2 O, Na 2 O, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 indicate that a relatively large volume of the host granite (up to 400 m from the contact) was metasomatized by high-temperature (650 ^ 3508 C) fluids derived from the mingled zone of the quartz diorite intrusion. In detail, the metasomatic K 2 O-rich fluid reacted with albite to form K-feldspar, and triggered the recrystallization of quartz and plagioclase to higher calcium concentrations. The progressive increase in the MgO/(MgOþFeO) of chlorite closer to the contact indicates that this phase also recrystallized. The iron released during chlorite recrystallization was buffered by hematite formation in the pores of metasomatic K-feldspar. The Gennargentu metagranites provide evidence that metasomatic fluids can {{play a major role in}} driving metamorphic reactions in contact aureoles. For instance, the expected increase of Ca in plagioclase owing to thermal equilibration was not achieved in the high-T zone of the aureole because of fluid-assisted removal of cations. We conclude that caution should be taken when interpreting the processes that underpin contact metamorphism in terms of thermally <b>driven,</b> <b>ionic</b> diffusion alone, because the role of fluids may be significant, if not overwhelming, in the domains closest to the magmatic source...|$|R
