5|$|By 1940, the {{outbreak}} of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> little world.|$|E
5|$|Hemming's {{introduction}} {{to his work}} (Prefatio) claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: about the things which have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.|$|E

No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty.

5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of French music, Les Troyens stands out as a grand opera that avoided the shallow glamour of Meyerbeer and Halévy, but {{therefore}} paid the price of long neglect. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> time the opera has finally come {{to be seen as}} one of the greatest operas of the 19th century.

25|$|A {{much more}} likely source of {{explanation}} is some natural optical phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> atmosphere. In my 1949 sightings the faintness of the object, together with the manner of fading in intensity as it traveled away from the zenith towards the southeastern horizon, is quite suggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of slight contrast in refractive index, as in an inversion layer.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} for two or more {{separate}} open clusters to form {{out of the same}} molecular cloud. In the Large Magellanic Cloud, both Hodge 301 and R136 are forming from the gases of the Tarantula Nebula, while <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> galaxy, tracing back the motion through space of the Hyades and Praesepe, two prominent nearby open clusters, suggests that they formed in the same cloud about 600 million years ago. Sometimes, two clusters born at the same time will form a binary cluster. The best known example in the Milky Way is the Double Cluster of NGC 869 and NGC 884 (sometimes mistakenly called h and χ Persei; h refers to a neighboring star and χ to both clusters), but at least 10 more double clusters are known to exist. Many more are known in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds—they are easier to detect in external systems than <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> galaxy because projection effects can cause unrelated clusters within the Milky Way to appear close to each other.|$|E
25|$|The general {{shape of}} the {{ultraviolet}} through near-infrared (0.125 to 3.5 μm) extinction curve <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> galaxy, the Milky Way, is fairly well characterized by the single parameter R(V) (which is different along different lines of sight through the galaxy), but there are known deviations from this single parameter characterization. Extending the extinction law into the mid-infrared wavelength range is difficult {{due to the lack}} of suitable targets and various contributions by absorption features.|$|E
25|$|In China, the Taiping Rebellion is successful, {{resulting}} in a China which is even more incapable of successful modernization than <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> history. The Japanese victory in the First Sino-Japanese War (which in the Draka timeline occurs in 1899) is even more decisive, with Japan not only annexing Formosa, but also Korea, Hainan, and several Chinese coastal cities. After victory in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War, Japan annexes Manchuria and establishes a protectorate over the weak Taiping Dynasty.|$|E
