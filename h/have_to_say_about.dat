I’m ashamed, really, of how little leadership there has been. There has been just tremendous timidity {{on the part of the}} party, generally, although there have been a handful of exceptions. But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Yes Minister, {{there are}} many {{occasions}} when Hacker is portrayed as a publicity-mad bungler, incapable of making a firm decision, and prone to blunders that embarrass him or his party, eliciting bad press and stern lectures from the party apparatus, particularly the Chief Whip. He is continually concerned with what the newspapers of the day will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> him, and is always hoping to be promoted by the Prime Minister. (Hacker ran the unsuccessful campaign for a political ally during the party's last leadership election - his man lost, becoming Foreign Secretary, and leaving Hacker nervous about his prospects under the winner, now Prime Minister.) He is equally afraid of either staying at his current level of Cabinet seniority, or being demoted.|$|E

The show was organised by public broadcaster ARD and private television station ProSieben, as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant Stefan Raab. Among 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she stated, [...] "I like to test myself. I wanted to see how I am perceived, and I wanted to hear what people with knowledge <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it. I personally can't judge myself at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholar Zofia Burr, {{who calls}} Angelou's poetry [...] "unabashedly public in its ambitions", connects Angelou's lack of {{critical}} acclaim {{to both the}} public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Bloom agrees, stating that Angelou's acclaim has been public rather than critical. Critic James Finn Cotter, in his review of Oh Pray, calls it an [...] "unfortunate example {{of the dangers of}} success" [...] and states that Angelou's fame has [...] "muted the private and personal quality that it takes to be essential to poetry". Critic John Alfred Avant, {{despite the fact that the}} volume was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, states that Diiie [...] "isn't accomplished, not by any means". Even critics who value poetry as an oral tradition devalue Angelou's poetry; critic Bryan D. Bourn, who praises her for using African oral tradition, states that she [...] "slips into banality when she abandons" [...] them and criticizes her for not catering to poetry critics. Scholar Joanne Braxton asserts that [...] "Angelou's audience, composed largely of women and blacks, isn't really affected by what white and/or male critics of the dominant literary tradition <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> her work. This audience does not read literary critics; it does read Maya Angelou". Burr condemns Angelou's critics for their narrow view of poetry, which has resulted in their negative reviews of her poetry, and for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: [...] "to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional".|$|E
500|$|... "En La Disco" [...] (""), {{originally}} from Escorpiones (2004), features an Arabic-influenced beat infused with reggaetón. Lyrically, Queen assures her lover {{that if she}} finds him in the club, she promises to dance with him disregarding what other people <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it. She assures him {{that there will be}} no other like her. [...] "Miles De Voces" [...] (""), a hip hop track from Buddha's Family (2001), contains simple harmonic progressions, synthesizers, affronted lyrics and a sociopolitical theme while alternating between major and minor key. [...] "La Abusadora" [...] ("The Abuser") originates from Iván Joy's Diamond Hits (2004). While reviewing the compilation Reggaeton Diamond Hits (2006), Steve Leggett, from Allmusic, named the song the highlight of the album. [...] "Aunque La Distancia" [...] ("") was originally included on the compilation release Romances Del Ruido 2 (2003) by Baby Rasta & Gringo as [...] "Llora Mi Corazón" [...] (""). Queen's rap contributes to a hip hop beat accompanied by Gran Omar. It is also known by the name of [...] "Eres Mi Hombre" [...] (""). [...] "Yo Lamento" [...] (Salsa Version), also from Contra La Corriente, is essentially the same track only re-recorded and mixed into salsa with a duration of four minutes and sixteen seconds; the longest on the album and only salsa track. In the song, Queen sings to her friend about loving her friend's man. She tells her that she had never intended to hurt her. Queen assures that she loves her friend, but acknowledges the fact that their friendship was lost. [...] "He looked at me and we started dancing while the music took us away. Dancing, he touched me. My mind wasn't thinking, passion was leading. My friend don't think that I don't love you", she sings.|$|E

2500|$|Jazz critic Scott Yanow regards Marsalis as talented but {{has criticized}} his [...] "selective {{knowledge}} of jazz history" [...] and {{has said that}} he feels the fact that Marsalis considers [...] "post-1965 avant-garde playing to be outside of jazz and 1970s fusion to be barren" [...] to be the unfortunate result of the [...] "somewhat eccentric beliefs of Stanley Crouch". Bassist Stanley Clarke said [...] "All the guys that are criticizing—like Wynton Marsalis and those guys—I would hate to be around to hear those guys playing on top of a groove!" [...] But Clarke also said, [...] "These things I've said about Wynton are my criticism of him, but the positive things I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> him outweigh the negative.

Schemel had expressed a desire to record with Love, Erlandson and Auf der Maur stating [...] "nothing has been discussed, but I have a feeling." [...] After the screening, the four took part in a Q session where Love stated: [...] "For me, as much as I love playing with Patty – and I would play with her in five seconds again, and everyone onstage – if it's not moving forward, I don't wanna do it.

2500|$|Upon {{release of}} the work, Anger was arrested on {{obscenity}} charges. He was acquitted, after the case went to the Supreme Court of California, which deemed it to be art rather than pornography. Anger made the claim to have been seventeen {{years old when he}} made it, {{despite the fact that he}} was actually twenty, presumably to present himself as more of an enfant terrible. A homoerotic work lasting only 14 minutes, Fireworks revolves around a young man (played by Anger himself) associating with various navy sailors, who eventually turn on him, stripping him naked and beating him to death, ripping open his chest to find a compass inside. Several fireworks then explode, accompanied by a burning Christmas tree and the final shot shows the young man lying in bed next to another topless man. Of this film, Anger would later state in 1966 that [...] "This flick is all I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> being 17, the United States Navy, American Christmas and the fourth of July." [...] He would continuously alter and adapt the film up until 1980, with it finally being distributed on VHS in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|David Lane was {{a former}} Klansman who later joined the Neo-Nazi Christian Identity group Aryan Nation. He steadfastly denied any {{involvement}} in Berg's murder, but neither did he regret that Berg was dead. In an interview presented {{as part of the}} History Channel documentary, Nazi America: A Secret History, Lane admitted to calling the show and goading Berg into an exchange and stated: [...] "The only thing I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Alan Berg is, regardless of who did it, he has not mouthed his hate-whitey propaganda from his 50,000-watt zionist pulpit for quite a few years". Lane, incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, died of an epileptic seizure at age 68 on May 28, 2007. One of the alleged gunmen in the [...] Berg assassination, Bruce Pierce, who was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Complex in Union County, Pennsylvania, died of natural causes at age 56 on August 16, 2010. Craig and Scutari were convicted of unrelated crimes. The leader of The Order, Robert Jay Mathews, believed, although never proven, to be a lookout in the Berg shooting, was burned to death during a standoff with federal authorities on December 8, 1984, at his home in Coupeville, Washington.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me out, because I suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If they got that, then they have other things on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Our {{picture of}} the earlier Maya priesthood is almost entirely based on what their Spanish missionary colleagues <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> them (Landa for Yucatán, Las Casas and others for the Guatemalan Highlands). The upper echelon of the priesthood was a {{repository}} of learning, also {{in the field of}} history and genealogical knowledge. [...] Around 1500, the Yucatec priesthood was hierarchically organized, from the high priest living at the court down to the priests in the towns, and the priestly books were distributed along these lines. The role model for the high priest is likely to have been the upper god Itzamna, first priest and inventor of the art of writing. The most general word for priest, including the Yucatec high priest, appears to have been ah k'in 'calendrical priest'. Some priests were ordinary diviners, while others had specialized knowledge of the katun cycle. Aside from calendrical learning, however, priests had multiple tasks, running from performing life crisis rituals to managing the monthly feast cycle, and held special offices, such as that of oracle (chilan), astrologer, and sacrificer of human beings (nacom). In the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj, the most important deities (Tohil, Awilix, Jacawitz and Gukumatz) had their own high priests. At all levels, access to the late-Postclassic priesthood seems to have been restricted to the nobility.|$|E
