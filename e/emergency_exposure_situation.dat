40|$|AbstractIn {{the light}} of the new {{international}} requirements on the emergency preparedness and response to nuclear and radiological emergencies, the basics of the strategy of protection of the public in event of beyond design basis accident at a nuclear plant have been reviewed. New international requirements were issued by the IAEA in 2015 taking into account lessons learned from the accident at the NPP Fukushima Daiichi in Japan on 11 March 2011. The IAEA pays particular attention to the development of safety infrastructure in Member States embarking on a nuclear power programme. In the framework of the national projects of technical cooperation, the IAEA is actively implementing international safety requirements released in the IAEA Safety Standards. Following the IAEA safety standards for these States became mandatory. The key issue of the requirements is a demand to Member State to have a public protection strategy in place before the commissioning the first NPP. The strategy shall be based on the Generic criteria to be used in emergency preparedness and response to protect the people in <b>emergency</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>situation</b> -to prevent severe deterministic effects, and-to limit the risk of stochastic health effects on the reasonably achievable level. The strategy shall include 1. Classification of facilities and areas according to the degree of potential radiological hazard. 2. Classification of emergency planning zones around the hazardous facility. 3. Classification of the status of a facility in event of an emergency. The Russian Federation takes an active part in the construction of nuclear power plants in those countries that are just embarking on a nuclear power programme, therefore, new international requirements should be considered in the design and construction of the NPPs abroad. Those requirements should be also considered in training of national personnel for the implementation of nuclear power programme...|$|E

40|$|The ICRP {{recognises}} {{three types}} of <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> (planned, existing and emergency). In all three situations, the release of radionuclides into the natural environment leads to exposures of non-human biota, {{as well as the}} potential for exposures of the public. This paper describes how the key principles of the ICRP system of radiological protection apply to non-human biota and members of the public in each of these <b>exposure</b> <b>situations.</b> Current work in this area within ICRP Task Group (TG) 105 is highlighted. For example, how simplified numeric criteria may be used in planned <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> that are protective of both the public and non-human biota. In <b>emergency</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>situations,</b> the initial response will always be focused on human protection however, understanding the potential impacts of radionuclide releases on non-human biota will likely become important in terms of communication as governments and the public seek to understand the exposures that are occurring. For existing <b>exposure</b> <b>situations,</b> we need to better understand the potential impacts of radionuclides on animals and plants especially when deciding on protective actions. Understanding the comparative impacts from radiological, non-radiological and physical aspects is often important in managing remediating legacy sites. The TG is making use of case studies of how <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> have been managed in the past to provide additional guidance and advice for the protection of non-human biota...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from <b>emergency</b> to existing <b>exposure</b> <b>situation</b> {{is an important}} stage in the nuclear or radiological emergency plan. It requires arrangements {{to be put in}} place and to be implemented so as to ensure that the transition is made in a coordinated and orderly manner of guidelines for adjusting the undertaken protective actions and other response actions. The delivering radiation doses to public and environmental pollution are monitoring that measurements should be implemented according to certain plan of intervention and protective actions in the different stages of the N/R accident. In this study, a computer model (RASCAL) is used to calculate the effect of severe accident could have detected on an operating nuclear power reactor PWR and the possible impact on the public. Features for the decision to implement the {{transition from}} <b>emergency</b> to existing <b>exposure</b> <b>situation</b> are proposed depending on the estimation of the collection of deliver exposure doses to the public and environment due to monitoring the different radiation sources resulting from the N/R accident...|$|R

40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} the option of {{employing}} the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic (ACR) when a radiation emergency is imminent. Primarily, it focuses on evaluation of selected devices designed for radiation reconnaissance; summarising of radiation protection related legislation; and study of approved procedures. At its beginning, this Thesis tracks the origin of early detection systems at {{the territory of the}} then Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and their gradual evolution into the the existing form. From the radiation emergency point of view, this nationwide system represents a priceless help for monitoring of radioactive contamination dispersion and for warning. The following part sums up basic information on what is an ionizing radiation, how it comes into being and which basic quantities describe it. This part also contains basic type distinction, description of consequences for human organism and the most significant interactions of sources of ionizing radiation that could be misused with the most probability. This specific topic is introduced here because of the subsequent part of this Thesis being named Radiological Dispersion Device, or the dirty bomb. The significant part of this Thesis is the summary and classification of related legislation. The first documents referred to are two international standards. Publication 103 the 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection is dealing, inter alia, with dosing limits determining dose levels in planned <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> and reference levels used for <b>emergency</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> and existing <b>exposure</b> <b>situations.</b> Publication 96 Protecting People against Radiation Exposure in the Event of a Radiological Attack is more substantial for this Thesis since it partly copes with the protection of front-line units including Integrated Rescue System (IRS) components and it specifies maximum exposure time for intervening personnel. Based on the IRS Catalogue of Typical Activities (STC 01 /IZS), Materialised and Verified Use of a Radiological Weapon, the ACR {{would be one of the}} intervening components in such an attack. This Thesis analyses in detail individual ACR procedures starting with activities before employment, through threat prevention, event reaction to post-event activities like decontamination followed by monitoring of personnel contamination and their health condition. The practical part deals mainly with one of the Thesis´s goals which was evaluation of selected dosimetric devices used by the military for radiation reconnaissance. For this purpose, the quantitative research processing their main parameters was applied. The analysis within a selected sample was used for comparing and the sumary index IVi then showed the status of device applicability for contemporary use in radiation emergency. The pre-defined goals of this Thesis have been met implementing the above methods. The comparison of individual devices and their evaluation in respect to their applicability in joint radiation emergency operation with other IRS components has been carried out via discussion. It has been found out that some of the devices are obsolete and do not comply with the requirements for this job. This fact reflects the reality that these devices were designed in the period of a potential nuclear war. This corresponds with their robust structure and high level of sensitivity which is not desirable for a radiation emergency. The most severe problem, however, seems to be the fact that some devices measure quantities in old, no more used, units which could cause misinterpretation. On the other hand, other devices are modern, sensitive at low levels of dose input and offer real-time information on a well organised LCD display. To answer the question of ACR´s readiness to intervene in a radiation emergency one has to say that the ACR is ready to meet its rescue and consequence management tasks at a satisfactory level...|$|R

40|$|Health {{effects from}} {{exposures}} to ionizing radiation are {{in general the}} result of complex multi-step reaction chains involving changes and responses {{on the level of}} molecules, cells, tissues and organisms. In environmental low dose <b>exposure</b> <b>situations,</b> ionizing radiation only contributes a small fraction to the life-long attack on DNA by other exogenous and endogenous genotoxins. Nevertheless, efforts to assess and quantify deleterious effects at low exposure levels are directed mainly towards radiation as a single isolated agent, and rarely towards the concomitant presence of other natural and anthropogenic toxicants. Only these combined exposures may lead to observable health risk effects. In addition they might differ from those expected from simple addition of the individual risks due to potential interaction. The existing data base on combined effects is rudimentary, mainly descriptive and rarely covers exposure ranges large enough to make direct inferences to present day low <b>exposure</b> <b>situations.</b> Therefore, any risk assessment will have to consider the question whether combined effects, i e. interaction between two or more agents will influence the health outcome from specific <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> {{in such a way that}} predictions derived from simple standard <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> would have to be revised. In view of the multitude of possible interactions between the large number of potentially harmful agents in the human environment, descriptive approaches will have to be supplemented by the use of mechanistic models for critical health endpoints such as cancer. Agents will have to be grouped depending on their mode of action at the molecular and cellular level, to generalize and predict the outcome of combined exposures at low exposure levels and the possibility of interactions...|$|R

40|$|The {{awareness}} of potential risks {{emerging from the}} use of chemicals in all parts of daily life has increased the need for risk assessments that are able to cover a high number of <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> and thereby ensure the safety of workers and consumers. In the European Union (EU), the practice of risk assessments for chemicals is laid down in a Technical Guidance Document; it is designed to consider environmental and human occupational and residential exposure. Almost 70 EU risk assessment reports (RARs) have been finalized for high-production-volume chemicals during the last decade. In the present study, we analyze the assessment of occupational and consumer exposure to trichloroethylene and phthalates presented in six EU RARs. Exposure scenarios in these six RARs were compared to scenarios used in applications of the scenario-based risk assessment approach to the same set of chemicals. We find that scenarios used in the selected EU RARs to represent typical <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> in occupational or private use of chemicals and products do not necessarily represent worst-case conditions. This can be due to the use of outdated information on technical equipment and conditions in workplaces or omission of pathways that can cause consumer exposure. Considering the need for exposure and risk assessments under the new chemicals legislation of the EU, we suggest that a transparent process of collecting data on <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> and of generating representative exposure scenarios is implemented to improve the accuracy of risk assessments. Also, the data sets used to assess human exposure should be harmonized, summarized in a transparent fashion, and made accessible for all risk assessors and the public...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Occupational {{exposure}} to manufactured nano-objects and their agglomerates, and aggregates (NOAA) {{has been described}} in several workplace air monitoring studies. However, data pooling for general conclusions and exposure estimates are hampered by limited exposure data across the occupational life cycle of NOAA and a lack in comparability between the methods of collecting and analysing the data. By applying a consistent method of collecting and analysing the workplace exposure data, this study aimed {{to provide information about}} the occupational NOAA exposure levels across various life cycle stages of NOAA in the Netherlands which can also be used for multi-purpose use. METHODS: Personal/near field task-based exposure data was collected using a multi-source exposure assessment method collecting real time particle number concentration, particle size distribution (PSD), filter-based samples for morphological, and elemental analysis and detailed contextual information. A decision logic was followed allowing a consistent and objective way of analysing the exposure data. RESULTS: In total, 46 measurement surveys were conducted at 15 companies covering 18 different <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> across various occupational life cycle stages of NOAA. Highest activity-effect levels were found during replacement of big bags (< 1000 - 76000 # cm(- 3)), mixing/dumping of powders manually (< 1000 - 52000 # cm(- 3)) and mechanically (< 1000 - 100000 # cm(- 3)), and spraying of liquid (2000 - 800000 # cm(- 3)) showing a high variability between and within the various <b>exposure</b> <b>situations.</b> In general, a limited change in PSD was found during the activity compared to the background. CONCLUSIONS: This broad-scale exposure study gives a comprehensive overview of the NOAA <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> in the Netherlands and an indication of the levels of occupational {{exposure to}} NOAA across various life cycle of NOAA. The collected workplace exposure data and contextual information will serve as basis for future pooling of data and modelling of worker exposure...|$|R
