5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, {{but he could not}} sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> The distance in dating between the objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to the setting of the painting, and that he did not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E

5|$|However, the two western towers left of {{the church}} display an unusual detail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> The uniformly proportioned, large, square windows {{depicted}} there {{are associated with the}} Italian Renaissance, which was introduced in Sweden in 1572 during reconstruction of Kalmar Castle. While the construction works of Gustav Vasa are poorly documented, the presence of these windows in Stockholm in 1535 is unlikely. It seems more credible that this part of the painting had been damaged before 1632, forcing the copyist to rely on another source. As the two square and crenellated towers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> are depicted much as they appear on a copperplate of Stockholm produced by Frantz Hogenberg around 1560–1570, the painting thus probably renders this part of the castle as it appeared while the reconstruction was still under way, before its completion in the 1580s.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> {{the medieval}} city is viewed looking east {{with the dark}} waters of Riddarfjärden in the {{foreground}} and {{the interior of the}} Stockholm archipelago in the background. Although the event depicted is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is painted in evening light.|$|E
5|$|Just {{behind the}} Greyfriars turret is the islet of Helgeandsholmen, where the {{northern}} city gate and defensive wall were located. Today occupied by the Swedish Parliament, this islet was named after the charitable institution, Helige andens holme ("Islet of the Holy Spirit"), located there from around 1300 and discernible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> as a building with stepped gables facing an open space perhaps indicating {{the location of the}} demolished Johannite monastery. King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced.|$|E
50|$|The Sinner begins where <b>The</b> <b>Painter</b> leaves off.

Illugi writes a slanderous article about David’s art, {{which is one}} of the things that pushes David over the edge. Many of <b>the</b> characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel seem to think that Illugi is responsible for the murder, one of them being himself.|$|R

5|$|The {{painting}} is centred on the Storkyrkan church, first mentioned in historical records in 1279 and gradually enlarged {{over the following}} centuries. In 1468–1496, {{during the reign of}} Sten Sture the Elder, its size was doubled — the chapels where transformed into aisles, while rounded windows and a taller roof allowed more light into the building. The building <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> depicts the church as it must have appeared when Gustav Vasa became king — the buttresses added in the 1550s are not present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> which seem to confirm that the 17th century copy was faithful to the original. The church still exists, although the present exterior is mostly a later Baroque design.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{shows the}} stages of courtship as described by Milton, as men are seduced by women and pass from enjoying the company of other men into married life.

5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|To {{the left}} of the open space north of the medieval city are the steep {{southern}} slopes of the Brunkebergsåsen esker, a geological feature whose remains still stretch north through the city.

5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E
5|$|Like the Coronation Necklace, these {{earrings}} {{have been}} worn by queens regnant and consort at every coronation since 1901. Made for Queen Victoria in 1858 using the diamonds {{from an old}} Garter badge, they are of typical design: a large brilliant followed by a smaller one, with a large pear-shaped drop. The drops were originally part of the Koh-i-Noor armlet. After they had been made, Victoria wore the earrings and matching necklace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> Queen Victoria by the European court painter, Franz Winterhalter.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E

5|$|The World Before the Flood is {{strongly}} influenced by A Bacchanalian Revel Before a Term of Pan (1632–33) by Nicolas Poussin, whom Etty greatly admired and of whose works he had previously made several copies; this painting had been bought by the National Gallery in 1826. Adam and Michael are not visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> Instead, the viewer sees the scene from Adam's point of view.|$|E

As part of his preparations, Jovanović studied authentic costumes and armaments {{from the time of}} the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović incited the people. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some of their faces appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece depiction of a battle scene, and much more than a simple depiction of a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
