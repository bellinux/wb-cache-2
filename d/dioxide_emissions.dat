Passenger car {{is one of}} the largest shares of internal combustion engine vehicle on the road today. Therefore, they are also responsible for a large proportion of the environmental pollution such as the greenhouse gas emission. On this study four different ages of cars will be tested experimentally for their carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>emission</b> using the universal emission analyzer machine. From the experiment result, carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>emission</b> index is then being proposed.

From this research it is clear that the age of the car play a significant role of carbon dioxide emitted. Generally, the older the car emits more carbon dioxide compare to the newer car for the same time of use.

5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>emissions</b> by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E

5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no tailpipe emissions. In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>emissions.</b> However, this benefit is mostly local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, these emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's battery is depleted and the gasoline-powered engine engages, the plug-in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E

Geopolymers have advantage of high compressive strength, fire resistance, low shrinkage, acid resistance and low thermal conductivity. In this study, marble-based geopolymer was studied by mixing marble powder, blast furnace slag (BFS) and alkali solution. Physical/mechanical properties of marble-based geopolymer prepared with different marble/BFS weight ratio and SiO 2 /Na 2 O mole ratio were tested. The experimental results indicated that the compressive strength of marble-based geopolymer can reach 44 MPa within 120 minutes setting time. The microstructure of geopolymeric green cement contains C-S-H gel and aluminosilicate in the framework.

The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of sulphur <b>dioxide</b> <b>emissions</b> between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of unleaded petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspotâ€”the RÃ©union hotspotâ€”now occupied by the volcanic island of RÃ©union. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60â€“68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>emissions</b> also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
