40|$|Focusing on each country's topmost destination/origin {{migration}} {{relation with}} other countries, this study builds top 1 <b>destination</b> <b>networks</b> and top 1 origin networks {{in order to}} understand their skeletal construction and community dynamics. Each top 1 network covers approximately 50 % of the complete migrant network stock for each decade between 1960 and 2000. We investigate the community structure by implementing the Girvan-Newman algorithm and compare the number of components and communities to illustrate their differences. We find that (i) both top 1 <b>networks</b> (origin and <b>destination)</b> exhibited communities with a clear structure and a surprising evolution, although 80 % edges persist between each decade; (ii) top 1 <b>destination</b> <b>networks</b> focused on developed countries exhibiting shorter paths and preferring more advance countries, while top 1 origin networks focused both on developed as well as more substantial developing nations that presented a longer path and more stable groups; (iii) only few countries have a decisive influence on community evolution of both top 1 networks. USA took the leading position as a destination country in top 1 <b>destination</b> <b>networks,</b> while China and India were the main Asian emigration countries in top 1 origin networks; European countries and the Russian Federation {{played an important role in}} both...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{is replete with}} analyses of minimum cost flows in networks for which the cost of shipping from node to node is a linear function. However, the linear cost assumption is often not realistic. Situations {{in which there is}} a set-up charge, discounting, or efficiencies of scale give rise to concave functions. Although concave functions can be minimized by an exhaustive search of all the extreme points of the convex feasible region, such an approach is impractical for all but the simplest of problems. In this paper some theorems are developed which explicitly characterize the extreme points for certain single commodity networks. By exploiting this characterization algorithms are developed that determine the minimum concave cost solution for networks with a single source and a single destination, for acyclic single source multiple <b>destination</b> <b>networks,</b> and for acyclic single <b>destination</b> multiple source <b>networks.</b> An interesting theorem then establishes that for either single source or single <b>destination</b> <b>networks</b> the multi-commodity case can be reduced to the single commodity case. Applications to the concave warehouse problem, a single product production and inventory model, a multi-product production and inventory model, and a plant location problem are included. ...|$|R

40|$|Distance vector routing, {{known as}} the Internet {{standard}} 'Routing Information Protocol' (RIP), is overhead-prone when adapting to changes in topology. The reason for this behaviour is {{known as the}} 'counting to infinity' approach: <b>destination</b> <b>networks</b> which become unreachable will be advertised with increased distance until their distance reaches infinity. To speed up this procedure, 'infinity' has to be very small (usually 16); hence, distance vector routing can be used in small networking environments only. (orig.)
