And <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> captured all of that on this album". MTV News noted that on the songs, Lopez might be [...] "giving us some insight about what she was dealing with in her personal life in the months before it was released".|$|E
500|$|After a month out of work, Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013, {{his third}} spell in charge at the club. On the appointment, Stevenage {{chairman}} Phil Wallace stated [...] "Graham was keen {{to come back}} to Stevenage and, although I met some strong candidates, without doubt I think he’s the best man for the job right now. The club enjoyed a great deal of success before he left last year and we moved forwards significantly in his time here on several levels". On his return, Westley said [...] "I'm really happy to be back, the training ground is fantastic, the club just keeps moving forward. All the facilities keep improving and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can come back and make another positive difference".

Stevenage ended the 2012–13 campaign in 18th-place, and Westley released four players and transfer-listed three others.|$|E

"It {{was during}} the period of one of my {{greatest}} depressions <b>that</b> <b>I</b> met with a monk who was afterward St. Bruno, and I joined the Carthusian monastery which he founded in Calabria.

It has the power to build bridges, to empower, to teach, to heal – this is what triathlon and every other sport should be about. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> [...] can, in a small way, help to inspire people to take up sport, realise their own dreams and their full potential.|$|E

Afterward, Thomas {{and his fellow}} veteran East players were accused of having planned to [...] "freeze out" [...] Jordan from their offense by not passing him the ball, supposedly out of spite over the attention Jordan was receiving. No player involved has ever confirmed that the freeze-out occurred, but the story has long been reported {{and has never been}} refuted by Jordan. Thomas has ridiculed the idea of him being the mastermind behind a supposed freeze-out as [...] "ludicrous", pointing out that he was a relatively young player on a team that included Larry Bird, Julius Erving and Moses Malone.

AMMA president and actor Innocent, requested Mohanlal to withdraw from the stunt from endangering himself. He said [...] "Mohanlal is a pillar of the Malayalam film industry; he has no right to go and do such a risky show".

Briefing about the act in the press conference organised in Trivandrum, Mohanlal said [...] "The risk factor is fifty-fifty for the escape act. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can make it with the blessings of all". About the objective of the act, the Merlin Award winning magician Gopinath Muthukad said [...] "Counted {{as one of the most}} dangerous acts, the 'Burning Illusion' will find Mohanlal inspiring the youth to overcome debacles in life with sheer determination.
