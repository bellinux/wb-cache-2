Evacuations occurred in sequence to follow the storm's forecast positions, and many residents and tourists along portions of the Gulf Coast were forced to leave twice {{in a matter of}} days. Preparations were generally timely and efficient, though accommodations and resources at storm shelters were stretched thin, and many refugees tried to return home against officials' orders. About 1.25 million people fled the storm in Florida alone, contributing to a region-wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees.

This chapter will argue that conflict and conflict resolution can be understood against an evolutionary framework which helps us understand why the human brain is capable of producing highly destructive and conflictual behaviours. This approach opens up new ways of considering the challenges that face international negotiators. This chapter will also argue that although our brain has many <b>destructive</b> <b>potentials,</b> it also has a capacity for altruism, cooperation and compassion. If we learn to cultivate our minds from these qualities, along with mindfulness, this may help negotiators find new ways of negotiating and working with their own complex psychologies...|$|R

This working paper examines how residents in a periurban area seek to position themselves at appropriate distances to important but potentially dangerous others. It is argued that house-building constitutes a potent medium for proportioning viable distances so that reciprocal exchanges can be realized without being harmed by presumed greedy and envious others. In particular, the paper explores how house-builders imitate urban norms which state and municipality claim to be using but which they are incapable of implementing. Through such processes of inverse governmentality, illegal occupancy acquires a form of pragmatic legitimacy when appearing to materialise state-defined urban norms...|$|R

40|$|Compassion focused therapy (CFT) {{is rooted}} in an evolutionary, {{functional}} analysis of basic social motivational systems (e. g., to live in groups, form hierarchies and ranks, seek out sexual, partners help and share with alliances, and care for kin) and different functional emotional systems (e. g., to respond to threats, seek out resources, and for states of contentment/safeness). In addition, about 2 million years ago, (pre-) humans began to evolve a range of cognitive competencies for reasoning, reflection, anticipating, imagining, mentalizing, and creating a socially contextualized sense of self. These new competencies can cause major difficulties {{in the organization of}} (older) motivation and emotional systems. CFT suggests that our evolved brain is therefore potentially problematic because of its basic ‘design,’ being easily triggered into destructive behaviours and mental health problems (called ‘tricky brain’). However, mammals and especially humans have also evolved motives and emotions for affiliative, caring and altruistic behaviour that can organize our brain {{in such a way as}} to significantly offset our <b>destructive</b> <b>potentials.</b> CFT therefore highlights the importance of developing people's capacity to (mindfully) access, tolerate, and direct affiliative motives and emotions, for themselves and others, and cultivate inner compassion as a way for organizing our human ‘tricky brain’ in prosocial and mentally healthy ways...|$|R

When writing his work Hitler – Scheitern und Vernichtungswut (2004; “Hitler – Failing and rage of destruction”), Vinnai had a psychoanalytic point of depart; he first subjected Hitler’s book Mein Kampf a depth psychological interpretation {{and tried to}} reconstruct how Hitler had processed his experiences in World War I {{against the background of}} his childhood and youth. But similar to Dorpat, Vinnai explains the <b>destructive</b> <b>potential</b> in Hitler's psyche {{not so much as a}} result of early childhood experiences, but rather due to trauma that Hitler had suffered as a soldier in World War I. Not only Hitler, but a substantial part of the German population was affected by such war trauma. Vinnai then leaves the psychoanalytical discourse and comments on social psychological questions, such as how Hitler’s political world view could have emerged from his trauma and how this could appeal to large numbers of people.|$|E

40|$|Over several centuries, mining {{activities}} {{have resulted in}} the creation of varied environmental complications. Most {{mining activities}} are carried out in locations with proximity to human settlements. The interplay of mining activity and society has created  several mining-related conflicts throughout the world, and in developing countries especially, these conflicts are much prevalent. These conflicts could be analysed in a variety of ways: analyzing the conflicts based on goals, interests and value interference; or on the bases of issues related to interaction between two or more parties. This paper takes into consideration the two concepts of constructivity and destructivity of conflicts as they relate to natural resource management and indicate that it is possible for a country or society like Ghana to discover constructive potential in a phenomenon that is mostly deemed destructive. The conflict situations in two mining communities (Akyem and Wassa) are taken into consideration for this paper. This does not deal with issues of conflict management, rather, it takes a look into the interaction between these communities and the associated mining company to determine whether the relationship between them possess constructive or <b>destructive</b> <b>potentials.</b> Based on interviews and information available on the internet, this paper determines that there exist elements of constructivity and destructivity in both areas. In the Akyem area, the destructive aspects reside in the relationship between Newmont and the Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining (WACAM). The relationship between Newmont and the local representatives take on a constructive aspect. Even though there is some sort of tension between the local people and Newmont, the situation can still be considered as constructive because they are still able to engage in dialogue in an attempt to coexist. In the Wassa area on the other hand, the story is different thus taken a destructive nature between Golden Star Resources and the communities. The involvement of the government however presents an opportunity for constructivity in the situation...|$|R

40|$|The {{language}} of idealism and skepticism in Shakespearean moments of disillusionment provides terms for understanding {{features of the}} late plays—their self-conscious artificiality, their blend of wonder and irony, pathos and moral indignation. The psychology of disillusionment illuminates the relationship of tragedy to romance. ^ In Timon of Athens, perhaps the last tragedy, Shakespeare skeptically exposes the psychology of idealism but reveals the consequence of such skepticism, a world drained of wonder. Subsequent plays rejuvenate idealism, protecting it from its own tendencies toward punishment and revenge. Moving toward heroic assertion and death, tragedy often colludes with the idealist in his time-foreclosing and self-destructive acts of revenge, but the new genre gives him more time to return to reality without sacrificing the psychological benefits of idealism. Pericles escapes the anxiety brought by awareness of evil by flight and delay. The unifying principle of his play is not the tragic closure of heroic integrity, but a life extended in time. Cymbeline returns to the truth impulses of love-idealism. Posthumous 2 ̆ 7 disillusioned misogyny carries these impulses into a punishing mode, but his reacceptance of Imogen represents an irrational but redeeming subordination of epistemological truth to interpersonal truth. The Winter 2 ̆ 7 s Tale rejuvenates idealism after displaying its <b>destructive</b> <b>potentials</b> in jealousy. Married love embodies idealism in {{an image of the}} good of life. In the statue scene, the wish for an atemporal ideal gives way to faith in the temporal world. In The Tempest wonder arises from seeing a world as if for the first time, and is thus exposed to the irony of perspectivism. Marriage returns as love at first sight, but shares the stage with tropes of ambition, usurpation, subjugation, murder. Prospero identifies with reason over fury but remains perplexed by irony and anxiety. ^ Taking bearings from within the Shakespearean ethos rather than from a specific theory of genre allows this study to register the distinctive tonalities of the individual plays. The development illuminated is not that of a sustained progression toward a preexisting genre but that of a vital intelligence probing a specific set of problems in an intellectually coherent way. ...|$|R

40|$|In June 2016, {{an unusual}} East Coast Low storm {{affected}} some 2000 km {{of the eastern}} seaboard of Australia bringing heavy rain, strong winds and powerful wave conditions. While wave heights offshore of Sydney were not exceptional, nearshore wave conditions were such that beaches experienced {{some of the worst}} erosion in 40 years. Hydrodynamic modelling of wave and current behaviour as well as contemporaneous sand transport shows the east to north-east storm wave direction to be the major determinant of erosion magnitude. This arises because of reduced energy attenuation across the continental shelf and the focussing of wave energy on coastal sections not equilibrated with such wave exposure under the prevailing south-easterly wave climate. Narrabeen–Collaroy, a well-known erosion hot spot on Sydney’s Northern Beaches, is shown to be particularly vulnerable to storms from this direction because the <b>destructive</b> erosion <b>potential</b> is amplified by the influence of the local embayment geometry. We demonstrate the magnified erosion response that occurs when there is bi-directionality between an extreme wave event and preceding modal conditions and the importance of considering wave direction in extreme value analyses...|$|R
