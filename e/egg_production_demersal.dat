We propose a new definition for persistency of egg production: the number of weeks during which a level of constant production is maintained. No <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> model exists that includes a measure of persistency in terms of duration of time or that allows this measure of persistency to be derived from model parameters. It was necessary, therefore, to develop a new model to describe an <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> curve for a flock: Please see model within the full paper, due to the limits of computer coding. and for an individual: where yt = <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> at time t, t 1 and t 2 = times at transition, r = duration of transition, yP = level of constant production, b 4 = rate of decline in production, and P = persistency of constant production. These parameters measure directly the important biological characteristics of an <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> curve. To illustrate the model, six data sets were used: two from flocks (one pullet flock and one hen flock) and four from two pairs of individuals.

Methods A total of 916 chickens were reared in warm and natural cold environments (daily mean ambient temperature varied from 7. 4 °C to 26. 5 °C in the warm environment and from − 17. 5 °C to 27. 0 °C in the cold environment). To investigate their adaptability to the cold environment, the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance and body weight were monitored and compared between breeds and environments. The cloacal temperature and serum biochemical parameters were monitored to reveal the physiological characteristics underlie cold tolerance and favorable <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance in the cold environment. Results The warm environment experiment showed that RIR had the highest <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance, and that the reciprocal crossbreds had a higher <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance than BS. While in the cold environment RIR had the lowest <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance, and the reciprocal crossbreds had a higher <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance than BS. In the cold environment BS and reciprocal crossbreds had higher triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine levels than RIR.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} aimed to improve <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> by decreasing the intersequence pause days between the sequences of egg lay in girirani birds through chemical control of prolactin by using bromocriptine (an anti prolactin chemical) through feed. At 12 weeks of age, forty two girirani birds were randomly divided into control (n= 21) and treated (n= 21) groups. Birds in the treated group were fed bromocriptine through feed @ 350 µg/bird/day from 17 - 36 weeks of age and controls were fed the same ration without bromocriptine. Birds fed with bromocriptine through feed significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced the prolactin concentration compared to control birds. Estradiol and progesterone were quantified in both the groups. Treated birds showed higher (P< 0. 01) concentration of estradiol and progesterone concentration from 19 th to 72 weeks of age with intermittent fluctuations. <b>Egg</b> <b>production,</b> pause days, and hormonal parameters were correlated between the two groups. Prolactin is negatively correlated with <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (r =- 0. 89), estradiol (r =- 0. 59) and progesterone (r =- 0. 37) hormones and positively correlated with inter sequence pause days with concomitant decrease in <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> Birds fed bromocriptine through feed showed significantly (P< 0. 01) less pause days and more <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> The results of this study showed that, controlling the prolactin secretion by chemical means resulted in 5. 12 % increase in <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> over control birds, further such an approach is more promising, practicable, economical without any traces of chemical in meat, egg and blood to improve <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in backyard poultry farming.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{described}} and analysed changes {{in the numbers of}} large ovarian follicles (diameter 6. 1 - 9. 0 cm) and in the plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol- 17 beta (E 2 beta) in relation to individual <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> figures of farmed ostriches (Struthio camelus spp.) throughout one year. Ultrasound scanning and blood sampling for plasma hormone analysis were performed in 9 hens on a monthly basis during the breeding season and in two periods of the non-breeding season. Our data demonstrated that: (1) large follicles were detected and LH concentrations were elevated already 1 month before first ovipositions of the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season took place; (2) E- 2 beta concentrations increased as soon as the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season started; (3) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations were elevated during the entire <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season; and that (4) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations decreased simultaneous with or following the last ovipositions of the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season. By comparing these parameters during the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season with their pre-and post-seasonal values, significant differences were found in the numbers of large follicles and E- 2 beta concentrations between the pre-seasonal, seasonal and post-seasonal period; while LH concentrations were significantly different between the seasonal and post-seasonal period. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that changes in numbers of large follicles and in concentrations of LH and E- 2 beta closely parallel individual <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> figures and provide some new cues that <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in ostriches is confined to a marked reproductive season. Moreover, our data provide indications that mechanism, initiating, maintaining and terminating the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season in farmed breeding ostriches are quite similar to those already known for other seasonal breeding bird species.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> was {{increased}} by scientific breeding. After a few false starts, (such as the Maine Experiment Station's failure at improving <b>egg</b> <b>production)</b> success was shown by Professor Dryden at the Oregon Experiment Station.|$|R
40|$|Dietary calcium restriotion is {{studied as}} a method of {{controlling}} <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> Attempts have been made to delay the onset of <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in the fowl by feeding pre-laying diets deficient in calcium. Calcium restriction had no apparent effect on sexual development and did not delay the time· of first oviposition. Low calcium diets were used at a later date to halt <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> firstly just after peak production and secondly {{towards the end of the}} first laying year. <b>Egg</b> <b>production</b> was depressed markedly but never completely ceased, and remained at a low level until calcium restrictions were lifted whereupon a rapid rise returned <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> to levels comparable to <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> rates of non calcium restricted control hens. Comparisons between <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> <b>egg</b> weight, shell weight and a measure of shell quality (shell weight per unit surface area of egg) revealed trends towards improved shell production and shell quality following calcium restriction but little else. There was only a small number of significant differences. <b>Egg</b> <b>production</b> pauses induced by low dietary calcium were thought to be unsatisfactory as substitutes for force moulting. Calcium restriction caused declines in food consumption and body weight. While food consumption returned to levels equivalent to food consumption of non calcium restricted hens after calcium restriction, body weight in general did not. Calculations of the calcium loss from the body of calcium restricted hens via egg·shell production show that extremely severe depletion occurs unless egg prvduction is stopped or at least <b>egg</b> shell <b>production</b> is stopped. Such depletion of calcium has greatest effects on the skeleton and damage to the bones, particularly of the legs, may result. This is a condition which may predispose to a paralytic condition characteristic of extreme calcium deficiency...|$|R
5|$|Global <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> was {{expected}} to reach 65.5 million tonnes in 2013, surpassing all previous years. Between 2000 and 2010, <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> was growing globally at around 2% per year, but since then growth has slowed down to nearer 1%.|$|R
50|$|According to Mench et al., {{although}} {{changes in}} commercial <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> systems are being driven largely by animal welfare concerns, {{it is clear}} that other aspects of such changes must be considered to ensure sustainable <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> Sustainability is a complex topic. Elements of sustainability include economics, environmental effects, human health and safety, and social values in addition to animal welfare. Backyard <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> has been suggested as a solution to sustainable, healthy food supply for families.|$|R
40|$|ALTHOUGH {{genotype}} by environment- {{interactions in}} <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> stocks may be statististically significant for some traits, {{they appear to}} be of minor impor-tance (Tindell et al., 1967; Marks et al., 1969). These studies demonstrated the ex-plained variation attributable to genotype by environment interactions to be of low magnitude for most <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> traits.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to find out {{conditions}} and characteristics of Slovenian farms that are engaged in <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> as well as their future strategic plans. The results were obtained with questionnaires that were sent to 87 farmers but 50 were properly answered and returned. Besides <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> most farmers are engaged in other agricultural and non-agricultural activities. The main objective of farmers is sufficient income and production of quality and safety animal products. The differences among groups of farmers are presented according to system of <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (organic / other systems), model of production (specialization / various agricultural and non-agricultural activities) and expected <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in future (enlarged production / unchanged production). </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{conducted}} research analyzes two systems of <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> the conventional, commercial <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> and the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> {{with a higher}} nutritive value - PUFA n- 3 enriched eggs. Financial result of <b>eggs</b> <b>production</b> with PUFA n- 3 is significantly {{higher than that of}} the conventional production - profitability of the conventional production was 19. 29 % and the one with PUFA n- 3 enriched eggs 36. 10 %. It is, therefore, important to evaluate the efficiency of the use of capital based on the profitability of capital that is in the conventional <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> 23. 9 %, and in the production of PUFA n- 3 enriched eggs 56. 1 %. According to the results of investigation, it is necessary to produce 258 eggs in the conventional <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> whereas in the <b>production</b> of enrichments <b>eggs</b> with PUFA n- 3 breakeven point (BEP) is lower and amounts 204 eggs per laying hen per year. A higher cover rate with a difference of 10 % (42. 99 ± 53. 07) confirms that the <b>production</b> of enrichments <b>eggs</b> with PUFA n- 3 is economically more efficient...|$|R
