The equation for determining the isoelectric point is as follows: [...] In the papermaking process, the pigment dispersions are generally kept at a pH above 8.0.|$|E

This study aimed to define some relationships among these changes in an Oxisol using multivariate analysis. Corn (Zea mays L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) were grown for two years, irrigated with TSE. The following soil properties were determined: Ca 2 +; Mg 2 +; Na+; K+ and H + Al contents, cationic exchangeable capacity (CEC), sum of bases (SB), base saturation (V), texture (sand, silt and clay), macro-, micro-, and cryptoporosity (V MA, V MI and V CRI), water content at soil saturation (&# 952;S) and at field capacity (&# 952;FC), residual water content (&# 952;R), soil bulk density (d s), water dispersed clay (WDC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K SAT). Factor analysis revealed the following six principal factors: <b>Fine</b> <b>Porosity</b> (composed of Na+; K+; WDC, &# 952;R, &# 952;RFC, and V CRI); Large Porosity (&# 952;S, d s, V MA, Vs); Soil CEC (Ca 2 +; Mg 2 +; CEC, SB, V); Soil Acidity (H + Al); and Soil Texture (factors 5 and 6). A dual pore structure appears clearly to the factors 1 and 2, with an apparent relationship between <b>fine</b> <b>porosity</b> and the monovalent cations Na+ and K+. The irrigation (with potable sodic tap water or sewage wastewater) only {{had a significant effect}} on <b>Fine</b> <b>Porosity</b> and Large Porosity factors, while factors 3 and 4 (Soil CEC and Soil Acidity) were correlated with soil depth.

Kaolinite, sinter magnesite, talc and pyrophyllite as natural raw materials and Al 2 O 3, MgO and SiO 2 as synthetic powders were used to obtain the synthetic cordierite. 6 different mixtures were prepared for the selected three target compositions in the Al 2 O 3 -MgO-SiO 2 quaternary diagram. Each mixture was milled in a planetary ball mill followed by pressing in an unaxial press and sintering in an electrical furnace at 1350 oC for 1, 3 and 5 hours. Sintered cordierite bodies were characterized using X-ray diffraction(XRD), Archimedes method and three point bending strength tests.

The influence of liquid sampling volume, frit porosity and the nature of the sampling liquid was explored and it was shown that all impact on the collection efficiency of particles smaller than 220 nm. Obtained values for overall collection efficiency were substantially higher (~ 30 – 95 %) than have been previously reported, mainly due to the high deposition of particles in the fritted nozzle tip, especially in case of <b>finer</b> <b>porosity</b> frits and smaller particles. Values for the capture efficiency of the solvent alone ranged from 20 to 45 %, depending on the type and the volume of solvent.

Different X-ray sources, detectors and filtering methods were investigated. Use of a low-energy detector {{as well as a}} Cu-filter decreased the potential for phase segmentation in X-ray CT images of an artificial sand-OM mixture. A mid-range X-ray detector showed to hold more potential. Results obtained for an artificial sand-OM sample showed that an attenuation coefficient (AC) grey-value histogram-based single threshold was unsuitable for automated phase segmentation. A dual thresholding approach enabled a better separation of the different phases. Secondly, the minimal measurable pore size class in a clay loam soil aggregate was compared using micro-focus and state-of-the-art nano-focus X-ray CT. The resolution of the scanned images depends on the spot size of the X-ray source, the resolution of the detector and the magnification used. Reliable discrimination of pore and solid phases was expected to be limited by the X-ray tube's focal spot size to 2. 5 mu m, in contrast to the voxel size of 0. 84 mu m actually obtained using nano-focus CT. Although this study was limited in its extent, indications were found that more <b>fine</b> <b>porosity</b> is visible at higher resolutions and that large connected pore spaces may be observed.

Non-woven geotextiles of 20, 30 and 40 micrometers equivalent pore sizes were subjected to heads of 0. 9, 1. 8 and 2. 7 m of 5 % total solids (TS) swine slurry for 1800 hours. Infiltration rates decreased from 5 X 10 ^- 5 m/s to less than 1 X 10 ^- 7 m/s and 2 X 10 ^- 8 m/s within 150 and 1000 hours, respectively and all demonstrated minimum seepage rates of 1. 3 to 1. 8 X 10 ^- 8 m/s after 1000 to 1400 hours; these rates are slightly greater than the 10 ^- 8 m/s guideline established by the Quebec government. Field sealing of geotextiles liners was confirmed using a 20 micrometers fabric subjected to swine slurries of various total solids (TS) concentrations ranging from 1 % to 10 %. Infiltration rates indicate that satisfactory sealing requires slurries with a minimum TS content of 4 %. As well, higher TS levels favour a longer lasting manure seal at the fabric surface. Sterilized manure of 5 % total solids (TS) used to simulate cool field conditions or poor biological sealing mechanisms showed that the sterilized manure retained a constant infiltration rate after 1000 hours. The equivalent natural manure, on the other hand, demonstrated an increase in infiltration rates after 1000 hours, indicating that microbial degradation of the manure solids mat had occurred.

40|$|Improved {{methods of}} heat {{dissipation}} {{are required for}} modern, high-power density electronic systems. As increased functionality is progressively compacted into decreasing volumes, this need will be exacerbated. High-performance chip power is predicted to increase monotonically and rapidly with time. Systems utilizing these chips are currently reliant upon decades of old cooling technology. Heat pipes offer {{a solution to this}} problem. Heat pipes are passive, self-contained, two-phase heat dissipation devices. Heat conducted into the device through a wick structure converts the working fluid into a vapor, which then releases the heat via condensation after being transported away from the heat source. Heat pipes have high thermal conductivities, are inexpensive, and have been utilized in previous space missions. However, the cylindrical geometry of commercial heat pipes is a poor fit to the planar geometries of microelectronic assemblies, the copper that commercial heat pipes are typically constructed of is a poor CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) match to the semiconductor die utilized in these assemblies, and the functionality and reliability of heat pipes in general is strongly dependent on the orientation of the assembly with respect to the gravity vector. What is needed is a planar, semiconductor-based heat pipe array {{that can be used for}} cooling of generic MCM (multichip module) assemblies that can also function in all orientations. Such a structure would not only have applications in the cooling of space electronics, but would have commercial applications as well (e. g. cooling of microprocessors and high-power laser diodes). This technology is an improvement over existing heat pipe designs due to the <b>finer</b> <b>porosity</b> of the wick, which enhances capillary pumping pressure, resulting in greater effective thermal conductivity and performance in any orientation with respect to the gravity vector. In addition, it is constructed of silicon, and thus is better suited for the cooling of semiconductor devices...|$|R

It is shown that the microwave-induced favorable effects on densification could be more important due to the existence of MgO dopant or a decrease of particle size. Combined with the thermodynamics and kinetics considerations, one assumed that grain-boundary diffusion could be significantly enhanced by microwave non-thermal effect.

The effect of polyacrylamide (PAM) on soil aggregate stabilization and crust formation was also investigated. A laboratory rainfall simulation experiment was carried out using soil sample slices. The slices were examined under a polarized light microscopy and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results revealed that the soil crusts were thin and were characterized by a greater density, higher shear strength, <b>finer</b> <b>porosity,</b> and lower saturated hydraulic conductivity than the underlying soil. Two types of crusts, i. e., structural and depositional crusts, were observed. Soil texture {{was determined to be}} the most important soil variable influencing surface crust formation; depositional crust formation was primarily related to the skeleton characteristics of the soil and happened when the soil contained a high level of medium and large aggregates. The crust formation processes observed were as follows: 1) The fine particles on the soil surface became spattered, leached, and then rough in response to raindrop impact and 2) the fine particles were washed into the subsoil pores while a compact dense layer concurrently formed at soil surface due to the continual compaction by the raindrops. Therefore, the factors that influenced structural crust formation were a large amount of fine particles in the soil surface, continual impact of raindrops, dispersion of aggregates into fine particles, and the formation of a compact dense layer concurrently at the soil surface. It was concluded that the most important factor in the formation of soil crusts was raindrop impact. When polyacrylamide (PAM) was applied, it restored the soil structure and greatly increased soil aggregate stabilization. This effectively prevented crust formation. However, this function of PAM was not continuously effective and the crust reformed with long-term rainfall. In conclusion, this study showed that soil micromorphological studies were a useful method for evaluating soil crust formation...|$|R

Next, I utilized a grain size statistical method to derive estimates for permeability, using the measured porosity values. I then compared these estimates to measured permeability values. I took permeability measurements on the mixtures using air- and water-based methods. Finally, I made conclusions about the petrophysical models for porosity and permeability {{to determine whether or not}} they were applicable to natural sediment. These conclusions will help to improve the confidence in estimating the parameters of porosity and permeability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{report the}} {{fabrication}} of Ni 60 self-fluxing alloy coatings on the substrate of 45 steel via spark plasma sintering technique. The microstructure and interface bonding of the coatings {{have been investigated}} systematically. The {{results suggest that the}} as-prepared coatings possess <b>fine</b> grains, little <b>porosity</b> and with hard-phases (CrB, Cr 7 C 3, Ni 3 B) dispersed within the substrate (γ-Ni,). The coatings are jagged and embedded to the substrate due to the elements diffusion during the SPS process. A solid interfacial metallurgy bonding can be achieved between the coating and substrate and the hardness of the coating is ~ 597. 5 HV 0. 3. The hardness of the transition layer present a gradient distribution ranged from 597. 5 HV 0. 3 to 209. 6 HV 0. 3. The bonding strength between the coating and substrate is measured to be ~ 710 MPa. The volume abrasive wear rate of the coating is ~ 5. 43 × 1...|$|R
