Caldershaws, {{you must}} know, {{is one of the}} most disreputable districts in Edinburgh. One of my clerks (whom I am in the habit of employing confidentially) volunteered to inquire for 'Dandie' at 'Number Nine.' It was a ticklish business in every way; and my man wisely took a person with him who was known in the neighborhood. 'Number Nine' turned out to be (ostensibly) a shop for the sale of rags and old iron; and 'Dandie' was suspected of trading now and then, additionally, as a receiver of stolen goods. Thanks to the influence of his companion, backed by a bank-note (which can be repaid, by the way, out of the fund for the American expenses), my clerk succeeded is making the fellow speak. Not to trouble you with needless details, the result in substance was this: A fortnight or more before the date of Mrs. Eustace's death, 'Dandie' made two keys from wax models supplied to him by a new customer. The mystery observed in the matter by the agent who managed it excited Dandie's distrust. He had the man privately watched before he delivered the keys; and he ended in discovering that his customer was--Miserrimus Dexter. Wait a little! I have not done yet. Add to this information Dexter's incomprehensible knowledge of the contents of your husband's diary, and the product is--that the wax models sent to the old-iron shop in Caldershaws were models taken by theft from the key of the Diary and the key of the table-drawer in which it was kept. I have my own idea of the revelations that are still to come if this matter is properly followed up. Never mind going into that at present. Dexter (I tell you again) is answerable for the late Mrs. Eustace's death. How he is answerable I believe you are in a fair way of finding out.

40|$|To {{understand}} clinicians' {{impressions of}} and decision-making processes regarding an informatics-supported antibiotic timeout program to re-evaluate {{the appropriateness of}} continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. We implemented a multi-pronged informatics intervention, based on Dual Process Theory, to prompt discontinuation of unwarranted vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam on or after day three in a large Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Two workflow changes were introduced to facilitate cognitive deliberation about continuing antibiotics at day three: (1) teams completed an electronic template note, and (2) a paper summary of clinical and antibiotic-related information was provided to clinical teams. Shortly after starting the intervention, six focus groups were conducted with users or potential users. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Iterative thematic analysis identified recurrent themes from feedback. Themes that emerged are represented by the following quotations: (1) captures and controls attention ("it reminds us to think about it"), (2) enhances informed and deliberative reasoning ("it makes you think twice"), (3) redirects decision direction ("…because [there was no indication] I just [discontinued] it without even trying"), (4) fosters autonomy and improves team empowerment ("the template… forces the team to really discuss it"), and (5) limits use of emotion-based heuristics ("my clinical concern is high enough <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> more aggressive therapy…").

In central Malawi, for example, some groups of women have recently begun adding value to the wild, edible mushrooms that they collect in a nearby forest reserve. They have been helped by Meg Faville, a Peace Corps volunteer living in the area, who has encouraged the women to improve their handling and marketing of the mushrooms, building on their traditional knowledge. Patrick Mphaka recently traveled to Zithani village in Kasungu district to meet Meg, {{and to find out}} more about the progress the women have made. IN:		?I was trying to stress to the women ? OUT:		? about their newly acquired knowledge. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 16 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Patrick Mphaka was reporting from central Malawi. Transcript Faville	I was trying to stress to the women that it?s very important how you package and how you process your mushrooms to sell them in a way that is both sanitary and also in a way that is eye-catching. So what we did is I gave every woman some soap to wash her hands before then we did a short talk about how to keep things clean while you are handling mushrooms that will be sold to the public. And we also talked a bit about marketing and having a nice label that says ?From the Forest? (that we collected it from). That it was harvested by women and that they had formed this group to generate some income for their families. So, what we are doing is basically trying to empower the women to start their business and make it something that can be sustained in the future. Mphaka	Sustainability. The word we talk a lot about in development circles, but have so little, if any to show off about. A very difficult concept to achieve. Meg agrees, but is set to achieve it nevertheless. Faville	It?s a very difficult thing sustainability, and we use the word very often. But for myself, there are small ways that you can ensure sustainability that I am trying to do with the women here. First of all, it takes motivation and it takes knowledge. If these women had no idea how to find mushrooms or what mushrooms to find, then we would not have a business in the first place. So that traditional knowledge is there. So that is something they can pass on to their children, and their children can therefore sustain the business as far as maintaining that sense of knowledge and sense of guardianship towards the bush. Mphaka	One of the elements of sustainability, according to Meg, is to be able to know the measurements. How much, or how many, are you selling, and how much money will it fetch. Faville	That also ties into sustainability. We are using our creativity to create these packaged goods. For instance, the scale that we use to measure is the same scale that they measure the children every month for the early development, maintaining the weight every month, as you know. So what I do, as I alone did not measure those bags, but we made sure there was one woman in the group that knew very well how to measure. And she can in turn teach others in the future, or measure alone the next time. Mphaka	When you sit here in this village. You look around at what is happening, what do you think the outside world can do to help the people in the village so that in future, they can be self sufficient? Faville	I think that?s a problem actually is looking to the outside world instead of looking within. Women here are very strong, stronger than a lot of women that I have seen in America, and I think they have to recognize that within themselves, to see that they are not alone. And they also are not unable to be self reliant. They have the traditional knowledge, and they have the strength and the togetherness to make some very wonderful things accomplished here. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> someone may be from the outside like me to recognize that in them and try to empower them to be more self sufficient. Mphaka	Meg Faville, a Peace Corp volunteer resident in Zithani village in the outskirts of Chimaliro Forest in Kasungu district. Meanwhile, there are less unprocessed mushrooms for sale by the roadside in the area because the women have seen the value of processing their product. They are now happier and can sing praises about their newly acquired knowledge. (SFX - women?s song fades out). End of track.

40|$|Building on food {{security}} Cue: If small-scale farmers aren?t {{even able to}} grow enough food for their families, they certainly aren?t ready to think about cash crop production. All across Africa, millions of small farmers feel trapped in low productivity, with no way of improving either their {{food security}} or their livelihood. And for many farmers in Zambia, life {{in the last ten}} years has become more difficult not less; a succession of droughts combined with a government policy for economic liberalisation, have cut farm productivity among poorer farmers in particular. For Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition, known as ?Pam?, the challenge is greater than ever. This non-government organisation is now working closely with the Zambian government, through a variety of initiatives, to support small-scale farmers. The ?food security pack? scheme, for example, is currently distributing vital farming inputs, such as seed and fertilizer, to the most needy. But beyond that, the programme has also recognised the importance of farmers being able to get real economic benefits from any increase in their production. Daniel Sikazwe sent us this report on the work of the Programme Against Malnutrition in his home country, Zambia. IN:		?Ten years ago, Zambia ? OUT:		?value to food crops. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 44 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That report came from Daniel Sikazwe, and featured Mlotha Damaseke, manager of the food security pack scheme, for the Programme Against Malnutrition in Zambia. Transcript Sikazwe	Ten years ago, Zambia embarked on an ambitious liberalisation programme; subsidies in crucial areas like agriculture were removed. Some small-scale farmers found themselves out of business, while others persevered. In this programme we will try to establish what impacts liberalisation has had on small-scale farmers; how those who have continued with their farming activities have managed to stay alive in the midst of an uncertain food security situation. Mr. Mlotha Damaseke is the food security pack manager at the Programme Against Malnutrition, PAM, a non-governmental organisation that has been working with small-scale farmers over the years. What did liberalisation entail on small-scale farmers? Damaseke	The main problem is in terms of input supply. The country is quite big, the infrastructure for service delivery, is quite poor, and that left them very very vulnerable. Most of the people who are benefiting are large-scale farmers who are along the main trunk roads, but eighty percent of our producers, especially for staple foods, are small-scale farmers. This has had an adverse effect on the amount of food that is produced in the country. Sikazwe	I?ve come across a lot of small-scale farmers that have talked about working with the Programme Against Malnutrition, and that they have somehow managed to rise above the impacts of liberalisation. Can you just tell me what PAM has been doing with the small-scale farmers? Damaseke	Yes indeed. PAM was implementing a number of interventions, some of which are coming from government initiatives. For example the food security pack is targeting the small-scale farmers who have been left helpless by the liberalisation of the economy, and the droughts that have been persisting since 1991, and therefore we are assisting the farmers with inputs; so we are delivering inputs to small-scale farmers throughout the country, so that they can become productive once again, and maybe go into a commercial lending portfolio. Sikazwe	Well once you have delivered these inputs to the small-scale farmers, they produce, they need to have a market but then they are competing against heavily subsidised goods coming from South Africa, and probably some other countries. Are there any attempts by the Programme Against Malnutrition to try and help them get a market to try to rise above the challenges of liberalisation? Damaseke	In fact, as a way of addressing that problem, the programme has got a component, which is looking at management of excess produce. It?s called the cereal or seed bank component. This is a concept where communities themselves, come together; they make their own storage facilities. The aim to do that is: one, you have small-scale farmers coming at one point, putting in, each one brings whether it is one tin, or it?s one bag, or it?s ten bags, they get an inventory of each person who brings excess produce. And then they can decide when to sell. If they want to keep it for a longer period so that they can sell it when the price is right, for example during the start of the rainy season in January or February, then they sell the excess crop. So that is one way of enhancing the profitability of farming. Sikazwe	Well, there has been an argument that some small-scale farmers have been small-scale farmers for a long time; they need to graduate. And attempts that effect to make them graduate into, maybe not commercial farmers, but at least above small-scale farmers, through the aid or help that the Programme Against Malnutrition is giving to the small-scale farmers? Damaseke	Yes, the efforts are there. I think what is important is for people to realise is that before a person can feed himself or herself, there is no way that they will grow bigger. Firstly they must solve the first problem; the first problem is hunger in the house. If he solves the problem of hunger in the household, then he will think of having more. And therefore, efforts are being made to see that those who are able to feed themselves for one year, and have excess, maybe be linked to for example, the micro-bankers trust, who can lend them, on terms that they are able to pay back, and then become bigger farmers. So that is one initiative that the small-scale farmers must look for. They should not remain subsistence farmers. Sikazwe	Liberalisation has surely come to stay in Zambia. How do you look at the future of small-scale farmers? Damaseke	<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to take the initiative. The way the formation of co-operatives. If co-operatives are formed where people come together, they buy inputs together, that should be the way to go. Another way is contract cropping by out-grower schemes, that is another way to go. And also adding value to their crop; processing foods so that they don?t go to waste when they are in abundance. Whether it?s groundnuts; is it just roasting, or are you going to make peanut butter and things like that. So there is a component that is looking at adding value to food crops. End of track. The Food Security Pack manager with Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition explains how the programme is working to support small-scale farmers, and help them move from better food security towards commercial production...|$|E
40|$|Medicine, Alternative, Healing, IntegrativeMixing Medicine A {{new school}} of "integrative" health-care {{providers}} {{sets out to}} wed alternative treatments to mainstream medical practice. by Deborah Rudacille Since childhood, Wendy Lafferman, 27, has suffered from headaches. Diagnosed with migraines in high school, she has seen numerous doctors and swallowed a mountain of pills to combat pain so severe that "sometimes I'm literally digging my head into a pillow," she says. So when a friend of her mother raved about a neurologist in Pikesville who had assembled an unconventional team of practitioners-including a hypnotherapist, an acupuncturist, and a naturopath-to treat headache, Lafferman was not impressed. "I've been seeing doctors for fifteen years," she told her mom. "Nothing is going to help. " But at the Mid-Atlantic Headache Institute (MAHI), she found a neurologist, Marcia Ribeiro, who supported her use of alternative healing practices like acupuncture and cranio-facial massage while fine-tuning a pharmaceutical regimen aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of her headaches. "Dr. Ribeiro is willing to walk that path with me," Lafferman says. A few months after starting treatment at MAHI (and switching to a nutritionist-recommended diet free of gluten and sugar), {{she says she is}} doing much better. "This is the first time I've made it completely through a full week of work in months. " Lafferman's embrace of "integrative medicine," which links a range of alternative healing practices with traditional Western medicine, is shared by a steadily growing number of Americans. Approximately 38 percent of people over the age of 18 (and 12 percent of children) use some form of alternative or "complementary" medicine, according to a 2007 survey carried out by the National Center for Health Statistics. Use of non-vitamin, non-mineral natural products such as fish oil, flaxseed, and echinacea top the list; other therapies include deep breathing, meditation, and massage. From acupuncture to herbal supplements to yoga, alternative healing-typically dispensed out of people's homes, small offices, and clinics-is booming. But most American physicians are considerably less enthusiastic about these treatments than their patients. A kind of "don't ask, don't tell" policy rules-many doctors don't ask and patients don't tell them about their use of alternative healing methods not legitimized by science. "[Doctors] are not familiar with this, and yet nearly 50 percent of their patients are using alternative or complementary medicine," says Brian Berman, director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. "We need to make sure they know about them so they can refer appropriately. Whether or not they use the therapies themselves, they {{need to be able to}} work together in a larger team. " When Berman founded CIM-the first such center in an academic medical institution in the country-eighteen years ago, he and other proponents of integrating alternative therapies with Western medicine were on the far fringes of medical practice. Today, forty-five universities around the country have some kind of program in integrative medicine, combining research, teaching, and clinical practice in varying proportions. But the approach has been slower to penetrate the ranks of practitioners. "I would like to see it more widely adopted so that it's part and parcel of standard care," Berman says. "But there are still quite a few skeptics. " MAHI provides a glimpse of the kind of integrative medicine practice that Berman and other alt-med pioneers have long envisioned. The institute looks like a typical doctor's office, with a suite of examining rooms and offices. There are no trickling fountains or Chinese ideograms on the walls in the waiting room-just copies of WebMD and patient information brochures, industrial carpeting, and a receptionist's counter with glass windows and stacks of insurance forms. But some of the activities carried out here are revolutionary in such a setting. In one room, physical therapist Rupal Davé massages a patient's head, neck, and shoulders, easing the tension that can lead to headaches. Licensed clinical social worker Dale Liebman conducts hypnotherapy, helping patients manage stress via visualization. Cognitive psychologist H. Richard Waranch uses biofeedback and behavioral counseling. Acupuncturist and naturopathic physician Stacey Kargman checks for food allergies and recommends herbal supplements. "Other practices are largely driven by pharmacy," Liebman points out. "We take a more holistic approach. " MAHI was founded by Ribeiro and nurse practitioner Maureen Ann Moriarty in 2004. Both had worked in conventional medical practices for many years. But they wanted to do something different. Their experience at MAHI has shown that headache patients-"people sick of being sick"-were also looking for a different approach. Patients meet first with Ribeiro, and then she and Moriarty craft an individualized treatment plan for each patient that combines pharmacy with one or more of the other services provided at the clinic. "Sometimes it's a little bit of everything," Ribeiro says. The team treats not just the pain of the headache, but also the factors behind the pain-diet, stress, personal habits, and lifestyle. It's precisely that attention to the whole person that is touted by proponents of integrative medicine as an improvement on the traditional treat-the-symptom model, particularly when it comes to chronic pain. Berman says that when he founded CIM at the University of Maryland in 1991, "we started based on pain and pain management because that's one of the areas that we don't have all the answers for in conventional medicine. " Housed partly in an old mansion on the grounds of Kernan Hospital, a short drive from the Social Security Administration in Woodlawn, CIM has grown far beyond its modest roots. The center has received more than $ 30 million in research funding from the National Institutes of Health Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine since its founding and has been an NIH Center of Excellence since 1995. Integrative medicine is now part of the medical school curriculum at Maryland, and Berman's center has worked collaboratively with the Greenbaum Cancer Center, R. Adams Cowley Shock-Trauma Center, and other medical and surgical departments. Soon, it will be conducting research with the Institute for Genome Sciences. "I would never have expected that back in ' 91," Berman admits. Across town at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the integrative approach hasn't yet penetrated the curriculum or garnered as much institutional support. But even at that bastion of empiricism, some clinicians are exploring the use of complementary modalities and have formed a loose support network. Anastasia Rowland-Seymour, a Hopkins internist, was introduced to folk healing methods while a resident at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, where she also attended medical school. "My patients were largely Dominican," she says, "and there was a lot of use of teas and tinctures and other ways of healing that seemed to have some effect. I felt that in order to provide quality care, I should know a little about what people were using and whether it was safe to take with their other meds. " After completing her residency and working for a year and a half at Harlem Hospital, she did an integrative medicine fellowship with Dr. Andrew Weil, the godfather of the discipline. "I thought I was going to learn about nutrition and supplements, which I did," she says. "But I also got exposed to other types of healing that I hadn't known much about, like acupuncture and mind-body practices, and more esoteric things like energy healing and homeopathy. " Rowland-Seymour doesn't use all of those methods in her own practice. Some patients come to her specifically because she has been recommended as someone who uses an integrative approach, but about half "don't have a clue that I'm interested in integrative medicine," she says. "For all they know, I'm just a general internist. " Patients often hesitate to volunteer information about whether they are using alternative practices or supplements because they are apprehensive about the reactions of medical doctors-with good reason. Doctors rely on data, not anecdote, when treating patients. And it's precisely the lack of good data establishing the efficacy of alternative and complementary therapies that impedes their acceptance, critics say. Steven L. Salzberg, director of the University of Maryland's Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, maintains that there is no evidence to support the claims made by proponents of acupuncture, homeopathy, and other types of alternative healing. "It's pseudoscience and quackery," he says. Salzberg, a biostatistician who is a vocal advocate for open access to research data, has helped sequence the genes of hundreds of organisms, including human and avian influenza viruses and anthrax. For scientists like him, medicine is and ought to be based in rigorous science, with data that can be quantified and results that can be validated. Alternative and complementary treatments are conspicuously lacking in these essentials, he says-and the number of people who actually use them is far lower than proponents claim, because everything from drinking herbal tea to practicing yoga is included in surveys. "They include all kinds of common practices that people don't use instead of medicine. I have herbal tea in my kitchen," he says. But that doesn't make him a supporter of what he terms "non-medical, non-scientific" approaches to treating disease. Salzberg doesn't object to the wellness aspects of integrative medicine-controlling diet, exercising, and managing stress. He says doctors should and do regularly speak with patients about such preventive practices, which are "all good things with plenty of evidence to support them. " But he has strong words for medical schools that have begun offering fellowships in integrative medicine that include such practices as Reiki (a spiritual healing technique from Japan) and traditional Chinese medicine. "They are training reputable doctors in what is nothing more than voodoo," he says. Much of the improvement experienced by people who use such alternative therapies can be explained by the placebo effect, he adds. "If they are being treated for mild pain, which comes and goes, and they are seeing a therapist, they'll give them the credit. The only harm is to their wallet. " He is much harder on acupuncture, which is probably the most accepted alternative therapy but whose effectiveness is unsupported by data, he says. "Acupuncture, ayurveda, homeopathy-all of these things were made up in the premedical era, and people still cling to them despite the fact that whenever controlled studies are done, there is no evidence that they work at all. " And that has real-world consequences, he says. He points to a British study that revealed alternative practitioners recommending homeopathy as a substitute for vaccination for people preparing to travel in Africa. "Most of the stuff is harmless. Where it becomes harmful is when people who have real diseases use it as a substitute for medicine. " Rowland-Seymour, Ribeiro, and Berman all point out that herbs, yoga, and massage are not a replacement for medical treatment. "I don't want to give people the impression that just because they walk into my office and I know something about supplements that may be useful that I am going to tell them to use that instead of conventional remedies," says Rowland-Seymour. "That would be irresponsible. " Rowland-Seymour understands the skepticism from other physicians. Integrative medicine "is not well-accepted by many of my colleagues in part because there are concerns about what might be suggested to patients and what patients are doing already that physicians don't know about," she says. "Also, there are studies that are perfect in terms of methodology and there are studies that are very much less than perfect. That makes it very difficult to determine whether something has efficacy, whether it's really safe. So I completely understand the reticence. " But she and others like her are more willing than the average physician-and certainly more willing than scientists like Salzberg-to believe that practitioners other than medical doctors have a role to play in health care. Ribeiro, for example, works closely with naturopathic physician Stacey Kargman, who has a busy practice of her own, the Maryland Natural Health Center, a few miles from MAHI. Naturopaths promote the innate healing ability of the human body and rely on diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, and herbal supplements to combat disease and maintain health. In working with headache patients, Kargman examines their lifestyle and diet and does allergy testing for corn, wheat, and dairy. "If I find something, we'll do a trial for six to eight weeks, maybe stop eating wheat, for example," she says. "Often that does the trick. Just by eliminating or cutting down something in the diet you can eliminate or at least reduce the frequency of headache. " When she sees people with serious illnesses, however, she refers them to specialists. "I will send people to a cardiologist or neurologist if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> a more specific diagnosis or treatment," she says. The reason the collaboration with Ribeiro works, Kargman says, "is that we both support what the other is doing. We use the best of both worlds. " That, notes Berman, is the very definition of integrative medicine. "There's a lot of good in conventional medicine, and we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater," he says. "But we need other members of the team, like the acupuncturist, nutritionist, and maybe the yoga teacher. We shift the focus so that [health care] is not just about disease management but health and wellbeing across the life span. " The approach is especially effective in treating chronic disease, he and other practitioners point out. Unlike infectious disease, chronic disease is often created and exacerbated by diet and lifestyle-and that's particularly true of chronic pain. "Pain comes from a lot of different levels: emotional, mental, physical, and maybe even spiritual," Berman points out. "A lot of people are saying that we need a more multi-disciplinary approach to deal effectively with that. " The anecdotal evidence, at least, bears this out. Both Lafferman and Sharon Chafee, a patient of Kargman's who adopted a diet to treat her fibromyalgia (chronic muscle pain and fatigue), experienced significant improvement. Chaffee also dropped 30 pounds. "I'm 53 years old, and I've never felt this good," she says. Both women also say that when they slip up and eat a forbidden food, their symptoms return. "I did it for about a month and felt good, but then ate two chocolate cookies and I got so sick," Lafferman says. She was convinced her to stick to the diet. Weight loss can be quantified, but pain is subjective and difficult to measure. When improvement can be quantified and validated in a controlled study, skeptics may relinquish their doubts. "A good scientist wants to know the truth," Salzberg says. "If a treatment works and can be shown to work by scientifically valid studies, we call it medicine. " However, the history of medicine shows that radically new approaches often need time to be accepted, even when empirical evidence supports their efficacy. In 1847, when Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis ordered obstetricians at his Viennese clinic to wash their hands in chlorinated lime solution before attending women in labor, he was ridiculed. Even after the mortality rate from "childbed fever" fell from 18 percent to 4 percent at the clinic- and to nearly zero when instruments too were treated with the solution-his observational data were dismissed because he could not offer a scientific explanation for his findings. He was vindicated, of course, when germ theory was developed-about thirty years later. -Deborah Rudacille writes frequently about health and science. Buyer Beware Just because something is natural doesn't mean it's harmless. Herbal supplements and vitamins are not tested for potency, safety, or efficacy by the Food and Drug Administration-and many are little more than filler. "People bring in stuff they've bought cheaply," says naturopathic physician Stacey Kargman of the Maryland Natural Health Center, "and when you look at the ingredient label, it's mostly colors and dyes. " Some herbal preparations and vitamins can react with drugs. Johns Hopkins internist Anastasia Rowland-Seymour recommends developing a good relationship with a pharmacist if you plan on self-medicating with herbal remedies. "Pharmacists have access to great databases and can check if there are known interactions," she says. If you want to do research on your own, check out the data reviews in the Cochrane Collaboration (www. cochrane. org), an international clearinghouse for information on evidence-based medicine. In 2007, the National Institutes of Health granted a five-year, $ 2. 1 million research grant to the Cochrane's complementary and alternative medicine arm, based at the University of Maryland's Center for Integrative Medicine. Center director Brian Berman says the funding has helped gather and publish clinical trials of alternative therapies and conduct research to improve the methodology of literature reviews. "We've been working with people all over the world," he says. It's also important to check the credentials of alt-medicine providers. "Ask about licensing and whether or not they went to an accredited naturopathic program," Kargman says. She attended a naturopathic medicine program in Arizona, one of only four in the country, and is currently licensed by the state of Vermont. (Maryland does not license naturopathic physicians, though the state does license acupuncturists.) To find a licensed practicioner, go to www. naturopathic. org, the website of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. No matter which alternative practices you are using, your primary care doctor should know about it, says Rowland-Seymour. "Even if your physician doesn't have a huge knowledge base about integrative medicine, they need to know what you are doing. " -D. R...|$|E
