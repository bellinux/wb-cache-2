In the Courtauld-Sargent series the LPO played not only under Sargent but under many guests including Bruno Walter, George Szell, Fritz Busch and Igor Stravinsky.|$|E
5|$|Narayan became {{frustrated}} with his supporting role for vocalists {{and moved to}} Mumbai in 1949 to work independently in film music and recording. He recorded three solo 78rpm <b>gramophone</b> <b>records</b> for the British HMV Group in 1950 and an early ten-inch LP album in Mumbai in 1951, but the album was not in demand. The Mumbai film industry offered a good salary and obscurity for work that would have lowered his stature among classical musicians. For the next 15 years he played and composed songs for films, including Adalat, Gunga Jumna, Humdard, Kashmir Ki Kali, Madhumati, Milan, Mughal-e-Azam, and Noorjehan. He was considered a desired choice of film music director O. P. Nayyar.|$|E

5|$|J.R.R. Tolkien found {{inspiration}} in the Malvern landscape {{which he had}} viewed from his childhood home in Birmingham and his brother Hilary's home near Evesham. He {{was introduced to the}} area by C. S. Lewis, who had brought him here to meet George Sayer, the Head of English at Malvern College. Sayer had been a student of Lewis, and became his biographer, and together with them Tolkien would walk the Malvern Hills. Recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were made in Malvern in 1952, at the home of George Sayer. The recordings were later issued on long-playing <b>gramophone</b> <b>records.</b> In the liner notes for J.R.R Tolkien Reads and Sings his The Hobbit & The Fellowship of the Rings, George Sayer wrote that Tolkien would relive the book as they walked and compared parts of the Malvern Hills to the White Mountains of Gondor.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his <b>gramophone</b> <b>records.</b> The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E

25|$|A laser {{turntable}} is a phonograph {{that plays}} <b>gramophone</b> <b>records</b> using {{a laser beam}} as the pickup instead of a conventional diamond-tipped stylus.

The laser turntable was first conceived by Robert S. Reis, {{while working as a}} consultant of analog signal processing for the United States Air Force and the United States Department of Defense.|$|E

500|$|Ray thus had {{to borrow}} money to shoot enough footage to persuade {{prospective}} producers to finance the whole film. To raise funds, he continued {{to work as a}} graphic designer, pawned his life insurance policy and sold his collection of <b>gramophone</b> <b>records.</b> Production manager Anil Chowdhury convinced Ray's wife, Bijoya, to pawn her jewels. Ray still ran out of money partway through filming, which had to be suspended for nearly a year. Thereafter shooting was done only in intermittent bursts. Ray later admitted that the delays had made him tense and that three miracles saved the film: [...] "One, Apu's voice did not break. Two, Durga did not grow up. Three, Indir Thakrun did not die." ...|$|E

He also enlisted Swayze to sing the new song [...] "She's Like the Wind".

[...] The relationship has been characterised by Keeler as an unromantic relationship without expectations, a [...] "screw of convenience", although she also states that Profumo hoped for a longer-term commitment and that he offered to set her up in a flat. More than 20 years later, Profumo described Keeler in conversation with his son as someone who [...] "seem to like sexual intercourse", but who was [...] "completely uneducated", with no conversation beyond make-up, hair and <b>gramophone</b> <b>records.</b>|$|E

He always treated a rehearsal as a joint undertaking with the Orchestra.… The musicians were entirely unselfconscious with him. Instinctively they accorded him the artistic authority {{which he did not}} expressly claim. Thus he obtained the best from them and they gave it without reserve." ...|$|E

500|$|Parasakthi {{acquired}} cult {{status and}} changed the character of Tamil cinema. Dialogue writing was given more importance than ever before. Speeches of the film replaced traditional music of artists like M. S. Subbulakshmi, K. B. Sundarambal and others at festivities. The film also had its share in giving the DMK the necessary stimulus to overthrow the Congress party in Tamil Nadu. The dialogues became so popular that [...] "roadside entertainers used to recite long passages from the film in market area of Madras and collect money from bystanders", and memorising the film's dialogues became a [...] "must for aspirant political orators". They were even released separately on <b>gramophone</b> <b>records.</b> K. Hariharan, the director of L. V.

500|$|Armstrong and her {{colleague}} Ida C. Ward published {{their book}} Handbook of English Intonation in 1926. It {{was accompanied by}} three double-sided <b>gramophone</b> <b>records</b> which consisted of Armstrong and Ward reading English passages. These recordings appeared in bibliographies of speech and theatre training for decades. Armstrong and Ward analyzed all English intonation patterns as essentially consisting of just two [...] "Tunes": Tune 1 is typified by ending in a fall, and Tune 2 by ending in a rise. American linguist Kenneth Lee Pike called their analysis [...] "valuable" [...] for learners of English because it found commonalities in the various uses of rising contours and of falling contours. In 1943, Danish linguist [...] wrote [...] "there is fairly general agreement" [...] about the Tune 1 and Tune 2 classification; he also compares the Tune 1 and Tune 2 system of Handbook of English Intonation with the intonation classifications in An Outline of English Phonetics by Daniel Jones and English Intonation by Harold E. Palmer.|$|E

O'Rourke invited Glenn Kotche, a drummer who played in a similar musical style, to the practice session. Tweedy found lyrical inspiration from word exercises; for example, he picked out random words from a copy of TV Guide and formed abstract lines such as [...] "you boil hearts and discuss birds". He also sought to improve as a guitarist, taking influence from free jazz artists such as James [...] "Blood" [...] Ulmer.|$|E
