We designed that the Simplified <b>Fireproof</b> <b>Partition</b> Wall were composed 	of the steel frams and the special light steel plates and pearlite mortar. 	 2. We experimented with many tests as follow， that strength test， stiffness 	test， heating test， and impacting test， about the Simplifieded <b>Fireproof</b> 	<b>Partition</b> Wall Panels. 	The Results were summarized as follow. 	 1. The strength and stiffness of the Special Panels were sufficient. 	 2. We considered that composing of the Special Panels were easy， and its 	industrialzation plan seems possible. 	 3.

40|$|Our present paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} study on the Simplified <b>Fireproof</b> <b>Partition</b> Wall. 	We designed the Simplified Fireproof Patition Wall Panels and Fireproof Mortal Blocks 	as large as life size. 	Wee xperimented with several test as follow，composing test，stiffness test and strength test about the Simplified <b>Fireproof</b> <b>Partition</b> Wall Panels. 	The results were summarized as follow. 	 1. We considered that composing of the Special Panels were easy. 	 2. The conbination of steel frams and special panels well complied with relative displacement of buildings. 	As the result，we concluded that partition walls were useful component about MultiStories Buildings. 	 3. The stiffness and strength of the Special Panels were sufficient. 	 4. We obtained the result that Upper-Joint covered with Fireproof Mortal Blocks were 	firm against 2 hour's heating test...|$|E
50|$|On March 20, 1958 New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. {{asked for}} {{legislation}} to prevent fires {{like the one}} at 623 Broadway. Wagner and New York City Fire Commissioner Edward F. Cavanaugh both stated that the structure did not violate fire and building codes. Wagner called on the New York City Council to enact necessary ordinances quickly. Among those he suggested were the installation of automatic fire sprinkling systems, the building of <b>fireproof</b> <b>partitioning</b> walls in lengthy rooms, the construction of full ceilings in loft buildings,and making it mandatory that each worker be given a fire drill.|$|R
40|$|This study uses a {{metal stud}} <b>partition</b> <b>fireproof</b> drywall {{measuring}} 83 [*]mm in thickness {{as a test}} specimen to explore the impact of an embedded junction box on the firefighting performance of the wall through one time of standard fire test on a 300 [*]cm × 300 [*]cm area and five times of standard fire test on a 120 [*]cm × 120 [*]cm area. The {{results show that the}} quality of calcium silicate board plays a big role in the fireproof effectiveness. The embedded junction box located on the backside of the fire can reduce the effectiveness of the wall, especially the area above the socket. The thickness of rock wool may increase the performance, but in a limited rate. External junction box may not impact the fireproofing performance of the wall but it still possesses some safety risks. An embedded junction box measuring 101 × 55 [*]mm could already damage the fire compartment, and in reality there may be more complicated situations that should be noted and improved...|$|R
