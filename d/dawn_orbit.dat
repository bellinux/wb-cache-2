I had heard it in a dark street in Berlin in the 1920s. First it was a solo recital, then there were two voices; they belonged to a middle-sized man and a tall man, Otto Nebel and Kurt Schwitters. They were {{followed}} by a dozen friends, mainly artists. We all came from a party after a party, or from a cafe house after the opening of an exhibition, or was it a recital after a recital in the Sturm Gallery? I do not remember, but I still hear the noise in the dark street, both painter-poets without inhibition shouting, screaming, howling. There were puns and jokes with bitter meaning under the surface. Nebel recited fragments from this epic 'Zug-ins-Feld' - March-to-War - a true story of his own terrifying experience. He recited war-injured, mutilated sentences; sentences which were hit by gunfire and broken into words, single words of protest, bleeding into sounds."Nebel had become a poet and a painter during four years of military war duty plus 14 months in an English prisoner-of-war camp. His successful career as an architect and architectural engineer had been bluntly interrupted. However, the stream of his imagination and his urge to create could not be stopped. Restricted in movement by military duties, he was under continuous pressure. The steam of his protest had to find an outlet in words and pictorial forms. Immediately after his return from war, Nebel joined Herwarth Walden's avant-garde group 'Der Sturm'. From that time he collaborated on the journal Der Sturm, exhibited in the Sturm Gallery and performed at the Sturm recitals. Kurt Schwitters joined the group about the same time. That night, in the Berlin side-street, Nebel's fiery, meaningful words and Schwitters' deliberately non-sensical words and sounds exploded like fireworks. We were lucky that no policeman interfered. Both Schwitters and Nebel were used to loud and emphatic talk at the performances in the Sturm Gallery. These recitals were not soft-spoken. Schwitters, Nebel and the other performers had to keep up with Rudolph Bluemner, the great master of the spoken word, who had abandoned the stage in order to join Herwarth Walden as writer, critic and performer at the Sturm. The Sturm-wind in the Potsdamerstrasse actually became a hurricane, ravaging syntax and grammar, atomizing sentences. Subjects and predicates with their appended clauses exploded in the air, the most radical over Zurich in 1916, when Hugo Ball recited poems of mere syllables without meaning, assembled from the debris of words for their mere sound value. Destructive tendencies, as it appeared to the public? Or, as Gertrude Stein later explained her own disconnected language: '... Breaking the paragraph down and everything down to commence again with not connecting with the daily anything and really to choose something.'"Nebel chose the expressive power of the word; rhythm and meaning combined in staccato sentences, in fragments of dialogue, evoking situations but not describing. Words that hit and words laid open the decay under well-masked appearances. The [...] "Zug-ins-Feld" [...] epic appeared in many continuations in the Sturm of 1920-1921. At the time of the recitals in the Sturm Gallery the walls trembled under explosions of anger and protest. The Sturm artists believed in their go; they were moralists within their own laws of morality. They condemned the bloody mass-murder of war, but with their pens, their brushes and their voices they killed armies of writers, artists, critics of other artistic and philosophical creeds. They attacked hypocrisy and compromise; they preferred to disturb and to frighten their audience more than to please it. That this happened in the halls of an art gallery was not accidental. The search for a new art of the world was to a great extent carried by painter-poets and painter-musicians. Arnold Schoenberg at that time was a painter of the Sturm movement."Nebel is hardly known in the United States. He was not at all known to the West Coasts before the exhibition of s small selection of this paintings in the Raboff Gallery. Ernest Raboff had discovered them in the Simone Heller Gallery in Paris, and was fascinated by the beauty and harmony in the thematic wealth of abstract composition and by the elaborate execution. In fact they evoked a harmonic music of the spheres rather than the fortissimo of Nebel's voice of protest in Berlin in the 1920s."Nebel is a classic to the abstract movement in painting. Immediately after his return from the war he joined Kandinsky, Klee and Schwitters in their concept of art. They remained lifelong friends. One cannot deny that some of Nebel's paintings have a family likeness to Klee and Kandinsky, but in the way Gris' and Braque's cubist paintings have a family likeness to those of Picasso of the same period. This is caused by the same spiritual concept, certainly not by dependence or imitation. Nebel, like Klee and Schwitters, limits himself to small formats in contrast to the giant formats of the present-day American school. On his small surface, varying in airy colors as the sky at sunset or <b>dawn,</b> <b>orbit</b> clearly defined shapes or bodies, circles, rods, squares and star-like balls and quick-moving serpentine lines. All sorts of constellations seem to move in controlled order. Other paintings give the feeling of stability by the equilibrium of geometrical forms. There is nothing accidental, no painterly blur. Nebel is neither a spontaneous action painter, nor a primitive. He knows his craft, based upon a sound knowledge of color theories. One painting has areas of grey which receive a noble quality from the optical division of color. Small regular dots of complementary colors, placed side by side, according to Seurat's principle, mix in the spectator's eye to the fine grey of clouds, non-figurative, words into forms."The precise brushstroke, the jewel-like finish of each dot, line and form caused some critics to classify Nebel as a mere craftsman, a jeweller or enamel artist stepping out into painting. But for Nebel, as for Kandinsky and Klee, art is the visible expression of spiritual concepts. Each work of art, says Nebel, is an image of the artist's mental development and transformation. The most elaborate craftsmanship is just good enough to give shape to inspired and enlightened vision. Means and mediums should be used in harmony with the creative process."They are precious and almost sacred as they have to make a revelation visible. The artist must combine visual ability with intelligence of interpretation. Nebel expresses his idealistic philosophy of art in dithyrambic sentences, which defy direct literary translation, in a book with 24 reproductions of his paintings, drawings and prints: [...] "Worte zu Bildern" [...] (Words to Images). (Six of these pictures are among 100 works in the possession of the Guggenheim Museum in New York; S. H. Guggenheim was a sponsor of Nebel through many hard years). Out of the expressionist free form of his postwar epic he progressed to rigorous studies of language to intensify his medium. The result was introduction of musical form of the Fugue into poetry."Nebel {{was not the only one}} who used forms in his literary work; James Joyce, also early in the 20th century, experimented with musical forms in his [...] "Ulysses", e.g., in the episode of the Sirens, where he made a rather free use of the fugue. His intellectual variations of words depend on most complex associations. His boundless growth of linguistic flowers has its roots in the swamp of our civilization. Nebel searched for, and found, an archetype of expression in a so-far-undiscovered world of forms. Nebel's Fugues are unique through a self-imposed discipline. In order to intensify the power of the word he concentrated on words composed of 9 letters of the alphabet only for his first Fugue, [...] "Unfeig" [...] (Brave) and of 12 letters for the second Fugue, [...] "Das Rad der Titanen" [...] (The Wheel of the Titans). He explains this attempt to counteract the lack of expression in the outworn language of our time."Unfeig Oblong Format standing like trees. To associate Nebel's return to runic characters with romantic, Wagnerian, or worse, Hitlerian, Teutonism would be a misunderstanding of his purpose, the search of simplicity. There is more and deeper affinity to pictorial values in his literary work. Nebel designed the book [...] "Unfeig" [...] in an oblong format. The poems stand like tress, upright. As a painter he transposes the letters into small colored squares on the last folding leaf of his book. Nebel at the completion of his 70th year looks back upon an oeuvre of 7000 leaves of drawings and series of drawings, 2000 painted and graphic leaves, 200 paintings, many unpublished books and writings, several printed books. (Forthcoming is [...] "Die Goldene Spur", The Golden Track, Arcade Press.) At the present time, another book is forthcoming, small of format, but great significance. It is the Fugue of 12 runic characters, [...] "das Rad der Titanen" [...] (The Wheel of the Titans). Twelve letters of the alphabet have the power to roll a gigantic wheel of meaning over a new world in gestation."'The myth of creation in the 20th century', in the words of Lothar Schreyer, 'not a repetition of old myths, but Ur-Bilder, prime images, shaped by the impact of the 20th century'." ...|$|E

At this time, Dawn has completed its science campaign at Vesta and is currently on its journey to Ceres, where it will arrive in mid- 2015. The spacecraft spent over a year in orbit around Vesta from July 2011 through August 2012, capturing science data during four dedicated orbit phases. In order to maintain the reference orbits necessary for science and enable the transfers between those orbits, precise and timely orbit determination was required. The constraints associated with low-thrust ion propulsion coupled with the relatively unknown a priori gravity and rotation models for Vesta presented unique challenges for the <b>Dawn</b> <b>orbit</b> determination team.

40|$|The aim of Dawn {{mission is}} the {{acquisition}} of data from orbits around two bodies, (4) Vesta and (1) Ceres, the two most massive asteroids. Due to the low thrust propulsion, Dawn will slowly cross and transit through ground-track resonances, where the perturbations on <b>Dawn</b> <b>orbit</b> may be significant. In this context, to safety go the Dawn mission from the approach orbit to the lowest science orbit, {{it is essential to}} know the properties of the crossed resonances. This paper analytically investigates the properties of the major ground-track resonances (1 : 1, 1 : 2, 2 : 3 and 3 : 2) appearing for Vesta orbiters: location of the equilibria, aperture of the resonances and period at the stable equilibria. We develop a general method using an averaged Hamiltonian formulation with a spherical harmonic approximation of the gravity field. If the values of the gravity field coefficient change, our method stays correct and applicable. We also discuss the effect of one uncertainty on the C 20 and C 22 coefficients on the properties of the 1 : 1 resonance. These results are checked by numerical tests. We determine that the increase of the eccentricity appearing in the 2 : 3 resonance is due to the C 22 and S 22 coefficients. Our method can be easily adapted to missions similar to Dawn because, contrarily to the numerical results, the analytical formalism stays the same and is valid {{for a wide range of}} physical parameters of the asteroid (namely the shape and the mass) as well as for different spacecraft orbits. Finally we numerically study the probability of the capture in resonance 1 : 1. Our paper reproduces, explains and supplements the results of Tricarico and Sykes (2010).

40|$|Introduction: NASAâs Dawn {{spacecraft}} orbited {{the dwarf}} planet Ceres from August to October 2015 in HAMO (High Altitude Mapping Orbit) with {{an altitude of}} about 1, 500 km to characterize, among others, the geology, topography, and shape of Ceres. Data: The Dawn mission {{is equipped with a}} framing camera (FC) which has one broad band clear filter and seven narrow band color filters. The FC took about 4300 color filter images in HAMO with a resolution of about 140 m/pixel. Data Processing: The first steps of the processing chain towards the mosaics are: radiometric calibration and photometric correction of the images followed by ortho-rectification to the proper scale and map projection type. These steps require detailed information of the <b>Dawn</b> <b>orbit,</b> the orientation of the spacecraft, and of the topography of the target. Both, improved orientation and a high-resolution shape model, are provided by the stereo processing of the HAMO clear filter dataset. Ceres' HAMO shape model is used for the calculation of the ray intersection points and the orientation of the surface normals, while the map projection itself is done onto a reference sphere for Ceres. The final step is the controlled mosaicking of all color images to seven global mosaics of Ceres. True color: True color was achieved by scaling FC images acquired through the red, green, and blue filters (effective wavelength 653, 555, and 438 nm) to RGB values calculated from the CIE color matching functions and a Ceres reflectance spectrum. Color ratios: Color ratio image mosaics were calculated using the images of four different narrow band filters; Red channel: 965 / 749 nanometers (nm); Green channel: 555 / 749 nm; Blue channel: 438 / 749 nm. The color ratio image serves to cancel out the dominant brightness variations of the scene (caused by albedo variations and topographic shading) and enhances color differences related to soil mineralogy and, possibly, maturity. Download: All color mosaics will become available to the public through the Small Bodies Node of the Planetary Data System (PDS) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{anticipation}} of the Dawn Mission to 4 Vesta, we conducted a ground-based campaign of Bessel BVRI filter photometry of five V-type near-Earth asteroids {{over a wide range}} of solar phase angles. We also obtained medium-resolution optical spectroscopy (0. 38 Î¼m < Î» < 0. 92 Î¼m; R â¼ 500) of sixteen near-Earth and main-belt V-type asteroids in order to investigate their spectral diversity and to draw connections between spacecraft data of Vesta and V-type asteroids. Our disk-integrated photometry extended the excursion in solar phase angle beyond the maximum of 24 Â° available from Earth for Vesta to 87 Â°, which is more typical of the geometry during the Dawn approach and mapping phases. The majority of our broad-band observations were obtained at the JPL 0. 6 -m Table Mountain Observatory but multiple nights were also contributed by the Calar Alto 1. 2 -m and 2. 2 -m telescopes, {{as well as by the}} Purple Mountain 1 -m Schmidt. Our results include a determination of rotation periods for 4 asteroids, identification of a binary candidate and four new V-type asteroids, including a confirmation of two main-belt V-type asteroids beyond the Jupiter 1 : 3 resonance (Cruikshank, D. P., Tholen, D. J., Bell, J. F., Hartmann, W. K., Brown, R. H. [1991]. Icarus 89, 1 â 13; Lazzaro, D. et al. [2000]. Science 288, 2033 â 2035; Roig, F., Gil-Hutton, R. [2006]. Icarus 183 (2), 411 â 419; Moskovitz, N. A., Jedicke, R., Gaidos, E., Willman, M., NesvornÃ½, D., Fevig, R., IveziÄ, Å½. [2008]. Icarus 198, 77 â 90). This latter finding supports the hypothesis that some vestoids may be crustal fragments of a disrupted basaltic parent body compositionally similar to 4 Vesta. We also obtained rotationally resolved medium resolution spectra of Vesta during the <b>Dawn</b> <b>orbit</b> insertion phase, which will be valuable for calibration and comparison of spacecraft data. Modeling of a composite V-type asteroid phase curve yielded a generic photometric model for V asteroids. We also find that a significant amount of the spectral diversity in the V class comes from changes in solar phase angle. A fit of a composite solar phase curve containing our vestoid observations, previously published groundbased observations of Vesta, and early disk-integrated Dawn observations show important differences with other asteroids. The macroscopic surface roughness of V-type asteroids is significantly larger than that of C-type or S-types (Helfenstein, P., Veverka, J. [1989]. Physical characterization of asteroid surfaces from photometric analysis. In: Binzel, R., Gehrels, T., Matthews, M. S. (Eds.), Asteroids II. University of Arizona Press, Tucson, pp. 557 â 593). This result is consistent with radar studies showing that igneous rocky asteroids â the E and V types â exhibit the largest surface roughness (Benner, L. et al. [2008]. Icarus 198, 294 â 304). The effects of what appears to be space weathering can be largely explained by phase reddening in our collection of V-type NEOs, but our finding that smaller vestoids, which have shorter lifetimes, are more similar to Vesta suggests that some type of alteration of the surface through time occurs. Our observations confirm that the south polar region of Vesta has a more diogenitic composition than its equatorial regions. The south pole, which is dominated by a large impact feature, thus may offer a view into the interior of Vesta. We derive a visible phase integral of 0. 44 Â± 0. 02 and a corresponding Bond albedo of 0. 15 Â± 0. 03 from our composite V-type asteroid solar phase curve...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dawn</b> {{spacecraft}} <b>orbited</b> Vesta {{for more}} than one year and collected a huge volume of multispectral, high-resolution data in the visible wavelengths with the Framing Camera. We present a detailed disk-integrated and disk-resolved photometric analysis using the Framing Camera images with the Minnaert model and the Hapke model, and report our results about the global photometric properties of Vesta. The photometric properties of Vesta show weak or no dependence on wavelengths, except for the albedo. At 554 nm, the global average geometric albedo of Vesta is 0. 38 Â± 0. 04, and the Bond albedo range is 0. 20 Â± 0. 02. The bolometric Bond albedo is 0. 18 Â± 0. 01. The phase function of Vesta is similar to those of S-type asteroids. Vestaâs surface shows a single-peaked albedo distribution with a full-widthhalf-max 17...|$|R
