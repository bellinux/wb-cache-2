5000|$|The unit of {{currency}} under the Empire (and until 1942) {{was the real}} ("royal"), plural réis, a name derived from the Portuguese real. It was usually called milréis (English: thousand royals), being written as 1$000. [...] "A thousand milréis (1:000$000) was known as conto de réis." [...] One conto de réis was represented by the symbol Rs written before the value and by a dollar sign separating the units group (lower than 1,000 réis). Thus, 350 réis was written as [...] "Rs 350"; 1,712 réis as [...] "Rs 1$712"; and 1,020,800 réis was written as [...] "Rs 1:020$800". This means that the colon functioned as the millions comma and the $ sign as the thousands comma; the colon is the actual <b>group</b> <b>separator,</b> and the $ sign is used only for separating the smaller group of units.|$|E

30|$|Instability of flow has {{occurred}} in three wells of Mutnovskoe field. Those are Wells 4 -E, A- 2 and A- 3. The steam–water mixture from the wells arrives in plant’s <b>group</b> <b>separator.</b> The wells are located close to the plant; pipelines of steam–water mixture have a large diameter and minimum hydraulic resistance, i.e., the pressure in the wellhead, in practice, is determined by pressure in the separator. The pipelines have plots, including vertical, with a very large diameter that does not satisfy the condition of stable operation (Shulyupin 2007). In these pipelines, the pressure drop can be increased by reducing the flow rate. This reaction of the pipeline is the destabilizing factor for the system. A simple throttle of flow by wellhead valve has stabilized the operation of Wells 4 -E and A- 3. Pressure drop in the valves was about 2  bars. Well A- 2 was operating at a low maximum pressure that {{is not allowed to}} apply throttling.|$|E

Various INFILE and INPUT options are illustrated in the process, and some related functions are considered. The input file is the output of a COBOL program pulling data from a DB 2 database which is then brought to the PC via FTP. Each record contains 6 types of information, called segments, for a person. The segments and the fields within are divided by unprintable hexadecimal codes, which SAS represents with notations like the hexadecimal numbers 1 E (Segment separator) and 1 C (Field separator) respectively. A further complication {{is the use of}} 1 D which is the <b>group</b> <b>separator</b> to separate repeating segments. There are also groups of repeating fields within a segment. Since the fields do not have a fixed length and they may be missing on some records, there is no fixed record layout for the file. Although the program was written for the PC, the technique is applicable for any system. All the tools discussed are in BASE SAS ®.

30|$|This paper {{investigated}} the asymptotic performance of QDF on skewed training data for three populations (π _i,i= 1, 2, 3) with increasing group centroid (δ), with chosen variables and sample size ratios.

Other results also indicates that, the QDF performs better under an equal sample size ratio (1 : 1 : 1) resulting in a reduced misclassification rate with minimized error rates. The <b>group</b> centroid <b>separators</b> increased with decreasing group error rates and sample sizes. In other words, the QDF performed better in classifying the observations into their respective groups when the <b>group</b> centroid <b>separators</b> were increased.

5000|$|The {{convention}} for digit <b>group</b> <b>separators</b> historically varied among countries, {{but usually}} seeking {{to distinguish the}} delimiter from the decimal mark. Traditionally, English-speaking countries employed commas as the delimiter [...] - [...] 10,000 [...] - [...] and other European countries employed periods or spaces: 10.000 or [...] Because of the confusion {{that could result in}} international documents, in recent years the use of spaces as separators has been advocated by the superseded SI/ISO 31-0 standard, {{as well as by the}} International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, which have also begun advocating the use of a [...] "thin space" [...] in [...] "groups of three". Within the United States, the American Medical Association's widely followed AMA Manual of Style also calls for a thin space. In some online encoding environments (for example, ASCII-only) a thin space is not practical or available, in which case a regular word space or no delimiter are the alternatives. In 2014, the Metrication Board also proposed the system of using a space for separation in the United Kingdom and, while it is not universally adopted, it is standard within the country's construction industry.|$|R

30|$|Discriminant {{analysis}} {{is used in}} situations where the clusters are known a priori. The main aim of discriminant {{analysis is}} to classify an observation, or several observations, into these known groups (Härdle and Simar 2007). The problem of multiple group discrimination under normality and non-normality {{for a long time}} has posed a challenge to researches and several attempts have been made at deriving parsimonious rules that address this hurdle (Asamoah-Boaheng et al. 2014). This study evaluates the asymptotic performance of a three qroup quadratic discriminant function (QDF) under non-normal distribution with varying degrees of sample sizes, varying variable selections and under increasing <b>group</b> centroid <b>separators.</b>|$|R
30|$|The study {{focussed}} on the asymptotic {{performance of}} the QDF under correlated and uncorrelated normally distributed training samples. Under this distribution, the {{performance of the}} QDF under varying sampling ratios, selected number of variables and different <b>group</b> centroid <b>separators</b> were extensively studied. The QDF recorded minimum misclassification error rates and high variability as the sample size increased asymptotically under correlated normal distribution, thereby increasing the accuracy of classification of observations with the function. The performance of the QDF deteriorated when the sample size ratio was 1 : 2 : 3 as δ increased with increasing sample size. However, {{the performance of the}} function was appreciably good under both correlated and uncorrelated normal distributions when their estimated average misclassification error rate decreased with increasing number of variables (from 4 to 8). This results shows some partial conformity with the study of Lawoko (1988) where the researcher found that the efficiency of the QDF and other classifiers are generally lowered by positively correlated training observations. Generally, the study found that, the QDF performed better resulting in the reduction in misclassification error rates as <b>group</b> centroid <b>separator</b> increases with non increasing sample size and under correlated training samples. This results therefore shows some partial conformity with the studies by Marks in 1974. Marks approached the problem of discrimination by comparing the performance of QDF with other classifiers. Although he considered only two populations, the QDF performance was abysmal under small sample size selection when covariance matrices were nearly equal with large dimensions.|$|R

30|$|Generally, {{the study}} found that, {{there is always a}} {{pronouncement}} in the reduction of misclassification error rates as the <b>group</b> centroid <b>separator</b> increases as compared to an increasing sample size ratios. The results obtained from this study (skewed distribution) shows some conformity with Lachenbruch et al. (1977). Lachenbruch et al. (1977) generated random samples through simulations under non-normal distribution. Johnson’s system of transformation was used to transform the generated random samples into components by components. After the transformation, the QDF was derived and its performance was evaluated by the estimated mean error rates, standard deviation and sample variability. From their study the QDF recorded very high and increasing error rates, standard deviation under non-normality compared with the performance of the function under normally distributed data/training samples. In other words, they discovered that the QDF under non normal samples generally performs quite poorly as compared to when their performance are evaluated under normal distribution.|$|R

Visual design issues are raised in many domains of human activity such as user interface design, documentation development, presentation design, and graphic layout. This chapter describes techniques coming from traditional visual design and discusses them in the context of user interface design. When the designer sketches the components of a user interface, she or he first selects appropriate interaction and interactive objects according to the user’s task (Vanderdonckt & Bodart, 1993). The second activity is to determine the basic layout of these selected objects ranging from the most important to the least important: the main application window, the title and menu bars, the functional areas of the application window (e. g., a status bar, a toolbar), all child windows, dialog boxes and panels with their contents.

Results: Subgroup of immunocytes and absolute value in combined chemotherapy group were evidently higher than in single chemotherapy group, but {{there was no significant difference}} in Karnofsky score. In addition, combined chemotherapy group was apparently higher after treatment than treatment before and single chemotherapy group in the results of perforin, granular enzyme B (GranB) and CD 107 a in PBMC.
