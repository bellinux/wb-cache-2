5000|$|Due to its {{isolation}} and scenic appeal, Lakshadweep was already {{known as a}} tourist attraction for Indians since 1974. This brings in significant revenue, {{which is likely to}} increase. Since such a small region cannot support industries, the government is actively promoting tourism as a means of income in Bangaram and Kadmat islands. Bangaram is projected to become a major destination for international tourism. [...] Marine fauna are plentiful. Water sports activities such as scuba <b>diving,</b> <b>wind</b> surfing, snorkelling, surfing, kayaking, canoeing, water skiing, sportfishing, yachting and night sea voyages are popular activities among tourists. Tourists flock to these islands throughout the year, except during the South-west monsoon months when seas are extremely rough. The government has also proposed to set up two customs clearance check-in offices so that tourists can enter directly instead of getting permission from the nearest customs office in Kochi, which is [...] from these islands. These will be the smallest customs offices in India. Tourism is expected to get a big boost after these offices open as the islands lie on one of the busiest cruise ways.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to design, develop, and {{administer}} a recreation interest survey to examine the distribution of summer school graduate students' participation levels in selected physical recreation activities. The instrument used to examine the distribution of summer school graduate students' participation levels in selected physical recreation activities was a researcher-developed survey. Subjects consisted of 105 University of Wisconsin-La Crosse summer school graduate students. Responses to each survey item were tabulated and percentages calculated. Results indicated the ten most regularly participated physical recreation activities were walking/jogging, swimming, biking, golfing, dancing, hiking, boating, fishing, volleyball, and weight training. The results also indicated that the ten activities with the highest percentage of graduate students never participating were hang gliding, sky diving, aikido, karate, lacrosse, caving/spelunking, mountaineering, scuba <b>diving,</b> <b>wind</b> surfing, and hackey sack...|$|E

5000|$|The Boscombe Surf Reef was {{the first}} surfing reef to be {{constructed}} in the Northern Hemisphere. Boscombe, a district of Bournemouth, opted to build a surfing reef to provide a unique focal point for the town's multi-million pound waterfront redevelopment effort. [...] “The reef will give Boscombe beach its own identity, raise the profile of Boscombe and attract {{a large number of}} visitors on an annual basis.” Bournemouth Borough Council, July 2006 [...] In April 2014, after being closed since March 2011, the council re-branded the reef as a coastal activity park concentrating on <b>diving</b> and <b>wind</b> surfing, as well as kite and wind surfing.|$|R
500|$|In some species, for example, either remiges or rectrices {{make a sound}} during flight. [...] These {{sounds are}} most often {{associated}} with courtship or territorial displays. The outer primaries of male broad-tailed hummingbirds produce a distinctive high-pitched trill, both in direct flight and in power-dives during courtship displays; this trill is diminished when the outer primaries are worn, and absent when those feathers have been moulted. [...] During the northern lapwing's zigzagging display flight, the bird's outer primaries produce a humming sound. [...] The outer primaries of the male American woodcock are shorter and slightly narrower {{than those of the}} female, and are likely the source of the whistling and twittering sounds made during his courtship display flights. [...] Male club-winged manakins use modified secondaries to make a clear trilling courtship call. [...] A curve-tipped secondary on each wing is dragged against an adjacent ridged secondary at high speeds (as many as 110 times per second—slightly faster than a hummingbird's wingbeat) to create a stridulation much like that produced by some insects. Both Wilson's and common snipe have modified outer tail feathers which make noise when they are spread during the birds' roller coaster display flights; as the bird <b>dives,</b> <b>wind</b> flows through the modified feathers and creates a series of rising and falling notes, which is known as [...] "winnowing". [...] Differences between the sounds produced by these two former conspecific subspecies—and the fact that the outer two pairs of rectrices in Wilson's snipe are modified, while only the single outermost pair are modified in common snipe—were among the characteristics used to justify their splitting into two distinct and separate species.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{radio-controlled}} gliding awoke {{to the idea}} of dynamic soaring (a [...] "discovery" [...] largely credited to RC soaring luminary Joe Wurts). Radio-controlled glider pilots perform dynamic soaring using the leeward side of ground features such as ridges and saddles. If the ridge faces the wind, and has a steep back (leeward) side, it can cause flow separation {{off the top of the}} hill, resulting in a layer of fast air moving over the top of a volume of stagnant or reverse-flow air behind the hill. The velocity gradient, or wind shear, can be much greater than those used by birds or full scale sailplanes. The higher gradient allows for correspondingly greater energy extraction, resulting in much higher speeds for the aircraft. Models repeatedly cross the shear layer by flying in a circular path, penetrating a fast-moving headwind after flying up the back side, turning to fly with the <b>wind,</b> <b>diving</b> down through the shear layer into the stagnant air, and turning again to fly back up the back side of the hill. The loads caused by rapid turning at high speed (the fastest models can pull up to 100 Gs) require significant structural reinforcement in the fuselage and wing. Because of this, dynamic soaring models are commonly built using composite materials.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Flying Corps was {{initially}} {{impressed with the}} potential of the dive bomber, but was aware of its suicidal nature. It ran a series of tests at the Armament Experimental station at Orfordness in Suffolk. Sopwith Camels and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5as were used in early 1918 to dive bomb targets from various heights, with different bombs and with and without the use of the Aldis gunsight, which had been invented in 1916 to aid pilots to calculate the deflection required to hit a traversing German plane. In principle, it obviated the need for a vertical dive. The results showed that a vertical <b>dive</b> into the <b>wind</b> sighting along the top of rather than through the sight was best. But they were not considered good enough to justify the expected casualties. The Royal Air Force, which took over both army and naval aviation in April 1918, retired its Sopwith Salamander dive bombers {{at the end of the}} war. Colonel, later General, Billy Mitchell arrived in France with the first US Army and Air Force units soon after 6 April 1917 and began to organize the US Army Air Force flying French Salmson 2s, a spotter plane. The later Salmson 4 was to be a ground attack and dive bomber, but production was cancelled at the end of the war. Mitchell became a strong advocate of dive bombers after witnessing British and French aerial attacks. Mitchell by now assistant chief of the Air Service United States Army arranged tests with captured German and obsolete US ships in June and July 1921 and repeated over the next two years using Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5as as dive bombers and Handley Page O/400s and Martin NBS-1s as level bombers carrying bombs of different weights up to 2000 lb. The SMS Ostfriesland was sunk and so later were the USS Alabama, USS Virginia and USS New Jersey.|$|R
40|$|Aims. To better {{understand}} the phenomenon of colliding winds in massive binary stars, we study the X-ray lightcurve of a WR+O system of the Carina region, a system well known for the high mass of its primary. Methods: Phase-resolved X-ray observations of the massive WR+O binary system WR 22 were performed with the XMM-Newton facility. We observed the object at seven different phases from near apastron to near periastron. Results: The X-ray spectrum can be represented by a two-component, optically thin, thermal plasma model with a first one at a typical temperature of 0. 6 keV and a second hotter one in the range 2. 0 - 4. 5 keV. The hot component is indicative of a colliding wind phenomenon, but its flux is remarkably constant with time despite the high eccentricity of the orbit. Although surprising at first, this actually does not contradict {{the results of the}} hydrodynamical simulations of the wind collision that we performed. When the system goes from apastron to periastron, the soft part of the X-ray flux is progressively lowered by an increasing intervening absorbing column. This behaviour can be interpreted in terms of an X-ray emitting plasma located near the O star, but not fully intrinsic to it, and accompanying the star when it <b>dives</b> into the <b>wind</b> of the WR component. A model is presented that interprets most of the observational constraints. This model suggests that the mass-loss rate of dot{M}[SUB]WR[/SUB] 1. 6 Ã 10 [SUP]- 5 [/SUP] {M}[SUB]È¯[/SUB] yr[SUP]- 1 [/SUP] assumed for the WR could still be slightly too high, whereas it is already lower than other published values. From the comparison of the observed and the expected absorptions at phases near periastron, we deduce that the hard X-ray emitting collision zone should at least have a typical size of 50 - 60 R[SUB]È¯[/SUB], but that the size for the soft X-ray emitting region could reach 244 R[SUB]È¯[/SUB] if the assumed mass-loss rate is correct. We also present an upper limit to the X-ray luminosity of the WR component that further questions the existence of intrinsic X-ray emission from single WN stars.

40|$|Along its Red Sea coast Eritrea {{possesses}} {{not less}} than 350 Islands. Dahlak Kebir, the largest of all is located approximately 50 kms {{off the coast of}} Massawa, the busiest port of Eritrea. Topographically, relatively low relief limestone encircled by clean waters, abundant coral reefs and bountiful of fish species are the dominant features of the Islands. Nevertheless, their rich resources are so far not harnessed. They are inhabited by small fishing communities. One could only witness a small hotel and few houses scattered here and there, except for the presence of a military base on both Dahlak Kebir and in the near by Nakura Islands. The archaeological site of the Necropolis, a large early Islamic cemetery, and nearby ancient cisterns and pre Islamic cemetery, lies on the southwestern side of the Island. The story of Dahlak and its ruins are clear testimony that the archipelago has a mine of very rich history that needs to be explored. In the 7 th century, for instance, it was through these Islands that the Islamism has infiltrated and eventually penetrated deep into various parts of Eritrea and Ethiopia. In between the beginning of the 8 th and mid- 9 th century, the archipelago was conquered and occupied by various external powers such as the Byzantine Empire. In the 13 th century, during the period of internal uprising in the Arab world, Dahlak established its own autonomous Sultanate. In latter years, Portuguese and Ottoman Kingdoms used to control the Islands and to assert their supremacy in the Red Sea. In 16 th century, however, Dahlak was exclusively occupied by the Ottomans and was used as a launching ground to conquer and control the costal part and highland of Eritrea. Finally, in the 1870 s Mohammed Ali of Egypt became master of the Islands. Dahlak was also known to have been the centre of trade for slaves on the Horn from the beginning of its occupation by Ottomans until its occupation of the Islands and the Red Sea coast by the Egyptians. (Eritrean travel and trade manual 2000) The prospect of the Dahlak Archipelago {{for the development of a}} successful tourist industry in Eritrea could undoubtedly be feasible. The low-lying coral chains where these volcanic Islands are located is amazingly tantalizing, fascinating and picturesque beyond description. Environmentally unpolluted, they are hygienic health-wise and could therefore be the primary attractions for tourists. Clean water and warm climate being their outstanding features, tourists could easily be lured to enjoy themselves without much ado about worrying their welfare, given their graceful natural environment is protected from deteriorations by contamination. White sandy beaches, protective bays and lagoons, provide excellent conditions for <b>diving,</b> snorkeling, sailing <b>wind</b> surfing and other sport activities.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{successfully}} capture prey in a challenging and physically demanding environment, Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) {{have developed a}} number of foraging strategies. Foremost among such strategies is the joining in formation of mixed species feeding associations (MSFA’s) {{and the use of}} specialised plunge diving behaviours. This study sought to determine how gannets vary individual and group plunge diving behaviours in order to maximise the benefits and mitigate the risks associated with feeding in densely packed, highly active MSFA’s. Specifically this study’s aims are to examine how variations in gannet dive heights, angles and completion rates are influenced by external stimuli, including weather parameters, oceanographic conditions and MSFA’s species composition and behaviour. This study additionally seeks to examine what mixed and/or con-­‐specific cues are associated with the formation of synchronous diving bouts, and determine its role as a form of local enhancement for gannets foraging in MSFA’s. Between March 2013 and June 2014, 45 independent boat based surveys were conducted aboard Dolphin Explorer, a 20 m tour boat based in New Zealand’s Hauraki Gulf. Using a Canon XH A 1 S high definition video camera, approximately 11. 9 hrs of MSFA video footage was collected, containing 5565 recorded gannet plunge dives. Variations in these dives, including their height, angle of entry, and synchronous timing were examined in context of environmental variables including wind speeds, sea surface temperatures, and Beaufort sea states as well as against MSFA variables including the abundance of other foraging gannets, the abundance and behaviour of common dolphins (Delphinus sp.), and the presence of other species including shearwaters (Puffinus spp.), petrels (Fregetta spp.), terns (Sterna spp.), and Bryde’s whales (Balaenoptera edeni). While weather influences were found to have minimal effects on gannet <b>dive</b> behaviours, higher <b>winds</b> were associated with lower altitude dives, and less frequent synchronous diving bouts. This is likely due to the decreased visibility of deeper prey caused by increased surface disturbances as a result of higher wind speeds, coupled with the inherent difficulties of performing highly coordinated aerial manoeuvres in high wind conditions. Increased gannet flock sizes were found to correlate with more frequent high-­‐ altitude 90 ° dives, and increased rates of dive synchrony. This may be a result of the need to better coordinate dives in denser assemblages of con-­‐specifics to avoid collisions, coupled with the increased foraging success associated with larger foraging groups, and local enhancement. Increased foraging dolphin pods were also associated with more frequent high-­‐ altitude vertical dives. This may result from gannets capitalising on the increased bait-­‐ball density and stability associated with larger foraging pods by taking deeper dives in order to make multiple prey captures with greater ease. Gannet synchrony, however, was only found to decrease in the smallest dolphin pods, again attributed to the decreased foraging abilities of smaller pods. Dolphin foraging behaviours most associated with the maintenance of dense stationary bait-­‐balls were most heavily associated with high, vertical gannet dives, and increased gannet synchronous dives. This is likely the result of gannets capitalising on denser prey assemblages by taking deeper dives in pursuit of multiple prey capture. The presence of Bryde’s whales at MSFA’s was found to decrease the frequency of both high vertical dives and synchronous dives, as lunge feeding on bait-­‐balls scatters fish and decreases prey density. The presence of hetero-­‐specific avian species had various effects on gannet dive behaviours. Most notably, the presence of shearwaters and petrels was found to be associated with greater frequencies of low altitude gannet dives, thought to be a result of an increased collision risk in their presence. Terns meanwhile were associated with decreased dive synchrony, possibly as a result of false hetero-­‐ specific signalling caused by their white plumage...|$|R
