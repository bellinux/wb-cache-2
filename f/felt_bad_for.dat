5|$|From the {{day that}} Speaker arrived in Cleveland, manager Lee Fohl rarely made an {{important}} move without consulting him. George Uhle recalled an incident from 1919 during his rookie year with the Indians. Speaker often signaled to Fohl when he thought that a pitcher should be brought in from the bullpen. One day, Fohl misread Speaker's signal and brought in a different pitcher than Speaker had intended. To avoid the appearance of overruling his manager, Speaker let the change stand. Pitcher Fritz Coumbe lost the game, Fohl resigned that night and Speaker became manager. Uhle said that Speaker <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> contributing to Fohl's departure.|$|E

While still a teenager, he reached the semifinals of both the French Open and the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semifinals in 1989. He began the 1990s {{with a series of}} near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to Andrés Gómez, which he attributes to worrying about his wig falling off. He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semifinals. His opponent in the final was Pete Sampras; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which he told his coach that he <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro. Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets. The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade. Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in 8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup, beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final.|$|E

After two days of deliberations, all but one juror had voted to convict Guandique. On the third day, the jury asked Judge Gerald Fisher to clarify the definition of assault. Fisher responded that any physical injury could legally be considered an assault, regardless of how small. On November 22, 2010, the jury found Guandique guilty of both remaining counts of first-degree murder. After the trial, a juror said the testimony of Morales was decisive in reaching the verdict. The conviction was called a [...] "miracle" [...] for having been reached with only circumstantial evidence. Gladys Weatherspoon, who had previously represented Guandique in the 2001 assault cases, stated that she was troubled by the jury's verdict: [...] "I just think {{they were going to}} convict anyway....

It’s so rare to have that on a television show, because so often everyone wants you to be the same character every week. It was quite refreshing creatively to get to do that." [...] Referring to Jim and Pam, Denman felt it was [...] "inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together" [...] and end the series' love triangle. [...] "Otherwise," [...] he explained, [...] "it gets kind of tiring and old. I think it was the appropriate time , and I had such a great experience working with all those guys." [...] Denman also added that Daniels' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim–Pam storyline [...] "to the next stage," [...] rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself.

[...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger commented that Sudeikis's return gave Tina Fey's Liz [...] "one of her more down-to-earth and relatable stories in a while", and enjoyed the Frank, Toofer, and Lutz rivalry with Jack and Danny, as well as Pete's involvement in the Jenna and Tracy story.

500|$|The {{deaths of}} Ana Lucia and Libby caused {{speculation}} {{that they were}} killed off due to the DUIs that actresses Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros received within fifteen minutes of each other on December 1, 2005. Watros pleaded guilty, was fined $370, and had her license suspended for 90 days. Rodriguez initially pleaded innocent, but in April pleaded guilty, {{and was sentenced to}} five days in Oahu correctional facility, but ended up serving only 65 hours due to jail overcrowding. In February 2006, US Weekly claimed that an insider told them that the Lost producers were frustrated with Rodriguez's behavior and were going to kill her character off. Soon after, [...] "Two for the Road" [...] aired, writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse told TV Guide that when talking to Rodriguez about the part of Ana Lucia, she said that she would be interested, but only for a year. After sitting down with her, the two were very impressed with her energy, and decided to adjust their plan to make her character only last one season. Since audiences had a negative reaction to Ana-Lucia, the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans, so they decided that Libby, who was well liked, should also be killed for emotional impact. [...] Lindelof recalled that after they found out that both Rodriguez and Watros got the DUIs, he was concerned that it would look like killing Ana and Libby was the producers attempt to say [...] "Don't drive drunk!", and even considered re-writing the script so it wouldn't seem that way, but the producers decided just to keep it like it was. Lindelof also denied rumors that Rodriguez was killed off because she was hard to deal with, saying that Michelle was [...] "totally professional and got along well with all the other actors." [...] According to Lindelof and Cuse, Watros was very sad about Libby being killed off, and the producers <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> her, so they helped her get in a pilot for a show on CBS called My Ex-Life, although it was not picked up by the network.|$|E
2500|$|Later in 2003, Jericho began a slow face turn, by {{starting}} a romance with Trish Stratus while his tag team partner Christian began one with Lita. This, however, {{turned out to}} be a bet over who could sleep with their respective paramour first, with a Canadian dollar at stake. Stratus overheard this and ended her relationship with Jericho, who seemingly <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> using Stratus. After he saved her from an attack by Kane, Stratus agreed that the two of them could just be [...] "friends", thus making Jericho a face. After Christian put Stratus in the Walls of Jericho while competing against her in a match, Jericho sought revenge on Christian, which led to a match at WrestleMania XX. Christian defeated Jericho after Stratus ran down and [...] "inadvertently" [...] struck Jericho (thinking it was Christian) and Christian got the roll-up. After the match, Stratus turned on Jericho and revealed that she and Christian were a couple. This revelation led to a handicap match at Backlash that Jericho won. Jericho won his record-breaking seventh Intercontinental Championship at that year's Unforgiven in a ladder match against Christian, breaking the previous record held by Jeff Jarrett from 1999. Jericho's seventh reign was short lived, as he lost it at Taboo Tuesday to Shelton Benjamin.|$|E

To manage her daughter, Norwood's mother soon resigned from her job, while Norwood herself dropped out of Hollywood High School later, and was tutored privately from tenth grade on. During the early production stages of her debut album, Norwood was selected for a role in the ABC sitcom Thea, portraying the daughter of a single mother played by comedian Thea Vidale. Initially broadcast to high ratings, the series' viewership dwindled and ended up running for only one season, but earned her a Young Artists Award nomination for Outstanding Youth Ensemble alongside her co-stars. Norwood recalled that she appreciated the cancellation of the show as she was unenthusiastic about acting at the time, and the taping caused scheduling conflicts with the recording of her album. She stated, [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> everybody else but me. It was a good thing, because I could do what I had to do, because I wanted to sing." ...|$|E

He was sick and week and it went to his head. He just turned and run and run till he got back to the old micmac's camp and fell in front of it.
