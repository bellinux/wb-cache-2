Mysore has traditionally been home to <b>industries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> weaving, sandalwood carving, bronze work {{and the production of}} lime and salt. The planned industrial growth {{of the city and the}} state was first envisaged at the Mysore economic conference in 1911.

5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been {{a key component of}} the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related <b>industries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state.

5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller {{than it had been}} in the mid 19th century. Other <b>industries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E

By themselves, developing countries, even if well-educated, cannot produce at the quality levels demanded in high-value-added industries and cannot market what they produce even in low-value-added <b>industries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> textiles or shoes.

5|$|In medieval times, {{the wool}} trade was {{important}} in the town's economy, although this declined in the 18th century {{to be replaced by}} other <b>industries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> brewing; the town continues to be a major centre for the production of cider.

5|$|Local {{industries}} in Nashik, especially those {{located in the}} Ambad Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation area, were affected due to the large-scale departure of migrant workers.

Though the local industries at Nashik are ancillary units, they provide material to big <b>industries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Mahindra and Mahindra and Crompton Greaves.

5|$|The {{share of}} public {{spending}} in GDP increased from 27% in 1995 to 30% in 2000. Some poorer provinces had depended on state enterprises or on inefficient <b>industries,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> sugar, {{which could not}} compete when trade was opened. To quell social unrest, provincial governors padded their payrolls. The government had embarked on a pension reform with costs reaching 3% of GDP in 2000, as it still had to pay pensioners but no longer received contributions.|$|E
5|$|The siting of noxious <b>industries,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> tanning and fulling {{downwind}} {{outside the}} boundaries of the City, and therefore beyond complaints and official controls. The foul-smelling industries partially preferred the East End because the prevailing winds in London traveled from west to east (i.e. it was downwind {{from the rest of the}} city), meaning that most odors from their businesses would not go into the city but outside, and thereby reduced complaints.|$|E
5|$|With urban regeneration, high-value {{service sector}} <b>industries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{corporate}} services {{and financial services}} haven taken root in Northern England, with major hubs around Leeds and Manchester.

A sizeable {{number of these}} stateless Vietnamese consisted of migrants that came to Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 during the UNTAC administration. The majority of Vietnamese still {{live below the poverty}} line, although {{a very small number of}} Vietnamese are represented in the Cambodian business sector.

During the 1980s, Singapore began to upgrade to higher-technological <b>industries,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the wafer fabrication sector, in order to compete with its neighbours which now had cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was developed to become a major airline.

Singapore emerged as an important transportation hub and a major tourist destination.|$|E

These and all other rules regarding the safety of interstate commercial driving are issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
