40|$|Equations {{of motion}} for a coupled rotor-body system were derived {{for the purpose}} of {{studying}} air and ground resonance characteristics of helicopters that have bearingless main rotors. For the fuselage, only four rigid body degrees of freedom are considered; longitudinal and lateral translations, pitch, and roll. The rotor is assumed to consist of three or more rigid blades. Each blade is joined to the hub by means of a flexible beam segment (<b>flexbeam</b> or strap). Pitch change is accomplished by twisting the <b>flexbeam</b> with the pitch-control system, the characteristics of which are variable. Thus, the analysis is capable of implicitly treating aeroelastic couplings generated by the <b>flexbeam</b> elastic deflections, the pitch-control system, and the angular offsets of the blade and <b>flexbeam.</b> The linearized equations are written in the nonrotating system retaining only the cyclic rotor modes; thus, they comprise a system of homogeneous ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. All contributions to the linearized perturbation equations from inertia, gravity, quasi-steady aerodynamics, and the <b>flexbeam</b> equilibrium deflections are retained exactly...|$|E
40|$|With the {{evolution}} of advanced composites, the feasibility of designing bearingless rotor systems for high speed, demanding maneuver envelopes, and high aircraft gross weights has become a reality. These systems {{eliminate the need for}} hinges and heavily loaded bearings by incorporating a composite <b>flexbeam</b> structure which accommodates flapping, lead-lag, and feathering motions by bending and twisting while reacting full blade centrifugal force. The flight characteristics of a bearingless rotor system are largely dependent on hub design, and the principal element in this type of system is the composite <b>flexbeam.</b> As in any hub design, trade off studies must be performed in order to optimize performance, dynamics (stability), handling qualities, and stresses. However, since the <b>flexbeam</b> structure is the primary component which will determine the balance of these characteristics, its design and fabrication are not straightforward. It was concluded that: pitchcase and snubber damper representations are required in the <b>flexbeam</b> model for proper sizing resulting from dynamic requirements; optimization is necessary for <b>flexbeam</b> design, since it reduces the design iteration time and results in an improved design; and inclusion of multiple flight conditions and their corresponding fatigue allowables is necessary for the optimization procedure...|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear-tapered <b>flexbeam</b> {{laminates}} from {{a full-size}} composite helicopter rotor hub <b>flexbeam</b> were tested under combined constant axial tension and cyclic bending loads. The two different graphite/glass hybrid configurations tested under cyclic loading failed by delamination in the tapered region.

The analysis results from two geometrically nonlinear finite element codes, ANSYS and ABAQUS, are presented and compared. Strain energy release rates (G) obtained from the above codes using the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) at a resin crack location in the flexbeams are presented for both hybrid material types. These results compare well {{with each other and}} suggest that the initial delamination growth from the resin crack toward the thick region of the <b>flexbeam</b> is strongly mode II. The peak calculated G values were used with material characterization data to calculate fatigue life curves and compared with test data.

The approach used involves examining the local scattering properties of structural discontinuities in the frequency domains to assess the effect of damage on the modal response of the structure. A model using a simulated cantilevered beam is used to illustrate the performance of the wave model approach for dynamic detection of damage in the form of transverse cracks imparted to composite rotorcraft <b>flexbeams.</b> Experimental validation is carried out on a graphite/epoxy cantilever beam test specimen with (O/ 9 O) s ply orientation in vacuum. Damage {{in the form of a}} transverse crack, which extends across the entire width of the specimen is imparted at depths of 25, 50 and 75 % of the beam thickness to the test specimen. A piezo-electric actuator mounted near the root is used to excite the structure dynamically to help locate and determine the extent of damage.

40|$|The {{viability}} of {{a method for}} determining the fatigue life of composite rotor hub <b>flexbeam</b> laminates using delamination fatigue characterization data and a geometric non-linear finite element (FE) analysis was studied. Combined tension and bending loading was applied to nonlinear tapered <b>flexbeam</b> laminates with internal ply drops. These laminates, consisting of coupon specimens cut from a full-size S 2 /E 7 T 1 glass-epoxy <b>flexbeam</b> were tested in a hydraulic load frame under combined axial-tension and transverse cyclic bending loads. The magnitude of the axial load remained constant and {{the direction of the}} load rotated with the specimen as the cyclic bending load was applied. The first delamination damage observed in the specimens occurred at the area around the tip of the outermost ply-drop group. Subsequently, unstable delamination occurred by complete delamination {{along the length of the}} specimen. Continued cycling resulted in multiple delaminations. A 2 D finite element model of the <b>flexbeam</b> was developed and a geometrically non-linear analysis was performed. The global responses of the model and test specimens agreed very well in terms of the transverse <b>flexbeam</b> tip-displacement and flapping angle. The FE model was used to calculate strain energy release rates (G) for delaminations initiating at the tip of the outer ply-drop area and growing toward the thick or thin regions of the <b>flexbeam,</b> as was observed in the specimens. The delamination growth toward the thick region was primarily mode 2, whereas delamination growth toward the thin region was almost completely mode 1. Material characterization data from cyclic double-cantilevered beam tests was used with the peak calculated G values to generate a curve predicting fatigue failure by unstable delamination as a function of the number of loading cycles.

40|$|Nonlinear tapered <b>flexbeam</b> laminates, with {{significant}} ply waviness, were {{cut from a}} fullsize composite rotor hub <b>flexbeam.</b> The specimens were tested under combined axial tension and cyclic bending loads. All of the specimens had wavy plies through the center and near the surfaces (termed marcelled areas), although {{for some of the}} specimens the surface marcels were very obvious, and for others they were much smaller. The specimens failed by first developing cracks through the marcels at the surfaces, and then delaminations grew from those cracks, in both directions. Delamination failure occurred in these specimens at significantly shorter fatigue lives than similar specimens without waviness, tested in ref. 2.

Delaminations grew slowly and stably, toward the thick end of the <b>flexbeam,</b> at the interfaces above and below the dropped-ply region. A 2 D finite element model of the <b>flexbeam</b> was developed. The model was analyzed using a geometrically non-linear analysis with both the ANSYS and ABAQUS FE codes.

The ANSYS model was used to calculate strain energy release rates (G) for delaminations initiating at two different ply-ending locations.

40|$|A {{conventional}} articulated {{rotor blade}} has mechanical flap and lag hinges, a lag damper, and a pitch bearing. In connection {{with an interest}} in designs of greater mechanical simplicity and increased maintainability, hingeless and bearingless rotors have been developed. A hingeless blade lacks the hinges and is cantilevered at the hub. It does have a pitch bearing for pitch control. A bearingless design eliminates the hinges and the pitch bearing as well. In the present investigation of bearingless rotor blade characteristics, finite element analysis has been successfully applied to determine the solutions of the nonlinear trim equations and the linearized flutter equations of multiple-load-path blades.

40|$|The {{results of}} a wind tunnel test program to {{determine}} the performance loads and dynamic characteristics of the Composite <b>Flexbeam</b> Tail Rotor (CFTR) for the AH- 64 Advanced Attack Helicopter are reported. The CFTR uses an elastomeric shear attachment of the <b>flexbeam</b> to the hub to provide soft-inplane S-mode and stiff-inplane C-mode configuration. The properties of the elastomer were selected for proper frequency placement and scale damping of the inplane S-mode. Kinematic pitch-lag coupling was introduced to provide the first cyclic inplane C-mode damping at high collective pitch. The CFTR was tested in a wind tunnel over the full slideslip envelop of the AH- 64. It is found that the rotor was aeroelastically stable throughout the complete collective pitch range and up to rotor speeds of 1403 rpm.

40|$|This is a {{follow-on}} {{study to}} a 2010 correlation effort. Measured {{data from the}} SMART rotor test in the NASA Ames 40 - by 80 - Foot Wind Tunnel are compared with CAMRAD II calculations. As background, during the wind tunnel test, unexpectedly high inboard loads were encountered, and it was hypothesized {{at that time that}} due to changes in the flexbeams over the years, the <b>flexbeam</b> properties used in the analysis needed updating. Boeing Mesa, recently updated these properties. This correlation study uses the updated <b>flexbeam</b> properties. Compared to earlier studies, the following two enhancements are implemented: i) the inboard loads (pitchcase and <b>flexbeam</b> loads) correlation is included for the first time (reliable prediction of the inboard loads is a prerequisite for any future anticipated flight-testing); ii) the number of blade modes is increased to better capture the flap dynamics and the pitchcase-flexbeam dynamics. Also, aerodynamically, both the rolled-up wake model and the more complex, multiple trailer wake model are used, with the latter slightly improving the blade chordwise moment correlation. This sensitivity to the wake model indicates that CFD is needed. Three high-speed experimental cases, one uncontrolled free flap case and two commanded flap cases, are considered. The two commanded flap cases include a 2 o flap deflection at 5 P case and a 0 o flap deflection case. For the free flap case, selected modifications to the HH- 06 section flap airfoil pitching moment table are implemented. For the commanded 2 o flap case, the experimental flap variation is approximately matched by increasing the analytical flap hinge stiffness. This increased flap hinge stiffness is retained for the commanded 0 o flap case also, which is treated as a free flap case, but with larger flap hinge stiffness. The change in the mid-span and outboard loads correlation due to the updating of the <b>flexbeam</b> properties is not significant. Increasing the number of blade modes results in an effective, commanded flap hinge stiffness of 4 X baseline, not 3 X as reported earlier. The inboard loads correlation is reasonable, but needs further study. Overall, the free flap case correlation is reasonable, thus confirming the basic correctness of the current semi-empirical modifications; the correlation for the commanded 2 o flap at 5 P case and the 0 o flap case is also reasonable...|$|E

Delamination is a predominant failure mode in continuous fiber reinforced laminated composites and often initiate near the free edges of the structure. The appearance of delaminations in the composite rotorcraft <b>flexbeams</b> can lead to deterioration of the mechanical properties and, in turn, the helicopter performance as well as safety.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} {{structures}} is often optimized by gradually decreasing the thickness as the load carrying requirement on the components decreases. Such structures in composites {{are made of}} tapered laminates involving dropping of plies. However, these structures are often prone to early delamination initiation, which leads to premature failure of the component and therefore limits its useful life. In the past, many routes to circumvent this problem have been evolved, {{such as the use}} of adhesive film layers or interleaving the dropped plies between continuous ones. In this work, a novel technique of ply edge chamfering has been developed and employed in the specimen fabrication. Comparisons have been drawn between similarly configured specimens, with and without chamfered ply drops. Static and fatigue test results have shown remarkable improvements, both in terms of complete suppression of delamination around ply drops and in realizing 14. 5 – 77. 6 % higher strength levels in tapered composite test coupons.

40|$|A {{summary of}} several studies of {{delamination}} in tapered composite laminates with internal ply-drops is presented. Initial studies used 2 D FE models to calculate interlaminar stresses at the ply-ending locations in linear tapered laminates under tension loading. Strain energy release rates for delamination in these laminates indicated that delamination would likely {{start at the}} juncture of the tapered and thin regions and grow unstably in both directions. Tests of glass/epoxy and graphite/epoxy linear tapered laminates under axial tension delaminated as predicted. Nonlinear tapered specimens were cut from a full-size helicopter rotor hub and were tested under combined constant axial tension and cyclic transverse bending loading to simulate the loading experienced by a rotorhub <b>flexbeam</b> in flight. For all the tested specimens, delamination began {{at the tip of}} the outermost dropped ply group and grew first toward the tapered region. A 2 D FE model was created that duplicated the test <b>flexbeam</b> layup, geometry, and loading. Surface strains calculated by the model agreed very closely with the measured surface strains in the specimens. The delamination patterns observed in the tests were simulated in the model by releasing pairs of MPCs along those interfaces. Strain energy release rates associated with the delamination growth were calculated for several configurations and using two different FE analysis codes. Calculations from the codes agreed very closely. The strain energy release rate results were used with material characterization data to predict fatigue delamination onset lives for nonlinear tapered flexbeams with two different ply-dropping schemes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} flap bending, lead-lag bending and torsion of hingeless and bearingless rotor blades in forward flight is examined, using a finite element formulation based on Hamilton's principle. The hingeless blade is idealized as an elastic beam, and is discretized into beam elements. Each beam element consists of fifteen nodal degrees of freedom. Between the elements {{there is a}} continuity of displacement and slope for lag and flap bending, and a continuity of displacement for twist and axial deflection. For a bearingless rotor blade the <b>flexbeam,</b> the torque tube and the main blade are assumed as elastic beams, and these are discretized into beam elements. Quasisteady strip theory is {{used to evaluate the}} aerodynamic forces, and the unsteady aerodynamic effects are introduced approximately through a dynamic wake induced inflow modelling. The natural vibration characteristics of a rotating blade are calculated from the finite element equations. The blade finite element response equations are transformed to the model space {{in the form of a}} few normal mode equations. These nonlinear response equations containing periodic terms are solved iteratively using Floquet theory. The periodic perturbation equations linearized about the nonlinear response position are solved for stability using Floquet transition matrix theory as well as constant coefficient approximation in the fixed reference frame. Results are presented for both stiff-inplane and soft-inplane blade configurations. Stability results are also obtained for a bearingless blade configuration consisting of single <b>flexbeam</b> with a wrap-around type torque tube and the pitch links located, one on the leading edge and the other on the trailing edge of the torque tube.

These included a reduction in the rotor control system stiffness and increased <b>flexbeam</b> structural damping. The primary objective of the test was to determine aeroelastic stability of the fundamental flexbeam/blade chordwise bending mode. The rotor was stable for all conditions. Damping of the rotor chordwise bending mode increases with increased collective pitch angle at constant operating conditions.

40|$|Composite {{laminated}} {{structures are}} prone to delamination. Rotorcraft flexbeams, apart from many other aerospace primary load carrying members {{are made up of}} composite laminated structures. A delaminated primary load carrying member can lead to catastrophic failure of the system of which it is a part. Delamination modeling and detection in composite laminated structures are challenging areas of ongoing research worldwide. Existing literature falls short of addressing effects of widthwise partial delamination on the modal characteristics of beams. To address this issue, a new partial delamination model for composite beams is proposed and implemented using the finite element method. Homogenized cross-sectional stiffness of the delaminated beam is obtained by the proposed analytical technique, including extension-bending, extension-twist and torsion-bending coupling terms, and hence can be used with an existing finite element method. A two-noded C 1 -type Timoshenko beam element with four degrees of freedom per node for dynamic analysis of beams is implemented. The results for different delamination scenarios and beams subjected to different boundary conditions are validated with available experimental results in the literature and/or with a 3 -D finite element simulation using COMSOL. Results of the first torsional mode frequency for the partially delaminated beam are validated with the COMSOL results. The key point of the current work is that even partial delamination in long structures can be analyzed using a 1 -D beam model, rather than using computationally more demanding 3 -D or 2 -D models. Rotor craft flexbeams {{are prone to}} delaminations, which in most realistic situations are partial along both the length and the width. However, the effect of partial delamination on the modal characteristics of the beam is not studied by researchers to the best of the author’s knowledge. Addressing this issue, a rotorcraft <b>flexbeam</b> is analysed here in the presence of delamination. A set of nonlinear governing equations for the rotating <b>flexbeam</b> are developed in hybrid basis. The <b>ﬂexbeam</b> model developed has axial stretch, transverse displacement and flexural rotation in flapwise direction and twist as its degrees of freedom. The nonlinear governing differential equations are linearised and solved for eigenvalues and eigenvectors using a finite element method. The effects of angular speed and delamination size and location on the <b>ﬂexbeam</b> modes are analysed. The results obtained using the proposed model are validated with the COMSOL 3 -D finite element simulations. Next, the issue of delamination detection in beams is addressed. Mode shape curvature and Katz fractal dimension are used to detect the presence of partial delaminations in a beam. The effects of boundary conditions and location of delamination on the fractal dimension curve are studied. Usage of higher mode shape data for detection of delamination in beams is evaluated. Limitations of the Katz fractal dimension curve for delamination detection are enumerated. It is shown that fractal dimension measure and mode shape curvature can be used to detect the presence of partial delamination in beams. It is found that the torsional mode shape is best suited for partial delamination detection in beams. Apart from beams, Shell-and plate-like structures are also extensively used in aerospace structures. The modeling of multilayered plates is introduced herein with the intention to model delaminations in 2 D. Carrera Unified Formulation(CUF) plate model, developed using variational formulations, is used to derive the stiffness matrices and to apply, the Principle of Virtual Displacement(PVD) and the Reissner Mixed Variational Theorem (RMVT). It is known that FEM implementation for plates leads to the phenomenon of numerical locking: the so-called membrane and shear locking effects. A well-known remedy for addressing locking is the use of the Mixed Interpolated Tensorial Components(MITC) technique. A strategy similar to MITC approach in the RMVT formulation is used to construct an advanced locking-free finite element to treat the multilayered plates. Composite laminated plates are prone to delamination. Implementation of delamination in the CUF frame work using nine-noded quadrilateral MITC 9 elements is discussed. MITC 9 elements are devoid of shear locking and membrane locking. Delaminated structures, as well as the corresponding healthy structures, are analysed for free vibration modes. The results from the present work are compared with those from available experimental or/and theoretical research articles or/and the 3 -D finite element simulations. The effects of different kinds and different percentages of interfacial area of delaminations on the first three natural frequencies of the structure are discussed. The presence of the open-mode or breathing mode delamination mode shape for large delaminations within the first three natural frequencies is discussed. Also, the switching of the places between the second bending mode and the first torsional mode frequencies is discussed. Results obtained from different ordered theories are compared in the presence of delamination. Advantage of layer wise theory as compared to equivalent single layer theories for very large delaminations is stated. The effects of different kinds of delamination and its effect on the second bending and first torsional mode shapes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} Integrated Technology Rotor/Flight Research Rotor (ITR/FRR) Program {{a number}} of {{advanced}} rotor system designs were conceived and investigated. From these, several were chosen that best meet the started ITR goals with emphasis on stability, reduced weight and hub drag, simplicity, low head moment stiffness, and adequate strength and fatigue life. It was concluded that obtaining low hub moment stiffness was difficult when only the blade flexibility of bearingless rotor blades is considered, unacceptably low fatigue life being the primary problem. Achieving a moderate hub moment stiffness somewhat higher than {{state of the art}} articulated rotors in production today is possible within the fatigue life constraint. Alternatively, low stiffness is possible when additional rotor elements, besides the blades themselves, provide part of the rotor flexibility. Two primary designs evolved as best meeting the general ITR requirements that presently exist. An I shaped <b>flexbeam</b> with an external torque tube can satisfy the general goals but would have either higher stiffness or reduced fatigue life. The elastic gimbal rotor can achieve a better combination of low stiffness and high fatigue life but would be a somewhat heavier design and possibly exhibit a higher risk of aeromechanical instability...|$|E

Accordingly, an integrated sensor system that continuously monitors the structural integrity of the rotor system is needed to assure the safety of flight and reduce the cost of maintenance of the rotor system. This smart monitoring system could also provide immediate information on the dynamic loading in the rotor system. This information could define the performance limit of the helicopter based on the condition of the rotor system. The operator will then be able to adjust the flight condition and prevent damage from occurring or propagating. The challenges in designing this monitoring system are related to the operating conditions of the helicopter. These include significant aerodynamic and external damping in bending and torsion modes, moderate nonlinearities in the system, large dynamic loads, and difficulty in actuating pure interrogation signals in the airborne condition. In this paper, piezoceramic sensors and actuators and different techniques for damage detection that use symmetry properties of the structure and no structural model are tested in a static condition for health monitoring {{of a helicopter}} <b>flexbeam.</b> Testing under dynamic loading is needed as the next step in the development of the smart sensor system...|$|E
