50|$|Murnau {{is a minor}} train hub, {{since it}} is the place where the Munich-Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Oberammergau lines intersect. The first <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> of the Deutsche Bundesbahn was {{installed}} here. Also, the A95 motorway and the B 2 Bundesstrasse run through or near Murnau.|$|E
25|$|Because {{double and}} single track may use {{different}} signalling systems, {{it may be}} awkward and confusing to mix double and single track too often. For example, intermediate mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> on a double-track line can be closed during periods of light traffic, but this cannot be done {{if there is a}} single-line section in between. This problem is less serious with <b>electrical</b> <b>signalling</b> such as Centralized traffic control.|$|R
5000|$|In late February 2007, the railway's 'Two-Train Running' {{project was}} {{completed}} {{and approved by}} HM Railway Inspectorate. Through improvements to infrastructure and signalling, this project allows two trains in steam on the line, utilising a refurbished and extended passing loop at [...] Each section of the railway is worked by a train staff, each with a key to operate the ground frames and <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> releases at the <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> and the ground frames at Rowsley South, Rowsley North, Darley South Yard sidings and Matlock Riverside.|$|R
5|$|Between 5–28 June 1926, {{the station}} was closed to allow the Southern Railway to carry out various works, {{including}} the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of the tracks and installation of {{a new system of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>signalling</b> – the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated and the glass roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.|$|R
50|$|The station building, {{the nearby}} level {{crossing}} <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and footbridge are each listed buildings. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was the prototype for the Airfix kit <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{also had}} three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> I (Stellwerk I) {{was in the}} {{northern}} part of the station, <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> II was in the middle of the platform. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> III was in the southern part of the station.

50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} signalled by {{a mixture of}} semaphore signals and colour lights by several <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> over the years. Almost every station had a <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> Lewes even had five <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> controlling the area including the goods yard. Polegate had three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> and other <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> at Willingdon and Stone Cross junctions and at Pevensey Bay and Cooden Beach There were also crossing boxes at Ripe, between Glynde and Berwick, and at Wilmington, between Berwick and Polegate.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2013 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was repainted externally. In June 2016 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{frame and}} point {{connecting}} rods were renewed increasing {{the life expectancy}} of the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and reducing the chance of failure ...|$|R
50|$|Bidston {{had four}} <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in 1899. These <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{situated}} alongside the Dee, West, East and North junctions. The nearest {{to the station}} was the Bidston Dee Junction box. The second Dee Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{was built in the}} 1930s by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and was much larger than the earlier <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> which had been built by the Wirral Railway. This <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> had a 65-lever frame and also took over the operation of Bidston North Junction, when built. Bidston Dee Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was closed on 17 September 1994, and demolished two months later on 20 November.|$|R
50|$|The {{dismantling}} of the Rhenish line between Steinfurt and St. Arnold started on 30 September 2005. Of the four former <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> two have already been demolished, the Bn <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> on the Rhenish line and the Bmf <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> which was located on the former middle platform. The two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> on the Enschede line (the Bf <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{to the south and}} the Bw <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{to the north of the}} station) are still standing, but are out of service. Since 26 October 2008, signalling and points at the station have been remotely controlled from the electronic signalling centre at Coesfeld (Westf) station.|$|R
50|$|The station did {{not have}} a passing loop being only a block post {{splitting}} the line into two sections. It had a goods yard, <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> goods shed, and a level crossing with gates. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> near the level crossing was replaced by a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> located on the platform in 1915. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was renamed Dousland from Dousland Barn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} been {{controlled}} by an electronic interlocking at Jena-Göschwitz and built by Siemens since 27 November 2011. One day before, the dispatchers <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Jm", {{was taken out}} of operation. The guard <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Js", was also closed. Until September 2006, there was another <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Jn". All were mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> of the Jüdel type.|$|R
50|$|Bidirectional {{transducers}} convert physical phenomena to <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> {{and also}} convert <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> into physical phenomena. Examples of inherently bidirectional transducers are antennae, which can convert conducted <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> {{to or from}} propagating electromagnetic waves, and voice coils, which convert <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> into sound (when used in a loudspeaker) or sound into <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> (when used in a microphone).

50|$|Two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> {{were opened}} in 1889, the 13-lever North <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> by Torquay Road level crossing, the 17-lever South <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> by Sands Road level crossing. Both were {{replaced}} in 1924 by two new boxes. The North box closed on 26 March 1988 when control of trains {{was transferred to}} the Panel <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> at Exeter but the South box was retained to monitor the two level crossings. In 1990 this function was transferred to a panel in the station buildings and the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> closed.|$|R
40|$|The plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> {{has some}} features, e. g. weak, low-frequency and time-varying. To detect changes in plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signals,</b> LED light source {{was used to}} create a {{controllable}} light environment in this study. The <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> data were collected from Sansevieria leaves under the different illumination conditions, and the data was analyzed in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain, respectively. These analyses are helpful to explore the relationship between changes in the light environment and <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> in Sansevieria leaves. The changes in the plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> reflected the changes in the intensity of photosynthesis. In this study, we proposed a new method to express plant photosynthetic intensity {{as a function of the}} <b>electrical</b> <b>signal.</b> That is, the plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> can be used to describe the state of plant growth...|$|R

5000|$|At Horsted Keynes, the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and {{an engine}} {{house to the}} south of the station are also Grade II listed buildings. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is {{described}} as [...] "the only remaining Type 1 <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> on the LBSC line".|$|R
40|$|Modern {{computerised}} railway control {{methods are}} making traditional railway <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> obsolete and most <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> owned by Network Rail in Great Britain will close by 2026. Many of these <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> have a listing as buildings of architectural or historical significance. Listed buildings should ideally {{remain in their}} original location and this particularly applies to <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> where the railway environment is an intrinsic aspect of the listing. However, there is pressure to relocate redundant listed and heritage <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> Primary research methodology is by focusing upon key exemplars to determine the actual situation against theoretical conservation policy and practice. Findings are that while relocation affects the building’s conservation integrity, presentation of relocated <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in a heritage railway environment provides for interpretation of railway history. The conclusions identify that there are contradictory requirements and pressures in conserving heritage <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> These pressures materially affect the conservation process {{and there is a}} need to redefine accepted conservation theory to cope with the realties of <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> preservation. This will necessitate engagement by all interested parties and a systematic identification of all affected <b>signal</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{optical sensor}} system {{has at least}} one optical sensor element (20), which {{depending}} on an optical information signal falling on the same, produces a first <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> (IS), which consists of an <b>electrical</b> information <b>signal</b> and an interference signal. One reference sensor element (22) at least is provided, which is not exposed to the optical information signal (28) and produces a second <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> (Idark). This second <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> corresponds to the interference signal or is derived from this. A unit (24, 30) is provided for combining the first and second <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> in such a manner. That the resulting <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> (ISK) is closer to the <b>electrical</b> information <b>signal,</b> than the second <b>electrical</b> <b>signal.</b> ADVANTAGE - Optical sensor system, output signal of which is based on optical information signal and free from interference signals...|$|R
25|$|Oban {{originally}} had two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> namely Oban Station <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> (the larger of the two), and Oban Goods Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> The latter was situated {{about a quarter}} mile further south, where the line to the goods yard and engine shed diverged from the single line. The original <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> contained 21 and 5 levers, respectively. The single line between the two boxes was doubled in 1881.|$|R

50|$|The Weilheim station {{originally}} had three mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 1 controlled movements between {{different parts of}} the station precinct and was located at the northern end of the station west of the tracks. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 2 was operated by the train despatcher and was situated south of the entrance building between the local loading tracks and the station building. Both were mechanical interlocking of the Krauss class of 1902. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 3 was a mechanical interlocking of the Krauss class of 1925, which controlled the marshalling yard and was located {{at the southern end of}} the sidings to the west of the station. In 1983, the three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were replaces by a centralised <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> with a track-plan push-button interlocking of the Lorenz L60 class, which is housed in an cubic, three-storey building with an attached observation deck. This <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> controls, in addition to the Weilheim station area, the Wilzhofen and Polling areas. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is located on the main platform north of the entrance building.|$|R

5000|$|... 14 {{mechanical}} <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> {{were built}} for {{the operation of the}} freight yard, mainly of the Bruchsal G design. Over the years, <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> B and D were abolished during the replacement of sets of points and in 1974 <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> 5, 7, 8 (old), 10 and 11 were replaced during the commissioning of the new central <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> B8. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 4 was destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War and reconstructed in 1947 in a different style with yellow clinker brickwork and a lever frame of the Jüdel design from old spare parts. In the 1960s, an electro-mechanical lever frame of a 1907 design was installed in the previously mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> A and, in addition, the approach track received three beam retarders. In 1971, colour light signals were installed on the western hump. These are operated centrally by the dispatcher at the western hump, who was moved from <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 2 to exit <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 1 at the same time. During the construction of the Engelsdorf crossing structure, which took the Leipzig-Geithain railway under the exit from the yard, exit <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> A and 3 were remodelled. Both were equipped with electro-mechanical lever frames of 1912 design with lamp monitoring and <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> A was relocated from its old position on the crossing structure to the already prepared Bremsturm (brake <b>signal</b> <b>box).</b> In 1988, the sorting tracks were equipped with screw-type track brakes so that since then no riders have been required to retard wagons.|$|R
50|$|The {{tracks of}} the former {{marshalling}} yard have been controlled since December 2008 by the electronic interlocking at the yard, which is also connected to the Munich operation centre. The track plan interlocking of 1951 and two mechanical interlocking of 1900 (<b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 3) and 1894 (<b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 1) were taken out of service at the same time. Since the commissioning of the Moosburg/Isar electronic interlocking and the related closure of <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in the Langenbach (Oberbayern) station, <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 2 in Laim yard has been Bavaria's oldest <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{that can be used}} to control signalling directly.|$|R
