40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a cutter for harvesting machines, {{also known as}} a reaping bar, said cutter having a triangular shape and designed with cutting edges on both sides. Known cutters are only hardened along the cutting edge and thus fail to meet all the requirements under operating conditions. Therefore, in addition to the cutting edges, the material characteristics of other areas must be changed. The change in material characteristics including the <b>hardness</b> <b>penetration</b> depth should be possible using a vacuum process and achieve high productivity. According to the invention, isolated areas other than the cutting edges are hardened by an energy beam, preferably an electron beam, {{in such a way that}} said areas assume different or identical material characteristics and <b>hardness</b> <b>penetration</b> depth. The energy transfer field of the energy beam is guided over the cutter in such a way that all areas whose characteristics are changed pass through one process...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study the mechanics of indentation of an adhesively bonded layered solid. To this end, several (plane strain) finite element simulations of wedge indentation of a ductile strip which is adhesively bonded to a rigid substrate are conducted by varying {{the properties of the}} adhesive layer. The stress fields below the indenter tip and at the strip-adhesive interface are examined for Various depths of indentation. The effects of the adhesive properties on the above features of the finite element solution, {{as well as on the}} <b>hardness</b> versus <b>penetration</b> characteristics, are investigated. The above results are also compared with those for an unbonded strip resting on a frictionless surface. It is found that once yielding commences in the adhesive layer, the state of stress in it is comprised of a shear stress and a superposed hydrostatic compression. Also, it is observed that increasing the yield strength of the adhesive layer significantly delays the onset of the decreasing phase of the <b>hardness</b> versus <b>penetration</b> curve, whereas, changing the elastic modulus of the adhesive has negligible effect on it...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} industry has {{a keen interest}} in using a nondestructive, real-time, reliable and inexpensive technique for the in-place evaluation of the compressive strength of concrete structures. Compressive strength of concrete is usually determined by drilling a core and testing it in a laboratory. This method is relatively expensive, and it may take a few days for the results to be known. In addition, this method is destructive. Consequently, several nondestructive techniques have been developed for this purpose.

The rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea can also penetrate synthetic surfaces such as poly(vinyl chloride). Previous experiments {{have suggested that}} penetration requires an elevated appressorial turgor pressure. In the present report we have used nonbiodegradable Mylar membranes, exhibiting a range of surface hardness, to test the proposition that penetration is driven by turgor. Reducing appressorial turgor by osmotic stress inhibited penetration of these membranes. The size of the turgor deficit required to inhibit penetration was {{a function of the}} surface <b>hardness.</b> <b>Penetration</b> of the hardest membranes was inhibited by small decreases in appressorial turgor, while penetration of the softer membranes was sensitive only to large decreases in turgor. Similarly, penetration of the host surface was inhibited in a manner comparable to penetration of the hardest Mylar membranes. Indirect measurements of turgor, obtained through osmotically induced collapse of appressoria, indicated that the infection apparatus can generate turgor pressures in excess of 8. 0 MPa (80 bars). We conclude that penetration of synthetic membranes, and host epidermal cells, is accomplished by application of the physical force derived from appressorial turgor...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{presented}} to compare the transmission gear products from SME (UKM gear) and national scale manufacturer (OEM gear) especially on the surface hardening characterization. Both gears were heat treated with different methods. The gear product of SME was heat treated by pack carburizing and quenching whereas the OEM gear was predicted to be heat treated using induction heating with high frequency. The surface hardening characterization was conducted by investigating the hardening thickness, the hardness number and the microstructure observation on the gear surfaces. The result of the hardening thickness investigation reveals a distinction on the depth of hardening penetration. The heat treatment using long interval pack carburizing of UKM gear produces a deeper penetration and the higher hardness number on the gear surface whereas the OEM gear has a thin <b>hardness</b> <b>penetration</b> and lower hardness number.

40|$|Currently, {{within the}} {{aviation}} industry {{there has been}} a large focus on enhancing the fatigue life of thin-walled aircraft structures, such as the fuselage. In the past decades, shot peening was seen to aid in accomplishing this goal. In more modern and recent times, laser shock peening techniques were said to provide a more substantial improvement to the treated material, in comparison to shot peening. Laser shock peening relies on a more focused and precise peening process, whereas shot peening utilised a multitude of shots (small spherical metal/plastic/glass beads) which are projected towards a material surface (via a high pressure), which randomly impacts the material surface to create compressive residual stresses and thus improve fatigue life. Samples of AA 6056 -T 4 Aluminium alloy used for integral structures, with a thickness of 3. 2 mm were used to represent a thin-walled component. These were used for comparative testing of material properties after Laser Shock Peening and Shot peening had been executed on the test pieces. The material properties investigated were material deflection, surface roughness, micro-hardness and residual stresses at various laser intensities and shot peening pressures. Laser shock peening had shown the best results, with higher deflections between 2. 12 to 3 times higher than shot peening, a smoother surface finish (roughness values 2 - 2. 5 times less than shot peening), deeper <b>hardness</b> <b>penetration</b> and deeper residual stress into the aluminum alloy test pieces...|$|E
40|$|The {{change in}} the {{composite}} <b>hardness</b> with <b>penetration</b> depth derived from nanoindentation tests conducted on coated systems, which involve the deposition of multilayer coatings, in general exhibit a complex shape, {{as a consequence of}} the sequential contribution of each coating layer to the composite hardness during indentation loading. In spite that there are a number of models, which have been proposed for describing the change of the composite <b>hardness</b> with <b>penetration</b> depth for monolayer coatings, as well as for determining the coating and substrate hardness, very few research works have addressed the problem of describing this kind of data for multilayer coatings. In the present communication, a rational approach is proposed for extending two models widely used for the analysisof monolayer coatings, in order to describe the composite hardness data of multilayer coatings, as well as for determining the hardness of each individual layer and that of the substrate. Thus, a modified form of the models earlier advanced by Korsunsky et al. [1] and Puchi-Cabrera [2], as well as their computational instrumentation, are proposed. The extension of both models to deal with multilayer coatings is conducted on the basis of the model developed by Iost et al.

The proposed models are validated employing nanoindentation results obtained from a 2024 -T 6 aluminum alloy coated with a DLC film, employing electroless NiP as intermediate layer (Fig. 1 - 2), as well as the results obtained for a ZrN/MoN bilayer deposited onto a 316 L stainless steel substrate.

Tendency to breakage and fragmentation of CaB 6 in a contact loading zone under indenter facilitates {{formation of a}} core from fractured and powdered material, the densification of which during penetration leads to high penetration work and high resistance against penetration. Penetration resistance for each from 3 selected ceramic compositions and different B 4 C ceramic with porosity up to 30 % were calculated and used for a direct analysis of influence of the basic properties of a composite on the penetration resistance. Different components of penetration resistance were estimated and compared for compositions with different mechanical properties and structure.

40|$|Abstract. Rotary {{punching}} is a {{sheet metal}} blanking process which utilizes shearing tools fixed {{to a pair}} of rollers. The polyurethane pad is adopted as the die instead of rigid mold because it has the advantages of wide hardness range and high load-bear capacity. Due to the application of polyurethane pad, the surrounding region adjacent to the pierced hole will occur to plastically deform and deflect, which greatly differs from that in the conventional blanking. In this paper, the effects of blank material and thickness, polyurethane <b>hardness,</b> punch <b>penetration</b> depth on deformation behavior were mathematically analyzed and modeled, and then a series of experiments through varying process parameters were conducted to validate the relationship between process parameters and product quality. The degree of sample deflection was exactly measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the deformed area varies with different blank elongations and increases with increasing blank thickness for a given material. When polyurethane pad with low hardness level is employed, it results in large area deformation and quality degradation. Moreover, the deflection degreearound the hole edge becomes more severe along with punch penetration, but the penetration depth along blank thickness is not in proportion to the amount of punch advancement...|$|R

In parallel, the powders are subjected to shear testing in a range of high stresses, with the derived unconfined yield strength used, along with the indentation hardness to define the constraint factor (C).

Needle penetration, cone penetration and compression tests were used to characterise mechanical properties and acoustic properties were evaluated by simultaneous texture and sound analyses. Results were correlated with a descriptive sensory evaluation. A significant correlation was found between <b>hardness</b> (needle <b>penetration)</b> and sensory <b>hardness</b> evaluated upon biting (r = 0. 91, p < 0. 05) and between Hencky strain (compression test) and the sensory toughness (r = 0. 94, p < 0. 05). In contrast, no significant correlation was found between brittleness (cone penetration) and the sensory brittleness. The use of different mechanical methods shed light on a complex rheological behaviour of fat which demonstrates the importance of not simply relying on results from penetration tests when evaluating fat texture. For instance, a hard fat was perceived very differently depending {{on the degree of}} elasticity. A significant correlation was found between sound pressure level (simultaneous sound and texture analyses) and the sensory evaluation of the sound intensity upon breakage (r = 0. 96 and 0. 97, p < 0. 05). Both hardness and elasticity were found to be of great importance for the intensity of the sound emission i. e. a hard texture with a low degree of flexibility (less elastic) is more likely to provide a rapid energy release upon breakage and thus a high intensity sound emission...|$|R

40|$|The {{ballistic}} {{performance of}} an ultra-high hardness armour steel (UHA) has been evaluated {{for a range}} of thicknesses and obliquities against armour piercing (AP) and fragment simulating projectiles (FSPs). Together with published literature, these results enable the effect of plate hardness on performance against both AP and FSP threats to be characterized over a range of plate hardnesses from ∼ 300 to 600 HB. For AP projectiles, a complex relationship was observed that corresponded well with historical phenomenological curves describing the effect of varying projectile and armour failure mechanisms. In the ultra-high hardness regime (> 570 HB), against AP projectiles with core hardnesses of 610 - 745 HB (i. e. 7. 62 mm APM 2 and 12. 7 mm APM 2 projectiles), projectile shatter was demonstrated to be the controlling mechanism of armour performance. Against much softer FSPs (281 HB), where projectile shatter is not a relevant mechanism, the armour performance was found to initially decrease with increasing plate hardness up to ∼ 450 HB due to increased susceptibility to adiabatic shear plugging. Above ∼ 450 HB the performance was observed to plateau. The observed performance plateau appears to relate to a critical threshold for adiabatic shear failure beyond which further increases in plate hardness will not result in a decrease in performance. A number of common empirical and analytical models were applied to reproduce the experimentally-determined relationship between <b>hardness</b> and <b>penetration</b> resistance, none of which were able to qualitatively or quantitatively reproduce the observed relationships for either projectile class...|$|R

Various characteristics-colour, mechanical/rheological behaviour and thermal properties-of pork fats (backfat-PBF and trimmed fat-PTF) and konjac gel (KFG) with different physical structures (intact or ground to 4 and 8. mm) were studied. Pork fat melting processes were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at above- and below-zero temperature ranges with PBF and PTF always showing similar net results. KFG did not show any thermal event in the range from - 40 to 100 °C except the freezing/melting of its constitutional water. While water and fat binding properties of pork fats were affected by fat type and structural disintegration (ranging between 0 and 77 %), in all cases KFG presented excellent thermal water binding (< 1 %). As compared to KFG, PBF showed greater (P < 0. 05) <b>hardness,</b> chewiness, <b>penetration</b> force, gel strength, extrusion force and work of extrusion. These differences were minimized after grinding. Kramer shear values in KFG were greater (P < 0. 05) than in PBF when this was ground to 4. mm, but lower (P < 0. 05) at 8. mm. The highest Kramer shear values (P < 0. 05) were recorded in PTF irrespective of the degree of disintegration.

Risk of injury is influenced by surface properties, however there is limited understanding of the effect on hoof slip during jump landing. The objectives of this study were to compare hoof slip on two different surfaces and investigate relationships between hoof slip and surface properties. A contact mat and hoof reference marker were designed and validated, the former to indicate the moment of impact and the latter to provide a visible reference marker on the lateral hoof wall. The leading right forelimb of six horses was recorded during jump landing on two different surfaces. Five trials, plus one where the forelimb landed on a contact mat were recorded at 500 Hz using a calibrated high speed camera positioned perpendicular to landing. Surface traction, <b>hardness</b> and <b>penetration</b> were measured between horses. Horizontal displacement of the hoof reference marker was plotted and smoothed with a Butterworth filter at 25 Hz cut off. Hoof slip was measured from impact to mid-stance. Data were analysed using ANOVA and Pearson correlations. A significant difference in hoof slip (10 % wax= 4. 9 ± 2. 1 cm and, 3 % wax= 7. 4 ± 3. 6 cm) was found between the two surfaces (P< 0. 01). In addition, hoof slip was correlated with all surface measurements (hardness, traction and penetrability) on the 10 % wax surface, but none on the 3 % wax surface. Wax content appears to influence hoof slip during jump landing as greater hoof slip was measured on a 3 % wax surface and variability on this surface was greater for the group. The results suggest that wax content influenced surface properties and on the 3 % wax surface the greater variability in hardness and traction influenced the consistency with which the horses jumped upon it...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Dentistry. School of Oral Health Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa Johannesburg, 2014 Purpose: Endodontic retreatment requires {{the removal of the}} obturation material from the root canal system. Gutta percha (GP), the most commonly employed obturation material, requires mechanical instrumentation coupled with a chemical adjunct to facilitate its removal. Xylene and Eucalyptus oil are recommended as endodontic solvents due to their dissolving capacity of GP. This study sought to test the changes in the hardness and penetrability of three types of GP (Conventional, Thermafil® and Guttacore™) when exposed to these solvents, utilizing distilled water as a control. Method and materials: Textural analysis was performed to determine the hardness by testing for rigidity, and the penetrability by testing for deformation energy and resilience. These properties were tested on 81 GP cones prior to, and following solvent exposure. For each outcome variable, results were tabulated by group. Between-group differences were assessed by means of a General Linear Model, with the outcome variable as the dependent variable and the solvent, GP type and solvent-GP type interaction as the independent variables. Results: A significant decrease in rigidity and deformation energy was observed across all groups. Resilience was observed to decrease with the thermoplastic GP, Thermafil and Guttacore, but increased with conventional GP. Thermoplastic GP was more amenable to a reduction in <b>hardness</b> and <b>penetration</b> when compared with Conventional GP. A greater reduction in the hardness of Thermafil was observed with Eucalyptus oil. Conventional GP was susceptible to a significant reduction in hardness with both solvents, however its penetrability may be reduced following exposure to Xylene. Guttacore was significantly altered by both solvents. Conclusions: Considering the toxicity profile of Xylene, and the biocompatibility and antimicrobial effects of Eucalyptol, Eucalyptus oil is recommended for use during endodontic retreatment...|$|R

HIWPGs were used, because they are considered to be a suitable model material for studying proteinaceous milk fouling. This is because HIWPGs have the same nature as type "A" milk fouling and they are easy to reproduce and to dissolve in the laboratory under well-controlled conditions. The results from the HIWPGs investigations provided a good foundation for the pilot-plant investigation. In the HIWPGs studies, the effect of protein concentration and the effect of the heating/run time on the formation and dissolution of HIWPGs were investigated using HIWPGs made from different protein concentrations (14, 20, and 26 wt %) and HIWPGs produced at various heating times (60, 120, 240, 1440 and 2880 minutes). The HIWPGs were formed in tubular capsules and then dissolved in aqueous sodium hydroxide at an optimal condition of 0. 5 wt % at 60 °C. The dissolution rate calculation was based on a UV Spectrophotometer analysis. The microstructure and texture of the HIWPGs was analysed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and texture analyser. It was found that increasing the HIWPGs protein concentration from 17 wt % to 26 wt % significantly increased the gel <b>hardness</b> and the <b>penetration</b> force from approximately 8 N to 48 N and decreased the dissolution rate from 0. 34 g m- 2 S- 1 to 0. 12 g m- 2 S-I. It was also found that increasing the heating time from 60 min to 1440 mm significantly increased the gel <b>hardness</b> and <b>penetration</b> force from approximately 3 N to 25 N, and decreased the dissolution rate from 0. 40 g m- 2 S- 1 to 0. 24 g m- 2 S-I. The HIWPGs contained larger aggregates and the structure became more rigid, implicating the difficulty in cleaning. In the pilot-scale plant studies, the effects of bulk protein concentration, bulk solids content and heating/run time on the fouling and cleaning of dairy heat exchange surfaces were investigated using fouling layers produced from different concentrations of whey protein fluid, different solids content of milk fluid and fouling layers produced at various heating/run times. The fouling layers were produced by re-circulating the dairy fluids in the pilot-scale test rig. The dairy fluids used include: reconstituted whey protein, fresh whole milk, fresh skim milk, reconstituted whole milk, and reconstituted skim milk. The cleaning of the fouling layers was achieved by re-circulating aqueous sodium hydroxide (0. 5 wt %) at 60 °C, and the cleaning efficiency was monitored {{in the form of the}} recovery of the overall heat transfer coefficient while both fluid electric conductivity and turbidity were recorded as an indication of the cleaning completion. The microstructure structure of the fouling deposits was analyzed usmg scanmng electron microscope. It was found that the pilot-scale plant study results mirror the results from the HIWPGs study, increases in the bulk protein concentration, bulk solids content and the heating/run time in the pilot plant study significantly increased both the rate of fouling and the time required to remove the fouling deposit. The slopes of the overall heat transfer coefficient versus time in the cleaning curves provide a good indication of the effect of bulk protein concentration, bulk solids content and aging, particularly for the fouling formed at the earliest stage (the inner fouling layer). The inner fouling layers were affected by the initial high bulk concentration and experienced the longest aging period during the heating time, and they were the hardest to clean. Contribution of this research This research has contributed reliable data for improving the understanding of the effect of protein concentration; solids content and dairy fluids heating/run time on the fouling and cleaning of dairy heat exchangers, and will provide a strong basis and guide the decision for further studies...|$|R
30|$|With the CSM measurements, the <b>penetration</b> depth-dependent <b>hardness</b> and Young’s modulus of the {{hexagonal}} GaSe {{thin film}} were calculated {{directly from the}} load–displacement data following the analytic method developed by Oliver and Pharr [10]. The results are displayed in Figure[*] 3 b,c, respectively. In Figure[*] 3 b, the <b>penetration</b> depth-dependent <b>hardness</b> of GaSe thin films can be roughly divided into two stages, namely the initial increase to a maximum value and an asymptotic decrease toward a nearly constant value after the penetration depth reaches 50 [*]nm. The increase in <b>hardness</b> at small <b>penetration</b> depth is usually attributed to the transition between purely elastic to elastic/plastic contact whereby the hardness is really reflecting the mean contact pressure and is not representing the intrinsic hardness of GaSe. Only under a condition of a fully developed plastic zone does the mean contact pressure represent the hardness. When there is no plastic zone, or a partially formed plastic zone, the mean contact pressure (which is measured using the Oliver and Pharr method) {{is less than the}} nominal hardness. After the first stage, the hardness gradually decreases with the increasing penetration depth and eventually reaches a more or less constant value of 1.8 [*]±[*] 0.2 [*]GPa, which is in good agreement with that of the single crystal GaSe (2.0 [*]±[*] 0.4 [*]GPa) [15]. It is also noted that within the penetration depth of 50 [*]nm, the hardness appears to be quite ‘noisy’ {{as a function of the}} penetration depth, presumably due to the extensive dislocation activities being activated in this stress range.|$|R
30|$|Fig. 2 b {{displays}} the hardness of ZnO thin films calculated {{by using the}} method of Oliver and Pharr [18]. The plot {{can be divided into}} two stages, namely, increase and decrease to constant. The hardness is observed to increase with increasing the penetration depth at small depth. The increase in <b>hardness</b> at small <b>penetration</b> depth is usually attributed to the transition between purely elastic to elastic/plastic contact whereby the hardness is really the mean contact pressure. Only under a condition of a fully developed plastic zone does the mean contact pressure represent the hardness. When there is no plastic zone, or a partially formed plastic zone, the mean contact pressure (which is measured using the Oliver and Pharr method) is less than the nominal hardness. After the first stage, the hardness decreases to constant stage and reaches constant values of ZnO thin films on three various substrates, as listed in Table 1, respectively. The constant characteristic of hardness is consistent with that of a single material; therefore, the hardness values at this stage could be regarded as film-only properties. In addition, a plot of Young’s modulus of ZnO thin films on three various substrates determined using the method of Oliver and Pharr [18] is illustrated in Fig. 2 c. The variation of results is similar to those illustrating in Fig. 2 b; corresponding to the tendency of increase and decrease to constant of curves. The values of Young’s modulus for ZnO thin films are also listed in Table 1.|$|R
40|$|Bursts of tremor {{accompany}} {{a moving}} slip pulse in Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events. The sources of this non-volcanic tremor (NVT) are largely unknown. We {{have developed a}} model describing the mechanism of NTV generation. According to this model, NTV {{is a reflection of}} resonant-type oscillations excited in a fault at certain depth ranges. From a mathematical viewpoint, tremor (phonons) and slip pulses (solitons) are two different solutions of the sine-Gordon equation describing frictional processes inside a fault. In an ETS event, a moving slip pulse generates tremor due to interaction with structural heterogeneities in a fault and to failures of small asperities. Observed tremor parameters, such as central frequency and frequency attenuation curve, are associated with fault parameters and conditions, such as elastic modulus, effective normal stress, <b>penetration</b> <b>hardness</b> and friction. Model prediction of NTV frequency content is consistent with observations. In the framework of this model it is possible to explain the complicated pattern of tremor migration, including rapid tremor propagation and reverse tremor migration. Migration along the strike direction is associated with movement of the slip pulse. Rapid tremor propagation in the slip-parallel direction is associated with movement of kinks along a 2 D slip pulse. A slip pulse, pinned in some places, can fragment into several pulses, causing tremor associated with some of these pulse fragments to move opposite to the main propagation direction. The model predicts that the frequency content of tremor during an ETS event is slightly different from the frequency content of ambient tremor and tremor triggered by earthquakes.

40|$|Functionally graded, {{multilayer}} coatings {{consisting of}} alternating TiN/TiSiN layers were synthesized {{in an attempt}} to overcome the innate brittleness of TiSiN nanocomposite coatings, whilst maintaining high hardness. These coatings exhibited key structural characteristics that are known to render many naturally occurring materials extremely hard and robust. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that shear sliding of columnar TiN grains played a vital role in controlling the inelastic deformation of these coatings, conferring a greater resistance to contact damage. Moreover, nanoindentation experiments showed that the multilayer coatings exhibited high hardness, attributed to the strong shear resistance offered by the hard TiSiN layers. A dependence of coating <b>hardness</b> upon indentation <b>penetration</b> depth (h t) was found to be proportional to 1 /√h t, according to a mechanistically based model, from which the shear stress was determined. The energy dissipation during indentation was also quantified to show the critical role of the shear stress, regulated by the thickness of TiSiN layers, in resisting contact damage in the coatings. Finite-element models were constructed and the presence of transgranular cracks in the monolithic TiSiN coating was clarified based upon experimental observations. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that the transition of the dominant deformation mechanism from brittle transgranular cracking to intergranular shear sliding was controlled by the microstructural characteristics of the coatings. Enabled by the shear sliding, as well as periodic changes in elastic modulus, such a functionally graded multilayer structure was effective in lowering the magnitude and extent of stress concentrations, thereby extending the damage tolerance accessible to a ceramic coating...|$|R
