25|$|<b>Hydroxyzine</b> can be {{administered}} orally or via intramuscular injection. When given orally, <b>hydroxyzine</b> is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The effect of <b>hydroxyzine</b> is notable in 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} of <b>hydroxyzine</b> in large amounts by ingestion or intramuscular administration during {{the onset of}} pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities—when administered to pregnant rats, mice and rabbits, <b>hydroxyzine</b> caused abnormalities such as hypogonadism with doses significantly above that of the human therapeutic range. In humans, a significant dose {{has not yet been}} established in studies, and by default, the FDA has introduced contraindication guidelines in regard to <b>hydroxyzine.</b> Similarly the use in those at risk from or showing previous signs of hypersensitivity is also contraindicated. <b>Hydroxyzine</b> is contraindicated for intravenous (IV) injection, as it has shown to cause hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|Other drugs {{related to}} <b>hydroxyzine</b> are cyclizine, buclizine, and meclizine, and they share {{all or most}} of the benefits, indications, contraindications, cautions, and side effects of <b>hydroxyzine.</b> The second-generation {{antihistamine}} cetirizine is in fact one of the metabolites of <b>hydroxyzine</b> produced in the human body. Unlike <b>hydroxyzine,</b> cetirizine is not reported to appreciably cross the blood-brain barrier, but it has been reported to be associated with dystonic reactions as well as sedation. Therefore, it has a narrower spectrum of effects, making it an effective antihistamine but removing {{some or all of the}} anxiolytic and other psychoactive properties, but it may cause dystonic reactions and drowsiness in some patients.|$|E
25|$|The Tmax of <b>hydroxyzine</b> {{is about}} 2.0hours in both adults and {{children}} and its elimination half-life is around 20.0hours in adults and 7.1hours in children. Another {{study found that the}} elimination half-life of <b>hydroxyzine</b> in adults was as short as 3hours, but this may have simply been due to methodological limitations.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} been {{conducted}} which show that long-term prescription of <b>hydroxyzine</b> can lead to tardive dyskinesia after years of use, but effects related to dyskinesia have also anecdotally been reported after periods of 7.5 months, such as continual head rolling, lip licking {{and other forms of}} athetoid movement. In certain cases, elderly patients' previous interactions with phenothiazine derivatives or pre-existing neuroleptic treatment may have had some contribution towards dyskinesia at the administration of <b>hydroxyzine</b> due to hypersensitivity caused due to the prolonged treatment, and therefore some contraindication is given to the short-term administration of <b>hydroxyzine</b> to those with previous phenothiazine use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroxyzine</b> is {{a member}} of the diphenylmethylpiperazine class of antihistamines.|$|E
25|$|Administration in {{geriatrics}} {{differs from}} the administration of <b>hydroxyzine</b> in younger patients; according to the FDA, there have not been significant studies made (2004), which include population groups over 65, which provide a distinction between elderly aged patients and other younger groups. <b>Hydroxyzine</b> should be administered carefully in the elderly with consideration given to possible reduced elimination.|$|E
25|$|Analogues of <b>hydroxyzine</b> include buclizine, cetirizine, cinnarizine, cyclizine, etodroxizine, meclizine, and {{pipoxizine}} among others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroxyzine</b> is {{prescribed}} {{when the}} onset of an organic disease state manifests through anxiety, as generalized anxiety disorder, or in other more serious cases as psychoneurosis, and is therefore prescribed {{as a means of}} regulating normal function. <b>Hydroxyzine</b> has shown to be as effective as the benzodiazepine drug bromazepam in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. However, a systematic review concluded that compared with other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), <b>hydroxyzine</b> was equivalent in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability, however there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment for generalised anxiety disorder due to the high risk of bias in the reviewed studies.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine's {{predominant}} {{mechanism of}} action is as a potent and selective histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. This action is responsible for its antihistamine and sedative effects. Unlike many other first-generation antihistamines, <b>hydroxyzine</b> has very low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and in accordance, has low or no propensity for producing anticholinergic side effects. In addition to its antihistamine activity, <b>hydroxyzine</b> {{has also been shown}} to act more weakly as an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the dopamine D2 receptor, and the α1-adrenergic receptor. The weak antiserotonergic effects of <b>hydroxyzine</b> likely underlie its usefulness as an anxiolytic, as other antihistamines without such properties have not been found to be effective in the treatment of anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Somnolence with {{or without}} vivid dreams or nightmares may occur in users with {{antihistamine}} sensitivities {{in combination with other}} CNS depressants. <b>Hydroxyzine</b> exhibits anxiolytic and sedative properties in many psychiatric patients. Other studies have suggested that <b>hydroxyzine</b> acts as an acute hypnotic, reducing sleep onset latency and increasing sleep duration — also showing that some drowsiness did occur. This was observed more in female patients, who also had greater hypnotic response.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} <b>hydroxyzine</b> {{has also been}} tested {{on the ability of}} humans in the {{registration}} and storage of memory, and was used in comparison with relatively safe drugs, such as lorazepam, to illustrate the effects of benzodiazepines, which are thought to have adverse effects on the capacity of memory storage. <b>Hydroxyzine</b> was found to have no adverse effects on memory in relation to lorazepam, which caused several deficiencies in the capacity of memory storage.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) {{announced}} {{a small but}} definite risk of QT prolongation {{associated with the use}} of <b>hydroxyzine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroxyzine</b> {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier easily and exerts {{effects in the}} central nervous system. A {{positron}} emission tomography (PET) study found that brain occupancy of the H1 receptor was 67.6% for a single 30mg dose of <b>hydroxyzine.</b> In addition, subjective sleepiness correlated well with the brain H1 receptor occupancy. PET studies with antihistamines have found that brain H1 receptor occupancy of more than 50% {{is associated with a}} high prevalence of somnolence and cognitive decline, whereas brain H1 receptor occupancy of less than 20% is considered to be non-sedative.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{the use of}} sedating drugs {{alongside}} <b>hydroxyzine</b> {{can cause}} oversedation and confusion if administered in large amounts—any form of treatment alongside sedatives should be done under supervision of a doctor.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{the usage}} of <b>hydroxyzine</b> is {{as a form of}} non-barbiturate {{tranquilizer}} used in the pre-operative sedation and treatment of neurological disorders, such as psychoneurosis and other forms of anxiety or tension states.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{permanent}} effects to people from this condition. Orally administered <b>hydroxyzine,</b> an antihistamine, is sometimes prescribed to treat swimmer's itch and similar dermal allergic reactions. In addition, bathing in oatmeal, baking soda, or Epsom salts {{can also provide}} relief of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroxyzine,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Atarax and Vistaril among others, is a first-generation antihistamine. It was first {{synthesized}} by Union Chimique Belge in 1956 and was marketed by Pfizer in the United States later the same year, {{and is still}} widely used today.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroxyzine</b> {{can also}} be used for the {{treatment}} of allergic conditions, such as chronic urticaria, atopic or contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus. These have also been confirmed in both recent and past studies to have no adverse effects on the liver, blood, nervous system or urinary tract.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroxyzine</b> {{preparations}} {{require a}} doctor's prescription. The drug {{is available in}} two formulations, the pamoate and the dihydrochloride or hydrochloride salts. Vistaril, Equipose, Masmoran, and Paxistil are preparations of the pamoate salt, while Atarax, Alamon, Aterax, Durrax, Tran-Q, Orgatrax, Quiess, and Tranquizine are of the hydrochloride salt.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{antagonistic}} {{effects on}} several receptor {{systems in the}} brain, <b>hydroxyzine</b> also has anxiolytic, antiobsessive, and antipsychotic activity. Today it is used primarily for the symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested.|$|E
25|$|For {{dentistry}} and obstetrics as well {{as other}} surgeries and procedures and acute pain situations like accidents, <b>hydroxyzine</b> is useful as a first line anxiolytic and opioid adjunct because it lacks both antagonism and synergy with benzodiazepines and scopolamine, allowing either of these agents to be used simultaneously or later in the procedure if need be.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{have been}} noted in manufacturer guidelines — deep sleep, incoordination, sedation, calmness, and dizziness {{have been reported in}} children and adults, as well as others such as hypotension, tinnitus, and headaches. Gastro-intestinal effects have also been observed, as well as less serious effects such as dryness of the mouth and constipation caused by the mild antimuscarinic properties of <b>hydroxyzine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{contraindications}} {{include the}} administration of <b>hydroxyzine</b> alongside depressants and other compounds which affect the central nervous system. and if absolutely necessary, it should only be administered concomitantly in small doses. If administered in small doses with other substances, such as mentioned, then patients should refrain from using dangerous machinery, motor vehicles or any other practice requiring absolute concentration, in accordance with safety law.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{antihistamine}} effects {{it can be}} {{used for}} the treatment of severe cases of itching, hyperalgesia and motion sickness-induced nausea; it has also been used in some cases to relieve the effects of opioid withdrawal. Even though it is an effective sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic, it shares virtually none of the abuse, dependence, addiction, and toxicity potential of other drugs used for the same range of therapeutic reasons. <b>Hydroxyzine</b> has also been used to potentiate the analgesia of opioids and to alleviate some of their side effects, such as itching, nausea, and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, {{during which}} antiemetics (e.g. low dose {{haloperidol}} once at night) are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine {{is more often}} used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as ondansetron or tropisetron are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as domperidone and metoclopramide. Domperidone does not cross the blood–brain barrier and produce adverse central antidopaminergic effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. (The drug is not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (e.g. orphenadrine or diphenhydramine) may also be effective. The first-generation antihistamine <b>hydroxyzine</b> is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol relieves nausea and vomiting; it also produces analgesia that may allow lower doses of opioids with reduced nausea and vomiting.|$|E

2500|$|Central {{nervous system}} {{problems}} such as hallucinations or confusion have been observed in rare cases, attributed mostly to overdosage. [...] Such properties {{have been attributed to}} <b>hydroxyzine</b> in several cases, particularly in patients treated for neuropsychological disorders, as well as in cases where overdoses have been observed. While there are reports of the [...] "hallucinogenic" [...] or [...] "hypnotic" [...] properties of <b>hydroxyzine,</b> several clinical data trials have not reported such side effects from the sole consumption of <b>hydroxyzine,</b> but rather, have described its overall calming effect described through the stimulation of areas within the formatio reticularis. The hallucinogenic or hypnotic properties have been described as being an additional effect from overall central nervous system suppression by other CNS agents, such as lithium or ethanol.|$|E
2500|$|Pharmacokinetically, <b>hydroxyzine</b> {{is rapidly}} absorbed and {{distributed}} in oral and intramuscular administration, and is metabolized in the liver; the main metabolite (45%), cetirizine, is formed through oxidation of the alcohol moiety to a carboxylic acid by alcohol dehydrogenase, and overall effects are observed within {{one hour of}} administration. Higher concentrations {{are found in the}} skin than in the plasma. Cetirizine, although less sedating, is non-dialyzable and possesses similar anti-histaminergic properties. The other metabolites identified include a N-dealkylated metabolite, and an O-dealkylated 1/16 metabolite with a plasma half-life of 59 hours. These pathways are mediated principally by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. [...] "In animals, <b>hydroxyzine</b> and its metabolites are excreted in feces via biliary elimination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Use of <b>hydroxyzine</b> for {{premedication}} as a sedative has no {{effects on}} tropane alkaloids, such as atropine, but may, following general anesthesia, potentiate meperidine and barbiturates, and use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified {{depending upon the}} state of the individual.|$|E
2500|$|... 5) Symptomatic Control: Control of {{symptoms}} {{to some degree}} can be achieved with antihistamines (especially <b>hydroxyzine,</b> and with corticosteroids, although the potential side effects (e.g. laminitis, immune suppression) make this a less preferred option. In addition, antibiotics {{may be required to}} manage any secondary infection.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hydroxyzine</b> is {{classified}} as an antihistamine and anxiolytic and is also used as a tranquilizer; especially common in dentistry and less so in medicine, where for many years it has been preferred in combination with opioids due to its ability to counteract {{the side effects of}} opioid pain medications, namely itchiness and nausea, and the fact that its sedative properties complement the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
2500|$|As {{dihydrocodeine}} {{can provide}} a euphoric high when taken in higher-than-therapeutic doses, it is quite commonly abused recreationally. The typical recreational dose can be anything from 70mg to 500mg, or, in users with tolerance, even more. [...] Potentiators and adjuvants are often included when dihydrocodeine is used in an unsupervised fashion, especially carisoprodol, <b>hydroxyzine</b> and first-generation antihistamines, both to intensify the effect and lessen side-effects such as itching.|$|E
2500|$|Drugs {{that have}} been {{introduced}} for uses other than analgesics are also used in pain management. [...] Both first-generation (such as amitriptyline) and newer anti-depressants (such as duloxetine) are used alongside NSAIDs and opioids for pain involving nerve damage and similar problems. [...] Other agents directly potentiate the effects of analgesics, such as using <b>hydroxyzine,</b> promethazine, carisoprodol, or tripelennamine to increase the pain-killing ability of a given dose of opioid analgesic.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{comparative}} study with lorazepam on memory effects, {{patients who had}} taken <b>hydroxyzine</b> experienced sedative effects like drowsiness, but recalled that they felt capable, attentive and able to continue with a memory test under these conditions. [...] Conversely, those under the effects of lorazepam felt unable to continue {{due to the fact}} they felt out of control with its effects; 8 out of 10 patients describing tendencies of problems with balance and control of simple motor functions.|$|E
2500|$|Itching and {{flushing}} {{and other}} effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release {{in response to}} the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS or other responses elsewhere in the body. [...] First-generation antihistamines such as tripelennamine (Pyrabenzamine), clemastine (Tavist), <b>hydroxyzine</b> (Atarax), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cyproheptadine (Periactin), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), chlorphenamine (Chlor-Trimeton), doxylamine (NyQuil) and phenyltoloxamine (Percogesic Original Formula) not only combat the histamine-driven side-effects, but are analgesic-sparing (potentiating) in various degrees. The antihistamine promethazine (Phenergan) may also {{have a positive effect on}} hepatic metabolism of dihydrocodeine as it does with codeine. Higher doses of promethazine may interfere with most other opioids with the exception of the pethidine family (Demerol and the like) by this or other unknown mechanisms.|$|E
