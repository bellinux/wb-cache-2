5|$|Leo's {{election}} {{was seen as}} a victory for France, with supporters of the French celebrating in Rome's streets upon his election. Leo's election pleased the French, because he was a relative of Marie de' Medici who was happy with his election. Leo's reign, however, was limited to the month of April 1605. <b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> cold while appearing in public, and died on 27 April 1605, twenty-six days after his election.|$|E
5|$|The Toledo Maroons {{were the}} Tigers' next opponent. The Maroons were an {{independent}} team but joined the APFA in 1922. Prior to this game, the Maroons did not score a point against an APFA tem all season, and that streak continued into this game. In the first quarter, Baston blocked a kick and ran {{it for a}} touchdown. He would later score the game's final points in the fourth as <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> receiving touchdown from Pierotti.|$|E

5|$|Despite Brown's intentions, Saban {{was used}} {{occasionally}} on the Browns' offense in 1946. <b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> 44-yard pass from quarterback Otto Graham in a September {{game against the}} Buffalo Bisons. He was mainly used as a linebacker, however, and had four interceptions as the Browns won the first AAFC championship. In the offseason, he worked for Browns owner Mickey McBride's Yellow Cab Company; many of his teammates spent the offseason either at college making up for time lost to the war or taking jobs to supplement their football incomes.|$|E

After scoring another pair of touchdowns in a win against Wisconsin, Graham passed to his wide receivers for two touchdowns in a victory over the Ohio State, coached by Paul Brown, the team's only loss of the 1941 season. Northwestern ended the year with an 11th-place showing in the AP Poll of the best college teams in the country.|$|E

Afterward, his name was known {{from coast to coast}} in the worst possible way. Earp sold his interest in his horses on December 20 and left San Francisco shortly afterward. He only returned when <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> boat to Alaska. Earp's decision left a smear on his public character that followed him until he died and afterward.|$|E

5|$|Coming off {{a loss to}} Minnesota the {{preceding}} week, Penn State looked to defeat Purdue, which they had in every meeting since 2004. Though expected to beat an overmatched Purdue squad that was reeling, having lost 38–14 the prior week against Iowa, and 56–0 the week before that against Ohio State, and entering {{the game with a}} 1–8 record, the Lions would have to do so with even less depth than normal. At his mid-week press conference, Bill O'Brien announced at the midweek press conference that Ben Kline would miss the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury, for which he sustained surgery. There was also some pregame concentration surrounding the receiving corps – Allen Robinson was listed on the injury report with a shoulder injury, and Geno Lewis, who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in the season when <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> 54-yard touchdown pass against Syracuse, but had recently been relegated to special teams, was also expected to receive increased playing time in Penn State's second-to-last home game of the season.|$|E
5|$|During the 2013 preseason, Hemingway led the Chiefs in receptions and touchdowns. He {{seemed to}} have moved into the fourth wide {{receiver}} position behind Dwayne Bowe, Donnie Avery, and Dexter McCluster. In the 2013 Chiefs season opener, <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars, who had his college freshman season quarterback Chad Henne and his redshirt senior season quarterback Denard Robinson on their roster. The reception, which came from Alex Smith, was Hemingway's first in the NFL. Hemingway had a three-reception game that included the game's opening score on December 1 against the Denver Broncos. In {{the final game of}} the season, he had 5 receptions for 45 yards, giving him 13 receptions and 125 yards for the season. Hemingway also posted 2 receptions for the Chiefs in the 2013–14 NFL playoffs against Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|During the Syracuse game, Kafka set {{a school}} record for {{consecutive}} completions in a game with 16, breaking the 47-year-old record set by Tom Myers in 1962. He set a new career-high in passingyards in a game by passing for 390yards, breaking his previous career-high in the season opener. Kafka also ran for a three-yard touchdown and threw three touchdown passes along with an interception. <b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> receiving touchdown when he tossed a lateral to Andrew Brewer who threw it back to Kafka for a 24-yard touchdown. Kafka became the first Big Ten Conference player to score at least one passing, receiving and rushing touchdown in a game since Zack Mills from Penn State accomplished it on September 4, 2004, against Akron. Kafka finished the game with 35 completions on 42 attempts. However, despite his record-breaking performance, the Wildcats lost 37–34. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week on September 20 for his performance.|$|E

Upon his return to Australia, there were attempts to secure Fisher a seat in parliament and lead the Labor Party once more, {{but he was not}} interested in doing so. In 1922 he returned to London and lived in retirement at South Hill Park, Hampstead, for the remainder of his life. In his final years, Fisher gradually succumbed to the effects of dementia, such that he would ultimately lose the ability to even sign his own name. <b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> severe bout of influenza in September 1928 and died a month later. He is buried at Hampstead Cemetery in West Hampstead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} opener, the Wolverines played the Western Michigan Broncos at Michigan Stadium. The Wolverines scored first, {{midway through the}} first quarter, with a 27-yard {{touchdown}} (TD) pass from Tate Forcier to Junior Hemingway. They added to their lead five minutes later when Denard Robinson ran in a TD from 43 yards out. In the second quarter, Michigan added 17 more points: two TDs and a field goal. First was a 7-yard TD pass from Tate Forcier to Kevin Koger. 6 minutes later, Jason Olesnavage kicked a 44-yard field goal. Junior Hemingway scored Michigan's final points when <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> 44-yard TD pass from Tate Forcier, putting the Wolverines up 31–0 at halftime.

5|$|Mitchell {{was drafted}} by the Eagles with the 25th {{selection}} {{in the first round}} of the 2001 NFL Draft. He began the 2001 season as the fourth wide receiver, but surpassed Na Brown to become the team's slot receiver in week eight. Mitchell became the fourth receiver again after the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman before the 2002 season and caught only twelve passes the entire year. Mitchell became the slot receiver once again during the 2003 season, after Freeman left. In the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Green Bay Packers, with the Eagles facing a 4th and 26 situation, <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> 28-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to help led the team to a win in overtime.

5|$|Booth {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for New South Wales against Queensland in the 195455 Sheffield Shield. He made a duck {{in the first}} innings before adding 19 in the second. New South Wales won, but Booth was dropped when the Test players returned from international duty. Booth was recalled a month later for a match against Len Hutton's English cricket team at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Arthur Morris and Bill Watson had to withdraw at late notice and Booth was asked to play, having already started his day's work as a teacher at Hurlstone Agricultural College. <b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> train and arrived at the ground {{more than half an}} hour after the start of play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth came in with a borrowed cap and bat to join Peter Philpott. They put on an 83-run partnership, and Booth eventually finished the innings unbeaten on 74 as the hosts folded for 172. Booth made a duck in the second innings and took his maiden first-class wicket as New South Wales defeated Hutton's men. It was only the tourists' second loss for the campaign, and the last match in Booth's debut season.|$|E
5|$|End Dante Lavelli {{returned}} to the lineup for the Browns' week-eight game against the New York Yankees after recovering from a broken leg sustained in the preseason. Lavelli's return had an immediate impact. <b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> 29-yard pass from Graham for the Browns' first touchdown in the first quarter. Graham then threw two more touchdowns {{in the second quarter}} to Bob Cowan and Mac Speedie. Cowan scored after catching Graham's pass behind New York's defenders and running 35 yards for the end zone. Receptions by Cowan and Lavelli set up Speedie's 9-yard touchdown. Lavelli caught another touchdown {{at the beginning of the}} third quarter to give the Browns a 28–0 lead. Graham ran 22 yards for a fifth Browns touchdown in the fourth quarter after a pass play broke down. The Yankees avoided a shutout in the final minute of the game, when end Buddy Young got behind Cleveland's defenders and caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from Pete Layden. The Browns had 486 total yards in the game, including 337 yards of passing. While Cleveland remained undefeated, the San Francisco 49ers continued to hold the best record in the AAFC with nine straight wins to begin the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{first play}} of the drive was a six-yard run by Linton, and it was {{followed}} by an incomplete pass from Keldorf to Crumpler. Crumpler made up for the missed pass on the next play, when <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> short pass for a first down from Keldorf. Now at the Hokies' 31, Linton ran straight ahead for a two-yard gain. Linton's run was followed by two incomplete passes by Keldorf, but rather than punt, the Tar Heels attempted to try to convert the fourth down. The fourth-down pass fell incomplete, and the Tar Heels turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 30-yard line. Clark completed a six-yard pass to Parker, then threw an incomplete pass downfield with less than a minute remaining on the clock. On third down, Clark completed a nine-yard pass to Michael Stuewe for a first down. A first-down pass attempt was batted down by the North Carolina defense, but on second down, Clark completed a pass to Stuewe for a first down at the Tar Heels 40-yard line. After a deep pass went incomplete, Clark was sacked and fumbled the ball {{for the second time in}} the first half. The loose ball was picked up by Vonnie Holliday with 13 seconds remaining, and the Tar Heels' offense returned to the field. North Carolina tried a deep pass in an attempt to get into scoring position before the end of the half, but Keldorf was sacked and the Tar Heels kneeled on the football to end the half with a 220 lead.|$|E
