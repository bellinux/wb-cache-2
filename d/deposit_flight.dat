In Greece it is the insolvency of the government that has sunk the banks, whereas in Spain the banks are sinking the government. What is common in both countries is that when savers see the banks and the sovereign propping each other up, they run away. Unless the banks in both Greece and Spain are soon recapitalised, the ongoing gradual <b>deposit</b> <b>flight</b> might turn quickly into a classic run with incalculable consequences...|$|E
40|$|The Indian {{banking system}} was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} insulated from the global financial crisis owing to heavy public ownership and cautious management. It was thus a surprise when some banks experienced a <b>deposit</b> <b>flight,</b> as depositors shifted their money toward government-owned banks and specifically toward the State Bank of India, the largest public bank. While there was some tendency for depositors to favour healthier banks and the banks with more stable funding, the reallocation of deposits toward the State Bank of India in particular cannot {{be explained by the}}se factors alone. Nor can it be explained by the impact of explicit capital injections by the government into some public-sector banks. Rather it appears that the implicit guarantee of the liabilities of the country’s largest public bank dominated other considerations. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper scrutinizes {{the reasons}} for the European debt crisis, the {{implications}} for TARGET 2 imbalances and options for surplus liquidity absorption within an asymmetric EMU. It is argued that starting from the turn of the millennium diverging fiscal policy paths and diverging unit labour costs were the driving force of rising intra-European current account imbalances within the euro area, which were enhanced by post- 2001 low interest rate policies and changing financing conditions for the German banking sector. The paper shows how since the outbreak of the crisis the adjustment of intra-EMU current account imbalances is postponed by a rising divergence of TARGET 2 balances, as the repatriation of private international credit and <b>deposit</b> <b>flight</b> from the crisis economies is substituted by central bank credit. Given that this process has brought Deutsche Bundesbank into a debtor position to the domestic financial system, we discuss options for liquidity absorption by Deutsche Bundesbank to forestall asset price bubbles in Germany...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to banking crises, governments often embark on direct credit programs and bank nationalization schemes. A theoretical framework {{is provided in}} this paper {{to examine the effects}} of such policy measures. A crisis of confidence in the banking sector is shown to be associated with a <b>deposit</b> <b>flight</b> that results in a contraction of the liquidity pool from which banks can finance their borrowers. Although banks are assumed to be perfectly competitive, the liquidity shortage indirectly provides them with bargaining power when they negotiate their debt contracts. Credit conditions are worsened both by the lack of liquidity in the form of deposits, but also by the market power enjoyed by banks when loanable funds are scarce. Government intervention in the credit market through state-owned banks can improve the credit terms on which firms borrow, leading to less deadweight losses from firm bankruptcies. The desirability of direct lending to firms via state-owned banks is conditioned on the degree of deposit rationing experienced by the banking sector and the ability of the government itself to access liquid funds. Using a panel dataset of 157 countries over the period 1970 - 2006, I find that a moderate state ownership of banking assets that ranges between 10 % and 50 % is associated with a lower interest rate spread during a banking crisis, as well as with a higher annual growth rate of GDP per capita relative to more privatized and more nationalized banking systems...|$|E
40|$|What are {{the drivers}} {{of the large}} Target 2 (T 2) {{balances}} that have emerged in the European Monetary Union {{since the start of}} the financial crisis in 2007 ? This paper examines the extent to which the evolution of national T 2 balances can be statistically associated with cross-border private capital flows and current account (CA) balances. In a quarterly panel spanning the years 1999 to 2012 and twelve countries, it is shown that while the CA and the evolution of T 2 balances were unrelated until the start of the 2007 financial crisis, since then, the relation between these two variables has become statistically significant and economically sizeable. This reflects the "sudden stop" to private sector capital that funded CA imbalances beforehand. I next examine how different types of private capital flows have evolved over the last years and how this can be related to the evolution of T 2 balances, finding some <b>deposit</b> <b>flight</b> by private customers, a substantial retrenchment of cross-border interbank lending, and also an increase of bank's holdings of high-quality sovereign debt. My first conclusion from this analysis is that since T 2 imbalances were caused by a sudden stop and are unlikely to grow without bounds since Euro area CA imbalances are currently diminishing at a rapid pace, there is no evidence that the institutional setup of the European Monetary Union needs to be reformed fundamentally. My second conclusion relates to how the current system transfers risks across the currency union, both in terms of risk transfer from T 2 debtor to T 2 creditor nations and in terms of risk transfer from the private sector to the public sector within T 2 creditor nations. I evaluate existing reform proposals in the light of these risk transfers...|$|E

40|$|Kapton H (DuPont Trademark) {{polyimide}} specimens {{exposed to}} the low earth (LEO) space environment suffered significant weathering with surface erosions of approximately 8. 0 microns. Despite these effects, no significant changes in bulk chemistry were observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{was used to determine}} local changes induced from approximately 25 percent in 1980 vintage ground control specimens to nearly 53 percent in space exposed specimens. The greatest increase was observed for the divalent oxygen moieties, although a slight increase in carbonyl oxygen was also measured. Furthermore, the chemical shifts of all XPS peaks of space-exposed Kapton are shifted to higher energy. This is consistent with a higher oxidation state of the space exposed surface. Finally, space exposed specimens had distinct silicon peaks (2 p 100 eV and 2 s 149 eV) in their XPS spectra in agreement with widespread reports of silicon contamination throughout the LDEF satellite. These results are discussed in terms of surface reactivity of the polyimide {{exposed to the}} LEO environment and the chemical nature of contaminants <b>deposited</b> on <b>flight</b> surfaces due to satellite outgassing...|$|R
40|$|Solid-waste {{treatment}} in space for Advanced Life Support, ALS, applications {{requires that the}} material can be safely processed and stored in a confined environment. Many solid-wastes are not stable because they are wet (40 - 90 % moisture) and contain levels of soluble organic compounds that {{can contribute to the}} growth of undesirable microorganisms with concomitant production of noxious odors. In the absence of integrated Advanced Life Support systems on orbit, permanent gas, trace volatile organic and microbiological analyses were performed on crew refuse returned from the volume F "wet" trash of three consecutive Shuttle missions (STS- 105, 109, and 110). These analyses were designed to characterize the short-term biological stability of the material and assess potential crew risks resulting from microbial decay processes during storage. Waste samples were collected post-orbiter landing and sorted into packaging material, food waste, toilet waste, and bulk liquid fractions <b>deposited</b> during <b>flight</b> in the volume F container. Aerobic and anaerobic microbial loads were determined in each fraction by cultivation on R 2 A and by acridine orange direct count (AODC). Dry and ash weights were performed to determine both water and organic content of the materials. Experiments to determine the aerobic and anaerobic biostability of refuse stored for varying periods of time were performed by on-line monitoring of CO 2 and laboratory analysis for production of hydrogen sulfide and methane. Volatile organic compounds and permanent gases were analyzed using EPA Method TO 15 by USEPA et al. [EPA Method TO 15, The Determination of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Ambient Air using SUMMA, Passivated Canister Sampling and Gas Chromatographic Analysis, 1999] with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography with selective detectors.

40|$|The spare {{detectors}} from NASA Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory COMPTEL instrument {{have been}} reconfigured {{to demonstrate the}} capability at ground level to remotely locate and identify sources of g radiation or the movement of material that might shield γ-ray sources. The Gamma-Ray Experimental Telescope Assembly (GRETA) employs two 28 cm diameter scintillation detectors separated by 81 cm: one 8. 5 cm thick liquid scintillator detector and one 7. 5 cm thick NaI(Tl) detector. The assembly electronics and real-time data acquisition system measures the energy <b>deposits</b> and time-of- <b>flight</b> for each coincident detection and compiles histograms of total energy and incident angle as computed using the kinematics of Compton scattering. The GRETA field of view is a cone with full angle approximately 120 °. The sensitive energy range is 0. 3 to 2. 6 MeV. Energy resolution is ~ 10 % FWHM. The angular resolution, ~ 19 ° in the simplified configuration tested, will improve to better than 5 ° with well-defined enhancements to the data acquisition hardware and data analysis routines. When operated in the mode {{that was used in}} space, the instrument is capable of measuring and imaging up to 30 MeV with an angular resolution of 1. 5 °. The response of the instrument was mapped in the laboratory with 14 Ci 22 Na source 3 m from the instrument. Later, we conducted demonstrations under two measurement scenarios. In one, the remotely located instrument observed an increase of background radiation counts at 1. 4 MeV when a large amount of lead was removed from a building and a corresponding decrease when the lead was replaced. In the other scenario, the location and isotope-identifying energy spectrum of a 500 μCi 137 Cs source 3 - 5 m from the instrument with two intervening walls was determined in less than one minute. We report details of the instrument design and these measurements...|$|R
40|$|Migratory {{shorebirds}} are {{a dynamic}} component of New Zealand's coastal fauna, alternating between distant breeding and non-breeding grounds. The Red Knot Calidris canutus, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica and Pied Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus finschi were studied on Farewell Spit, North-West Nelson. The first two species breed in the Arctic and migrate to New Zealand for the non-breeding season. Over the southern summer they experience low thermostatic costs and generally improving prey conditions over the summer. Oystercatchers are resident over autumn and winter, so experience rising costs and declining prey quality in some species. One bivalve species, Macomona liliana, shows seasonal depth {{changes in the}} sediment, and so is largely inaccessible even to a long-billed bird such as the oystercatcher. Despite this, oystercatchers feed for less time than is available, and achieve intake rates sufficient to cover estimated needs. The energy needs of the Arctic waders rise as they prepare to migrate, and they achieve {{at least part of}} this by increasing the duration of feeding. Knots during spring tides in the premigratory period feed for the entire low-water period. Godwits are apparently less stressed, underutilising nocturnal feeding opportunities over summer. They are thought to increase feeding time by using this night-time feeding. The high energy demands for migrating birds come from the need to deposit nutrients for migration, and knots around the Auckland region are estimated to increase in mass from 115 to 185 g prior to migration. Fat deposition is not the only physiological preparation, however, and a sample of knots shot from Northland (illegally, recovered by DoC) revealed complex interactions between organs. Large amounts of fat were deposited, mostly in a subcutaneous layer but also in the abdominal cavity. Muscle protein was also <b>deposited</b> in <b>flight</b> and heart muscles, presumably to prepare for the extreme effort involved in trans-oceanic flights. At the same time, digestive organs decreased in mass. This is interpreted as freeing up muscle protein which is then deposited in organs for use during flight. Knots and godwits migrated from Farewell Spit in March. Most departures occurred in the evening and on rising tides. The former probably allows for the use of multiple navigational cues, while the latter may maximise feeding opportunities immediately before the flight. Most departures occurred after the passage of a low-pressure system or with the approach of a high-pressure system. This enabled favourable winds to be gained, so that the mean wind vector was a small tailwind. Thus, while departure directions were intermediate between the expected directions for flights to either Australia or northern New Zealand, it is probable they were able to fly across the top of a high-pressure system and gain wind assistance for a direct flight to Australia. However, the variability in flight range estimates depending on assumptions of travel-speed and protein deposition makes predicting migration routes difficult. Numbers of godwits have increased on Farewell Spit over the past decade, while oystercatchers have remained static Knots have shown a slight decline. Knot numbers are independent of national census counts so are presumably determined largely by factors operating on Farewell Spit itself. A possible mechanism that could give to a slowly declining population could be if a certain sector of the population fails to deposit sufficient nutrients to successfully migrate and return. If site-fidelity is very high (as it generally is in waders) then a long-term decrease could ensue...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) {{has been}} used to study the surface composition and chemistry of Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) exposed materials including silvered Teflon (Ag/FEP), Kapton, S 13 GLO paint, quartz crystal monitors (QCM's), carbon fiber/organic matrix composites, and carbon fiber/Al Alloy composites. In each set of samples, silicones were the major contributors to the molecular film accumulated on the LDEF exposed surfaces. All surfaces analyzed have been contaminated with Si, O, and C; most have low levels (less than 1 atom percent) of N, S, and F. Occasionally observed contaminants included Cl, Na, K, P, and various metals. Orange/brown discoloration observed near vent slots in some Ag/FEP blankets were higher in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen relative to other contamination types. The source of contamination has not been identified, but amine/amide functionalities were detected. It is probable that this same source of contamination account for the low levels of sulfur and nitrogen observed on most LDEF exposed surfaces. XPS, which probes 50 to 100 A in depth, detected the major sample components underneath the contaminant film in every analysis. This probably indicates that the contaminant overlayer is patchy, with significant areas covered by less that 100 A of molecular film. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of LDEF exposed surfaces during secondary electron microscopy (SEM) of the samples confirmed contamination of the surfaces with Si and O. In general, particulates were not observed to develop from the contaminant overlayer on the exposed LDEF material surfaces. However, many SiO 2 submicron particles were seen on a masked edge of an Ag/FEP blanket. In some cases such as the carbon fiber/organic matrix composites, interpretation of the contamination data was hindered by the lack of good laboratory controls. Examination of laboratory controls for the carbon fiber/Al alloy composites showed that preflight contamination was the most significant factor for all the contaminants generally detected at less than 1 atom percent, or detected only occasionally (i. e., all but Si, O, and C). Flight control surfaces, including sample backsides not exposed to space radiation or atomic oxygen flux, have accumulated some contamination on flight (compared to laboratory controls), but experimentally, the LDEF exposed surface contamination levels are generally higher for the contaminants Si and O. For most materials analyzed, Si contamination levels were higher on the leading edge surfaces than on the trailing edge surfaces. This was true even for the composite samples where considerable atomic oxygen erosion of the leading edge surfaces was observed by SEM. It is probable that the return flux associated with atmospheric backscatter resulted in enhanced deposition of silicones and other contaminants on the leading edge flight surfaces relative to the trailing edge. Although the Si concentration data suggested greater on-flight deposition of contaminants on the leading edge surfaces, the XPS analyses did not conclusively show different relative total thicknesses of <b>flight</b> <b>deposited</b> contamination for leading and trailing edge surfaces. It is possible that atomic oxygen reactions on the leading edge resulted in greater volatilization of the carbon component of the deposited silicones, effectively 'thinning' the leading edge deposited overlayer. Unlike other materials, exposed polymers such as Kapton and FEP-type Teflon had very low contamination on the leading edge surfaces. SEM evidence showed that undercutting of the contaminant overlayer and damaged polymer layers occurred during atomic oxygen erosion, which would enhance loss of material from the exposed surface...|$|R
