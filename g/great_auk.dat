5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> is {{the subject}} of a novel, The Last <b>Great</b> <b>Auk</b> by Allen Eckert, which tells of the events leading to the {{extinction}} of the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> as seen from the perspective of the last one alive.|$|E
5|$|Pinguinus alfrednewtoni was a larger, {{and also}} flightless, {{member of the}} genus Pinguinus that lived during the Early Pliocene. Known from bones found in the Yorktown Formation of the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina, it is {{believed}} to have split, along with the <b>great</b> <b>auk,</b> from a common ancestor. Pinguinus alfrednewtoni lived in the western Atlantic, while the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> lived in the eastern Atlantic. After the former died out following the Pliocene, the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> took over its territory. The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> was not related closely to the other extinct genera of flightless alcids, Mancalla, Praemancalla, and Alcodes.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} {{has confirmed}} morphological and biogeographical studies {{suggesting that the}} razorbill is the closest living relative of the <b>great</b> <b>auk.</b> The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> also was related closely to the little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> often {{was placed in the}} genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E

5|$|<b>Great</b> <b>Auk</b> calls {{included}} low croaking and {{a hoarse}} scream. A captive <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious. It {{is not known}} what its other vocalizations were, but {{it is believed that}} they were {{similar to those of the}} razorbill, only louder and deeper.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{valued the}} <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> {{as a food}} source during the winter and as an {{important}} cultural symbol. Images of the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> {{have been found in}} bone necklaces. A person buried at the Maritime Archaic site at Port au Choix, Newfoundland, dating to about 2000 BC, was found surrounded by more than 200 <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> beaks, which are believed to have been part of a suit made from their skins, with the heads left attached as decoration. Nearly half of the bird bones found in graves at this site were of the <b>great</b> <b>auk,</b> suggesting that it had great cultural significance for the Maritime Archaic people. The extinct Beothuks of Newfoundland made pudding out of the eggs of the <b>great</b> <b>auk.</b> The Dorset Eskimos also hunted it. The Saqqaq in Greenland overhunted the species, causing a local reduction in range.|$|E
5|$|A {{cigarette}} company, the British <b>Great</b> <b>Auk</b> Cigarettes, {{was named}} after this bird.|$|E

500|$|Walton Ford, the American painter, has {{featured}} <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> in two paintings: [...] "The Witch of St. Kilda" [...] and [...] "Funk Island".|$|R
5|$|Later, European sailors {{used the}} <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> as a navigational beacon, as the {{presence}} of these birds signalled that the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were near.|$|R
5|$|Pleistocene fossils {{indicate}} the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> also inhabited Southern France, Italy, and other coasts of the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
5|$|The Little Ice Age {{may have}} reduced the {{population}} of the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation by humans for their down drastically reduced the population. By the mid-sixteenth century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows. In 1553, the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> received its first official protection, and in 1794 Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers. In St. John's, those violating a 1775 law banning hunting the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though hunting for use as fishing bait was still permitted. On the North American side, eider down initially was preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> {{at the same time that}} hunting for food, fishing bait, and oil decreased.|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> also {{is present}} {{in a wide variety}} of other works of fiction.|$|E
50|$|The {{last known}} <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> (Pinguinus impennis) {{were killed in}} 1844 for {{specimen}} collectors, after many centuries of exploitation for meat, eggs and oil for burning. A disputed sighting in 1852 has also been debated.|$|R
50|$|The Taxidermist {{claims that}} about half of the stuffed <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> are fakes and admits to having faked one himself. He {{proceeds}} to briefly explain how it is done using the feathers of other birds.|$|R

5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> was a {{food source}} for Neanderthals more than 100,000 years ago, as {{evidenced}} by well-cleaned bones found by their campfires. Images believed to depict the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> also were carved into {{the walls of the}} El Pendo Cave, Santander in Spain and Paglicci, Italy more than 35,000 years ago, and cave paintings 20,000 years old have been found in France's Grotte Cosquer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> was {{formerly}} the mascot of the Lindsay Frost campus of Sir Sandford Fleming College in Ontario. In 2012, the two separate sports programs of Fleming College were combined and the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> mascot went extinct. The Lindsay Frost campus student owned bar, student center, and lounge is still {{known as the}} Auk's Lodge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> {{was found}} in the cold North Atlantic coastal waters along the coasts of Canada, the northeastern United States, Norway, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Ireland, Great Britain, France, and the Iberian Peninsula. Pleistocene fossils {{indicate}} the <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> also inhabited Southern France, Italy, and other coasts of the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
500|$|Female <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> {{would lay}} only one egg each year, between late May and early June, {{although}} they could lay a replacement egg {{if the first}} one was lost. In years when there was a shortage of food, the <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> did not breed. A single egg was laid on bare ground up to [...] from shore. The egg was ovate and elongate in shape, and it averaged [...] in length and [...] across at the widest point. The egg was yellowish white to light ochre with a varying pattern of black, brown, or greyish spots and lines that often were congregated on the large end. It is believed that the variation in the egg streaks enabled the parents to recognize their egg among those in the vast colony. The pair took turns incubating the egg in an upright position for the 39 to 44 days before the egg hatched, typically in June, although eggs could be present at the colonies as late as August.|$|R
5|$|It bred on rocky, {{isolated}} islands {{with easy}} access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the <b>great</b> <b>auks.</b> When not breeding, they spent their time foraging in the waters of the North Atlantic, ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.|$|R
5|$|In {{the short}} story The Harbor-Master, by Robert W. Chambers, the {{discovery}} and attempted recovery of the last known pair of <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> {{is central to the}} plot (which also involves a proto-H.P. Lovecraftian element of suspense). The story first appeared in Ainslee's Magazine (Aug 1889) and was slightly revised to become the first five chapters of Chambers' episodic novel In Search of the Unknown, (Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York, 1904).|$|R
5|$|A <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> {{appears as}} a prized {{possession}} of Baba the Turk in Igor Stravinsky's opera The Rake's Progress (libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman).|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> also {{appeared}} on one stamp {{in a set}} of five depicting extinct birds issued by Cuba in 1974.|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{frequently}} referenced extinct birds in literature, much as the famous Dodo. It appears in many works of children's literature.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents also}} took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick {{was covered with}} grey down. The young bird took {{only two or three}} weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. <b>Great</b> <b>auks</b> matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|R
50|$|This {{expedition}} {{did other}} scientific work on Funk Island, including {{the collection of}} rock specimens. During their search of the island they also discovered several iron kettles, rusted and broken, which were {{believed to have been}} used to scald the bodies of the <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> to make removal of the feathers easier. Near {{the western edge of the}} auks' breeding grounds they discovered enclosures made of granite blocks. The Auks had been herded into these compounds to make slaughtering easier.|$|R
60|$|This {{plan was}} carried out with as little delay as possible. An islet was boarded, as Squill said, and the clumsy, {{astonished}} creatures lost numbers of their companions before making their escape into the sea. A further treasure {{was found in a}} large supply of their eggs. Laden almost to the gunwale with fresh provisions, the search-party returned to their camp--some of them, indeed, distressed at having failed to find their banished friends, but most of them elated by their success with the <b>great</b> <b>auks,</b> and the prospect of soon going into pleasant winter-quarters.|$|R
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> is the mascot of the Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware, and the Adelaide University Choral Society (AUCS) in Australia.|$|E
5|$|A <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> is {{collected}} by fictional naturalist Stephen Maturin in the Patrick O'Brian historical novel The Surgeon's Mate. This work also details the harvesting of {{a colony of}} auks.|$|E
5|$|Its growing rarity {{increased}} interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. On 3 June 1844, {{the last two}} confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey, {{off the coast of}} Iceland, ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught are unconfirmed. A record of one <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The <b>great</b> <b>auk</b> is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honour of this bird.|$|E
50|$|It {{took him}} twenty days to sail across the ocean. Starting on May 10 of that year, he {{explored}} parts of Newfoundland, areas that now comprise the Canadian Atlantic provinces and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. During one stop at Îles aux Oiseaux (Islands of the Birds, now the Rochers-aux-Oiseaux federal bird sanctuary, northeast of Brion Island in the Magdalen Islands), his crew slaughtered around 1000 birds, {{most of them}} <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> (now extinct). Cartier's first two encounters with aboriginal peoples in Canada {{on the north side}} of Chaleur Bay, most likely the Mi'kmaq, were brief; some trading occurred.|$|R
50|$|Humans have {{exploited}} birds for a {{very long}} time, and sometimes this exploitation has resulted in extinction. Overhunting occurred in some instances with a naive species unfamiliar with humans, such as the moa of New Zealand, in other cases it was an industrial level of hunting that led to extinction. The passenger pigeon was once the most numerous species of bird alive (possibly ever), overhunting reduced a species that once numbered in the billions to extinction. Hunting pressure can be for food, sport, feathers, or even come from scientists collecting museum specimens. Collection of <b>great</b> <b>auks</b> for museums pushed the already rare species to extinction.|$|R
50|$|The Copenhagen Zoological Museum (Danish: Zoologisk Museum) {{is a part}} of the Natural History Museum of Denmark which {{consist of}} four natural science museums. The {{permanent}} exhibition 'From pole to pole' show animals from around the world in big displays. There is also a semi-permanent Darwin exhibition and a full collection of all the animals in the Danish territory, including Greenland. The museum has many important remains of recently extinct birds in storage, including the eyes and internal organs of the last two <b>great</b> <b>auks,</b> several specimens of the pied raven, and one of only two known complete skulls of the dodos that were taken to Europe in the 17th century.|$|R
