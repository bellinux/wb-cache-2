50|$|<b>Ethiofencarb</b> has an {{atmospheric}} half-life of 16 hours. When {{exposed to}} soil, <b>ethiofencarb</b> is moderately mobile and remains within the ground. It {{has been found}} to have a half-life of 2 weeks under greenhouse conditions. When added to water, it typically does not associate with the sediment, and can remain unchanged in an acidic environment, while it is hydrolyzed in an alkaline one. When dissolved in water, <b>ethiofencarb</b> is readily photodegraded by sunlight. <b>Ethiofencarb</b> could be transported from place to place in the environment through various natural waste pathways.|$|E
50|$|Carbamate {{groups are}} hydrolyzed to produce phenols and the N-methyl group {{undergoes}} hydroxylation. Sulfur is rapidly oxidized to give <b>ethiofencarb</b> sulfoxide. As stated above, <b>ethiofencarb</b> is stable in acidic conditions, but hydrolyzes {{when in the}} presence of a base. It was found to rapidly hydrolyze at pH conditions of 9 and 12. When subjected to sunlight, the main products that resulted from photodegredation are 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 3-methylbenzoe-1,3oxazine-2-4-dione. The main reaction to occur is the precession of <b>ethiofencarb</b> to its sulfide. When in plants, <b>ethiofencarb</b> is close to optimum lipophilicity as the plant breathes. The chemical is metabolized to a sulfoxide, to a sulfone and then hydrolyzed to a phenol sulfoxide and a phenol sulfone.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ethiofencarb</b> {{is known}} to the World Health Organization as a 'highly hazardous' {{pesticide}} and the European Union's Nordic Council of Ministers refers to it as 'dangerous to the environment'. This chemical is no longer used or produced within the United States.|$|E
50|$|Rats were {{administered}} a dosage of <b>ethiofencarb,</b> which was radio labeled, for 10 days and their urine was analyzed. It {{was found that}} 95% of the radioactivity was urinated out within 72 hours of administration. This chemical is rapidly oxidized in the bodies of mammals, hydrolyzing to phenolic metabolites.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{reversible}} acetylcholinesterase inhibition {{and difficulty}} in crossing the blood-brain barrier, this compound {{is not considered}} highly toxic to humans, {{although there have been}} a few human deaths reported. In one case, a 56-year-old gardener who had come in contact with too much of the insecticide, was found unconscious in his car after vomiting and was taken to a hospital. He developed a severe case of pulmonary edema within an hour of admission, and after three hours, he died and 26.4 mg/L <b>ethiofencarb,</b> along with 0/12 g/100 mL ethanol, 37.9 mg/L ethiofencarbsulfoxide and 0.9 mg/L ethiofencarbsulfone were found in his urine analysis.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{requirements}} to have a reaction proceed down an E1cB mechanistic pathway. The compound must have an acidic hydrogen on its β-carbon and a relatively poor leaving group on the α- carbon. The first step of an E1cB mechanism is the deprotonation of the β-carbon, resulting {{in the formation of}} an anionic transition state, such as a carbanion. The greater the stability of this transition state, the more the mechanism will favor an E1cB mechanism. This transition state can be stabilized through induction or delocalization of the electron lone pair through resonance. An example of an E1cB mechanism that has a stable transition state {{can be seen in the}} degradation of <b>ethiofencarb</b> - a carbamate insecticide that has a relatively short half-life in earth's atmosphere. Upon deprotonation of the amine, the resulting amide is relatively stable because it is conjugated with the neighboring carbonyl. In addition to containing an acidic hydrogen on the β-carbon, a relatively poor leaving group is also necessary. A bad leaving group is necessary because a good leaving group will leave before the ionization of the molecule. As a result, the compound will likely proceed through an E2 pathway. Some examples of compounds that contain poor leaving groups and can undergo the E1cB mechanism are alcohols and fluoroalkanes.It has also been suggested that the E1cB mechanism is more common among alkenes eliminating to alkynes than from an alkane to alkene. One possible explanation for this is that the sp2 hybridization creates slightly more acidic protons. Although it should be noted that this mechanism is not limited to carbon-based eliminations. It has been observed with other heteroatoms, such as nitrogen in the elimination of a phenol derivative from <b>ethiofencarb.</b>|$|E

40|$|In recent years, several {{researches}} on {{the acute}} laboratory {{toxicity of pesticides}} to bumblebees have been carried. However, only a few researches on the toxicity of pesticides to bumblebees in semi-field and field-tests have bee conducted, and thus little {{information on this subject}} is available. The Italian Ministry of Agricultural Resources and Forestry financed the “AMA” Project (Ape-Miele-Ambiente) with the aim to intensify researches on toxicological impacts of pesticides on Apoidea. Within this project, we tried to develop an extended laboratory bioassay to evaluate the effects of insecticides and acaricides on bum-blebees. In order to record the behaviour and mortality of bumblebee workers after exposure to plants sprayed with pesticides, special cages offering the bees ample flying space, were built. Prior being transferred into the cages, potted flowering cucumber (Cu-cumis sativus) plants were sprayed with different pesticides at the field rate. Three different classes of pesticides were tested: phosphorganics (chlorpyriphos-methyl, dichlorvos, dimethoate, heptenophos and quinalphos), azotorganics (<b>ethiofencarb</b> and imidacloprid) and pyrethroids (acrinathrin and bifenthrin). In a first test, in each cage, thirty bumblebees were put into contact with the plants 1 hour after the treatment. For the next three days, every 24 hours, abnormal behaviour and bumblebee mortal-ity were recorded. In a second test, the introduction of the bumblebees into the cages was delayed up to 24 hours after the treatment; behaviour and mortality were recorded over the next two days. The cages were housed in a greenhouse and tem...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytochrome}} P 450 (P 450) and flavin-containing monooxygen-ase (FMO) enzymes are {{the major}} oxidative enzymes in phase I metabolism. Many organophosphate and carbamate thioether compounds are excellent substrates for these enzymes. Stereose-lective sulfoxidation of fenthion and methiocarb by human liver, kidney, and microsomes was investigated. A high level of stereo-selectivity {{in the formation of}} fenthion () -sulfoxide was observed in kidney and intestinal microsomes. This activity was not inhibited by the P 450 inhibitor 1 -aminobenzotriazole but was dramatically reduced following mild heat treatment. In liver, fenthion was me-tabolized to its sulfoxide in a nonstereoselective manner, and the activity was sensitive to both 1 -aminobenzotriazole and heat treat-ment. The carbamate pesticide methiocarb also was sulfoxidated {{with a high degree of}} stereoselectivity in human kidney micro-somes. Human liver microsomes formed both stereoisomers in equal amounts. Sulfoxide formation in kidney was not inhibited by 1 -aminobenzotriazole but was abolished in liver microsomes. For-mation of methiocarb sulfoxides was not observed in intestinal microsomes. The relative contribution of FMO 1 and FMO 3 to the sulfoxidation of carbophenothion, demeton-O, <b>ethiofencarb,</b> fono-fos, and methiocarb also was investigated by using baculovirus-expressed recombinant proteins. FMO 1 showed the highest cata-lytic activity for all pesticides. This study indicates that FMO 1 may have a bigger role in extrahepatic metabolism than previously thought. The P 450 and FMO systems are multigene families involved in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of xenobiotics. The P 450 family is a superfamily of monooxygenases with at least 57 isoforms iden-tified in human...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of voltammetric behavior of <b>ethiofencarb</b> (ETF) is reported using glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE). With GCE, {{it is possible to}} verify that the oxidative mechanism is irreversible, independent of pH, and the maximum intensity current was observed at + 1. 20 V vs. AgCl/Ag at pH 1. 9. A linear calibration line was obtained from 1. 0 x 10 - 4 to 8. 0 x 10 - 4 mol L- 1 with SWV method. To complete the electrochemical knowledge of ETF pesticide, the reduction was also explored with HMDE. A well-defined peak was observed at – 1. 00 V vs. AgCl/Ag in a large range of pH with higher signal at pH 7. 0. Linearity was obtained in 4. 2 x 10 - 6 and 9. 4 x 10 - 6 mol L- 1 ETF concentration range. An immediate alkaline hydrolysis of ETF was executed, producing a phenolic compound (2 -ethylthiomethylphenol) (EMP), and the electrochemical activity of the product was examined. It was deduced that it is oxidized on GCE at + 0. 75 V vs. AgCl/Ag with a maximum peak intensity current at pH 3. 2, but the compound had no reduction activity on HMDE. Using the decrease of potential peak, a flow injection analysis (FIA) system was developed connected to an amperometric detector, enabling the determination of EMP over concentration range of 1. 0 x 10 - 7 and 1. 0 x 10 - 5 mol L- 1 at a sampling rate of 60 h- 1. The results provided by FIA methodology were performed by comparison with results from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique and demonstrated good agreement with relative deviations lower than 4 %. Recovery trials were performed and the obtained values were between 98 and 104 %...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{side-effects}} {{of various}} pesticides on collembolan species covering different life forms (Isotoma anglicana, Lepidocyrtus violaceus, Folsomia fimetaria, Heteromurus nitidus and Onychiurus armatus) {{were examined in}} laboratory and field experiments. The principal aim {{of the study was}} to develop choice experiments with Collembola for the quantitative assessment of avoidance behaviour. Avoidance can potentially lead to population declines due to inhibited immigration or escape from contaminated areas. One herbicide (Betanal, active ingredient phenmedipham) and five insecticides were tested. These included two synthetic pyrethroids (Karate, a. i. lambda-cyhalothrin and Cymbush, a. i. cypermethrin), two carbamates (Croneton, a. i. <b>ethiofencarb</b> and Curaterr, a. i. carbofuran) and the neem seed-kernel extract formulation NeemAzal T/S (active ingredient azadirachtin A). To determine the influence of the six pesticides on springtail mortality and mobility, acute toxicity tests over 24 hours and seven days were carried out. All pesticides except NeemAzal T/S caused inactivation of the springtails after 24 hours. Whereas the acute toxicity of Karate, Croneton, Curaterr and NeemAzal T/S could be attributed to the active ingredients, these were non-toxic in the case of Betanal and Cymbush. It is concluded that the formulations of Betanal and Cymbush contain toxic adjuvants. Effects on reproduction were assessed with F. candida. Cymbush had no adverse effect on reproduction after 28 days. All other pesticides affected reproduction with EC 50 -values below those of acute toxicity. Repellency could be stated for all six pesticides by means of choice experiments. For Betanal, Karate and Cymbush the endpoint avoidance behaviour proved to be more sensitive than reproduction. By means of the choice test behavioural reactions can be detected that could lead to an emigration of springtails out of contaminated areas and thereby affect the community structure of the biocoenosis and soil fertility. Furthermore, it provides additional, ecologically important information about side effects of pesticides on non-target organisms. Avoidance induced by vapours of the test substances was quantified using an innovative design for testing collembolan olfaction, in which O. armatus was able to detect Betanal, Croneton, Curaterr and NeemAzal T/S without direct contact. Finally, the results of the choice experiments with Betanal and Cymbush were compared with investigations in the field. For this purpose, the colonization of Betanal- and Cymbush-contaminated litterbags and -boxes by springtails was investigated. The experiments showed no significant differences between the colonization of contaminated areas and controls...|$|E
