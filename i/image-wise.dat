50|$|Trent Reznor {{overhauled}} {{the band}} line-up and image for the tour; guitarist Robin Finck joined to play guitar while Danny Lohner joined {{on to play}} bass guitar. However, Chris Vrenna and James Woolley were brought back from the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. <b>Image-wise,</b> instead of the sloppy, low-budget style for previous tours, the band often dressed in black leather smothered in cornstarch, with band members often changing their hairstyles to radical hair styles for every concert. Robin Finck used makeup to hide his eyebrows, and Reznor would often don his 'fishnet gloves' (as they would come to be known) for the show. The band's showy yet intense tour style gave the band comparisons to David Bowie, whom Reznor was a big fan of. Later in the tour, Bowie and Reznor's protégé, Marilyn Manson, would often join the frontman on stage to sing their songs - as evident in the Closure tour documentary.|$|E

Accurate radiometric processing and atmospheric correction is required when data sets from different dates and sensors, collected in varying illumination conditions, are combined. Performance of novel radiometric block adjustment method, developed at Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, is evaluated with multitemporal hyperspectral data set of seedling stands collected during spring and summer 2016. Illumination conditions during campaigns varied from bright to overcast. We use two different methods to produce homogenous image mosaics and hyperspectral point clouds: <b>image-wise</b> relative correction and <b>image-wise</b> relative correction with BRDF.

In this study, we use a recurrent neural network with attention on convolutional network features. We apply it to delineate skin strata in vertically-oriented stacks of transverse RCM image slices in an interpretable manner. We introduce a new attention mechanism called Toeplitz attention, which constrains the attention map to have a Toeplitz structure.

40|$|International audienceThe {{subject of}} {{antialiasing}} techniques has been actively explored {{for the past}} 40 years. The classical approach involves computing the average of multiple samples for each final sample. Graphics hardware vendors implement various refinements of these algorithms. Computing multiple samples (MSAA) can be very costly depending on {{the complexity of the}} shading, {{or in the case of}} raytracing. Moreover, image-space techniques like deferred shading are incompatible with hardware implementation of MSAA since the lighting stage is decorrelated from the geometry stage. A filter based approach called Morphological Antialiasing (MLAA) was recently introduced [2009]. This technique does not need multiple samples and can efficiently be implemented on CPU using vector instructions. However, this filter is not linear and requires deep branching and <b>image-wise</b> knowledge which can be very inefficient on graphics hardware. We introduce an efficient adaptation of the MLAA algorithm running flawlessly on medium range GPUs...|$|E
40|$|Resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) is a {{powerful}} in-vivo tool for examining the functional architecture of the human brain. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability to characterize transitions between functionally distinct cortical areas through the mapping of gradients in intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) profiles. To date, this novel approach has primarily been applied to iFC profiles averaged across groups of individuals, or in one case, a single individual scanned multiple times. Here, we used a publically available R-fMRI dataset, in which 30 healthy participants were scanned 10 times (10 min per session), to investigate differences in full-brain transition profiles (i. e., gradient maps, edge maps) across individuals, and their reliability. 10 -min R-fMRI scans were sufficient to achieve high accuracies in efforts to "fingerprint" individuals based upon full-brain transition profiles. Regarding test-retest reliability, the <b>image-wise</b> intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was moderate, and vertex-level ICC varied depending on region; larger durations of data yielded higher reliability scores universally. Initial application of gradient-based methodologies to a recently published dataset obtained from twins suggested inter-individual variation in areal profiles might have genetic and familial origins. Overall, these results illustrate the utility of gradient-based iFC approaches for studying inter-individual variation in brain function...|$|E

Since our method simultaneously optimizes and learns spatial transformations for the image registration, our method can be directly used to register a pair of images, and the registration {{of a set of}} images is also a training procedure for FCNs so that the trained FCNs can be directly adopted to register new images by feedforward computation of the learned FCNs without any optimization.

40|$|A {{digital image}} {{hardcopy}} device {{has been designed}} using a laser exposure mechanism, a pigmented wax /resin donor ink sheet, and an opaque receiver sheet. The writing system relies on <b>image-wise</b> thermal mass transfer of molten ink to the receiver {{in order to produce}} high resolution output. With the receiver media and a specially designed donor ribbon being held to a platen through vacuum pressure, a pulsed solid-state diode pumped near IR NdrYAG laser provides the energy necessary to complete the thermal transfer process. By varying pulse width, dot size variation is possible. A mathematical model was developed to explain the physics of the imaging process and aid further experimentation. In order to maximize photothermal conversion and transfer efficiency while maintaining environmental friendliness, a water/ alcohol based multi-layer donor ribbon was designed. Digital image analysis techniques and processing algorithms were developed specifically to provide a reliable quantification scheme for all variables. A randomized four factor central composite design provided a statistically robust means by which to map measured image quality. Response surface methods of factorial experimental design afforded a means to model the ribbon design space. Utilization of the Downhill Simplex Method (Nelder and Mead, 1965) yielded the optimum point on the estimated image quality response surface. The optimum point represented the final donor ribbon composition. It is primarily the continuously variable dot size capability and high thermal efficiency of the developed system that sets this research apart from other published works related to laser driven thermal transfer...|$|E
40|$|Future {{orbiting}} observatories will survey {{large areas}} of sky in order to constrain the physics of dark matter and dark energy using weak gravitational lensing and other methods. Lossy compression of the resultant data will improve the cost and feasibility of transmitting the images through the space communication network. We evaluate {{the consequences of the}} lossy compression algorithm of Bernstein et al. (2010) for the high-precision measurement of weak-lensing galaxy ellipticities. This square-root algorithm compresses each pixel independently, and the information discarded is by construction less than the Poisson error from photon shot noise. For simulated space-based images (without cosmic rays) digitized to the typical 16 bits per pixel, application of the lossy compression followed by <b>image-wise</b> lossless compression yields images with only 2. 4 bits per pixel, a factor of 6. 7 compression. We demonstrate that this compression introduces no bias in the sky background. The compression introduces a small amount of additional digitization noise to the images, and we demonstrate a corresponding small increase in ellipticity measurement noise. The ellipticity measurement method is biased by the addition of noise, so the additional digitization noise is expected to induce a multiplicative bias on the galaxies' measured ellipticities. After correcting for this known noise-induced bias, we find a residual multiplicative ellipticity bias of m ~ - 4 x 10 ^{- 4 }. This bias is small when compared to the many other issues that precision weak lensing surveys must confront, and furthermore we expect it to be reduced further with better calibration of ellipticity measurement methods.

40|$|Women {{who perform}} popular music are also {{performing}} gender. This is both because gender {{can be understood}} as performance and because musical conventions and styles carry with them assumptions about femininity and masculinity. This thesis concerns three female popular music artists; Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Tori Amos and Gillian Welch, and their performances of femininity. As these artists have been presented as or have presented themselves as in some way "authentic", my readings of these artists include considerations of whether or not they perform femininity in ways that are likely to be interpreted as "authentic". The thesis is divided into one theoretical chapter where central concepts are discussed, three case studies - one of each artist - and a concluding chapter. In the case studies I am particularly concerned with the artists' vocal techniques, stylistic musical choices and visual representations. Kim Gordon's performances are marked by a stylized take on femininity - and indeed masculinity. Sonic Youth's music has a self-reflexive relationship with the history of rock, and Gordon likewise seems to have a self-reflexive relationship with femininity. Gordon confronts certain clichés and stereotypes, musical and visual, and uses them to appear as both girl and woman, and yet somehow neither. The song "Quest for the Cup" (1994) is a short yet interesting example of how Gordon uses her voice to invoke feminine personae and themes while remaining in the safe position as cool and detached anti-rock star. In the song "Professional Widow" (1996), Tori Amos explores a classic feminine type of the darker kind, the femme fatale. Using the harpsichord in a pseudo heavy rock style as well as the conventions of nightclub and piano bar music, Amos stays within a seemingly strategic use of popular music conventions before finally breaking out of the pop song format in the intense coda, symbolising a quest for freedom within the female situation, represented by the female voice. Amos's femme fatale tries to attain masculine power and grandeur through a glorification of femininity, but in a way she seems to remain a little envious of men. Country music is a performative kind of genre that is particularly reliant on traditions, both musically and <b>image-wise.</b> Gillian Welch's performances are both limited and liberated by country music tropes. With her old-fashioned dresses and serious dedication to the style and instrumentation of old-time country music, Welch often casts herself as the typical good and virtuous woman of country music culture. On the other hand, Welch also draws upon her own biography to present herself as a female version of the homeless "rambler". Moreover, as her songs often are written as stories, Welch sometimes sings as a male character but in such cases, for example the song "Red Clay Halo" (2001), her vocal technique relies more on notions of class than notions of gender. Welch thus gains freedom to move between gender identities by staying within the performance conventions of a certain kind of music...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of last November&# 8217;s federal election Simon Crean voyaged to the wilds of south-western Sydney in search of answers for Labor&# 8217;s defeat, and {{the eyes of the}} media followed. For a few days the casual television viewer was treated to cameos of the shopping centres of Sydney&# 8217;s outer suburbs, its yawning expanses of suburban and semi-rural sprawl, its multi-car garages, walled estates and multi-storey red-brick castles. Somewhere around here, Crean and the media hoped together, could be found the elusive secrets of the &# 8216;aspirationals&# 8217;, that newly-discovered demographic whose flights of electoral fickleness have been causing political parties of all complexions such heartache. Traditionally, the electoral battlefield of Sydney has been characterised by a form of regional trench warfare, with the harbour as no-man&# 8217;s-land. Booth after booth north of Sydney Harbour has voted solidly for the Coalition for generations, while the inner- and mid-West have been and remain wastelands for the Liberals. Yet over the last decade these deeply engraved trench-lines have been suddenly out-flanked. Westwards, &# 8216;to the green fields beyond&# 8217;, Sydney&# 8217;s fast-growing outer-suburban fringe has revealed itself to be a highly volatile electoral terrain, superficially Labor in appearance but increasingly Liberal in voting behaviour. And so the national media packed its sandwiches for its brief excursion to Sydney&# 8217;s south-west. In truth, the journey was somewhat overdue. In Sydney few journalists or social commentators venture beyond the Tropic of Polished Floorboards, and sage judgements about something called generically &# 8216;the West&# 8217; are woven out of a colourful yarn of guesswork and hearsay. One strand of hoary journalistic folklore imagines Sydney&# 8217;s outer west as an undifferentiated badlands of deprivation, unemployment and boredom. Another decries it as a pilot-program for the imagined horrors of an &# 8216;Americanised&# 8217; suburban megalopolis. Recent newspaper and radio debates have agonised over the supposed dangers of what are referred to as the region&# 8217;s &# 8216;American-style gated communities&# 8217; or even &# 8216;walled camps&# 8217; - somewhat lurid descriptions for what in many cases are simply tidy housing developments pragmatically bundled together to save on amenities. In other commentaries the entirety of south-western Sydney is imaginatively reshaped in the image of its few most dysfunctional housing estates. Even the experienced Peter Botsman, head of the newly established Whitlam Institute at the University of Western Sydney&# 8217;s Parramatta campus (some thirty kilometres to the north-east), has recently been indulging in some rather Dickensian word-pictures, portraying south-western Sydney generally as a gaggle of &# 8216;lost suburbs&# 8217; perched {{at the end of a}} &# 8216;freeway of despair&# 8217;, where fragmented communities eke out a subsistence on benefits doled out from fenced &# 8216;welfare compounds&# 8217;. These are the kinds of lurid images local activists in the outer west have laboured for decades to overcome. The image of a region focused on quotidian pragmatism and the brute necessities of life is equally hard to shake. When the Urban Frontiers Program, also at the University of Western Sydney, released a detailed report on community attitudes across the broader Western Sydney region in October last year, the responses to their findings were almost as worthy of remark as the findings themselves. Asked for their positive and negative feelings, their personal concerns and the main problems of the region, almost eight hundred respondents consistently reported as positive features the region&# 8217;s community spirit, affordable housing and living space, while criticising its traffic and travel problems and the prevalence of crime and drugs. Asked to cite improvements in their suburb since they had moved in, they most often nominated improved shopping facilities, followed at some distance by public transport and roads. Given the sprawling, open-knit character of much of the region, and the most common reasons people choose to move there, none of this was too surprising. And it was accompanied by a solid vote of approval by respondents for the particular local communities of which they felt a part. Yet it led to a public bout of anguish and embarrassment as to why residents across these various localities had not said more about the presence or absence of theatres, restaurants and sundry other cultural facilities. The image of the outer West as a monolith is similarly tenacious, and not much less misguided. When asked by the Urban Frontiers researchers what community they most closely associated with, more than two-thirds of residents nominated their suburb of residence, while the remainder was more or equally split between &# 8216;Western Sydney&# 8217;, &# 8216;Sydney&# 8217; and &# 8216;no opinion&# 8217;. Sydney&# 8217;s outer south-west, in particular, has developed into a highly-variegated patchwork of distinct local communities, some rural or semi-rural, some suburban, others high-rise, and others again based around those clusters of off-the-rack &# 8216;plan homes&# 8217; aimed at space-hungry young home-buyers fired with a dream of growing families and rolling billiard-rooms. Come election-time the electorate of Macarthur - which covers the long flat plain southwards from Badgerys Creek to Campbelltown - resembles nothing so much as a motley collection of medieval villages, each writing their entry in the Domesday Book. The image of the outer south-west as a lost &# 8216;Labor heartland&# 8217; is now fading. In fact, the region has become one of the more electorally volatile areas in the country. In 1996 the seat of Macarthur swung sharply to the Liberals, by a matter of 12 per cent in two-party terms; Labor&# 8217;s primary vote fell to 32 per cent. In 1998 Labor clawed back a couple of percent, but in 2001 it suffered another big swing, and is down to 43 per cent of the two-party vote. Key factors here are the relatively recent arrival of so many residents into growth areas like Camden and Campbelltown, the extremely limited impact of non-European migration in much of the region, and the limited attachment of many residents to a &# 8216;sense of place&# 8217;. Here, it often seems, no one is &# 8216;rusted on&# 8217; to anything more ancient than the foundation of their local neighbourhood centre. More than a third of those Western Sydney residents interviewed by the Urban Frontiers researchers had moved into their neighbourhood in the last five years. And more than a half (rising to almost 70 per cent among the young) envisaged that they would move on from Western Sydney at some point. Take Penrith, for example&# 8230; Perhaps even more striking is the example of Penrith, some twenty or thirty kilometres to the north-west. Wind along the confusion of two-lane roads which substitute for a radial road network in Western Sydney to the base of the Blue Mountains, and you will find yourself in the orderly conurbation that centres upon Penrith and St Marys. In the early 1990 s Lindsay, the federal seat here, was imagined by many electoral observers to be Safe Labor. No more. In 1993 Labor still dominated the two-party-preferred vote 60 per cent to 39 per cent. In the 1996 poll, on One Nation&# 8217;s first outing, Labor&# 8217;s primary vote collapsed by more than 18 per cent, and the Liberals&# 8217; Jackie Kelly won on One Nation preferences with a modest buffer. While Labor&# 8217;s primary vote has recovered somewhat, the two-party-preferred drift has continued ever since, and Lindsay is now not too far from becoming Safe Liberal. Prior to the 1998 federal poll, which attached Lindsay reasonably securely to the Liberals for the first time, the National Tertiary Education Union commissioned Saulwick to conduct detailed opinion polling in the electorate. The results, from the union&# 8217;s perspective, were rather chastening. Few among those interviewed ranked tertiary education as an issue of great importance, despite the presence of university campuses in the locality. The great bulk of those who were concerned about the issue were self-identified Labor supporters. This is less than surprising given that, according to the research, Labor supporters in Lindsay are actually more likely than Coalition supporters to have completed a tertiary degree. Conversely, One Nation&# 8217;s support was strongest among those residents who had left high school before Year 12. In short, there was a strong correlation between education levels and voting patterns - but a correlation directly inverse to that which one might have expected to find in Western Sydney a generation ago. Number-crunching after the 2001 poll by the market-research firm Australian Development Strategies suggests that the trend noticed in Lindsay in 1998 is not an isolated one. ADS notes significant swings to Labor nationally among those holding tertiary qualifications, and surmises, reasonably enough, that it was these groups who responded most favourably to the Knowledge Nation package. Such a swing has relatively little consequence in Lindsay. Conversely, Labor&# 8217;s vote fell most markedly among tradespeople and middle-level mortgage-payers - two groups heavily over-represented in the Penrith area as a whole. Jackie Kelly was a conspicuously unsuccessful federal minister, and anyone who has endured one of her public addresses will be keenly aware of her limited political repertoire. Yet in Lindsay her personal popularity seems almost boundless. The reasons are perhaps not too hard to find. Kelly is a former New Zealand army officer who lost a technical challenge against her election in 1996, on the grounds that she had failed to take out Australian citizenship. In the by-election which followed her vote increased once more, at the expense of her competent but decidedly donnish Labor opponent, Ross Free. In the process she became a more moderate local version of Pauline Hanson: a personable, unremarkable but hard-working young woman who could claim to have overcome the obstacles placed in her path by clever CBD lawyers and well-scrubbed Labor advisers. Yet the official campaign posters of her 2001 Labor opponent, David Bradbury, contrived to make him look unnervingly like an identikit portrait of, well, a clever young CBD lawyer and well-scrubbed ministerial adviser. Clearly Labor has some work to do in the choice of its candidates here. At first blush Penrith is a solidly blue-collar town, loosely woven together out of a patchwork of struggling flat-dwellers, prospering tradespeople and cashed-up evacuees from the newly-gentrified inner-city searching for the great Australian backyard. Here the hoon&# 8217;s car of choice is still the souped-up V 8 Falcon, rather than the customised Subaru WRX. And in the liquor stores bourbon walks out the door a good deal quicker than bottled red wine. Yet the cultural antennae of the inner-city observer, so finely-tuned to the frequencies of real estate and renovation, can easily lose reception here. There are roads full of fibro cottages and those &# 8216; 60 s units, sure enough, but there are also broad streets lined with grandiose red-brick mansions with vast crew-cut lawns and cement front porticos, and in some neighbourhoods there are more backyard swimming-pools than you could poke a skimmer at. And the apparently homogenous topography now resounds to the real-estate agent&# 8217;s mantra of Position, Position, Position. Werrington Downs is definitely not Werrington. <b>Image-wise,</b> Emu Plains is more than a quick burn away from South Penrith. There are rural enclaves around Orchard Hills where the National Party would poll handsomely. Take the train three stops up to Glenbrook, in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, and you are suddenly in a countrified version of Sydney&# 8217;s North Shore. Stroll through the town centre and these complexities become easier to understand. Once the prime shopping strip was the long die-straight course of High St, with its shabby arcades and its narrow footpath. But in the 1980 s the vast emporium and car-park of Penrith Plaza was born, and almost instantly the rest of retail Penrith emptied itself into this vast suburban Crystal Palace, leaving the surrounding streets to the wholesale fabric dealers and the tattoo joints. On a Thursday night you can wander through the rest of Penrith almost unobserved, but stroll through the electric doors of the Plaza and you are assailed with a wall of sound and light. Of course there are all the routine talismen of the suburban shopping-centre: sportswear shops stocked to the rafters with Nike and Adidas, temporary stalls selling fluoro mobile-phone covers, men&# 8217;s clothes shops stacked with $ 100 suits and polyester polo-shirts, and long trestle-tables laid out with not-so-kosher budget CDs. But there&# 8217;s also an ABC Shop with specials on BBC TV-chefs, a Body Shop with tasteful little agitprop placards, and a gourmet deli which sells salted anchovies and prosciutto by the chunk. The made-over Grace Bros now smells of pot-pourri and perfume, and the homeware shop displays $ 700 coffee-makers in the window. All the little tokens of inner-city sophistication are insinuating themselves, one by one. Like the other main conurbations of the outer-west, Penrith is a city of new arrivals. Back in the early 90 s the local rugby league football team, the Panthers, won the premiership and the region was briefly swamped in bunting. But grab a seat in the local stadium on match day now and it&# 8217;s obvious how well the locals are reconciled to the possibility of defeat. The cheering and booing alike is curiously subdued: even the referee gets an easy time of it. On weekday evenings the first-grade players train in a neighbouring park without arousing evident interest. After more than thirty years in the &# 8216;elite&# 8217; competition the players and fans alike still feel like well-behaved newcomers. More influential than their football team, so far as the locality is concerned, are the licensed club which bears the team&# 8217;s name, and the all-pervasive network of local and junior sporting clubs which prosper in its shadow. The licensed club, which now prefers to be called &# 8216;Panthers World of Entertainment&# 8217;, makes the 20, 000 -seat football stadium look like a neighbourhood basketball court. Opened in the 1950 s by a local footballer&# 8217;s wife out of the proceeds of a lottery win, it shed its footballing cocoon in the 90 s and took wing first as the state&# 8217;s largest licensed premises, and now as a diversified business empire spanning the entire outer-west and rural NSW. The headquarters at Penrith is a veritable entertainment-industry Palace of Versailles, complete with statuary and fountains; the grounds boast an Aqua Golf course, a waterski park and 200 acres of cycling and walking tracks. The parking lot is itself one of Penrith&# 8217;s major meeting-places for local young people, and on Friday nights it echoes to the dull growl of dozens of over-tuned engines circling around and around in first gear. Bowling alone? Everybody nowadays champions the virtue of community. In the hands of political scientists the term often acquires a misty aura of post- 1960 s &# 8216;activism&# 8217;, urban environmentalism and civic planning. Out here the reality is decidedly less heroic. The Urban Frontiers survey found that a third of those residents of the region who volunteer do so in the name of their local church, while another third do so through a local sporting club. No other institutions rated so much as a blip on the radar. In the Penrith area the Panthers empire constitutes one of these two poles, while the other belongs to the region&# 8217;s growing crop of humble-looking evangelical churches, whose parishioners have renounced corporate denominational loyalty for personal scriptural commitment. The huge illuminated panther, glowing on the highway like the invitation to a vast celestial motel, perhaps stands as a marker of those primal regional virtues of family, friends and locality. The string of squat structures with their winking illuminated crosses likewise serve as markers to the region&# 8217;s characteristic sober-minded personal independence. Neither sits easily with Labor&# 8217;s new generous-spirited cosmopolitanism. Labor has a lot of learning to do.
