5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E

The best change for the year appeared {{in the form of}} the fully synchronized 150-T model three-speed manual transmission as standard equipment, meaning the end of non-synchromesh units in VAM cars. The new transmission was joined by a 3.73:1 rear differential gear ratio. <b>Hazard</b> <b>lights</b> were added to the standard equipment list.|$|E

2500|$|Emergency vehicle {{lighting}} is {{one or more}} visual warning lights fitted to a vehicle for use when the driver wishes to convey to other road users the urgency of their journey, to provide additional warning of a hazard when stationary, {{or in the case}} of law enforcement as a means of signalling another driver to stop for interaction with an officer. [...] These lights may be dedicated emergency lights, such as a beacon or a light bar, or may be modified stock lighting, such as a wig-wag or hide-away light, and are additional to any standard lighting on the car such as <b>hazard</b> <b>lights.</b> [...] Often, they are used along with a siren (or occasionally sirens) in order to increase their effectiveness. [...] In many jurisdictions, the use of these lights may afford the user specific legal powers, and may place requirements on other road users to behave differently, such as compelling them to pull to the side of the road and yield right of way so the emergency vehicle may proceed through unimpeded.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a blue light (VISBL) dosimeter. The VISBL dosimeter is based on the combination of polysulfone and phenothiazine as a potential VISBL dosimeter for population studies of exposures related to the blue <b>light</b> <b>hazard.</b> This research found that this combination of photosensitive chromophores reacts to both ultraviolet and visible wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Further to this, the majority of the ultraviolet wavelengths below 380 nm can be filtered out {{with the use of a}} low pass filter. It was found that a large change in optical absorbance at 437 nm occurred when the dosimeter was employed to quantify the solar blue <b>light</b> <b>hazard</b> exposures. Preliminary results indicate that this dosimeter saturates relatively slowly and is able to measure exposures equivalent to more than 1200 kJ/m 2 of blue <b>light</b> <b>hazard</b> weighted solar radiation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{adverse effects}} to ocular health caused by {{exposure}} {{to high levels of}} solar radiation are of great concern and can result in the severe degradation of vision capabilities. Solar radiation in the blue part of the spectrum (effectively 380 to 550 nm) is found to trigger a reaction in the eye and has been characterized by the blue <b>light</b> <b>hazard.</b> This blue <b>light</b> photochemical injury to the human retina is termed photoretinitis. Photoretinitis can result from either viewing an extremely bright light source for {{a short amount of time}} or a less bright source for a longer period of time. Excessive exposure to harmful blue light radiation is linked to the increased risk of macular degeneration in humans. Age related macular degeneration is recognised as the leading cause of severe blindness in the Australian population. Therefore, it is essential to decrease any exposure to damaging blue light radiation that the population experiences. Quantification of the individual level of radiation exposure requires personal dosimetry that takes into account changes in the position and orientation of people compared to the light sources. A prototype photosensitive polymer is currently being developed that can be used for the measurement of blue light exposures to humans. The prototype polymer only responds to wavelengths associated with the blue <b>light</b> <b>hazard</b> and is expected to be a useful tool for measuring radiation associated with the blue <b>light</b> <b>hazard...</b>|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to determine the thermal sensitivity and water discharge requirements for pendent and sidewall extended coverage sprinklers (with standard and quick response thermal sensitive elements) in <b>light</b> <b>hazard</b> occupancies. Approval criteria were sought which would allow for simpler installation standards than those of existing extended coverage sprinklers. A series of free burn full-scale tests with heptane pool fires {{was conducted}} to determine the response of sprinklers {{as a function of}} the Response Time Index (RTI), Conduc-tivity Factor (C), temperature rating, and room dimensions for a selected fire size. In addition, a series of six full-scale sprinklered fire tests {{was conducted to}} determine sprinkler discharge requirements using a <b>light</b> <b>hazard</b> scenario. Based on the test results, recommenda-tions for approval criteria for pendent and sidewall standard response and quick response, extended coverage sprinklers have been made in terms of RTI, C, temperature rating, water densities, and wall wetting capabilities.
