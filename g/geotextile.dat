The most apparent example of this was the <b>geotextile</b> that had been placed by Kempinski to cover the painted plaster floor in the palace hall. Since 1993, the <b>geotextile</b> had bonded to the plaster, and this made it impossible to remove the <b>geotextile</b> without destroying the floor.

40|$|Innovative <b>geotextiles</b> {{formed from}} meandrically {{arranged}} ropes {{were used for}} the protection of the steep slope in the gravel pit Nieboczowy. The <b>geotextiles</b> from textile wastes were produced. Segments of <b>geotextiles</b> were mounted on the slope in winter. After installing for six months the slope condition was monitored. It was found that immediately after installation the <b>geotextiles</b> prevent the ground sliding. Ropes laterally arranged on the slope absorb significant amounts of water and create microdam system, which slow down a runoff. In spring the <b>geotextiles</b> accelerate the development of vegetation. Lush vegetation covering the entire surface of the slope supports the stabilizing effect of <b>geotextiles.</b> <b>Geotextiles</b> effectively protect the embankment against landslides and the consequences of surface erosion. <b>Geotextiles</b> can be successfully applied in the process of reclamation of disused gravel pits...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-speed}} railway {{project for}} trains with speeds of 160 – 180 km/h was recently completed in Malaysia. An array of geosynthetics such as biaxial geogrids, non-woven <b>geotextiles</b> and woven <b>geotextiles</b> were extensively {{used in the}} project primarily for separation, filtration and reinforcement purposes. The geosynthetics were particularly used at locations of high embankments underlain by soft clays and loose sands. Ground improvement using geosynthetics in the project primarily included geogrid-reinforced piled embankments with individual pile caps, geogrids at bridge approach transitions, geogrids for ground treatment beneath culverts, geogrids for culverts supported by stone columns, woven <b>geotextiles</b> for cement column works, non-woven <b>geotextiles</b> for excavation works, non-woven <b>geotextiles</b> {{at the top of}} the railway subgrade layer, non-woven <b>geotextiles</b> for temporary retaining walls and non-woven <b>geotextiles</b> for slope protection works.

25|$|Modern buried pipe drains often {{consist of}} corrugated, flexible, and {{perforated}} plastic (PE or PVC) pipe lines wrapped with an envelope or filter material {{to improve the}} permeability around the pipes and to prevent entry of soil particles, which is especially important in fine sandy and silty soils.

25|$|Due {{to their}} primary {{function}} {{of being the}} discharge of treated stormwater, infiltration systems are generally positioned as the final element in a WSUD system. Infiltration trenches should not be located on steep slopes or unstable areas. A layer of <b>geotextile</b> fabric {{is often used to}} line the trench in order to prevent the soil from migrating into the rock or gravel fill. Infiltration systems are dependent on the local soil characteristics and are generally best suited to soils with good infiltrative capacity, such as sandy-loam soils, with deep groundwater. In areas of low permeability soils, such as clay, a perforated pipe may be placed within the gravel.|$|E
25|$|The {{juxtaposition}} {{of the various}} types of geosynthetics just described with the primary function that the material is called upon to serve allows for the creation of an organizational matrix for geosynthetics; see table below. In essence, this matrix is the “scorecard” for understanding the entire geosynthetic field and its design related methodology. In the table the primary function that each geosynthetic can be called upon to serve is seen. Note that these are primary functions and in many cases (if not most) cases there are secondary functions, and perhaps tertiary ones as well. For example, a <b>geotextile</b> placed on soft soil will usually be designed {{on the basis of its}} reinforcement capability, but separation and filtration might certainly be secondary and tertiary considerations. As another example, a geomembrane is obviously used for its containment capability, but separation will always be a secondary function.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Koons {{designed}} Split-Rocker, {{his second}} floral sculpture made of stainless steel, soil, <b>geotextile</b> fabric, and an internal irrigation system, which was first {{shown at the}} Palais des Papes in Avignon, France.

40|$|Since <b>geotextiles</b> {{have been}} {{progressively}} incorporated into coastal protection structures, {{the influence of}} installation damage on them has been the primary concern. During installation/construction, <b>geotextiles</b> are repeatedly subjected to high mechanical stresses which often exceed service stress. It is therefore vital to evaluate the mechanical and hydraulic damage and determine the consequences of these damages to better develop criteria for selection of suitable products. As these damages could reduce the material's mechanical strength and hydraulic efficiency, or in the severest form of damage, puncturing, would end the separation function. The properties investigated in this paper include the permittivity and apparent opening size (AOS) of <b>geotextiles.</b> Generally, the greater the drop energy of armour units applied to <b>geotextiles,</b> the greater the potential for damage. Findings show that the residual permittivity could increase significantly, 45 % during installation. The preliminary design of coastal structures will be optimised as engineers and designers can better estimate the amount of damage on <b>geotextiles</b> upon installation...|$|R
25|$|Reinforcement is the {{synergistic}} {{improvement of}} a total system’s strength created {{by the introduction of}} a <b>geotextile,</b> geogrid or geocell (all of which are good in tension) into a soil (that is good in compression, but poor in tension) or other disjointed and separated material. Applications of this function are in mechanically stabilized and retained earth walls and steep soil slopes; they can be combined with masonry facings to create vertical retaining walls. Also involved is the application of basal reinforcement over soft soils and over deep foundations for embankments and heavy surface loadings. Stiff polymer geogrids and geocells {{do not have to be}} held in tension to provide soil reinforcement, unlike geotextiles. Stiff 2D geogrid and 3D geocells interlock with the aggregate particles and the reinforcement mechanism is one of confinement of the aggregate. The resulting mechanically stabilized aggregate layer exhibits improved loadbearing performance.|$|E
25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of <b>geotextile</b> material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the effects of coir <b>geotextiles</b> inclusion as inter layer in improving shear resistance of contact layers. Flexible pavements are complex structures consisting of several layers of asphalt and granular materials. This pavement layers including overlays are subjected to tangential force and there is a chance of slipping of layers and which will induce parabolic crack and heaving. This is predominant especially in the case of braking, overtaking zones, intersections and grade separations. Non-linear mechanical behaviour of the pavement materials combined with the randomness in traffic and environmental conditions complicate the issue.
