5|$|Orm was {{concerned}} with priests' ability to speak the vernacular, and developed an idiosyncratic spelling system to guide <b>his</b> <b>readers</b> in the pronunciation of the vowels.

5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told <b>his</b> <b>readers</b> how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that <b>his</b> <b>readers</b> were already familiar {{with the concept of}} transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider's {{knowledge on}} many subjects, {{as a result}} of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents. For example, De Vries states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks as others asserted. While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming <b>his</b> <b>readers</b> would have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{take issue with}} James Conant’s claim that Johannes Climacus seeks to engage <b>his</b> <b>reader</b> in the Postscript by himself {{enacting}} the confusions to which he thinks <b>his</b> <b>reader</b> is prone. I contend that Conant’s way of reading the Postscript fosters a hermeneutic of suspicion that leads him (and those who follow his approach) to be unduly suspicious of some of Climacus’ philosophical activity. I argue that instead of serving as a mirror of <b>his</b> <b>reader’s</b> faults, Climacus is better conceived of as a Socratic figure whose own philosophical activity represents a positive alternative to the Hegelian style of doing philosophy that is under attack in the Postscript. I close the paper by arguing that Climacus adopts two very different experimental stances in his two books: while in Fragments Climacus adopts the stance {{of someone who has}} “forgotten” about Christianity, in the Postscript he openly declares that he is not a Christian and then proceeds to investigate the question, appropriately cast in the first person, “How do I,Johannes Climacus, become a Christian?” I maintain that we will not {{be in a position to}} appreciate what makes the Postscript a profound work of philosophy until we obtain a better understanding of the various respects in which Climacus is a Socratic figure...|$|R

5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of <b>his</b> <b>readers,</b> who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because <b>his</b> <b>readers</b> would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{returned}} to Bucharest: in summer 1912, {{with help from}} journalist Rudolf Uhrinowsky, the young writer was employed by a French-language gazette, L'Indépendence Roumaine, informing <b>his</b> <b>readers</b> that he had also become the sole legitimate Caragiale family representative in Romania. In October, he became {{the chief of staff}} in the Ministry of Public Works in the second Titu Maiorescu executive, under Minister Alexandru Bădărău. He had manifested a relative interest in politics around 1908, after his father rallied with Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democratic Party; at the time, he criticized Ion Luca's political choices, but nonetheless noted that it could serve as a means for his own advancement ("From now on I'll have political lode , something certain, if there ever was certainty on Earth.") Four years after this comment, soon after making his literary debut, he clashed with his father over having considered a cabinet appointment in Ionescu's executive.|$|E

40|$|Interpreters {{have noticed}} that Nietzsche, in {{addition}} to sometimes being uproariously funny, reflects more on laughter and having {{a sense of humor}} than almost any other philosopher. Several scholars have further noticed that Nietzschean laughter sometimes seems to have an epistemic function. In this chapter, I therefore assume that Nietzsche is a pluralist about the functions of humor and laughter, and seek to establish the uses he finds for them. I offer an interpretation according to which he tactically uses humor and laughter for epistemic purposes. His epistemic aims include enabling inquiry (when faith and reverence might have forbidden it), achieving knowledge (for himself or for <b>his</b> <b>reader),</b> and abandoning error (again for himself or for <b>his</b> <b>reader).</b> Humor supports these goals by inducing contempt and the laughter that expresses (and sometimes also conjures) it...|$|R
5|$|Despite the BJP's {{shift away}} from {{explicit}} Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji ("Guru worthy of worship"). According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain {{the workings of the}} RSS to <b>his</b> <b>readers</b> and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.|$|E
5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches of the men and women <b>his</b> <b>readers,</b> as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{juxtapose}} two points about the ends {{and means of}} Kierkegaard's indirect communication: that Kierkegaard wrote {{with the intention of}} having some kind of effect on his readers; but that his writing style was so peculiar that it grossly jeopardized the possibility of such an effect. The suspicious and obscure nature of most of his books, particularly the "aesthetic" texts, fosters mistrust in the reader, breaking the contact between reader and writer. Without the writer overtly standing behind what he writes, it is unreasonable to expect someone to be influenced by what he reads or even to read it seriously. Yet, Kierkegaard hoped to find <b>his</b> <b>reader</b> developing a serious attitude and to be moved in a certain direction, namely towards religiousness. The question is how these two facts about his work come together, and my answer {{is that there is a}} third, hidden element at work in the relationship between Kierkegaard and <b>his</b> <b>reader.</b> Namely, he postulates the authoritative revelation of the religious spirit, and this is responsible for influencing the reader, not Kierkegaard himself. His own role as a writer is to release this stronger communication on <b>his</b> <b>reader,</b> by undermining the latter's capacity to ignore the spirit. Hence, the above problematic juxtaposition is mediated by an external and covert element being inserted into Kierkegaard overall project...|$|R
