5|$|Fielding's thirteenth play, The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 {{nights at}} Drury Lane, rivalling {{the run of}} the Provok'd Husband and Zara for {{production}} length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and <b>even</b> <b>put</b> on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy struck on 1 January 1862, when Arthur Brittan {{drowned in}} the Avon River while {{learning}} to swim. He got entangled in watercress, which the Brittans themselves had introduced to the Avon, {{and it took a}} half-hour for his body to be recovered. Arthur had left school by then and was helping his father on the farm. Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and there are indications that he went through a period of depression. Soon after the drowning, he advertised for both a dairyman and a farmworker, and <b>even</b> <b>put</b> Linwood House up for sale, though no property transaction was recorded.|$|E

No other party <b>even</b> <b>put</b> up a candidate when filing closed on April 30, handing the seat to Mario Diaz-Balart.|$|E
25|$|Jan Swammerdam {{was among}} the first to {{experimentally}} study muscle contraction. He used frog leg muscle along with its adherent nerve as a model for his experiments and observed muscle thickening (contraction) on nerve irritation (stimulation). He later on improved upon his technique by putting two needles at the muscle ends which showed movement on nerve stimulation. He <b>even</b> <b>put</b> the muscle into a glass pipe to avoid direct touching of its belly and used brass wire to fix the nerve and silver wire to stimulate it. Though he was very close in understanding the true nature of bioelectricity in neurophysiology; his experiments have greatly inspired many budding neurophysiologists.|$|E
25|$|The WWF had {{effectively}} {{doubled the}} size of its roster through its acquisition of WCW, and as a result, there was not enough screen time for everyone. The original plan was to find a time slot on TNN to continue running WCW as a separate entity. Polls were <b>even</b> <b>put</b> up on WWF.com and WCW.com to decide the name of the new show. These plans fell through when no TV station would touch WCW because of its reputation for losing money. The WWF eventually carried out a brand extension, effectively reviving WCW under its own auspices and running two separate promotions, each with one of the WWF's two existing televised shows, Raw and SmackDown!.|$|E

25|$|During the night, {{the captains}} of the French fireships did they best {{to fill their}} vessels with gunpowder, and on 6 July, under the escort of 5 sailing ships {{commanded}} by Duquesne, they went to {{set fire to the}} remaining Spanish galleys. All of them were still abandoned, so it was easy for the French to burn them. Both in the naval battle and the attack on the harbor, no more than fifty Frenchmen were killed. Frustrated by their defeat, the Spaniards <b>even</b> <b>put</b> a price on Sourdis' head. The Duke of Fernandina managed to escape with the galleys which had failed to break the French blockade, claiming to have won the battle for having introduced some relief into Tarragona. Some Spanish historians give credit to this claim, but other, like the Catalan Víctor Balaguer, said that the 11 ships which entered the port were not full of supplies but full of men, which worsened the situation in the city and made a second relief necessary.|$|E
25|$|His next {{aim was to}} {{make the}} {{imperial}} crown hereditary. Henry tried to secure the Imperial election of his son Frederick II as King of the Romans, which however met with objections raised by Archbishop Adolf of Cologne. Spending the winter in Hagenau Castle, the emperor and his ministeriales evolved the idea of a hereditary monarchy. Though they would have lost their right to elect the kings, the secular princes themselves wished to make their Imperial fiefs hereditary and to be inheritable by the female line as well, and Henry agreed to consider these demands. The emperor also bought the support of ecclesiastical princes by announcing that {{he would be willing to}} give up the Jus Spolii and the right to receive recurring earnings from church lands during a period of sede vacante. At the Diet of Würzburg, held in March/April 1196, he managed to convince the majority of the princes to vote for his proposal. However, Archbishop Adolf of Cologne did not <b>even</b> <b>put</b> in an appearance and several princes, predominantly in Saxony and Thuringia, were still dissatisfied.|$|E

500|$|The sailing {{capabilities}} of the Mary Rose were commented on by her contemporaries and were once <b>even</b> <b>put</b> to the test. In March 1513 a contest was arranged off The Downs, west of Kent, in which she raced against nine other ships. She won the contest, and Admiral Edward Howard described her enthusiastically as [...] "the noblest ship of sayle [...] gret ship, at this howr, that I trow [...] be in Cristendom". Several years later, while sailing between Dover and The Downs, Vice-Admiral William Fitzwilliam noted that both the Henry Grace à Dieu and the Mary Rose performed very well, riding steadily in rough seas {{and that it would}} have been a [...] "hard chose" [...] between the two. Modern experts have been more sceptical to her sailing qualities, believing that ships at this time were almost incapable of sailing close against the wind, and describing the handling of the Mary Rose as being like [...] "a wet haystack".|$|E
500|$|Paul McCartney later {{stated that}} Julia living in sin with Dykins {{while she was}} still married was a point of social ostracization for Lennon, as it was often used as a [...] "cheap shot" [...] against him. Although Julia never {{divorced}} Alf, she was considered to be the common-law wife of Dykins. She wanted Lennon to live with them both, but he was passed between the Stanley sisters and often ran away to Mimi's, where she would open the door to find Lennon standing there, [...] "his face covered in tears". Julia was accused by the family of being frivolous and unreliable— she never enjoyed household chores— and was once seen sweeping the kitchen floor with a pair of knickers on her head. Her cooking methods were also haphazard, as she would mix things [...] "like a mad scientist", and <b>even</b> <b>put</b> tea [...] "or anything else that came to hand" [...] in a stew.

500|$|The {{king vulture}} was {{originally}} described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae as Vultur papa, the type specimen originally collected in Suriname. It was reassigned to the genus Sarcoramphus in 1805 by French zoologist André Marie Constant Duméril. The generic name is a New Latin compound formed from the Greek words σάρξ (sarx, [...] "flesh", the combining form of which is σαρκο-) and ῥάμφος (rhamphos, [...] "crooked beak of bird of prey"). The genus name is often misspelled as Sarcorhamphus, improperly retaining the Greek rough breathing despite agglutination with the previous word-element. The bird was also assigned to the genus Gyparchus by Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger in 1841, but this classification is not used in modern literature since Sarcoramphus has priority as the earlier name. The species name is derived from Latin word papa [...] "bishop", alluding the bird's plumage resembling the clothing of one. The king vulture's closest living relative is the Andean condor, Vultur gryphus. Some authors have <b>even</b> <b>put</b> these species in a separate subfamily from the other New World vultures, though most authors consider this subdivision unnecessary.|$|E
