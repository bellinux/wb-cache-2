5|$|Various {{parts of}} the main volcano have been {{subjected}} to <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration.</b> The Azufrera stage edifice was subject to the most alteration; especially in the summit area and between the Angulo and Azufrera summits lie sulfur rich talus deposits. The central part of the complex is heavily altered by fumarole activity. <b>Hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration</b> may be driven by the formation of a deep magma reservoir and resulting hydrothermal circulation in overlying rocks.|$|E
5|$|Two {{abandoned}} sulfur mines can {{be found}} {{north and south of}} Llullaillaco. The northern mine is known as Azufrera Esperanto and associated with an area of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration.</b> A path or road leads up to that mine from northwest.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{is part of}} {{the active}} tectonic belt which is {{responsible}} for the formation of the Himalayas following the collision of India and Asia. As a result of this activity, <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration</b> and hydrothermal activity are expected to be widespread in Pakistan. Koh-i-Sultan is the youngest volcano in Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|Minerals in the Tajamar {{ignimbrite}} include biotite, hornblende, plagioclase, quartz {{and some}} augite. The eruption products are uniformly dacitic in nature. <b>Hydrothermal</b> <b>alterations</b> have generated Sb-Au and Pb-Ag-Zn deposits {{that may be}} of economic importance. The La Poma-Incachule mining district northeast of the caldera {{is part of the}} volcanic system and contains argentiferous galena, sphalerite, antimonite and arsenopyrite. These deposits formed through <b>hydrothermal,</b> deuteric <b>alteration</b> and supergene processes and were influenced during their formation by local fault systems.|$|R
40|$|The Herja {{ore deposit}} {{is one of}} the most known of the Baia Mare Neogene metallogenetic {{district}} and is associated with a complex stock of Pannonian age. The <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alterations</b> associated with the mineralizations are represented by: the propylitization, the argillization, the phyllic and potassic alteration. The monoascenedant character of the mineralizations is predominant. The magmatic intrusions have been sequential placed and have represented the heat, metals and hydrothermal solutions source. In the first stages of mineralization the hydrothermal solutions contain predominantly magmatic water and in the final stages the water is of connate and meteoric origin. According to the structural magmatic control, to the mineralogical composition and to the <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alterations,</b> the Herja ore deposits are of a low sulphidation epithermal systems type. ...|$|R

5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration</b> of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration</b> of {{the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing {{deposits}} has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
40|$|The Miocene magmatic {{intrusion}} in the Tavşanlı {{zone of the}} Kütahya-Bolkardağ Belt (KBB) in the northwestern region of Turkey {{is represented by the}} Eğrigöz granitoids. This paper studies the petrology and geochemistry of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alterations</b> associated with the vein-type Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization hosted by this pluton, focusing on the determination of the mass gains and losses of chemical components, which reflect the chemical exchanges between the host rocks and hydrothermal fluids. Vein-type Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization is closely associated with intense <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alterations</b> within the brecciation, quartz stockwork veining, and brittle fracture zones that are controlled by NW-SE trending faults cutting through the Eğrigöz granitoids. Paragenetic relationships reveal three stages of mineralization: pre-ore, ore, and supergene. The ore mineralogy typically includes hypogene chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, and pyrite, with locally supergene covellite, malachite, and azurite. Wall-rock hypogene <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alterations</b> include pervasive silicification, sulfidation, sericitization, and selective carbonatization and albitization. These are distributed in three main alteration zones (zone 1 : silicified/iron carbonatized alterations ± albite, zone 2 : argillic-silicic alterations, and zone 3 : phyllic alterations). Based on the gains and losses of mass and volume (calculated by the GEOISO-Windows™ program), zone 1 has a higher mass and volume gain than zones 2 and 3. Non-systematic zonal distributions of alterations are observed in which the silicic-carbonate alterations +/− albitization appeared in zone 1 in the center and the phyllic-argillic alterations appeared in zones 2 and 3, with an increase in base metals (Cu-Pb-Zn) in the zone from Cu, Cu-Pb, to Cu-Pb-Zn moving outwards...|$|R
30|$|These {{observations}} {{indicate that}} the PDC deposits contain abundant blocky rock fragments with various degrees of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alterations.</b> The presence of hydrothermally altered minerals {{and the absence of}} vesiculated juvenile materials in these PDC deposits {{indicate that the}} 2015 eruption occurred from the hydrothermal system sealed inside the edifice of Shindake. The mineral assemblage of the hydrothermally altered minerals indicates low pH environment of the hydrothermal system.|$|R

It is located in southeastern part of Republic of Macedonia, more precisely on Ograzden mountain, at about 17 km at a distance from Strumica city, near Ilovitza village...|$|R
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration</b> of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. This heat may have been {{replenished}} from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough to be visible from ASTER satellite image but barely visible from the ground. The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E
5|$|Boron has two {{naturally}} occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference {{results in a}} wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and −. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration</b> of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the − ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.|$|E
25|$|Spectacular {{hydrothermal}} {{features are}} a part of the Richat Structure. They include the extensive <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration</b> of rhyolites and gabbros and a central megabreccia created by hydrothermal dissolution and collapse. The siliceous megabreccia is at least 40m thick in its center to only a few meters thick along its edges. The breccia consists of fragments of white to dark gray cherty material, quartz-rich sandstone, diagenetic cherty nodules, and stromatolitic limestone and is intensively silicified. The <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration,</b> which created this breccia, has been dated to have occurred about 98.2 ± 2.6million years ago using the 40Ar/39Ar method.|$|E

Magmatic dykes and magmato-hydrothermal mineralized veins strike NE-SW and have accommodated NW-SE stretching.

25|$|Changes in {{temperature}} and pressure, and composition alter the mineralogy {{of a rock}} sample. Changes in composition {{can be caused by}} processes such as weathering or metasomatism (<b>hydrothermal</b> <b>alteration).</b> Changes {{in temperature}} and pressure occur when the host rock undergoes tectonic or magmatic movement into differing physical regimes. Changes in thermodynamic conditions make it favourable for mineral assemblages to react with each other to produce new minerals; as such, it is possible for two rocks to have an identical or a very similar bulk rock chemistry without having a similar mineralogy. This process of mineralogical alteration is related to the rock cycle. An example of a series of mineral reactions is illustrated as follows.|$|E
