5|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} {{and government agencies}} have special requirements to show, in financial statements and reports, how money is spent, rather than how much profit was earned.

5|$|Wage growth {{beginning}} in 1950 pushed prices up. The inflation rate increased faster, and soon real wages fell.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the causal {{relationship}} between public <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> the GDP growth in the Palestinian territories over the period of 1994 - 2013. For this purpose trends in both public <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> GDP growth in Palestine are discussed, the paper also explored the relevant literature regarding Wagner’s Law and the recent related empirical studies in various countries of the world. The study has adopted recent advances of econometric techniques. For this purpose, stationarity properties of the data and the order of integration of the data are empirically investigated by the Augmented-Dickey Fuller (ADF) test in the first place. Hypothesis of a long-run relationship between public <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> GDP growth has been tested by Engle-Granger co-integration test. Depending on the co-integration results of the six versions of Wagner’s Law, the findings reveal {{that there is a}} co-integration between public <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> GDP growth. Such results indicate that there is a long-run relationship between public <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> GDP growth for the Palestinian case. On the basis of the Granger causality tests, we also found that both public <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> GDP have a cause effect on each other, the findings also suggest that both public <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> GDP are growing substantially and hence validate Wagner’s Law in the case of Palestine...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the causal relationship between military <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> {{economic growth in}} Zimbabwe. The causality relationship between government military <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> economic growth has so far received attention from many economists, the dominant ones being Wagner (1890) and Keynes (1936). According to literature, there currently exist four perspectives around the causality relationship military <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> economic growth. The first perspective by Keynes (1936) suggests that military expenditure spur economic growth whilst the second perspective by Wagner (1890) mentions that economic growth affects military expenditure. The third perspective says both military <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> economic growth affects each other whilst the fourth perspective suggests the existence of no causality relationship at all between military <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> economic growth.

5|$|Diocletian {{separated}} and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing {{the largest and}} most bureaucratic government {{in the history of the}} empire. He established new administrative centres in Nicomedia, Mediolanum, Antioch, and Trier, closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome had been. Building on third-century trends towards absolutism, he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's <b>expenditures</b> <b>and</b> necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.|$|E

Also, by employing the Heckman selection models, we study how environmental <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> investment by Swedish industrial firms responded to the national and international policies directed to mitigate air pollution during the period 1999 through 2008. We find that firms that use carbon intensive fuels such as oil and gas {{are more likely to}} spend to and invest in the environment. Larger, more profitable and more energy intensive firms are more likely to incur environmental expenditure/investment. Overall, an important finding of our econometric analysis is that environmental regulation both on the national and international levels are highly relevant motivations for environmental <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> investment. environmental <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> investment; environmental policy; EU ETS; panel data...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamic}} {{interaction between the}} public sector <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> national income in India for the period 1960 - 61 to 1996 - 97.

The study also indicates that long-run positive impact of public sector expenditure on national income would turn adverse if {{the growth of the}} former is excessive. In the short-run, however, there is a trade-off between growth in public sector <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> income. Thus, though national income growth in India seems to be investment or demand led, there is the need for maintaining a proper balance between public sector <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> investment for economic growth. ...|$|R

The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize <b>expenditures</b> <b>and</b> taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct.|$|E

5|$|As secretary, Calhoun had {{responsibility}} for management of Indian affairs. He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, {{to preserve the}} sovereignty of eastern Indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments. In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes. Calhoun opposed the invasion of Florida launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the First Seminole War, which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe. The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the Adams–Onís Treaty. A reform-minded modernizer, he attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in the Indian Department and in the Army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads, but Congress either {{failed to respond to}} his reforms or responded with hostility. Calhoun's frustration with congressional inaction, political rivalries, and ideological differences spurred him to create the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824. The responsibilities of the bureau were to manage treaty negotiations, schools, and trade with Indians, in addition to handling all <b>expenditures</b> <b>and</b> correspondence concerning Indian affairs. Thomas McKenney was appointed as the first head of the bureau.|$|E

While the 75th Congress had in excess of 300Democrats, many of them were conservative, and Voorhis emerged as a leader of a progressive caucus of some 50 representatives.
