60|$|She {{came out}} to him from an inner room almost at once. His <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> her feverishly. He almost held his breath. Then he gave a great sigh of satisfaction. She came with her hands outstretched, a {{welcoming}} smile upon her lips. She was {{just as he had}} expected to find her. There was nothing in her manner to indicate that they had not parted yesterday.|$|E
60|$|And {{even as his}} restless <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> the {{surrounding}} landscape, they turned to where, {{in the shadow of}} the stately palaces of Tiberius and of Augustus, lay the house of Dea Flavia. Its gilded portals threw back with brilliant intensity the weird and elusive light of the waning moon, and high above, upon the balustrade of the roof, gigantic bronze groups of quaint and misshapen beasts looked ghoul-like against the canopy of the sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be. I suppose God chooses one's parents quite deliberately. Praise Him from Whom all blessings flow!" [...] She {{smoothed}} out her black cloak over her ankles, raised her face {{again into the}} dwindling moonlight, and gently smiled at me. [...] "I am glad I came, Midgetina, though it's suicidally cold. 'Pardi! on sent Dieu bien Ã  son aise ici.' We {{are going to be}} great friends, aren't we?" [...] Her <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> me. [...] "Would you like that?" ...|$|E
60|$|Poirot {{stepped forward}} briskly. Manning's <b>eye</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> {{him with a}} faint contempt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Every one {{you don't}} know here is in with that gang," [...] {{declared}} Dorn, and {{he waved a}} swift hand at the groups. His <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> piercingly <b>over,</b> and apparently through, the men nearest at hand.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} for a moment or two, whilst young Hortensius' glowing <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> questioningly <b>over</b> the assembly. Everyone there knew of his passion for the Augusta, a passion, in truth, shared by many of those who had the {{privilege}} of knowing her intimately, and strangely enough though the proposal had so much daring in it, it met with but little opposition.|$|R
6000|$|... "As he who {{climbs to}} {{mountain}} tops pants hard for breath; so panted I for Mardi's grosser air. But that which caused my flesh to faint, was new vitality to my soul. My <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> all before me. The spheres were plain as villages that dot a landscape. I saw most beauteous forms, yet like our own. Strange sounds I heard of gladness that seemed mixed with sadness:--a low, sweet harmony of both. Else, I know not how to phrase what never man but me e'er heard.|$|E
6000|$|Betty {{went forward}} {{to meet her}} friends while Colonel Zane {{continued}} talking, but now to himself. [...] "What a fatal beauty she has!" [...] His <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Helen with the pleasure of an artist. The fair richness of her skin, the perfect lips, the wavy, shiny hair, the wondrous dark-blue, changing eyes, the tall figure, slender, but strong and swelling with gracious womanhood, made a picture he delighted in and loved to have near him. The girl did not possess for him any of that magnetism, so commonly felt by most of her admirers; but he did feel how subtly full she was of something, which {{for want of a}} better term he described in Wetzel's characteristic expression, as [...] "chain-lightning." ...|$|E
6000|$|He glanced curiously about him. Twenty {{feet away}} a weary-faced sailor was calking the deck. As his eyes lingered on the man, he saw {{suddenly}} arise {{from under his}} hands a faint spiral of haze that curled and twisted and was gone. By now he had reached the deck. His bare feet were pervaded by a dull warmth that quickly penetrated the thick calluses. He knew now {{the nature of the}} ship's distress. His eyes roved swiftly forward, where the full crew of weary-faced sailors regarded him eagerly. The glance from his liquid brown <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> them like a benediction, soothing them, rapping them about as in the mantle of a great peace. [...] "How long has she been afire, Captain?" [...] he asked in a voice so gentle and unperturbed that it was as the cooing of a dove.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{whatever}} {{was to be}} seen between the point and the jetty. The stretch of Diamond Bay was {{like a piece of}} purple shadow, lustrous and empty, while beyond the land, the open sea lay blue and opaque under the sun. Heyst's <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> all <b>over</b> the offing till they met, far off, the dark cone of the volcano, with its faint plume of smoke broadening and vanishing everlastingly at the top, without altering its shape in the glowing transparency of the evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-morning, Mrs. Baker," [...] he said, pleasantly, {{with his}} hat already in his hand, [...] "I'm Harry Home, of San Francisco." [...] As he spoke his <b>eye</b> <b>swept</b> approvingly <b>over</b> the neat inclosure, the primly-tied papers, and well-kept pigeon-holes; {{the pot of}} flowers on her desk; her china-silk mantle, and killing little chip hat and ribbons hanging against the wall; thence to her own pink, flushed face, bright blue eyes, tendriled {{clinging}} hair, and then--fell upon the leathern mailbag still lying across the table. Here it became fixed on the unfortunate wire of the amorous expressman that yet remained hanging from the brass wards of the lock, and he reached his hand toward it.|$|R
60|$|Cecil drifted away, and Andrew {{glanced at}} his card. There were two dances {{for which he was}} still engaged, and he made his way slowly back to the ballroom. There was a slight block at the entrance, and he had to stand aside to let several couples pass out. One of the last of these was Jeanne, on the arm of young Bellamy Smith. Andrew stood quite still looking at her. He saw her start for a moment as she {{recognized}} him, and her <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> him <b>over</b> with a half incredulous, half startled expression. She drew a little breath. And then Andrew saw her suddenly and instinctively stiffen. She looked him in the face and bowed very slightly, without the vestige of a smile.|$|R
6000|$|Afterwards her admirers {{spoke of}} her voice as being one of her chief charms; to Paul {{it sounded like a}} soft strain of very sweet, {{throbbing}} music, reaching him from some far distant world. Yet, curiously enough, it went far to dissolve the spell which her presence seemed to have laid upon him. He was able to look at her steadily, and standing upon the wet pavement in the cold, grey light of that November afternoon, their eyes met in a long, searching gaze. He was able even to notice trifles. He saw the rich fur which lined her plain, black cloak, and he could even admire the absolute perfection with which it followed the lines of her slim, supple, figure. He saw the glowing eyes shining out from her dusky face, and the coils of brown hair, not very securely fastened under her turban hat. As she put out her foot to enter the cab, he could even {{catch a glimpse of the}} amber draperies concealed by her cloak. A dancer! A public dancer! His <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> her again, taking in every detail of her simple but rich toilette, and he shivered slightly. Then he answered her, [...] "It is of no consequence, thank you. I can walk." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the sharp}} {{feminine}} <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> the flower bed they detected {{at once the}} hollow in the middle, showing careless workmanship {{on the part of}} somebody. [...] "That hole must be filled up," [...] promptly declared Mrs. James; but first, woman-like, she thrust her trowel deep into it. [...] "Aha! a rock--careless man," [...] she gave judgment, and took another jab and a two-handed heave at the hard object. Whereupon out came the big mud-turtle, scrambling, hissing, protesting with beak and claw against being driven out of the best nest she had ever found so early in the season. That night there were curious sounds in the grass and dead leaves--rustlings and croakings and low husky trills, as the toads came hopping briskly by twos and threes down to the pond. From every direction, from garden and lawn and wood and old stone wall, they came croaking and trilling through the quiet twilight, and hopping high with delight at the first smell of water. Down the banks they came, sliding, rolling, tumbling end over end,--any way to get down quickly,--landing at last with glad splashings and croakings in the warm shallows, where they promptly took to biting and clawing and absurd little wrestling bouts; which is the toad's way of settling his disputes and taking his own mate away from the other fellows.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the face}} of Donkin leaning high-shouldered over the after-rail became grave. Something like a weak rattle was heard through the {{forecastle}} door. It became a murmur; it ended in a sighing groan. The washerman plunged both his arms into the tub abruptly; the cook became more crestfallen than an exposed backslider; the boatswain moved his shoulders uneasily; the carpenter got up with a spring and walked away--while the sailmaker seemed mentally to give his story up, and began to puff at his pipe with sombre determination. In the blackness of the doorway a pair of eyes glimmered white, and big, and staring. Then James Wait's head protruding, became visible, as if suspended between the two hands that grasped a doorpost {{on each side of}} the face. The tassel of his blue woollen nightcap, cocked forward, danced gaily over his left eyelid. He stepped out in a tottering stride. He looked powerful as ever, but showed a strange and affected unsteadiness in his gait; his face was perhaps a trifle thinner, and his eyes appeared rather startlingly prominent. He seemed to hasten the retreat of departing light by his very presence; the setting sun dipped sharply, as though fleeing before our nigger; a black mist emanated from him; a subtle and dismal influence; a something cold and gloomy that floated out and settled on all the faces like a mourning veil. The circle broke up. The joy of laughter died on stiffened lips. There was not a smile left among all the ship's company. Not a word was spoken. Many turned their backs, trying to look unconcerned; others, with averted heads, sent half-reluctant glances out of the corners of their eyes. They resembled criminals conscious of misdeeds more than honest men distracted by doubt; only two or three stared frankly, but stupidly, with lips slightly open. All expected James Wait to say something, and, at the same time, had the air of knowing beforehand what he would say. He leaned his back against the doorpost, and with heavy <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> them a glance domineering and pained, like a sick tyrant overawing a crowd of abject but untrustworthy slaves.|$|E
6000|$|The most {{tangible}} {{thing he}} had to build on was the night, immersed in bridge, when {{he had not been}} unaware of the abrupt leaving of the piano after the singing of the [...] "Gypsy Trail"; nor when, in careless smiling greeting of them when they came down the room to devil him over his losing, had he failed to receive a hint or feeling of something unusual in Paula's roguish teasing face. On the moment, laughing retorts, giving as good as she sent, Dick's own laughing <b>eyes</b> had <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Graham beside her and likewise detected the unusual. The man was overstrung, had been Dick's mental note at the time. But why should he be overstrung? Was there any connection between his overstrungness and the sudden desertion by Paula of the piano? And all the while these questions were slipping through his thoughts, he had laughed at their sallies, dealt, sorted his hand, and won the bid on no trumps.|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel's moist, beady <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> silently <b>over</b> his client's sallow face. He {{leaned back}} comfortably in his chair, and half {{closing his eyes}} as in dreamy reminiscence, said slowly: [...] "Your reply, Mr. Hotchkiss, reminds me of--er--sing'lar {{circumstance}} that--er--occurred, in point of fact--at the St. Charles Hotel, New Orleans. Pinkey Hornblower--personal friend--invited Senator Doolittle {{to join him in}} social glass. Received, sing'larly enough, reply similar to yours. 'Don't drink nor smoke?' said Pinkey. 'Gad, sir, you must be mighty sweet on the ladies.' Ha!" [...] The Colonel paused long enough to allow the faint flush to pass from Hotchkiss's cheek, and went on, half closing his eyes: [...] "'I allow no man, sir, to discuss my personal habits,' declared Doolittle, over his shirt collar. 'Then I reckon shootin' must be one of those habits,' said Pinkey coolly. Both men drove out on the Shell Road back of cemetery next morning. Pinkey put bullet at twelve paces through Doolittle's temple. Poor Doo never spoke again. Left three wives and seven children, they say--two of 'em black." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Thurwell drew a {{few steps}} backward, and his keen gray <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> the open country round.|$|R
60|$|The aged servant, hat in hand, made {{a respectful}} bow to Mr. Weldon. His frank <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> {{the young man}} {{from head to foot}} but his smile was the same as before.|$|R
60|$|Within {{the hour}} came {{a knock at}} the door, and Wild Water entered, {{followed}} by Bill Saltman. Their <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> the cabin eagerly, coming to rest on the windlass elaborately concealed by blankets.|$|R
60|$|As {{the little}} man stepped from the ladder into the waist, whither Captain Blood had gone to receive him, his sharp, ferrety dark <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> the uncouth ranks of the {{assembled}} crew of the Arabella.|$|R
60|$|Amid the breathless {{silence that}} {{followed}} this act of such great significance, Wingenund advanced toward the knoll with slow, stately step. His dark <b>eye</b> <b>swept</b> the glade with lightning scorn; his glance alone revealed the passion that swayed him.|$|R
60|$|He had {{scarcely}} spoken {{when they}} heard Professor Duke at the door. An instant later the portal was thrown open and the teacher stepped in. His <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> the trays and the plates of food the cadets were holding.|$|R
60|$|As {{they stood}} on the platform, waiting, her <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> along the great curve of the rails to the east, and suddenly, like {{a pain in the}} heart, came her first {{realization}} of distance, of the infinity of the world.|$|R
60|$|A {{lightning}} grimace <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Miss Bullace's square features.|$|R
60|$|Out {{they went}} indeed, judge, brokers, speculators--the evicted and the triumphant together. And when {{the place was}} empty Clark turned the key and thrust it into his hunting shirt. He {{stood for a moment}} on the step, and his <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> the crowd.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the blazing}} <b>eye</b> <b>swept</b> onward across the {{burnished}} domes and graceful minarets, down into court and park and garden to pause at last upon the ersite bench {{and the girl}} standing there beside it, her face upturned full toward the flier.|$|R
60|$|Jill turned scarlet. A monstrous {{suspicion}} had <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Her <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> {{this strange}} tract of country {{backward}} and forward. She saw the men like specks in the fields, the cows grazing {{in the pasture}} like toy animals. Then she {{turned and looked at}} the neat row of stacks and the square of farm-buildings.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{a hundred}} florins for the {{equipment}} of this company. I {{do not wish to}} have a regiment of out-at-elbow tatterdemalions at my heels." [...] And his <b>eye</b> <b>swept</b> in an uncomplimentary manner over Ercole's apparel. [...] "See that you dress them fittingly." ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{that feeling}} <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> me--that curious {{sensation}} of being defiant against myself.|$|R
60|$|He {{flushed with}} anger and his <b>eyes</b> <b>swept</b> round toward the saw. But he {{understood}} from my tone that I meant what I said, and that I {{was not a man}} to be bullied into submission. He pulled a cross from under his zammara or jacket of black sheepskin.|$|R
50|$|Ubaratutu lived {{until the}} deluge <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> the land, like Lamech, {{the father of}} Noah.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Anti-Chinese {{sentiment}} {{reached its}} peak in May 1998, when major riots <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Jakarta.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time a feeling of {{confusion}} <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Mattie, and her face flushed.|$|R
5000|$|... 25 Nepalese people, mostly children, {{died as a}} {{blizzard}} <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> most of Nepal on January 7.|$|R
