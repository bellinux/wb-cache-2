25|$|Noddings {{tends to}} use unequal {{relationships}} {{as a model}} for understanding caring. Philosopher and feminist Sarah Lucia Hoagland argues that the relationships in question, such as parenting and teaching, are ideally relationships where caring is a transitory thing designed to foster the independence of the cared-for, and so end the unequal caring relationship. Unequal relationships, she writes, are ethically problematic, and so a poor model for an ethical theory. Hoagland argues that on Noddings' account of ethical caring, the one-caring is placed {{in the role of the}} giver and the cared-for in the role of the taker. The one-caring is dominant, choosing what is good for the cared-for, but gives without receiving caring in return. The cared-for is put in the position of being a dependent, with <b>insufficient</b> <b>control</b> over the nature of the caring. Hoagland believes that such unequal relationships cannot be morally good.|$|E
25|$|The Shadows, {{an ancient}} and {{extremely}} powerful race who have recently emerged from hibernation, are {{revealed to be}} the cause of a variety of mysterious and disturbing events, including the attack on the Narn outpost at the end of 2258. Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari unknowingly enlists their aid through his association with their mysterious human representative Mr. Morden in the ongoing conflict with the Narn. The elderly and ailing Centauri emperor, long an advocate of reconciliation with the Narn, unfortunately has <b>insufficient</b> <b>control</b> to prevent others from instigating war against the Narn Regime. When the emperor dies suddenly during a peace mission to Babylon 5, a number of conspirators, including Ambassador Londo Mollari and Lord Refa, take control of the Centauri government by assassinating their opponents and placing the late emperor's unstable nephew on the throne. Their first act is to start open aggression against the Narn. After a full-scale war breaks out, the Centauri {{with the help of the}} Shadows through Londo eventually conquer Narn in a brutal attack involving mass drivers, outlawed weapons of mass destruction. Towards the end of the year, the Clark administration begins to show increasingly totalitarian characteristics, clamping down on dissent and restricting freedom of speech. The Vorlons are revealed to be the basis of legends about angels on various worlds, including Earth, and are the ancient enemies of the Shadows. They enlist the aid of Sheridan and the Babylon 5 command staff in the struggle against the Shadows.|$|E
500|$|Following {{several months}} of ground testing, the XR-1 {{conducted}} its maiden flight on May 12, 1941, although the aircraft was restrained by a tether for its early flights. On June 23 the aircraft conducted its first free flight, albeit remaining within {{a few feet of}} the ground. As flight testing continued and the aircraft's performance envelope was expanded, the XR-1's quickly proved troublesome, the testing showing a variety of troubles with the design. These included issues with the aircraft's controls, <b>insufficient</b> <b>control</b> authority being present, and in addition there were resonance issues with the airframe that made the XR-1 prone to pilot-induced oscillations. The aircraft was modified in an attempt to resolve these issues, and the Army modified Platt-LePage's contract to provide additional funding for improvements to the design, but despite this the XR-1's problems continued. In addition, the company's test pilot, Lou Leavitt, lacked confidence in the design, refusing to fly the aircraft to its full potential. The situation was only resolved when Colonel H. Franklin Gregory, director of rotor-wing projects for the Army Air Forces, flew the aircraft himself, reaching [...] on his first flight in the aircraft.|$|E

Cross-sectional study {{based on data from}} The Maastricht Study, a population-based cohort study focused on the aetiology, pathophysiology, complications, and comorbidities of T 2 DM. We analysed associations and clustering of glycaemic control and HRQoL with 38 independent variables (i. e. biopsychosocial characteristics) in different subgroups and using descriptive analyses, latent class analysis (LCA), and logistic regressions. Included were 840 persons with T 2 DM, mostly men (68. 6 %) and {{with a mean age of}} 62. 6 (± 7. 7) years. Mean HbA 1 c was 7. 1 % (± 3. 2 %); 308 patients (36. 7 %) had <b>insufficient</b> glycaemic <b>control</b> (HbA 1 c> 7. 0 % [53 mmol/mol]). Compared to those with sufficient control, these patients had a significantly worse-off status on multiple biopsychosocial factors, including self-efficacy, income, education and several health-related characteristics. Two 'latent classes' were identified in the <b>insufficient</b> glycaemic <b>control</b> subgroup: with low respectively high HRQoL. Of the two, the low HRQoL class comprised about one-fourth of patients and had a significantly worse biopsychosocial profile. <b>Insufficient</b> glycaemic <b>control,</b> particularly in combination with low HRQoL, is associated with a generally worse biopsychosocial profile.
