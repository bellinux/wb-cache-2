500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> desk. And I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're {{not going to let you}} keep talking about the things you want to talk about and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|The singer would record {{late into}} the morning, {{sometimes}} until noon, before riding her bus to the next city. In May 2012, Rihanna revealed that whilst she was recording the album, she suffered from exhaustion, saying in part: [...] "It was the best [...] ever, it was some rock star [...] This is the craziest schedule I've ever been on in my entire life. One morning I woke up and started crying so hard. I finally just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> bed from the IV [...] and I was just like, 'Good I can actually get to sleep tonight', because we stayed up all night' and I finished [...] at 5pm the day before..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fiennes {{stated that}} he had two weeks to shoot the climactic {{showdown}} scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fiennes said with a chuckle: [...] "I have no doubt children will be afraid of me now if they weren't before." [...] In preparation, he read the novel Goblet of Fire, but jokingly conceded: [...] "I was only interested in my scene, and I {{had to go through}} thousands and thousands of other scenes which I did, dutifully, until I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> scene and I read it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research." [...] Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 1 and Part 2.|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} help being rather short with him, but he {{appeared}} not to mind it.
