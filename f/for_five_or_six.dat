Upon NBC's 1989 {{cancellation of the}} network series, production moved to Studio 33 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, where it remained until 1995. Since then, the show has occupied Stage 11 at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. Some episodes are also recorded on location, a tradition which began with two weeks of episodes taped at Radio City Music Hall in late 1988. Recording sessions usually last <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> episodes in one day.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, {{producing}} the Noddy in Toyland pantomime {{in just two}} or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas. Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> years. Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre {{three or four times}} a week. TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers. In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the King's Head Theatre embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with The Famous Five Musical, to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 The Secret Seven Save the World was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.|$|E

5|$|Modern Guilt was {{the final}} release in Beck's {{contract}} with Geffen Records. Beck, then 38, had held the contract since his early 20s. Released from his label contract and going independent, Beck began working more heavily on his own seven-year-old label, which went {{through a variety of}} names. His focus on smaller, more quixotic projects, Beck moonlighted as a producer, working with artists such as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Thurston Moore and Stephen Malkmus. Beck worked <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> days a week at the small studio on his property in Malibu, and founded Record Club, a project whereby an entire classic album—by The Velvet Underground, Leonard Cohen, INXS, Yanni—would be covered by another singer in the span of a single day. Beck provided four songs for the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), each attributed to the title character's fictional band, Sex Bob-Omb. Beck also collaborated with Philip Glass, Jack White, Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow, Jamie Lidell, Seu Jorge, Childish Gambino, and The Lonely Island.|$|E
5|$|In 851, the capable Muslim {{governor}} and general Abu'l-Aghlab Ibrahim died, {{and the local}} Muslims elected Abu'l-Aghlab al-Abbas ibn al-Fadl, the victor of Butera, as his successor. Without waiting for confirmation of his appointment from Ifriqiya, the new governor attacked and captured the northern fortress of Caltavuturo, and then turned south towards Enna, whose Byzantine commander refused to meet him in the field. Abbas continued his raid, and in 852–853 he devastated the Val di Noto. Butera was besieged <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> months, until its inhabitants came to terms and secured his withdrawal by delivering 5,000–6,000 prisoners. Little details are known about {{the events of the}} next four years, but the picture painted by the sources is one of unopposed Muslim raids across the remaining Byzantine territories. Abbas captured several fortresses, including Cefalù in 857, whose population was allowed safe departure and which was then razed. Gagliano was also besieged, but not taken. In summer 858, the two sides were engaged in naval combat, probably off Apulia; Abbas' brother Ali managed to defeat the Byzantine fleet of 40 ships in the first engagement, but was in turn defeated and forced to flee in the second.|$|E

The men finally arrived in Chihuahua, where they were held <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> days in prison, but then granted freedom of the town. The names and fates of the other prisoners are unknown, but thanks to his memoirs, Bean's story has survived.|$|E
25|$|Hancock {{wrote the}} piece to help sell his debut album as a leader, Takin' Off (1962), on Blue Note Records; {{it was the}} first piece of music he had ever {{composed}} with a commercial goal in mind. The popularity of the piece, due primarily to Mongo Santamaría, paid Hancock's bills <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> years. Hancock did not feel the composition was a sellout however, describing that structurally, it was one of his strongest pieces due to its almost mathematical balance.|$|E
50|$|The British horror {{television}} show Death Rattles {{is believed to}} have been broadcast in mid-1984. Described as gritty, near-the-knuckle, and ahead of its time, the show ran <b>for</b> only <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> episodes before being withdrawn from the air.|$|R

25|$|From 1789 {{until the}} 1930s, Congress convened in December, stayed in session <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> months, and then adjourned sine die. Occasionally, {{the demands of}} war kept Congress in session longer, but {{generally}} senators agreed with Vice President John Nance Garner who famously proclaimed, “No good legislation ever comes out of Washington after June.” By the 1950s, however, the schedule had changed. In 1956 Congress adjourned on July 27—marking {{the last time the}} Senate adjourned before the first of August.|$|E
25|$|The {{operations}} of the 53d WRS were affected by the federal budget sequestration of 2013. Furloughs of personnel, amounting to two days in every pay period per member, resulted in a 20% cut in capability, according to the wing commander of the 403d Wing on 24 July 2013. While sequestration was in effect, this meant the squadron was capable of working only two storms simultaneously at full mission scheduling instead of the normal three, and that pace sustainable only <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> days.|$|E
25|$|Gere {{was raised}} {{attending}} a Methodist church. His interest in Buddhism {{began when he}} was in his twenties. He first studied Zen Buddhism under Kyozan Joshu Sasaki. After having studied Zen <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> years, in 1978 he traveled with the Brazilian painter Sylvia Martins to Nepal, where he met many Tibetan monks and lamas. He then met the 14th Dalai Lama in India and became a practicing Tibetan Buddhist of the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism and an active supporter of the Dalai Lama. Gere regularly visits Dharamshala, the headquarters of the Tibetan government-in-exile.|$|E

25|$|STV {{has some}} {{history in the}} United States. Many cities, {{including}} New York City, once used it {{to break up the}} Democratic Party monopolies on elective office. Cincinnati, Ohio, adopted STV in 1925 {{to get rid of a}} Republican Party monopoly, but the Republicans returned the city to FPTP in 1957. From 1870 to 1980, Illinois used a semi-proportional cumulative voting system to elect its House of Representatives. Each district across the state elected both Republicans and Democrats year-after-year. Cambridge, Massachusetts, (STV) and Peoria, Illinois, (cumulative voting) continue to use PR. San Francisco had citywide elections in which people would cast votes <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> candidates simultaneously, delivering some of the benefits of proportional representation.|$|E
25|$|Six of Maillard's masses have survived, and {{two others}} {{are known to have}} been lost. Considerable other music of his has survived in printed editions, {{including}} eighty-six motets, settings of the Magnificat, lamentations, chansons spirituelles, and secular chansons. Stylistically, his sacred music is more closely related to the contemporary Franco-Flemish idiom of pervasive, dense, complex polyphony than to the relatively clear and succinct style of his fellow French composers. In particular, he used short motifs in close imitation, and often used strict canonic devices. About half of his motets are for four voices; the rest are <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six,</b> with one motet for seven voices. Many of his motets have the cantus firmus in long note values in the highest voice, while the other voices carry on in a polyphonic, imitative texture.|$|E
25|$|For {{the season}} of 1861–62, Santley {{returned}} to Covent Garden, opening in Howard Glover's Ruy Blas (as Don Sallust, Harrison as Ruy Blas), then in a re-cast version of Robin Hood, and finally in Balfe's The Puritan's Daughter. He also created the role of 'Danny Man' in Julius Benedict's The Lily of Killarney, which was performed nightly <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> weeks. Worn out by this busy season, Santley decided to turn his attention to Italian opera, and, armed with a letter from Michael Costa, {{paid a visit to}} Rossini in Paris. This meeting proved disappointing; but he made an Italian début at Covent Garden in 1862 when he sang the role of di Luna in Il trovatore for three nights at Covent Garden, 'in place of Graziani, to oblige Mr. Gye': that was with the English soprano Fanny Gordosa, Constance Nantier-Didiée, the Italian dramatic tenor Enrico Tamberlik and the Franco-Italian bass-baritone Joseph Tagliafico. Santley's performances were received rapturously by the Covent Garden audience.|$|E

25|$|The landing party {{left the}} Endymion for the rock by boat. Whilst {{they were on}} the rock, the Endymion, which was taking depth {{measurements}} around Rockall, lost visual contact with the rock as a haze descended. The ship drifted away, leaving the landing party stranded. The expedition made a brief attempt to return to the ship, but could not find the frigate in the haze, and soon gave up and returned to Rockall. After the haze became a fog, the lookout sent to the top of Rockall spotted the ship again, but it turned away from Rockall before the expedition in their boats reached it. Finally, just before sunset, the frigate was again spotted from the top of Rockall, and the expedition was able to get back on board. The crew of the Endymion reported that they had been searching <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> hours, firing their cannon every ten minutes. Hall related this experience and other adventures in a book entitled Fragment of Voyages and Travels Including Anecdotes of a Naval Life.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both {{direct and}} cross examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he {{testified that he}} had known <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> years) came into the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that some time {{afterward}} Mae Taub (daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday) asked him for a ride into town, {{so he went to}} his room (1219) to change his clothes and discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting in the toilet. Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle {{and a few of the}} guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. After the doctor declared that Rappe was just drunk, Arbuckle then drove Taub to town.|$|E
