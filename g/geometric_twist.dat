The main results in this paper are to define the <b>geometric</b> <b>twisted</b> K-homology groups and to {{construct the}} assembly map. Even in the untwisted case the fact that the <b>geometric</b> <b>twisted</b> K-homology groups and the geometric assembly map are well defined for Lie groupoids is new, as it was only sketched by Connes in his book for general Lie groupoids without any restrictive hypothesis, in particular for non Hausdorff Lie groupoids.

We discuss the relation of the assembly map with the associated assembly map of the $S^ 1 $-central extension.

40|$|Fixed wing micro air {{vehicles}} (wingspan between 10 and 15 cm) are aerodynamically challenging {{due to the}} low Reynolds number regime (104 - 105) {{they operate}} in. The low aspect ratio wings (typically used to maximize area under a size constraint) promote strong tip vortices, and are susceptible to rolling instabilities. Wind gusts can be of the same order of magnitude as the flight speed (10 - 15 m/s). Standard control surfaces on an empennage must be eliminated for size considerations and drag reduction, {{and the range of}} stable center of gravity locations is only a few millimeters long. Membrane aeroelasticity has been identified as a tenable method to alleviate these issues: flexible wing structures with <b>geometric</b> <b>twist</b> (adaptive washout for gust rejection, delayed stall) and aerodynamic twist (adaptive inflation for high lift, larger stability margins) are both considered here. Recent investigations in static aeroelastic characterization, including flight loads, wing deformation, flow structures, aeroelastic-tailoring studies through laminate orientation, as well as unconventional techniques based on membrane pre-tension, are reviewed.
