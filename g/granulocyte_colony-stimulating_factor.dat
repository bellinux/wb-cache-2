40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prevention of {{infectious}} complications of chemotherapy-induced granulocytopenia {{is a major}} issue in preventive medicine, as febrile neutropenia is still associated with an overall 10 % mortality and extensive morbidity and cost. RECENT FINDINGS: The prescription of <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony-stimulating</b> <b>factors</b> should not be determined according to a risk prediction of febrile neutropenia considering solely type of chemotherapy and according to cost-effectiveness; other factors appear now to be important for making the decision, namely age and the presence of various comorbid factors. SUMMARY: It is likely that the consideration of these newly recognized risk factors and the availability of more affordable <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony-stimulating</b> <b>factors</b> will lead, in the near future, to an extension of the presently recognized indications for the prescription of <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony-stimulating</b> <b>factors.</b> EditorialReviewinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|There is good {{evidence}} to suggest that dose intensity is important when considering the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. However, the development of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia can lead to reduction in dose intensity and other treatment modifications, which may negatively affect patient outcomes. Febrile neutropenia can be prevented by the use of primary prophylactic treatment, notably with <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony-stimulating</b> <b>factors.</b> This practice is supported by international guidelines, all of which recommend that primary prophylaxis with <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony-stimulating</b> <b>factors</b> should be used with chemotherapy where the risk of febrile neutropenia is 20 % or greater...|$|R

We report {{the case of a}} 34 -year-old patient with metastatic testicular embryonal carcinoma who was extensively and in vain pretreated with chemotherapy and failed to mobilize an adequate number of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells following high-dose chemotherapy, with the support of <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony-stimulating</b> <b>factors.</b> After a cycle of high-dose cyclophosphamide associated with <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony-stimulating</b> <b>factors,</b> plerixafor was administered to the patient, with the clinical evidence of an increase in hematopoietic progenitor stem cells in the peripheral blood. The patient achieved a complete engraftment following two cycles of high-dose chemotherapy (paclitaxel, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide), with the support of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells; the patient showed discrete tolerability to the treatment. At biochemical control, the -human chorionic gonadotropin value decreased from 86 to less than 1. 2 mUI/ml and total body PET-CT scan showed a complete response to chemotherapy. According to this experience, we believe that in patients with advanced germ cell cancer, it is essential to explore the possibility of the use of high-dose chemotherapy to induce a stable and permanent response; in this context, plerixafor, with the support of <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony-stimulating</b> <b>factors,</b> may be an innovative option for satisfactory mobilization during high-dose chemotherapy protocols.
