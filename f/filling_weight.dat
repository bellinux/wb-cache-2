40|$|Most of the {{existing}} studies for confined boiling were focus on the pool-boiling phenomenon but did not consider the effect of liquid condensate flow back as it appeared in an actual plate heat pipe. For further understanding of the heat transfer mechanism in an actual plate heat pipe, this paper provides a visualization study of the boiling phenomena in confined spaces of height 0. 5 mm, 1. 0 mm and 1. 5 mm at heating power 3 W, 6 W and 9 W and <b>filling</b> <b>weight</b> of 0. 25 g, 0. 40 g and 0. 55 g. The observation results show {{that most of the}} liquid was accumulated in the corner and periphery of the space for the lowest space height test section. At low heating rate conditions, liquid column was form at the center or its near regions. The size of this liquid column increased or decreased depends on the heating rate conditions. While the heating rate is low, the liquid column diameter increased until it touched the edge of the grooves and suddenly sucked by the groove drainage force. At high heating rate conditions, the liquid column diameter decreased and vanished gradually. The observed dependency of the flow pattern to the filling ratio and heating rate condition {{can be applied to the}} further improvement of the thin plate heat pipe design...|$|E
40|$|DE 102007063041 A 1 UPAB: 20090710 NOVELTY - The {{arrangement}} has laser light-irradiation devices (E 1, E 2) including lasers (1 a, 1 b) {{and expanding}} optical systems (5 a, 5 b) for expanding laser beams (LS 1, LS 2). The expanded beams are irradiated from opposite sides {{on a common}} target volume (ZV), in which an object (O) is arranged. A charge coupled device (CCD) camera (2) optically detects laser sectional lines produced in the target volume by the radiated laser beams. An image processing device (3) identifies and separates the laser sectional lines {{from each other in}} a recorded image and assigns the lines to the respective lasers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a laser light section method for determining an elevation profile of an object. USE - Laser light section arrangement for determining an elevation profile of an object, for determining volume of the object, and for determining a filling level and a <b>filling</b> <b>weight</b> of bulk goods i. e. powder, in a container i. e. blister container (all claimed). Can also be used for measuring surface defects on copper plates, surface defects on concrete plates, welding seams at a robotic arm, thickness of metal bands, filling volume in Blistern, engine blocks in the passage, bodies, rotatable parts such as gear shafts or drive shafts and recognizing missing rivets, soldering level on printed circuit boards, warpages of food package, width and groove depth of motor-car tires, distortions of hot cast parts. ADVANTAGE - The object is subjected to a three-dimensional volume measurement to measure volume and elevation profile of the object in an easy, rapid and reliable manner without any inaccurate and/or incomplete volume and/or profile measurements. The laser beams are reflected by reflectors and/or mirrors such that the laser beams run one above the other perpendicular to a reference level and parallel to each other in an accurate manner, thus achieving a very compact design for the laser light section arrangement...|$|E
40|$|The rising {{number of}} elderly and {{disabled}} persons leads to the increasing demand for reha-bilitation robots for the support in daily life actions. The major factor limiting the application of robots in this domain is the programming of the robot since a detailed knowledge of the daily life activities {{as well as an}} effective mechanism to deal with the diverse environment is not available. The most promising way to alleviate this problem is {{to take advantage of the}} human experience and skills in performing daily activities and to transfer them to the robot. For this, the concept of Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is believed to be an intuitive and preferable solution. However, classic PbD methods will fail in the situations where the environment in which the task is to be performed differs from that in the demonstration, since important parts of the human skill are lost in that programming process. This work proposes a comprehensive solution for this problem, which is implemented and tested for the exemplary daily life action 'pouring a beverage from a bottle to a glass' (pour-in in short). This solution consists of three advanced methods: The parameter-based trajectory generation, the inclusion of the closed control loop into the PbD process and the implementa-tion of an anti-dripping movement into a pour-in. In the parameter-based trajectory genera-tion, human demonstration is used to obtain the characteristics of a pour-in trajectory repre-senting the human skills. This information is used to autonomously generate a general pour-in trajectory that is optimized to the current task conditions (e. g. the size of bottle and glass). This general pour-in trajectory is then processed by a closed control loop that manages other task restrictions like the target filling liquid. Based on the concept of cascade control loops two control systems reflecting different control strategies of human beings in a pour-in are designed in this work: The first is the three-point based cascade weight/flow rate control (TCC), which applies the human strategy to control the flow rate within minimum and maxi-mum limits. These limits depend on the filling ratio of the liquid. The second is the monitored cascade weight/flow rate control (MCC) based on the imitation of a particularity of the human demonstration, which is the unidirectivity of the movement. Experiments with the rehabilita-tion robot system FRIEND reveal that the lager delay time of the system influences the con-trol accuracy considerable due to the corresponding delays in the system response. Therefore, a number of strategies are developed and implemented into the control loops to dampen the impact of the time delay. Finally, the pour-in process is accomplished and optimized by the inclusion of an anti-dripping movement, whose implementation is based on human demon-strations. By the application of particular trajectory transformations it is possible to apply only one anti-dripping trajectory to any pour-in process. Experiments prove that a robust task execution under various task conditions is achieved to-gether with a high accuracy in reaching the target <b>filling</b> <b>weight.</b> This shows that the applica-tion of these advanced PbD methods for the implementation of pour-in processes into a reha-bilitation robot is successful and that this comprehensive solution is able to confer the abilities of human autonomous environment adaptation. The promising results qualify the developed methods to serve as a starting point for future implementations of additional daily life tasks...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the factors that influence <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> and weight variability of capsules produced on the In-Cap and to assess any differences in terms of capsule defects between gelatin and HPMC (Quali-V) shells. The In-Cap is an automatic tamping type capsule-filling machine and the low output of ≈ 3000 capsules/hour makes it ideal for early formulation development and phase I/IIa clinical supplies manufacture. Four commonly used excipients (Avicel PH 101, Avicel PH 302, A-Tab, and Prosolv HD 90) and a poorly flowing drug blend were encapsulated at various pin settings and powder bed heights. The average <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> and coefficient of weight variation were determined. The percentage of defective capsules formed during encapsulation was calculated. Results of the study showed that pin setting was critical for controlling the <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> and the weight variation. The order of pin setting with pin 1 (closer to the powder chute) set to a relatively higher position and pin 4 (before ejection) set to a lower position was found to give higher <b>fill</b> <b>weights</b> with relatively lower weight variability. The powder bed height influenced the <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> for poorly flowing powders. The capsule machine speed did not appear to significantly influence the <b>fill</b> <b>weight.</b> The <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> and weight variation were found to depend on the flow property of the material. A large percentage of defective capsules was obtained using HPMC shell size # 00. Some of the commonly observed defects included split caps and improperly closed filled capsules. In general, appropriate selection of pin settings and bed height can reduce the weight variability seen, especially with poorly flowing high-dose formulations...|$|R

The filling volume ratio is an index of pressure from 1 to 1. 3 to investigate the influence on <b>filling</b> <b>weights</b> of the internal parameters of a wick (permeability, effective pore radius and porosity) and heat transfer performance for LHP.

For stability analysis of the backfilled stopes, {{it is necessary to}} understand the stress developments within the stope while the filling is in progress.

This paper describes the development of a laboratory model that simulates mine backfilling in an inclined stope and enables determination of the average vertical stress at any depth within the fill.

The effect of arching is the least when the stope is inclined at about 80 ° to the horizontal, giving highest vertical stresses at any depth. This fact is not captured in both the mathematical and numerical models developed in the past and the ones discussed herein. The model tests show that the lateral earth pressure coefficient is closer to K 0 for vertical stopes and Ka for inclined stopes.
