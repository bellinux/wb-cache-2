However, it is worth to note that a square pipe will not be cracked at the first time of repeated freezings due to the large bending deformation from square to circular in the cross section.

40|$|Temperature and {{moisture}} are very essential parameters when describing {{the condition of}} a pavement. In most cases, a high moisture content involves a decreased bearing capacity and, consequently, a shorter durability of the pavement. A frozen pavement has a greater bearing capacity than the corresponding construction in spring or late autumn. However, the freezing itself also implies strains to the pavement, as it heaves to different extent and in different directions {{in connection with the}} frost heave. The properties of an asphalt concrete pavement vary dramatically according to temperature. Cold asphalt concrete is hard, stiff and brittle, and therefore, cracks easily occur, whereas its bearing capacity decreases at high temperatures as softening progresses. Emphasizing the asphalt concrete, a numerical model has been developed for calculation of temperatures for summer condition, by means of recorded values for solar radiation, air temperature and wind velocity. Further, in order to also model temperatures and other conditions, occurring in the pavement during winter, a frost heave module has been developed and included in the model. The aim of this is to gain a better insight into the freezing process of a road structure. The model also provides an efficient tool for a better understanding of important factors related to frost depth and frost heave. A modified version of the model, is tested for falling weight deflectometer analysis. Input here, is a series of measured pavement surface temperatures and the output is calculated temperature distributions for the asphalt layer. Measuring equipment, developed at VTI, has been used to, in the field, automatically record frost heave and pavement temperature distribution. Furthermore, equipment for <b>freezing</b> <b>tests</b> in laboratory has also been developed. Experiences from such tests and field measurements have been used when developing the numerical model for freezing of pavements. At the laboratory <b>freezing</b> <b>tests,</b> a special interest has been devoted to water intake rate and heave rate related to cooling rate. The experiences, obtained from both the laboratory tests, as well as the field observations, have been compared to what has been reported in literature. Temperatures obtained from the numerical model for summer and winter temperatures have turned out to correspond well to measurements of pavement temperatures at all test sections studied, 12 in US and 3 in Sweden. The <b>freezing</b> <b>tests</b> in laboratory have shown, that a strong frost heave can exist without addition of external water to the samples. The natural water content is, consequently, sufficient to provide enough water for the heave. This "in-situ" water can be redistributed in the structure, thus providing water to the frozen portion of the profile to cause significant frost heave. Frost heave caused by a process like this, is not bound to uptake of external water, which normally is assumed in the relevant literature. Frost heave in <b>freezing</b> <b>tests</b> is often explained by 10 % volume expansion of the freezing water, which is sucked up by samples during the <b>test.</b> The <b>freezing</b> <b>tests</b> in laboratory have also shown, that the ratio (heave/water uptake) increases with frost susceptibility, i. e. the most frost susceptible soils require comparatively less added water for the heaving. The <b>freezing</b> <b>tests</b> in laboratory and field tests, have also shown that the relation between heave rate and heat extraction rate at the frost front, is weak. This is also in contradiction to what normally is stated in literature. The weak relation is found during longer periods of continous frost penetration. However, when heat extraction rate is varied at short time intervals, a strong dependency between heave rate and heat extraction rate is found. Godkänd; 2002; 20061113 (haneit...|$|R

40|$|Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is a sub-tropical crop {{severely}} {{affected by}} exposure to low temperatures during all of its growing stages. Cool spring temperatures {{and the risk of}} frost are major limiting factors for the early sowing of dry bean in Saskatchewan. Due to its economic importance; however, it has been introduced to Saskatchewan, but it needs to be made more cold tolerant to further expand acreage. The genes that can contribute some tolerance to low temperature stress in bean are not found within the primary gene pool, which limits the capability of breeders to generate a cultivar with such characteristics. Consequently studies have being done in order to find a possible source of genes that can induce tolerance to low temperature exposure. Phaseolus acutifolius is a relative of the domesticated dry bean and previous hybridizations with it have been successful. It is also known to be tolerant to abiotic stresses such as drought. For this reason the decision was taken to explore the level of resistance to low temperature stress exposure in several P. acutifolius accessions. Using whole plant freezing tests in controlled environment chambers, P. acutifolius W 6 15578 was found to be more tolerant to exposure to sub-zero temperatures than were P. vulgaris genotypes. Interspecies hybrids were produced between P. vulgaris NY 5 - 161 and W 6 15578 and BC 2 plants were produced using embryo rescue. 	The whole plant <b>freezing</b> <b>test</b> is a destructive method that cannot be used with unique F 1 and BC 2 genotypes, so an alternative methodology to evaluate the hybrids was explored. An electrolyte leakage test was used and showed similar results to the whole plant <b>freezing</b> <b>test</b> with the parent plant controls. The F 1 hybrids had an intermediate tolerance to low temperature stress and the further generations (BC 1 and BC 2) had a better level of tolerance to this kind of stress than the cultivated parent (NY 5 - 161). This suggests that the genes that confer tolerance to low temperature exposure are being maintained through several generations of backcrossing and that these interspecies hybrids may offer a chance for the development of improved dry bean cultivars for the Saskatchewan environment...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The {{success of}} civil {{engineering}} construction in cold regions often {{depends on the}} assessment of the potential for frost heave. Over the past two decades two models have been presented to the engineering community to identify the frost heave potential, namely: (1) the segregation potential (SP), and (2) the discrete ice lens (DIL) models. These models are based on ice segregation parameters which can be obtained from simple laboratory freezing tests. However, the reliability of the ice segregation parameters obtained from the laboratory freezing tests is still in question. In recognition of the need to improve the reliability of the measurement of ice segregation parameters in a frost heave test, a study was conducted to: (1) investigate several improvements in the step <b>freezing</b> <b>test</b> used to measure ice segregation parameters, (2) examine several approximations used to interpret the laboratory step <b>freezing</b> <b>test</b> results, (3) demonstrate the compatibility of the SP and DIL parameters, (4) propose a method to obtain reliable ice segregation parameters, and (5) demonstrate the applicability of the DIL model to address field frost heave problems. The results of the study indicated: (1) the accuracy of measured ice segregation parameters may be improved if step freezing tests are conducted under shallower temperature gradients and the water intake velocity is accurately and continuously monitored, (2) inappropriate approximations may produce a significant error in the measurement of ice segregation parameters, (3) SP may be defined either by the ratios of the (i) heave velocity/ 1. 09 to the overall temperature gradient of the frozen soil, or (ii) water intake velocity to the temperature gradient of the frozen fringe, (4) the SP and DIL ice segregation parameters are compatible, and (5) the reliability of both models is improved through the demonstration of the compatibility of the ice segregation parameters. The application of the frost heave prediction models was studied based on ice segregation parameters determined with the improved laboratory procedure. A practical method to predict the influence of the groundwater level using the DIL ice segregation parameters was proposed. A probabilistic approach for the DIL frost heave model was developed...|$|E

Frost hardiness was determined five times from September to December in the nurseries. In January 1986 seedlings were lifted at the three nurseries. Dehardening of potted trees was observed under outdoor and growth chamber conditions. Budburst of the trees dehardening outdoors was recorded from March to June. Hardiness was determined with a whole plant <b>freezing</b> <b>test.</b> Seedlings were frozen at each sampling date to 4 test temperatures to evaluate needle, bud and stem tissue damage. In general, trees raised in the highest elevation nursery or the most northern nursery had hardier tissue than seedlings raised in the coastal nursery. However, hardiness varied for each tissue and among nurseries and seed sources. In February and March seedlings from the Cascade (975 m) seed source were less hardy than seedlings from the coastal source (450 m). A growth chamber experiment confirmed the outdoor dehardening pattern. With a 16 hour photoperiod a constant temperature of + 5 °C maintained cold hardiness, whereas + 10 °C and 15 °C promoted rapid dehardening after 20 days. To predict hardening, a regression equation with nursery weather data and elevation was calculated. Photoperiod, number of frost days, and elevation were the most important independent factors predicting hardening (R²= 0. 29). The environment of the three nurseries seemed to have a strong influence on budburst. Trees raised in the coastal nursery burst bud significantly earlier than trees from the other two nurseries. Mean terminal budburst of potted trees from both seed sources in each nursery occurred only 2 days apart. Frost hardiness in January and first-year field growth were not correlated.

The result of employing ice-nucleus bacteria at Guang-Zhou skating club showed bacterial suspension was capabal of freezing faster and smelting slower than fresh water. 我们于不同季节，从广东省不同地区采集植物样品 181 种，参考前人报道的冰核菌的特征，分离获得 375 株细菌并用经Lindow修改而成的方法对它们进行了冰核活性测定。结果表明有 20 株活性较高，对其中活性最高的 256 号菌株进行了深入研究。 256 号菌株在- 2. 3 ℃时具有冰核活性，参考菌株Ja在- 1. 7 ℃时显示有冰核活性。经初步鉴定， 256 号菌株属欧文氏菌的草生群，菌株Ja为假单胞杆菌。结冰试验表明，冰核数与菌体细胞数的比率同培养温度，生长培养基组成、菌龄和基因型有关。发挥冰核菌的冰核活性是最适培养条件是生长在内含 2. 5 %或 5 %的甘油的肉汁胨琼脂培养基上在 20 － 24 ℃下培养 7 天时间。加热或者破碎细胞都明显地使原有冰核在- 3 ℃时失去活性。通过离心和膜过滤，滤液和上清液在- 3 ℃时都不具有冰核活性，活性仅存在于菌体细胞中。刚果红因不与细胞壁结合，并不影响冰核活性。某些抗生素处理也不影响冰核活性。因此，冰核活性可能与细胞壁有关。将冰核菌在广州瘤冰俱乐部进行结冰试验表明：菌悬液与自来水相比，前者有结冰快融化慢的特点，具有节约能源的效果...|$|E
40|$|Forestry {{plantations}} with evergreen broadleaf {{species in}} Mediterranean climate sites usually perform poorly in the field. Holm oak (Quercus ilex ssp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.), cork oak (Quercus suber L.), {{wild olive tree}} (Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea var. sylvestris) and lentisk tree (Pistacia lentiscus L.) are extensively used for such plantations. In {{order to determine the}} environmental factor that induces cold hardening most effectively and the mechanisms that are involved in this process, seven month-old nursery seedlings were taken to three growth chambers during the hardening phase and submitted to: 22 / 17 ºC (day/night) and decreasing photoperiod from 12 to 8 h (Ph chamber), 12 h photoperiod and decreasing temperature from 22 / 17 ºC to 8 / 3 ºC (T chamber); and progressive reductions in temperature and photoperiod (PhT chamber). The variation of morpho-physiological traits was assessed. Reducing the photoperiod by up to 8 h did not stop the growth in height and diameter. Air temperatures below 8 ºC reduced substantially height growth, mainly in Quercus species, but not diameter growth. Reducing the temperature proved much more effective for cold hardening than reducing the photoperiod. Low temperatures induced seedlings to accumulate non-structural carbohydrates (soluble sugars in the leaves and roots, and starch in the roots), and to improve cold hardiness. Differences among species were observed in cold hardiness, with Q. ilex > Q. suber ≥ P. lentiscus ≥ O. europaea. The maximum level of cold hardiness achieved in this experiment by Q. suber and Q. ilex was reached when seedlings accumulated 775 - 800 h 8 (hours ≤ 8 °C), 750 h 8 in O. europaea and 725 h 8 in P. lentiscus. Finally, measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) after a <b>freezing</b> <b>test</b> was useful in estimating the cold hardiness of these species, providing results in less than two days for plant quality purposes...|$|E
40|$|Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) is a cool-season {{vegetable}} crop {{which can be}} damaged by intermittent spring frost {{that is needed to}} better understand freezing tolerance of spinach. This thesis focused on the physiology of spinach 2 ̆ 7 s freezing tolerance through duration of freezing, including an ability of recovery, using freeze-thaw injured spinach tissues exposed to various durations of freezing at two sub-lethal temperatures. Various physiological parameters [electrolyte leakage, Fv/Fm ratio (efficiency of PSII), MDA test (an indicator of lipid peroxidation), and histochemical detection of ROS (i. e. superoxide (O 2 -) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) ] were quantified. Based on the LT 50 of spinach (approximately - 5. 5 Â°C), - 4 and - 4. 5 Â°C were selected as two sub-lethal temperatures for prolonged <b>freezing</b> <b>test,</b> but only - 4. 5 Â°C for post-thaw recovery test. Enhanced ion-leakage, increased MDA content, accumulated ROS and decreased Fv/Fm ratio were observed in freeze-thaw injured spinach tissues subjected to four duration (0. 5, 3. 0, 5. 5 and 10. 5 h) of freezing at both - 4 and - 4. 5 Â°C; however, all measurements were shown to be worse at - 4. 5 Â°C than - 4. 0 Â°C during four durations of freezing. For the post-thaw recovery test, spinach tissues frozen for relatively short-term duration of freezing at - 4. 5 Â°C was recoverable during post-thaw periods, but was irrecoverable when stressed by a longer duration of freezing at the same temperature. In summary, depending upon duration of freezing, temperatures interpreted as sub-lethal based on LT 50 (short-term freezing assays) could be actual lethal. Therefore, 2 ̆ 2 duration of freezing 2 ̆ 2 should be considered as one of critical factors influencing on plant freeze-thaw tolerance when using artificial freeze-thaw protocols...|$|E

In artificial <b>freezing</b> <b>tests</b> at the Morton Arboretum the LT50 (temp. at which 50% of tissues die) {{was found to}} be -30.7&thinsp;°C. The Anhui elm was considered of particular interest, as its streamside habitat suggests it may tolerate low oxygen levels. [...] Very few specimens are cultivated (2017) in Europe, notably in the UK and the Netherlands. There are no known cultivars of this taxon, nor is it known to be in commerce.|$|R
40|$|Research on {{the effects}} of deicing salts and their trace {{minerals}} on bituminous highway wearing courses was prompted by early pavement deterioration of federal and state highways in Indiana. Several bituminous surface courses containing slag, slag-dolomite, or dolomite aggregates showed deterioration soon after deicing salts were first applied. Initially, a detailed literature review (Appendix A of report) was conducted. Data on eighteen dolomite sources from a previous study (Bruner, Choi and West, 1995) plus ten additional dolomite sources formed the basis for the brine <b>freeze</b> thaw <b>testing</b> program. Mercury intrusion porosimetry testing conducted on multiple specimens showed that rock texture significantly affects pore size distribution. Petrographic analysis, acid etching of thin sections and electron microprobe studies revealed the distribution of clays on dolomite grains. Additional brine <b>freeze</b> thaw <b>testing</b> on selected dolomite sources, plus one slag sample, were conducted using deicing salts from six Indiana highway districts. Petrographic evaluation of pavement cores from the distressed pavements was accomplished. Brine <b>freeze</b> thaw <b>test</b> results ranged from 0. 6 to 27. 3 % loss for the 28 samples; this test is a good measure of aggregate durability. INDOT has recommended a maximum 30 % loss for the brine <b>freeze</b> thaw <b>test.</b> Regression analysis showed that acid insoluble residue content and sodium sulfate loss have the highest correlation with brine freeze thaw loss; elemental magnesium content has a negative correlation with it. It is concluded that dolomite aggregates with a low insoluble residue content have lower sulfate soundness losses, lower brine freeze-thaw losses and greater durability. Evaluation of pavement cores indicated no evidence of deterioration caused by aggregate weathering or degradation. Brine <b>freeze</b> thaw <b>testing</b> is a good measure of freeze thaw resistance of aggregates in bituminous surface courses and no evidence was found indicating that early deterioration of the pavements studied was caused by salt attack...|$|R
