He {{discovered}} the Gibson ES-335 in recording [...] "Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever," [...] and took to using it almost exclusively live afterwards.

5000|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{awarded the}} album 4/5, noting the band's debt to early-Seventies Glam rock - T.Rex and David Bowie {{in particular -}} and praising Bejar for [...] "filtering <b>his</b> <b>cribbing</b> through an indie rocker's {{sense of humor and}} a poet's love of language." [...] Pitchfork Media critic William Bowers awarded the album 7.7/10 amid mixed praise, contending that [...] "the act's longevity had begun to work against the initial reasons for fan excitement - what were once singular eccentricities now have become anticipatable," [...] but arguing that the [...] "album succeeds despite itself," [...] praising its performance and [...] "spirit," [...] and ultimately concluding that Bejar is an [...] "untouchable wizard." ...|$|R

On [...] the child's remains were found in woods not far from the Lindbergh home.|$|E
60|$|Now Tyrker {{was a man}} in robust health; full {{of energy}} and high spirits. Sleep {{therefore}} was to him a process which, once begun, continued till morning.

2500|$|Though {{many have}} assumed that EPMD {{produced}} the music on the album because of their executive production credit, Weston stated [...] "in the studio back then it was just me, Skoob, Chris, and Derek, and that was it. EPMD didn't produce us, we were just with their production company. A lot of people forget that." [...] Weston referred to Charity, {{who died in the}} year 2000, as [...] "the brains of the operation, definitely... He was definitely the boss and the real executive producer of the first album.

2500|$|The Lašva Valley ethnic {{cleansing}} campaign against Bosniak civilians was planned by the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia's {{political and military}} leadership from May 1992 to March 1993. Fighting by the HVO which erupted the following April, was meant to implement objectives set forth by Croat nationalists in November 1991. The Lašva Valley's Bosniaks were subjected to persecution on political, and religious grounds, deliberately discriminated against {{in the context of}} a widespread attack on the region's civilian population and suffered mass murder, rape, imprisonment in camps, as well as the destruction of cultural sites and private property. This was often followed by anti-Bosniak propaganda, particularly in the municipalities of Vitez, Busovača, Novi Travnik and Kiseljak. Ahmići massacre in April 1993, was the culmination of the Lašva Valley {{ethnic cleansing}}, resulting in mass killing of Bosnian Muslim civilians just in a few hours. The youngest was a three-month-old baby, shot to death in <b>his</b> <b>crib,</b> and the oldest was an 81-year-old woman.

60|$|No one {{answered}} his knock at Elbridge's door, {{and he opened}} it and found {{his way into the}} room, where Elbridge and his wife were with the doctor. The little boy had started up in <b>his</b> <b>crib,</b> and was struggling, with his arms thrown wildly about.|$|E
50|$|House of Freaks was {{a two-man}} band formed in Richmond, Virginia in the mid-1980s. Bryan Harvey played guitar and sang, and Johnny Hott played percussion. The band managed {{to achieve a}} remarkably full sound, mostly because of Hott's inventive {{drumming}} and Harvey's confident vocals and knack of playing bass lines on <b>his</b> guitar (<b>cribbed</b> from <b>his</b> many years as a bass player) while simultaneously playing a melody.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am aware. The master {{generally}} knows <b>his</b> ass's <b>crib,</b> though I acquit you of {{any intention}} that way. Can you suggest anything for egregius exul?

6000|$|The sun {{was high}} in the heavens when Richard awoke. He turned on <b>his</b> straw-filled <b>crib,</b> and looked up. It was not the tapestried walls of his chamber at Laon that met his opening eyes, but the rugged stone and tall loop-hole window of a turret chamber. Osmond de Centeville {{lay on the floor}} by his side, in the sound sleep of one {{overcome}} by long watching and weariness. And what more did Richard see? ...|$|R
6000|$|He flung {{his arms}} round her neck, as she knelt beside <b>his</b> <b>crib</b> in the dark, and thus Mr. Kendal found {{the mother and}} son. As he bent to kiss them, Maurice exclaimed, {{with a sort of}} anger, 'Oh, mamma, why have I got a bullet in my throat?' ...|$|E
60|$|The purblind day was feebly {{struggling}} with the fog when I {{opened my eyes to}} encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon me.

60|$|The {{table was}} cleared {{as if by}} magic, for {{every member of the}} family helped. Soon, little Jim was {{sleeping}} as sound as a top in <b>his</b> <b>crib,</b> and Mrs Thorogood, with her knitting, joined the others at the fire, by the light of which the blacksmith made a little boat for Harry with a gully knife and a piece of stick.|$|E
30|$|Peter Hinkley {{recognized}} in 1968 that in <b>his</b> wood <b>crib</b> burning tests, {{there was a}} correlation between the heat release rate and the oxygen depletion in the hood exhaust (Hinkley et al. 1968). He recognized {{the potential of the}} method in that it did not suffer from lags and losses associated with direct thermal methods. He did not explore the generality or accuracy of the method in any detail and did not follow up on his findings.|$|R
6000|$|While {{they were}} {{yet in the}} {{enjoyment}} of the chops which had caused them so much mental and physical pain, they were alarmed by a sudden cry from Junkie. Looking round they saw that urchin on his knees {{holding on to the}} side of <b>his</b> home-made <b>crib,</b> and gazing in blank amazement at the hole in the wall which served for a window. And well might he gaze, for he saw the painted face of a black savage looking in at that window! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Outside the Golden Gate {{a number}} of Shadows were waiting, in {{different}} attitudes of depression and languor. Bavius and Maevius were there, still complaining of 'cliques,' railing at Horace for a mere rhymer of society, and at Virgil as a plagiarist, 'Take away <b>his</b> <b>cribs</b> from Homer and Apollonius Rhodius,' quoth honest Maevius, 'and what is there left of him?' I also met a society of gentlemen, in Greek costume, of various ages, from a half-naked minstrel with a tortoiseshell lyre in his hand to an elegant {{of the age of}} Pericles. They all consorted together, talking various dialects of Aeolic, Ionian, Attic Greek, and so forth, which were plainly not intelligible to each other. I ventured to ask one of the company who he was, but he, with a sweep of his hand, said, 'We are Homer!' When I expressed my regret and surprise that the Golden Gate had not yet opened for so distinguished, though collective, an artist, my friend answered that, according to Fick, Peppmuller, and many other learned men, they were Homer. 'But an impostor from Chios has got in somehow,' he said; 'they don't pay the least attention to the Germans in the Paradise of Poets.' ...|$|R
60|$|He was an enthusiast, and {{therefore}} happy, whom I {{have seen in}} the Humanity class-room on an examination day, his pen racing with time, himself seated in the contents of an ink bottle. Some stories of exams. have even a blacker ending. I write in tears of him who, estimating his memory as a leaky vessel, did with care and forethought draw up a crib that was more condensed than a pocket cyclopædia, a very Liebig's essence of the classics, tinned meat for students in the eleventh hour. Bridegrooms have been known to forget the ring; this student forgot <b>his</b> <b>crib.</b> In the middle of the examination came a nervous knocking at the door. A lady wanted to see the professor at once. The student looked up, to see his mother handing the professor <b>his</b> <b>crib.</b> Her son had forgotten it; she was sure that it was important, so she had brought it herself.|$|E
60|$|Having {{taken the}} first step already described, Georgie's mother finds some proper opportunity, when she can have the {{undisturbed}} and undivided attention of her boy--perhaps at night, after he has gone to <b>his</b> <b>crib</b> or his trundle-bed, and just before she leaves him; or, perhaps, at some time while she is at work, and he is sitting by her side, with his mind calm, quiet, and unoccupied.|$|E
60|$|A CHILD {{of three}} {{sat up in}} <b>his</b> <b>crib</b> and screamed {{at the top of}} his voice, his fists {{clinched}} and his eyes full of terror. At first no one heard, for his nursery was in the west wing, and the nurse was talking to a gardener among the laurels. Then the housekeeper passed that way, and hurried to soothe him. He was her special pet, and she disapproved of the nurse.|$|E
50|$|While {{conducting}} his research, {{the writer}} {{was not able}} to contact the Siegel or Shuster families.

500|$|Even {{during his}} early years, Danner {{displays}} superhuman strength. [...] He demolishes <b>his</b> wooden <b>crib</b> as a newborn, saves a man's life by lifting a two-ton supply wagon at 6 years old, and uproots entire trees at 10. He progressively grows stronger {{as he gets}} older. During his twenties, he can stop and kill a charging bull with a single punch, bend a railroad rail, lift a seventy-five millimeter howitzer cannon singlehandedly, lift a car and its driver singlehandedly, rip open a [...] bank vault, and easily catch a falling 8,000-pound block of stone.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson {{gives an}} example of a {{wideband}} microstrip bias tee covering 50 kHz to 1 GHz using four inductors (330 nH, 910 nH, 18 &micro;H, and 470 &micro;H) in series. [...] <b>His</b> design <b>cribbed</b> from a commercial bias tee. He modeled parasitic element values, simulated results, and optimized component selection. To show the advantage of additional components, Johnson provided a simulation of a bias tee that used just inductors and capacitors without Q suppression. Johnson provides both simulated and actual performance details. Girardi duplicated and improved on Johnson's design and points out some additional construction issues.|$|R
