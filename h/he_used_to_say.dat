5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E

500|$|Comparisons to Gnosticism {{are based}} not {{in what the}} author says, but in the {{language}} <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, notably, <b>use</b> of the concepts of Logos and Light. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown, {{have argued that the}} ancient Jewish Qumran community also used the concept of Light versus Darkness. [...] The arguments of Bultmann and his school were seriously compromised by the mid-20th-century discoveries of the Nag Hammadi library of genuine Gnostic writings (which are dissimilar to the Gospel of John) as well as the Qumran library of Jewish writings (which are often similar to the Gospel of John).|$|R

25|$|To {{assist him}} {{he succeeded in}} obtaining the help of Dr. W. H. R. Rivers, and in after years <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he counted it his chief claim to fame that he had {{diverted}} Dr. Rivers from psychology to anthropology. In April 1898, the expedition arrived at its field of work and spent over {{a year in the}} Torres Strait Islands, and Borneo, and brought home a large collection of ethnographical specimens, some of which are now in the British Museum, but the bulk of them for one of the glories of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge. The University of Cambridge later passed the wax cylinder recordings to the British Library. The main results of the expedition are published in The Reports of the Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits.|$|E
500|$|This {{study of}} nature {{translated}} into {{his use of}} ruled geometrical forms such as the hyperbolic paraboloid, the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the cone, which reflect the forms Gaudí found in nature. Ruled surfaces are forms generated by a straight line known as the generatrix, as it moves over one or several lines known as directrices. Gaudí found abundant examples of them in nature, for instance in rushes, reeds and bones; <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that there is no}} better structure than the trunk of a tree or a human skeleton. These forms are at the same time functional and aesthetic, and Gaudí discovered how to adapt the language of nature to the structural forms of architecture. He used to equate the helicoid form to movement and the hyperboloid to light. Concerning ruled surfaces, he said: ...|$|E
500|$|Once, {{he longed}} to visit the Thillai Nataraja Temple of Chidambaram, which enshrines Shiva as Nataraja, the Lord of Dance. <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{everyday}} that he will go {{the next day to}} Chidambaram, but never actually dared to step in the holy town, where he was prohibited entry. Thus, he {{came to be known as}} [...] "Tiru-Nalai-povar", 'he who will go tomorrow'. Finally, Nandanar reached the boundary of Chidambaram, but feared to set foot in the town. He saw the smoke of fire sacrifices and heard the chants of the Vedic scriptures. Thinking about how he can see Nataraja's dancing icon, the Nayanar circumambulated the town numerous times and finally succumbed to fatigue and slept. Shiva appeared in his dream and told Nandanar to enter the temple through a holy fire. The god also informed the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram to prepare a pyre. Next day, the Brahmins approached Nandanar as per the divine order.|$|E

500|$|Before his Berkeley {{professorship}} began, Oppenheimer {{was diagnosed}} with a mild case of tuberculosis and spent some weeks with his brother Frank at a ranch in New Mexico, which he leased and eventually purchased. When he heard the ranch was available for lease, he exclaimed, [...] "Hot dog!", and later called it Perro Caliente, literally [...] "hot dog" [...] in Spanish. Later <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "physics and desert country" [...] were his [...] "two great loves". He recovered from the tuberculosis and returned to Berkeley, where he prospered as an advisor and collaborator to a generation of physicists who admired him for his intellectual virtuosity and broad interests. His students and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing: hypnotic in private interaction, but often frigid in more public settings. His associates fell into two camps: one that saw him as an aloof and impressive genius and aesthete, the other that saw him as a pretentious and insecure poseur. His students almost always fell into the former category, adopting his walk, speech, and other mannerisms, and even his inclination for reading entire texts in their original languages. Hans Bethe said of him: ...|$|E
2500|$|Notwithstanding his prominence, Rabbi Mordechai always subordinated {{himself to}} his brother, Aharon. He {{consulted}} with him on every issue, attended his court on Shabbat, and even gave him kvitlach {{with the names of}} his family members. <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "When I want to enter my brother's room, I am overcome by fear, knowing who it is I am going to see. I try to turn back, due to my great fear. But one must go in!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he was the}} {{youngest}} of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred [...] "could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time".|$|E

2500|$|Paul McCartney {{made his}} debut {{with the group}} on Friday, 18 October 1957, at a Conservative Club social—organised by Walley—which {{was held at the}} New Clubmoor Hall in the Norris Green section of Liverpool. Lennon and McCartney wore cream-coloured sports jackets, which were paid for by Walley, and he {{collected}} half a crown per week from each member until the bill was settled. McCartney later clashed with Walley about payment: [...] "The funny thing was that whenever Paul [...] was around <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Don't pay anyone who's not playing' ... He didn't really rate managers".|$|E
2500|$|The first, {{and one of}} the longest-lived, was Sindo Garay (18671968). He was an {{outstanding}} composer of trova songs, and his best have been sung and recorded many times. Garay was also musically illiterate [...] in fact, he only taught himself the alphabet at 16 [...] but in his case not only were scores recorded by others, but there are recordings. Garay settled in Havana in 1906, and in 1926 joined Rita Montaner and others to visit Paris, spending three months there.

2500|$|According to Barks' {{description}} of his childhood, he was a rather lonely child. His parents owned one square mile (2.6km²) of land that served as their farm. The nearest neighbor lived half a mile (800 m) away, but he was more an acquaintance to Barks' parents than a friend. The closest school was about two miles (3km) away and Barks had to walk that distance every day. The rural area had few children, though, and Barks later remembered that his school had only about eight or ten students including him. He had high praise {{for the quality of}} the education he received in that small school. [...] "Schools were good in those days," [...] <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Once in the spring, {{a little}} before Midsummer, Walter heard {{that there were a}} great many wolves in the wood, and that pleased him.

2500|$|Underwood was a {{first-class}} bowler from his teens, {{and he took}} his 100th Test wicket and 1,000th first-class wicket in 1971, aged only 25. Only George Lohmann and Wilfred Rhodes had secured a thousand wickets {{at an earlier age}} than Underwood. <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that bowling was a 'low mentality profession: plug away, line and length, until there's a mistake', and sooner or later every batsman would make a mistake. He would finish his Test career with 297 wickets, and {{had it not been for}} his involvement in World Series Cricket and the rebel tour to South Africa, there is little doubt he would have had more than 300 Test wickets.|$|E
2500|$|Agip {{obtained}} {{an exclusive}} concession for {{gas and oil}} exploration within the national territory, {{and was able to}} retain the profits. Political views were divided: the leftists supporting him, and the conservatives (together with the industrialists), opposing him. At this time Mattei is alleged to have widely used unofficial financial resources of Agip for extensive bribery, especially of politicians and journalists. <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of political parties: [...] "I use them like I would use a taxi: I sit in, I pay for the trip, I get out". Agip gained control of hundreds of companies in all economic fields in the country. Mattei paid great attention to the press, and Agip soon took possession of several newspapers and two agencies.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1890s Garay got {{involved}} in the Cuban War of Independence, and decided a stay in Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic) {{would be a good}} idea. It was, and he came back with a wife. Garay settled in Havana in 1906, and in 1926 joined Rita Montaner and others to visit Paris, spending three months there singing his songs. He broadcast on radio, made recordings and survived into modern times. <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Not many men have shaken hands with both Jose Marti and Fidel Castro!"

2500|$|In the {{interval}} Great Britain had intervened in Egypt — {{the battle of}} Tel al-Kebir had been fought, Urabi Pasha had been banished, and Sir Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer) had succeeded Sir Edward Baldwin Malet. The British government, under the advice of Baring, insisted on the evacuation of the Sudan, and Muhammad Sharif Pasha having resigned office, the more pliant Nubar was induced to become prime minister, and {{to carry out a}} policy of which he openly disapproved, but which he considered Egypt was forced to accept under British dictation.

This being so, {{one has to wonder}} why Weldon was not more of a hustler on his own behalf. So far as we know, he seems to have done very {{little in the way of}} careerist self-advancement—although, to judge from photographs, he was by no means short of vanity. Arrogant, embittered and melancholic, he waited for acclaim to come to him, but none of the three books he published in his lifetime made much of a mark. (One commentator has estimated that Kees sold a total of 1,000 copies of his works before he disappeared.) ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} month Ulmanis cooperated with the Soviets. After Soviet {{controlled}} elections of July 14-15 a new parliament met and proclaimed a Soviet republic. On July 21, 1940 Ulmanis {{was forced to resign}} and asked the Soviet government for a pension and permission to emigrate to Switzerland. Instead, he was arrested and sent to Stavropol in Russia, where he worked in his original profession as Kolkhoz agronom for a year. After the start of German-Soviet war he was imprisoned in July 1941. A year later, as German armies were closing in on Stavropol, he and other inmates were evacuated to a prison in Krasnovodsk in present-day Turkmenistan. On the way there, he contracted dysentery and soon died on 20 September 1942. [...] His grave site is unknown, but a small memorial site was built in Turkmenbashi cemetery.
