25|$|Tritium is an {{important}} fuel for controlled nuclear fusion in both magnetic confinement and inertial confinement fusion reactor designs. The experimental fusion reactor ITER and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) will use <b>deuterium-tritium</b> fuel. The <b>deuterium-tritium</b> reaction is favorable since it has the largest fusion cross-section (about 5.0barns) and it reaches this maximum cross-section at the lowest energy (about 65keV center-of-mass) of any potential fusion fuel.|$|E
25|$|The Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) was a {{facility}} at the Los Alamos National Laboratory {{dedicated to the}} development and demonstration of technologies required for fusion-relevant <b>deuterium-tritium</b> processing.|$|E
25|$|One mole of <b>deuterium-tritium</b> gas {{would contain}} about 3.0grams of tritium and 2.0grams of deuterium. In comparison, the 20moles of {{plutonium}} {{in a nuclear}} bomb consists of about 4.5kilograms of plutonium-239.|$|E
25|$|Some proponents see a {{potential}} for dramatic cost reductions by converting energy directly to electricity. However, the conditions required to harness aneutronic fusion are much more extreme than those required for the conventional <b>deuterium–tritium</b> (D-T) nuclear fuel cycle.|$|E
25|$|All proto- and mid-life stars radiate {{enormous}} amounts of energy generated by fusion processes. Mass for mass, the <b>deuterium–tritium</b> fusion process releases roughly {{three times as much}} energy as uranium-235 fission, and millions of times more energy than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal. It is the goal of a fusion power station to harness this energy to produce electricity.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 a {{study of}} the ZETA results {{demonstrated}} an interesting side-effect; after an experimental run ended, the plasma would enter a short period of stability. This led to the reversed field pinch concept, which has seen some level of development since. On May 1, 1974, the KMS fusion company (founded by Kip Siegel) achieves the world's first laser induced fusion in a <b>deuterium-tritium</b> pellet.|$|E
25|$|Workable {{designs for}} a {{toroidal}} reactor that theoretically will deliver {{ten times more}} fusion energy than the amount needed to heat plasma to the required temperatures are in development (see ITER). The ITER facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2019. It will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2020, but {{is not expected to}} begin full <b>deuterium-tritium</b> fusion until 2027.|$|E
25|$|Using <b>deuterium-tritium</b> fuel, the {{resulting}} energy barrier is about 0.1MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an electron from hydrogen is 13.6eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) {{result of the}} fusion is an unstable 5He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining 4He nucleus is 3.5MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the ITER Tokamak complex {{started in}} 2013 and the {{building}} costs are now over US$14 billion as of June 2015. The facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2021 and will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2025 with full <b>deuterium–tritium</b> fusion experiments starting in 2035. If ITER becomes operational, it will become the largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment in use with a plasma volume of 840 cubic meters, surpassing the Joint European Torus by almost a factor of 10. The first commercial demonstration fusion power station, named DEMO, is proposed to follow on from the ITER project.|$|E
500|$|In {{conceptualized}} (hypothetical) {{nuclear fusion}} power plants, lithium {{will be used}} to produce tritium in magnetically confined reactors using deuterium and tritium as the fuel. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare, and must be synthetically produced by surrounding the reacting plasma with a 'blanket' containing lithium where neutrons from the <b>deuterium-tritium</b> reaction in the plasma will fission the lithium to produce more tritium: ...|$|E
500|$|Oliphant used {{electromagnetic}} separation {{to separate the}} isotopes of lithium. He {{was the first to}} experimentally demonstrate nuclear fusion. He found that when deuterons reacted with nuclei of Helium-3, tritium or with other deuterons, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Binding energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus. Following [...] Arthur Eddington's 1920 prediction that energy released by fusing small nuclei together could provide the energy source that powers the stars, Oliphant speculated that nuclear fusion reactions might be what powered the sun. With its higher cross section, the <b>deuterium–tritium</b> nuclear fusion reaction became the basis of a hydrogen bomb. Oliphant had not foreseen this development: ...|$|E
2500|$|Since this fusion process {{requires}} an extremely high temperature for ignition, and it produces fewer and less energetic neutrons (only fission, <b>deuterium-tritium</b> fusion, and [...] splitting are net neutron producers), lithium deuteride {{is not used}} in boosted bombs, but rather for multi-stage hydrogen bombs.|$|E
2500|$|This {{reaction}} {{is common in}} research, industrial and military applications, usually as a convenient source of neutrons. Deuterium is a naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen and is commonly available. The large mass ratio of the hydrogen isotopes makes their separation easy compared to the difficult uranium enrichment process. Tritium is a natural isotope of hydrogen, but {{because it has a}} short half-life of 12.32 years, it is hard to find, store, produce, and is expensive. Consequently, the <b>deuterium-tritium</b> fuel cycle requires the breeding of tritium from lithium using one of the following reactions: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, Holloway {{arrived at}} Purdue University {{on a secret}} {{assignment}} from the Manhattan Project. His task was to modify the cyclotron there to help the group there, which included L.D. P. King and Raemer Schreiber and some graduate students, measure the {{cross section of the}} fusion of a deuterium nucleus, when bombarded with a tritium nucleus to form a [...] nucleus (alpha particle), and the cross section of a <b>deuterium-tritium</b> interaction to form [...] These calculations were for evaluating the feasibility of Edward Teller's thermonuclear [...] "Super bomb", and the resulting reports would remain classified for many years.|$|E
2500|$|NIF is {{designed}} primarily {{to use the}} indirect drive method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a hohlraum (German for [...] "hollow room", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense X-rays, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the OMEGA and Nova lasers, validated this approach through the late 1980s. In {{the case of the}} NIF, the large delivered power allows for the use of a much larger target; the baseline pellet design is about 2mm in diameter, chilled to about 18 kelvins (−255°C) and lined with a layer of frozen <b>deuterium-tritium</b> (DT) fuel. The hollow interior also contains a small amount of DT gas.|$|E
2500|$|Before detonation, a few {{grams of}} tritium-deuterium gas are {{injected}} into the hollow [...] "pit" [...] of fissile plutonium or uranium. The {{early stages of the}} fission chain reaction supply enough heat and compression to start <b>deuterium-tritium</b> fusion, then both fission and fusion proceed in parallel, the fission assisting the fusion by continuing heating and compression, and the fusion assisting the fission with highly energetic (14.1MeV) neutrons. As the fission fuel depletes and also explodes outward, it falls below the density needed to stay critical by itself, but the fusion neutrons make the fission process progress faster and continue longer than it would without boosting. Increased yield comes overwhelmingly from the increase in fission. The energy released by the fusion itself is much smaller because the amount of fusion fuel is so much smaller. The effects of boosting include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Energy {{released}} in most nuclear reactions {{is much larger}} than in chemical reactions, because the binding energy that holds a nucleus together {{is greater than the}} energy that holds electrons to a nucleus. For example, the ionization energy gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is —less than one-millionth of the [...] {{released in}} the <b>deuterium–tritium</b> (D–T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. The complete conversion of one gram of matter would release 9×1013 joules of energy. Fusion reactions have an energy density many times greater than nuclear fission; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though individual fission reactions are generally much more energetic than individual fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Only direct conversion of mass into energy, such as that caused by the annihilatory collision of matter and antimatter, is more energetic per unit of mass than nuclear fusion.|$|E
2500|$|These are devices {{incorporated}} in nuclear weapons which produce a pulse of neutrons when the bomb is detonated {{to initiate the}} fission reaction in the fissionable core (pit) of the bomb, after it is compressed to a critical mass by explosives. [...] Actuated by an ultrafast switch like a krytron, a small particle accelerator drives ions of tritium and deuterium to energies above the 15keV or so needed for <b>deuterium-tritium</b> fusion and directs them into a metal target where the tritium and deuterium are adsorbed as hydrides. High-energy fusion neutrons from the resulting fusion radiate in all directions. Some of these strike plutonium or uranium nuclei in the primary's pit, initiating nuclear chain reaction. The quantity of neutrons produced is large in absolute numbers, allowing the pit to quickly achieve neutron levels that would otherwise need many more generations of chain reaction, though still small compared to {{the total number of}} nuclei in the pit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary device}} was a COBRA <b>Deuterium-Tritium</b> gas-boosted atomic bomb made by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, a very compact MK 7 device. This boosted fission device was {{tested in the}} Upshot Knothole Climax event and yielded [...] (out of 50–70 kt {{expected}} yield range), so that the planned operation Domino could be cancelled before the coming presidential election. The implosion system was quite lightweight at , because it eliminated the aluminium pusher shell around the tamper and used the more compact ring lenses, a design feature shared with the Mark 5, 12, 13 and 18 designs. The explosive material of the inner charges (I.C. for short) in the MK 7 was changed to the more powerful Cyclotol 75/25, instead of the Composition B used in most stockpiled bombs at that time, as Cyclotol 75/25 was denser than Composition B and thus could generate {{the same amount of}} explosive force in a smaller volume (it actually provided 13% more compressive energy than Comp B). The composite uranium-plutonium COBRA core was levitated in a type-D pit. COBRA was Los Alamos most recent end-product of design work on the very important [...] "new principles" [...] of the hollow core. A copper pit liner encased within the weapon-grade plutonium inner capsule prevented DT gas diffusion in plutonium, a technique first tested in Greenhouse Item. The assembled module weighed , measuring [...] across. It was located {{at the end of the}} device, which, as seen in the declassified film, shows a small cone projecting from the ballistic case. This cone is the part of the paraboloid that was used to focus the radiation emanating from the primary to the secondary.|$|E
