25|$|There is also {{a drastic}} lack of {{education}} given to governments, farmers, and the community about the science behind GM crops, as well as suitable growing practices. In most relief programs, farmers are given seeds with little explanation and little {{attention is paid to}} the resources available to them or even laws that prohibit them from distributing produce. Governments are often not advised on the economic and health implications that come with growing GM crops, and are then left to make judgments on their own. Because they <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> information regarding these crops, they usually shy away from allowing them or do not take the time and effort required to regulate their use. Members of the community that will then consume the produce from these crops are also left in the dark about what these modifications mean and are often scared off by their 'unnatural' origins. This has resulted in failure to properly grow crops as well as strong opposition to the unknown practices.|$|E
25|$|Other wards {{with high}} ethnic {{minority}} populations include Hendon, Barnes, Pallion and St Peter's. The Sunderland Urban Core {{is made up}} of all the wards listed on the table on the right hand side. In 2011, the least ethnically diverse ward was the Northside suburb Redhill which was 99.0% White (98.3% White British), 0.3% Asian and 0.1% Black. Redhill is closely followed by Fulwell which was 98.2% White British (99.0% White). These two wards <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> ethnic minorities that they can even be compared to rural wards in Cumbria. In the Sunderland Urban Subdivision, 6.4% of the population were from an ethnic minority group (non white British) compared with 5.2% in the surrounding borough. Sunderland is less ethnically diverse than Gateshead and the South Shields, mainly because of many outlying suburbs to the south, north and west of the city such as St Chad's, Southwick and Fulwell which have extraordinarily high white British populations. However, Washington is around 96% white British, a larger percentage than Sunderland.|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, Moqadem and Schaar filed {{a lawsuit}} against Lafosse {{demanding}} that they be able to review the film's screenplay. The 4th Civil Chamber of the Court of Brussels ruled that the lawsuit was [...] "admissible but unfounded." [...] However, production had already begun — cast negotiations were finished, and the team had already approached the French government about receiving subsidies — and Lafosse demonstrated no intent to hand over his work. The pair's lawyer subsequently released an official statement: [...] "Moqadem and Schaar feel that this is a violation of their privacy and do not understand why the filmmakers <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> respect for them." ...|$|E
500|$|The two {{met again}} in July at Fremland in Essex. Garnet told Catesby that he [...] "wished {{him to look}} what he did if he {{intended}} anything. That he must first look to the lawfulness of the act itself, and then he must not <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> regard of Innocents that he spare not friends and necessary persons for the Commonwealth." [...] When Catesby offered to tell the priest more, Garnet declined: [...] "I told him what charge we all had of quietness and to procure the like in others." [...] Garnet also spoke with William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, asking him [...] "if Catholics {{were able to make}} their part good by arms against the King", but Monteagle's reply was vague. [...] Author Alan Haynes suggests that Garnet may at that point have become marginalised.|$|E
500|$|... "The List" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "The List" [...] a B+, describing it as [...] "standard but well executed". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, had {{mixed feelings about}} it, ultimately rating it a B-. He felt that [...] "The List" [...] embodied a bland stand-alone X-Files episode for its underdeveloped concept and script, with [...] "attempts at drama" [...] that had no depth, and [...] "sideplots [...] <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> effect on the main narrative as to be basically padding". Handlen however praised the cinematography and art direction, the performances of both Ken Foree and J.T. Walsh, and the final scene, but ultimately considered that [...] "once you get past the set-design and cinematography, {{you end up with}} some good lines and a few scary moments, and that's it." ...|$|E

500|$|The State Department {{appeared}} {{to not be}} well-informed about the action, as Ball cabled Lodge {{a few hours after}} the coup started: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> info on motivations and other factors involved in current crisis that we leave to your judgment how to handle. Meantime we trust you will make very clear that we {{had nothing to do with}} coup. If you consider it advisable and possible there would seem to us to be merit in preserving Minh as head of Government since he appears to have best potentialities for rallying support of people." [...] The Pentagon had opposed the removal of Diệm and opposed his successors, while the State Department supported such a move, and Khánh later reflected: [...] "Maybe in the coup of January 30, 1964, the U.S. Army had come to conclude that it too should have the capacity to bring about a coup." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Aaliyah landed {{her first}} film role in Romeo Must Die, {{released}} March 22, 2000. Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist Jet Li, playing {{a couple who}} fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US$18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to [...] "make it easier on" [...] herself, but she heard [...] "that people {{were able to get}} into me, which is what I wanted." [...] In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times, who wrote that while Aaliyah was [...] "a natural" [...] and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, [...] "they <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Her role was well received by Glen Oliver by IGN who liked that she did not portray her character [...] "as a victimized female" [...] but instead [...] "as a strong female who does not come across as an over-the-top Women's Right Advocate." ...|$|E
