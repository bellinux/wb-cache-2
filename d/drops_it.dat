Some variations of the drink exist, such as blueberry and raspberry lemon <b>drops.</b> <b>It</b> is served at some bars and restaurants in the United States, and in such establishments {{in other areas of}} the world.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Lovett {{decides to}} abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean — in her {{possession}} all along — and <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep or has died in her bed, photos on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by the life she wanted to live with Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the Titanic Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player <b>drops</b> <b>it.</b> Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the slate behind if they want to climb a ladder.|$|E

5|$|The episode filmed {{for eight}} days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> onto {{a horde of}} walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|E
5|$|When local {{fishermen}} catch a large tiger shark, {{the mayor}} proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes it being the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable great white shark's tooth {{embedded in the}} submerged hull. He <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> after finding a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists fill the beaches. Following a juvenile prank, the real shark enters a nearby estuary, killing a boater and causing Brody's son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody finally convinces a devastated Vaughn to hire Quint.|$|E

5|$|With the Mujahideen's help, Bond {{plants a}} bomb aboard the cargo plane {{carrying}} the opium, but is spotted {{and has no}} choice but to barricade himself in the plane. Meanwhile, the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Milovy drives a jeep into the back of the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He re-activates the bomb and <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men gain an important victory over the Soviets. Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, infiltrating his estate with the help of his ally Felix Leiter, as Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} an ATM, but he <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> and an updraft carries it {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E
5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says that it looks like he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> in a trash can.|$|E

25|$|Ocean {{chemistry}} {{may also}} control which mineral shells are constructed of. Calcium carbonate has two forms, the stable calcite, and the metastable aragonite, which is stable {{within a reasonable}} range of chemical environments but rapidly becomes unstable outside this range. When the oceans contain a relatively high proportion of magnesium compared to calcium, aragonite is more stable, but as the magnesium concentration <b>drops,</b> <b>it</b> becomes less stable, hence harder to incorporate into an exoskeleton, as it will tend to dissolve.|$|E
25|$|American house spiders usually feed {{on small}} insects and {{household}} pests such as flies, mosquitoes, ants and wasps. They can randomly attack grasshoppers, butterflies, cockroaches or other spiders {{depending on their}} size. If the prey is too agile, the spider will try shooting web {{at it from a}} distance before pulling the thread toward itself. Bigger females can also attract baby skinks inside their web by leaving fly remains hanging in it. Once its food dries out, the spider usually <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> to the floor in order to free space in its web, instead of destroying and rebuilding it or changing its location.|$|E
25|$|Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford– {{former members}} of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the {{original}} leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the Chestnut Tree Café—with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, {{in the course of his}} editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> into a memory hole. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.|$|E
