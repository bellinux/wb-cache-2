This inflammatory response can lead to decreased corneal sensation, scarring, and blindness. The diagnosis of these lesions {{as the result of a}} recurrent herpes simplex virus infection can at times be problematic. Currently, <b>herpetic</b> stromal <b>keratitis</b> is diagnosed by its clinical presentation on the slit-lamp examination, but the literature does not always support the accuracy of these clinical findings.

40|$|In this report, we {{demonstrate}} that {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) infection of the cornea results in the upregulation of the matrix-degrading metalloproteinase enzyme MMP- 9. This enzyme was shown {{to contribute to the}} neovascularization process that occurs in the corneal stroma in response to HSV infection. The likely source of MMP- 9, at least initially after infection, was neutrophils that were signaled to invade the cornea soon after infection. Corneal infiltrating neutrophils were shown to express MMP- 9, and preventing the neutrophil response with specific mAb diminished MMP- 9 expression as well as the extent of angiogenesis. Further supporting a role for MMP- 9 in HSV-induced corneal angiogenesis was the observation that inhibition of MMP- 9 with the specific inhibitor TIMP- 1 resulted in reduced angiogenesis. In addition, angiogenesis was diminished in ocularly infected MMP- 9 knockout mice. Our results {{demonstrate that}} MMP- 9 is involved in angiogenesis caused by HSV.

Methods: A case of a 35 -year-old female with herpetic epithelial keratitis resistant to acyclovir is described. The patient presented following treatment for 4 weeks with topical acyclovir ointment five times per day and oral valacyclovir 1 g three times per day for <b>herpetic</b> <b>keratitis</b> with no resolution of the epithelial defect or symptoms.

In {{spite of the fact}} that HSK typically presents as a recurrent disease due to reactivation of virus which latently infects the trigeminal ganglia, most murine studies of HSK have employed a primary and not recurrent model of the disease. This report documents the several recurrent models of HSK that have been developed and how data generated from these models differs in some important aspects from data generated following primary infection of the cornea. Chief among these differences is the fact that recurrent HSK takes place in the context of an animal that has a preexisting anti-HSV immune response, while primary HSK occurs in an animal that is developing such a response.

40|$|Corneal {{infection}} of BALB/c mice with {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 results in a chronic inflammatory response in the stroma termed <b>herpetic</b> stromal <b>keratitis</b> (HSK).

However, the nature of the antigens, virus or host derived, which drive the inflammatory response remains in doubt. In this study, the relevance of infection with replicating virus for the subsequent development of HSK was evaluated with immunocompetent mice as well as with SCID mice reconstituted with herpes simplex virus-immune CD 4 !

In the corneas of immunocompetent mice, infectious virus, viral antigen, and mRNA expression were detectable for only a brief period of time (< 7 days postinfection), and all were undetectable by the time clinical lesions were evident (10 to 15 days). Viral replication, however, was necessary for the development of HSK in both models, since infection with UV-inactivated virus or with mutant viruses which were incapable of multiple rounds of replication in vivo failed to induce HSK. The inactivated and mutant viral preparations did, however, stimulate T-cell immune responses in immunocompetent mice.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Herpetic</b> stromal <b>keratitis</b> (HSK) is a {{blinding}} ocular disease that is initiated by HSV- 1 and characterized by chronic inflammation in the cornea. Although HSK immunopathology of the cornea {{is well documented}} in animal models, events pre-ceding this abnormal inflammatory cascade are poorly understood. In this study, we have examined the activation of pathologi-cal CD 4 T cells {{in the development of}} HSK. Dendritic cell autophagy (DC-autophagy) is an important pathway regulating ma-jor histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) -dependent antigen presentation and proper CD 4 T cell activation during infectious diseases. Using DC-autophagy-deficient mice, we found that DC-autophagy significantly and specifically contributes to HSK disease without impacting early innate immune infiltration, viral clearance, or host survival. Instead, the observed phe-notype was attributable to the abrogated activation of CD 4 T cells and reduced inflammation in HSK lesions. We conclude that DC-autophagy is an important contributor to primary HSK immunopathology upstream of CD 4 T cell activation. IMPORTANCE <b>Herpetic</b> stromal <b>keratitis</b> (HSK) {{is the leading cause of}} infectious blindness in the United States and a rising cause worldwide. HSK is induced by herpes simplex virus 1 but is considered a disease of inappropriately sustained inflammation driven by CD 4 T cells. In this study, we investigated whether pathways preceding CD 4 T cell activation affect disease out-come. We found that autophagy in dendritic cells significantly contributed to the incidence of HSK.

Little is known about specific host gene variants and molecular networks that influence herpetic disease progression, severity, and episodic reactivation. To identify such host gene variants we have initiated a forward genetic analysis using the expanded family of BXD strains, all derived from crosses between C 57 BL/ 6 J and DBA/ 2 J strains of mice. One parent is highly resistant and one highly susceptible to HSV- 1. Both strains have also been fully sequenced, greatly facilitating the search for genetic modifiers that contribute to differences in HSV- 1 infection. We monitored diverse disease phenotypes following infection with HSV- 1 strain 17 syn+ including percent mortality (herpes simplex encephalitis, HSE), body weight loss, severity of <b>herpetic</b> stromal <b>keratitis</b> (HSK), spleen weight, serum neutralizing antibody titers, and viral titers in tear films in BXD strains. A significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome (Chr) 16 was found to associate with both percent mortality and HSK severity. Importantly, this QTL maps close to a human QTL and the gene proposed {{to be associated with}} the frequency of recurrent herpetic labialis (cold sores). This suggests that a single host locus may influence these seemingly diverse HSV- 1 pathogenic phenotypes by as yet unknown mechanisms. Additional suggestive QTLs for percent mortality were identified [...] one on Chr X that is epistatically associated with that on Chr 16.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA {{persists}} in the corneas {{of patients and}} animals {{with a history of}} <b>herpetic</b> <b>keratitis.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to detect viral transcripts in the corneas of latently infected rabbits with a history of <b>herpetic</b> <b>keratitis</b> to determine whether the viral DNA represents latent virus, characterized by the restricted transcription of HSV genes and accumulation of the stable latency-associated transcripts (LATs), as occurs in neurons. METHODS. Rabbits were injected in the subalveolar mucosa with HSV strain RE. After 30 days, corneas were infected by intrastromal injection of HSV. Corneal disease was evaluated, and 7 to 378 days after infection, the rabbits were killed. DNA and RNA were isolated from corneas and trigeminal ganglia and amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers. RESULTS. <b>Herpetic</b> <b>keratitis</b> developed in all rabbits. All corneas of these immune rabbits contained viral DNA as many as 120 days after infection and then the frequency decreased over the next 260 days. Overall, viral DNA was detected in all ganglia and in 57 % of corneas. All latently infected ganglia but no corneas contained LATs. Transcripts of the early viral gene for thymidine kinase were detected in 23 of 30 ganglia and 10 of 17 corneas. Transcripts for the late viral glycoprotein C were not detected in either tissue...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ocular {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) {{infection}} remains {{a major cause of}} corneal blindness. Several topical and oral antiviral medications have been used to treat <b>herpetic</b> <b>keratitis.</b> Advances in topical ophthalmic antivirals have been made over the past several decades. The first antivirals that were discovered were cytotoxic, while the antivirals developed more recently, such as acyclovir and ganciclovir, have exceeded these drugs in both efficacy and tolerability. Commercially available outside of the US since 1996, ganciclovir ophthalmic gel, 0. 15 % (GCV 0. 15 %, European tradename: Virgan ®) is sold in more than 30 countries and has become the standard of care in treating acute <b>herpetic</b> <b>keratitis.</b> GCV 0. 15 % has been studied in animal models of ocular herpes, in healthy volunteers, and in several clinical studies. It {{has been found to be}} safe and effective at treating acute superficial <b>herpetic</b> <b>keratitis.</b> Previous preclinical studies of ganciclovir have shown activity against several common adenovirus strains and one recent clinical study demonstrated clinical effect against adenoviral conjunctivitis. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the GCV 0. 15 %, including a brief summary of the etiology and available treatments for ocular HSV, an explanation of GCV 0. 15 % mechanism of action, a compendium of preclinical and clinical GCV 0. 15 % studies, and an introduction into new areas of interest involving this drug...|$|E

40|$|GM-CSF) {{is thought}} to {{play a key role}} in chronic {{inflammatory}} diseases by governing the survival and function of infiltrating neutrophils. The objective of this study was to determine the putative role of GM-CSF in the pathogenesis of human <b>herpetic</b> stromal <b>keratitis</b> (HSK). METHODS. Primary human corneal fibroblast (HCF) cultures and a telomerase-immortalized human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell line representative of native HCE were stimulated with the known HSK-inducing cytokines interferon (IFN) -�, interleukin (IL) - 1 �, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -�. Alternatively, the T-cell cytokine IL- 17 was added solely or simultaneously. Human neutrophils were incubated with conditioned medium (CM) of the HCF and HCE stimulated with the aforementioned cytokines, or recombinant GM-CSF, and their viability or activation status was determined by flow cytometry. GM-CSF an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Herpetic</b> stromal <b>keratitis</b> (HSK) is a T cell-orchestrated, immunoinflammatory lesion {{that results}} from corneal Herpes simplex virus infec-tion. Previous reports {{indicate}} an essential role for proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 1 in HSK pathogenesis. The present study evaluates the efficacy of IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra) pro-tein {{in the management of}} HSK. Mice receiving IL- 1 ra had diminished disease severity. The ad-ministration of IL- 1 ra was shown to reduce the influx into the cornea of cells of the innate and adaptive immune response. In addition, the treat-ment diminished corneal vascular endothelial growth factor levels, resulting in reduced angiogenic re-sponse. Our results show the importance of target-ing early proinflammatory molecules such as IL- 1 to counteract HSK and advocate IL- 1 ra as an effective agent to achieve this. J. Leukoc. Biol. 76...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus- 1 (HSV- 1) {{infection}} of the cornea leads to a potentially blinding condition termed <b>herpetic</b> stromal <b>keratitis</b> (HSK). Clinical {{studies have indicated that}} disease is primarily associated with recurrent HSK following reactivation of a latent viral {{infection of}} the trigeminal ganglia. One of the key factors that limit inflammation of the cornea is the expression of Fas ligand (FasL). We demonstrate that {{infection of the}} cornea with HSV- 1 results in increased functional expression of FasL and that mice expressing mutations in Fas (lpr) and FasL (gld) display increased recurrent HSK following reactivation compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, both gld and lpr mice took longer to clear their corneas of infectious virus and the reactivation rate for these strains was significantly greater than that seen with wild-type mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that the interaction of Fas with FasL in the cornea restricts the development of recurrent HSK...|$|R
