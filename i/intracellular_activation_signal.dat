40|$|In human {{membrane}} proteins, intrinsically disordered regions, {{the regions}} that lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions, preferentially {{occur in the}} cytoplasmic tails. Many of these proteins represent cell receptors that function by recognizing their cognate ligand outside the cell and translating this binding information into an <b>intracellular</b> <b>activation</b> <b>signal.</b> Based on location of recognition and signaling (effector) domains, functionally diverse and unrelated cell receptors can be classified into two main families: those in which binding and signaling domains are located on the same protein chain, the so-called single-chain receptors (SRs), and those in which these domains are intriguingly located on separate subunits, the so-called multichain receptors (MRs). Recognition domains of both SRs and MRs {{are known to be}} well ordered. In contrast, while cytoplasmic signaling domains of SRs are well-structured as well, those of MRs are intrinsically disordered. Despite important role of receptor signaling in health and disease, extensive comparative structural analysis of receptor signaling domains has not been carried out as of yet. In this study, using a variety of prediction algorithms, we show that protein disorder is a characteristic and distinctive feature of receptors with recognition and signaling functions distributed between separate protein chains. We also reveal that disorder distribution patterns are rather similar within SR subclasses suggesting potential functional explanations. Why did nature select protein disorder to provide intracellular signaling for MRs? Is there any correlation between disorder profiles of signaling domains and receptor function? These and other questions are addressed in this article...|$|E
40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} recognize short peptides {{presented in}} association with MHC class I (MHCI) molecules {{on the surface of}} target cells. The Ag specificity of T lymphocytes is conferred by the TCR, but invariable regions of the peptide-MHCI (pMHCI) molecule also interact with the cell surface glycoprotein CD 8. The distinct binding sites for CD 8 and the TCR allow pMHCI to be bound simultaneously by both molecules. Even before it was established that the TCR recognized pMHCI, it was shown that CTL exhibit clonal heterogeneity in their ability to activate in the presence of anti-CD 8 Abs. These Ab-based studies have since been interpreted {{in the context of the}} interaction between pMHCI and CD 8 and have recently been extended to show that anti-CD 8 Ab can affect the cell surface binding of multimerized pMHCI Ags. In this study, we examine the role of CD 8 further using point-mutated pMHCI Ag and show that anti-CD 8 Abs can either enhance or inhibit the activation of CTL and the stable cell surface binding of multimerized pMHCI, regardless of whether there is a pMHCI/CD 8 interaction. We further demonstrate that multimerized pMHCI Ag can recruit CD 8 in the absence of a pMHCI/CD 8 interaction and that anti-CD 8 Abs can generate an <b>intracellular</b> <b>activation</b> <b>signal</b> resulting in CTL effector function. These results question many previous assumptions as to how anti-CD 8 Abs must function and indicate that CD 8 has multiple roles in CTL activation that are not necessarily dependent on an interaction with pMHCI...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{interactions}} of extracellular ligands with single membrane spanning receptors, such as kinases, typically serve to agonise or antagonise the <b>intracellular</b> <b>activation</b> of <b>signalling</b> pathways. Within the cell, E 3 ligases can act {{to alter the}} localisation and activity of proteins involved in signalling systems. Structural and functional characterisation of two closely related single membrane spanning molecules, RNF 43 and ZNRF 3, has recently revealed the receptor-like functionalities of a ligand-binding ectodomain combined with the intracellular architecture and activity of an E 3 ligase. This direct link provides a hereto novel mechanism for extracellular control of ubiquitin ligase activity that {{is used for the}} modulation of Wnt signalling, a pathway of major importance in embryogenesis, stem cell biology and cancer.

40|$|We have {{produced}} five monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) directed against idiotypic determinants of surface immunoglobulins (sIg) expressed on malignant B cells {{from a patient}} suffering from prolymphatic leukaemia (B-PLL). The anti-idiotype MoAb were characterized by immunofluorescence-binding studies, allotype reactivity, and immunoprecipitation studies and were found to recognize at least two distinct epitopes on the sIg of the neoplastic B cells. Differential effects of the soluble anti-idiotype MoAb on phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) -induced B-PLL-cell proliferation were found; three types of anti-idiotype MoAb could be distinguished: (1) MoAb that enhanced the PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation, (2) MoAb without effect, and (3) MoAb that inhibited the PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation. Addition of the calcium ionophore A 23187 could abolish the differential effects of the anti-idiotype MoAb on PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation. The negative effect of the type 3 MoAb on PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation {{was associated with a}} more than 10 -fold stronger binding to sIg expressed on the B-PLL cells, compared with the other anti-idiotype MoAb. The differential effects of the types 1 and 2 MoAb cannot be explained solely by differences in the Fc portion of the MoAb and binding characteristics. Neither did differences in epitope specificity necessarily lead to differential effects on PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation. In contrast to the clear differences found in the proliferation induction experiments, all MoAb were equally able to induce an early rise in free intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. Our data suggest that for B-cell proliferation to occur, apart from early rises of intracellular Ca 2 +, more prolonged [Ca 2 +]i elevations or additional <b>intracellular</b> <b>activation</b> <b>signals</b> are required. The differences in proliferative responses of B-PLL cells to anti-idiotype MoAb may be relevant for immunotherapy of B-cell tumours with anti-idiotype MoA...|$|R

Despite all efforts, the cur-rently available therapeutic interventions are limited. Prior studies have also proved that a multiple target inhibitor can be more efficient compared to a single target one. Therefore, de-velopment of novel inflammatory pathway-specific inhibitors would be of great value. To test this possibility, we screened our molecular library using recombinant kinase assays and identified the previously described compound VCC 251801 with strong inhibitory effect on both VEGFR 2 and PKD 1. We further analyzed the effect of VCC 251801 in the endotheli-um-derived EA. hy 926 cell line and in different inflammatory cell types.

40|$|Most T {{cells are}} {{produced}} in the thymus, where they proceed through several differentiation steps to shape the TCR repertoire. The first thymocyte subset to express a TCR complex {{is characterized by the}} expression of CD 4 and CD 8 co-receptors, CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes. At this stage, the CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes' fate relies on the affinity/avidity of their TCR towards self-peptide/MHC complexes. Indeed, elimination of thymocytes by apoptosis occurs in death by neglect, due to the absence of TCR-peptide/MHC interactions of sufficient affinity/avidity, and during negative selection, upon interactions of strong affinity/avidity. In contrast, weak affinity/avidity binding of TCR with its ligand would lead to positive selection followed by thymocyte maturation. This dissertation centers on understanding the factors involved in the elimination of thymocytes at the CD 4 +CD 8 + stage of thymic differentiation, namely death by neglect and negative selection. Particularly, we address the role of CD 45 in thymocyte deletion. Ligation of CD 45 in the absence of TCR signaling has been shown to induce mature T cell death. Thus, we have evaluated the consequences of CD 45 ligation on thymocytes in the absence of TCR triggering, and shown that it induces the death of thymocytes with rapid kinetics. Moreover, this non-necrotic form of cell death is independent of caspases and does not lead to DNA fragmentation. Based on these results, we propose a role for CD 45 in the induction of death by neglect. Next, we have evaluated the contribution of factors involved in negative selection. In particular, the individual impact of TCR-ligand affinity, TCR-ligand density, and costimulation in the process of negative selection was studied, We found that, with ligands of physiological affinity, costimulation is required for the induction of negative selection. In addition, our results suggest that increasing TCR ligand density or costimulation does not always promote thymocyte deletion. Finally, we studied some aspects of the <b>intracellular</b> <b>activation</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways leading to thymocyte apoptosis. Specifically, caspase- 3 was shown to participate in negative selection, and regulation of Nur 77 activity on a physiological mammalian DNA response element was identified, In summary, this work contributes to understanding the regulation of the apoptosis-induction in developing thymocytes...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} {{is essential}} to cell motility and tissue integrity and is regulated by the Integrin family of transmembrane receptors. Integrin binds to ligand extracellularly and provide anchor to the intracellular cytoskeleton via adhesion scaffolding proteins. In order to link cell to the surrounding matrix Integrin needs to be activated. <b>Intracellular</b> <b>activation</b> <b>signals</b> induce perturbations in Integrin cytoplasmic domain that are translated into a conformational change in extracellular region for high affinity ligand binding. Integrin engagement by matrix, in turn, triggers the assembly of adhesion complexes. Such early adhesions promote cytoskeletal organization with subsequent contractile activity that exerts forces against initial Integrin-matrix adhesions. In response to force, Integrin strengthens the interaction with matrix through its clustering and successive recruitment of additional adhesion components. These bidirectional regulatory loops mediated by such interactions are largely dependent on the unique function of Integrin adhesion components. We demonstrate a novel role for the PDZ/LIM domain protein Zasp as a core component of Integrin adhesions. Specifically, Zasp colocalizes with Integrins at focal adhesion in cultured cells and myotendinous junctions in Drosophila embryos. In both cases elimination of Zasp modifies Integrin function causing consequently defects in cell spreading and muscle attachment. Zasp supports Integrin adhesion to the extracellular matrix that is required to withstand tensile forces exerted during cell spreading and muscle contraction. Furthermore, {{we found that the}} distribution of Zasp in muscle Z-lines {{is essential to}} orchestrate the cross-linking of alpha-Actinin and Actin filaments. Disruption of Zasp leads to loss of muscle cytoarchitecture, pointing to a larger role for Zasp in sarcomere assembly. Finally, we demonstrate that Zasp, in addition to alpha-Actinin, physically interacts with the Integrin- and Actin-bound cytoskeletal protein Talin. Collectively, our results point to a dual role for Zasp as a structural scaffold. First it regulates Integrin adhesion to the extracellular matrix by interacting with the head domain of Talin at the myotendinous junctions. Second, Zasp controls sarcomere assembly by tethering the presarcomeric alpha-Actinin component to the tail domain of Talin. Zasp finding as a crucial adhesion component provides further insights on the mechanism underlying Integrin-mediated adhesion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Until now, no {{specific}} therapies {{are available to}} inhibit pancreatic fibrosis, a constant pathological feature of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. One major reason is the incomplete knowledge of the molecular principles underlying fibrogenesis in the pancreas. In the past few years, evidence has been accumulated that activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are the predominant source of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the diseased organ. PSCs are vitamin A-storing, fibroblast-like cells with close morphological and biochemical similarities to hepatic stellate cells (also known as Ito-cells). In response to profibrogenic mediators such as various cytokines, PSCs undergo an activation process that involves proliferation, exhibition of a myofibroblastic phenotype and enhanced production of ECM proteins. The <b>intracellular</b> mediators of <b>activation</b> <b>signals,</b> and their antagonists, are only partially known so far.

Through remodeling of the reactive tumor stroma and paracrine actions, CAFs regulate cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis, as well as tumor resistance to therapies. The CAFs found in stroma-rich primary hepatocel-lular carcinomas (HCC) and liver metastases of primary cancers of other organs predominantly originate from hepatic stellate cells (HSTC), which are pericytes associated with hepatic sinu-soids. During tumor invasion, HSTCs transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts in response to paracrine signals emanating from either tumor cells or a heterogeneous cell population within the hepatic tumor microenvironment.

We postulated that LAM affects GAL 9 /TIM 3 pathway, and, in consequence, the ability of the macrophage to control bacterial growth could be affected. In this work, we have generated MDM in the presence of LAM and observed that the expression of TIM 3 was not affected; in contrast, GAL 9 expression was downregulated at the transcriptional and protein levels. We observed that the cell surface and the soluble form of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 2 were decreased.

40|$|Fatal {{outcomes}} of Ebola virus (EBOV) infections are typically {{preceded by a}} 'sepsis-like' syndrome and lymphopenia despite T cells being resistant to Ebola infection. The mechanisms that lead to T lymphocytes death remain largely unknown; however, the degree of lymphopenia is highly correlative with fatalities. Here we investigated whether the addition of EBOV or its envelope glycoprotein (GP) to isolated primary human CD 4 + T cells induced cell death. We observed {{a significant decrease in}} cell viability in a GP-dependent manner, which is suggestive of a direct role of GP in T cell death. Using immunoprecipitation assays and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that EBOV directly binds to CD 4 + T cells through interaction of GP with TLR 4. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the addition of EBOV to CD 4 + T cells results in the significant upregulation of pathways associated with interferon signaling, pattern recognition receptors and <b>intracellular</b> <b>activation</b> of NFκB <b>signaling</b> pathway. Both transcriptome analysis and specific inhibitors allowed identification of apoptosis and necrosis as mechanisms associated with the observed T cell death following exposure to EBOV. The addition of the TLR 4 inhibitor CLI- 095 significantly reduced CD 4 + T cell death induced by GP. EBOV stimulation of primary CD 4 + T cells resulted in a significant increase in secreted TNFα; inhibition of TNFα-mediated signaling events significantly reduced T cell death while inhibitors of both necrosis and apoptosis similarly reduced EBOV-induced T cell death. Lastly, we show that stimulation with EBOV or GP augments monocyte maturation as determined by an overall increase in expression levels of markers of differentiation. Subsequently, the increased rates of cellular differentiation resulted in higher rates of infection further contributing to T cell death. These results demonstrate that GP directly subverts the host's immune response by increasing the susceptibility of monocytes to EBOV infection and triggering lymphopenia through direct and indirect mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Immunological {{signaling}} pathways {{between and}} within cells are central determinants {{of the success}} of immune responses. One major characteristic of immune signaling is a balance that is struck between pro-inflammatory responses to pathogens and anti-inflammatory regulation that stabilizes and modulates immunity. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a successful human pathogen that preferentially survives within host macrophages, the very immune cells that act to eliminate it. Exploitation of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms may be a strategy for M. tuberculosis survival within macrophages. This work first explores the evolved design principles of <b>intracellular</b> macrophage <b>activation</b> pathways relevant to countering M. tuberculosis infection. I used a mathematical model of the macrophage intracellular signaling network to predict that multiple synergistic <b>activation</b> <b>signals</b> are balanced by negative (anti-inflammatory) feedback from a single output, the killing effector nitric oxide. Without the presence of two <b>activation</b> <b>signals,</b> the feedback is antagonistic toward high levels of activation. I next implemented a representation of a growing intracellular population of M. tuberculosis in the macrophage signaling model. This shows that negative feedback of nitric oxide to <b>activation</b> <b>signaling</b> may not optimally kill bacteria compared to a possible positive feedback design. However, the model predicts that negative feedback imparts a kinetic advantage to elevating nitric oxide levels. The kinetics of nitric oxide induction offset the disadvantage of negative feedback if the timing of activating cytokine delivery occurs near the time of macrophage infection. On a different biological scale, I explored the roles of <b>activation</b> <b>signals</b> in M. tuberculosis infection with a computational agent-based model of granuloma formation. Model results suggest that multiple effects of the pleiotropic cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) are an essential feature of TNF function: loss of single TNF activities did not result in granuloma structures comparable to deletion of all TNF activity. Perturbation of multiple TNF activities simultaneously showed synergistic and competitive effects of individual TNF activities in granuloma formation. Finally, I explored possible ways to integrate a single-cell stochastic model of macrophage gene regulation into an agent-based model to simulate the roles of intracellular signaling {{in the context of the}} granuloma environment...|$|R

40|$|CXCR 1 {{is one of}} two high-affinity receptors for the CXC {{chemokine}} interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), a major mediator of immune and inflammatory responses {{implicated in}} many disorders, including tumour growth. IL- 8, released in response to inflammatory stimuli, binds to the extracellular side of CXCR 1. The ligand-activated intracellular signalling pathways result in neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation. CXCR 1 is a class A, rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the largest class of integral membrane proteins responsible for cellular signal transduction and targeted as drug receptors. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of CXCR 1 signal transduction is poorly understood owing to the limited structural information available. Recent structural determination of GPCRs has advanced by modifying the receptors with stabilizing mutations, insertion of the protein T 4 lysozyme and truncations of their amino acid sequences, as well as addition of stabilizing antibodies and small molecules that facilitate crystallization in cubic phase monoolein mixtures. The intracellular loops of GPCRs are crucial for G-protein interactions, and activation of CXCR 1 involves both amino-terminal residues and extracellular loops. Our previous nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that IL- 8 binding to the N-terminal residues is mediated by the membrane, underscoring the importance of the phospholipid bilayer for physiological activity. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of human CXCR 1 determined by NMR spectroscopy. The receptor is in liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers, without modification of its amino acid sequence and under physiological conditions. Features important for <b>intracellular</b> G-protein <b>activation</b> and <b>signal</b> transduction are revealed. The structure of human CXCR 1 in a lipid bilayer should help to facilitate the discovery of new compounds that interact with GPCRs and combat diseases such as breast cancer. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne {{intracellular}} {{bacterial pathogen}} capable of causing serious human disease. L. monocytogenes survival within mammalian cells {{depends upon the}} synthesis {{of a number of}} secreted virulence factors whose expression is regulated by the transcriptional activator PrfA. PrfA becomes activated following bacterial entry into host cells where it induces the expression of gene products required for bacterial spread to adjacent cells. Activation of PrfA appears to occur via the binding of a small molecule cofactor whose identity remains unknown. Electrostatic modeling of the predicted PrfA cofactor binding pocket revealed a highly positively charged region with two lysine residues, K 64 and K 122, located {{at the edge of the}} pocket and another (K 130) located deep within the interior. Mutational analysis of these residues indicated that K 64 and K 122 contribute to <b>intracellular</b> <b>activation</b> of PrfA, whereas a K 130 substitution abolished protein activity. The requirement of K 64 and K 122 for <b>intracellular</b> PrfA <b>activation</b> could be bypassed via the introduction of the prfA G 145 S mutation that constitutively activates PrfA in the absence of cofactor binding.
