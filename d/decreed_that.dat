The rites pertaining to circumcision were another honor reserved for the Zana-tompo. The king <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> they should inhabit the countryside south of the capital extending from Ambavahadimitafo southward to Ambatolampy. Outside of Antananarivo, the Zana-tompo lived {{in the village of}} Ambohimalaza.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} reports had been {{received}} about poor quality aircraft {{received by the}} regiments which pointed directly at the NII VVS as it was responsible for monitoring {{the quality of the}} aircraft delivered to the VVS. On 31 May 1941 the People's Commissariat of Defense <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> the NII VVS had been negligent. A number of senior managers were demoted {{and the head of the}} Institute, Major General A. I. Filin was summarily executed.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> the original capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{screening}} of the short for MGM executives, opinion was divided on whether Garland or Durbin should be retained. Finally, Louis B. Mayer, upon his return from a European trip, <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> both girls should be kept. However, Durbin's contract option had expired by then. She was signed by Universal Studios, where her first picture, Three Smart Girls, was so successful that it saved Universal from bankruptcy.|$|E

5|$|The English Reformation inevitably {{affected}} St Helen's Church. EdwardVI's 1547 injunction <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> all {{images in}} churches {{were to be}} dismantled or destroyed, including stained glass, shrines, roods, statues and bells, and altars were {{to be replaced by}} wooden tables. Damage during the Civil War was minimal; there are pike marks on the stonework. The church may have been fortified as part of the defences of the castle, a Royalist stronghold.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Games {{reached their}} zenith in the 6th and 5thcenturiesBC, but then {{gradually}} declined in importance as the Romans gained {{power and influence}} in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393AD, when the emperor Theodosius I <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> all pagan cults and practices be eliminated. Another date commonly cited is 426AD, when his successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.|$|E

5|$|Upon the monarch's initiative, the Diet of 1485 {{passed the}} {{so-called}} Decretum maius, a systematic law-code which replaced many previous contradictory decrees. The law-code introduced substantial {{reforms in the}} administration of justice; the Palatine's eyre and the extraordinary county assemblies were abolished, which strengthened the position of the county courts. Matthias also <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> in cases of the monarch's absence or minority, the Palatine was authorized to rule as Regent.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the Cisalpine Republic, the Legions were reorganized in France, as Napoleon {{ascended to}} power as the First Consul and <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> foreign troops could now serve in the French Army. On 10 February the {{remnants}} of the Italian Legions were reorganized near Marseilles into the Italian Legion (La Legion Italique) as a 9,000-strong unit (although soon reduced to 5,000) that would become part of the Army of Italy. The Legion fought at the Peschiera and Mantua.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|After the Dutch {{recognised}} Indonesia's independence on 27 December1949, {{following a}} several month-long {{conference in the}} Hague, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a drastic increase in enrolment at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws that limited the Church's ability to expand. In 1953 the Ministry for Religion <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> no foreign missionaries would be allowed into the country, and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from teaching. In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E

5|$|Although {{social order}} was {{maintained}} throughout the plague years, {{the economy of}} the region was devastated. However, the surviving merchant community were very influential in the city and, {{in the wake of the}} catastrophe, set about increasing the council's influence around the market, buying many of the surrounding shops. The council also bought a set of wharves along King Street near Dragon Hall in 1397 and <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> all goods entering Norwich by water be unloaded there. This ensured almost complete control of Norwich trade by the merchants who now dominated the council.|$|E
5|$|During {{their early}} years, West Bromwich Albion {{had played in}} {{whatever}} coloured kit was available locally. However, at a committee meeting held in September 1885, the club <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> blue and white striped jerseys should be adopted on a permanent basis. With {{the exception of a}} brief trial of scarlet and blue broad stripes early in the 1889–90 season, the team have worn these colours ever since, although initially the blue was of a lighter shade; the navy blue stripes were not introduced until after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the quake}} {{a program of}} {{rebuilding}} was rapidly put into action, but before it began in earnest some important decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in town planning, <b>decreed</b> <b>that</b> rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer piazze and wider main streets, often on a rational grid system. The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning. The city of Grammichele represents an example of these new cities rebuilted with a hexagonal plan.|$|E
