5|$|In 1988, Guy Caron {{left the}} company due to artistic <b>differences</b> <b>over</b> {{what to do with}} the money {{generated}} by Cirque du Soleil's first financially successful tour. Laliberté wanted to use it to expand and start a second show while Caron wanted the money to be saved, with a portion going back to the National Circus School. An agreement was never met and Caron, along with a large number of artists loyal to him, departed. This stalled plans that year to start a new touring show.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ {{was believed to be}} present in the Eucharist, but there were <b>differences</b> <b>over</b> the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of the Eucharist were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E
5|$|Raised a Roman Catholic, Wilders {{left the}} church at his coming of age. His travels to Israel and the greater Middle East as a young adult helped form his {{political}} views. Wilders worked as a speechwriter for the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie – VVD), and later served as parliamentary assistant to party leader Frits Bolkestein from 1990 to 1998. He {{was elected to the}} Utrecht city council in 1997, and one year later to the House of Representatives. Citing irreconcilable <b>differences</b> <b>over</b> the party's position on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, he left the VVD in 2004 to form his own party, the Party for Freedom.|$|E

5|$|During these {{difficult}} years, Boosey {{was supported by}} his trusted managing director, Ernst Roth. However, Roth later regarded the Boosey family as ineffectual and parochial. In the early 1960s, Roth forced Boosey's sons Anthony and Simon out of the company, and prevented his youngest son, Nigel, from even joining, allegedly {{at the behest of}} Benjamin Britten. Roth and Boosey also had <b>differences</b> <b>over</b> Britten's influence over the company. Roth regarded Britten as a gifted local musician, rather than a true genius like Roth's friends Strauss and Stravinsky. Boosey realised how valuable Britten was to the company, and agreed to Britten's request to divide the company into instruments and publishing. However, Britten humiliated Boosey by preventing him from chairing the music publishing board Boosey had established at Britten's request. In 1963, Britten also managed to get Boosey & Hawkes to employ Donald Mitchell to find new, young composers for the company. Angered by the sway Britten had over Boosey, Roth fired Mitchell within a year. Mitchell later set up Faber Music for book publisher Faber and Faber with the assistance of Britten and the blessing of T. S. Eliot.|$|E

25|$|Given these differences, many in {{the west}} had long {{contemplated}} a separate state. In particular, men such as lawyer Francis H. Pierpont from Fairmont, had long chafed under the political domination of the Tidewater and Piedmont slave-holders. In addition to <b>differences</b> <b>over</b> the abolition of slavery, he and allies felt the Virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds on needed internal improvements in the west, such as turnpikes and railroads.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} over One Unit (the division of Pakistan into only two provinces, east and west) {{and the appropriate}} electoral system for Pakistan, whether joint or separate, also revived as soon as Suhrawardy became Prime Minister. In West Pakistan, there was strong opposition to the joint electorate by the Muslim League and the religious parties. The Awami League however, strongly supported the joint electorate.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} an instrumentation system for a bench scale fluid bed granulator to determine the parameters expressing the changing conditions during the spraying phase of a fluid bed process. The study focused mainly on four in-line measurements (dependent variables) : fluidization parameter (calculated by inlet air flow rate and rotor speed), pressure <b>difference</b> <b>over</b> the upper filters, pressure <b>difference</b> <b>over</b> the granules (lower filter), and temperature of the fluidizing mass. In-line particle size measured by the spatial filtering technique was an essential predictor variable. Other physical process measurements of the automated granulation system, 25 direct and 12 derived parameters, were also utilized for multivariate modeling. The correlation and partial least squares analyses revealed significant relationships between various process parameters highlighting the particle size, moisture, and fluidization effect. Fluidization parameter and pressure <b>difference</b> <b>over</b> upper filters were found to correlate with in-line particle size and therefore could be used as estimates of particle size during granulation. The pressure <b>difference</b> <b>over</b> the granules and the temperature of the fluidizing mass expressed the moisture conditions of wet granulation. The instrumentation system evaluated here is an invaluable aid to gaining more control for fluid bed processing to obtain repeatable granules for further processing...|$|R

Tensions subsided only after 1967, when Egypt withdrew its troops from Yemen.

In 1969, NAWDCA joined the short-lived American Labor Alliance formed by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United Auto Workers. In 1979, NAWDCA affiliated with the UAW.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — One of {{the most}} {{substantial}} ways to protect users’ sensitive information is encryption. This paper is about the keyword index search system on encrypted documents. It has been thought that the search with errors over encrypted data is impossible because 1 bit <b>difference</b> <b>over</b> plaintexts may reduce to enormous bits <b>difference</b> <b>over</b> cyphertexts. We propose a novel idea {{to deal with the}} search with errors over encrypted data. We develop two similarity search schemes, implement the prototypes and provide substantial analysis. We define security requirements for the similarity search over encrypted data. The first scheme can achieve perfect privacy in similarity search but the second scheme is more efficient...|$|R
