40|$|The Schistosomatidae {{family is}} an {{important}} group of blood flukes, including serious human and livestock animal pathogens. With regard to reproduction, they are gonochoristic parasites. Their life cycle has two stages - asexual reproduction in an intermediary host (fresh water and sea gastropods) and sexual reproduction in the definitive host (mammals and birds). With regard to their pathogenicity at the definitive hosts, the blood fluke life cycle is abundantly maintained in laboratories. To preserve the whole cycle, the intermediary host gastropods are very important, They can <b>include,</b> <b>without</b> <b>limitation,</b> representatives of the Lymnaeidae family. However, their sensitivity to parasitism by blood flukes varies significantly by species. Floats were classified into several genera according to various parameters in the past. The systematics was most frequently based on anatomic and morphological differences. However, the most precise taxonomies are based on molecular data and mutual phylogenetic relationships of Lymnaeidaegastropods remain a subject of research. It is a fresh water family of gastropods with specific ecological and nutritional requirements.

5000|$|On November 19, 2013, the National Capital Planning Commission {{released}} {{their final}} recommendations regarding the Height Master Plan for Washington, DC. The plan, which {{looked at the}} question of possible changes to the Height of Buildings Act of 1910, also reviewed [...] "who or what entity should manage building heights....and gave voice to questions related to Home Rule {{as well as the}} role of the U.S. Congress...". The Commission has put forth four recommendations for Congress' consideration that would include both keeping the status quo in one instance, but proposing policy changes in the other. The first recommendation focuses on the area of the District of Columbia within the original L'Enfant city. [...] "Due to the concentration of federal interests within the L'Enfant City and to protect the integrity of the form and character of the nation's capital, the federal Height Act should remain in place and no changes should be made to the formula or approach for calculating allowable building height." [...] The second recommendation focuses on the area outside of the L'Enfant City and provides the District of Columbia government a mechanism in which to identify targeted areas in the city where they could proposed building heights to exceed the maximum currently allowed by the 1910 Height Act. [...] "These may be authorized through the existing Comprehensive Plan process, pending Congressional approval. Should such targeted exceptions be authorized through the Comprehensive Plan, the Height Act would remain in place for all other areas both inside and outside of the L'Enfant City." [...] The third recommendation focuses on the important vistas that currently exist within the city. [...] "The city's most significant viewsheds, to <b>include</b> <b>without</b> <b>limitations,</b> those to and from the U.S. Capitol and White House, should be further evaluated and federal and local protections established, which include policies in the Federal and District Elements of the Comprehensive Plan." [...] Finally, the last recommendation is in response to a specific request that the District of Columbia government put forth before Congress during the hearing in 2012. The National Capital Planning Commission agrees and recommends amending [...] "the Height Act to allow for human occupancy in existing and future penthouses, with restrictions." ...|$|R

30|$|The RipSeq {{algorithm}} {{has been}} validated {{for use with}} samples containing up to three different species of bacteria, although four bacterial species can occasionally be identified (Kommedal et al. 2009).

However, the resulting chromatograms were so complex {{that all of the}} peaks could not be <b>included</b> <b>without</b> exceeding the <b>limitation</b> of the RipSeq algorithm. Therefore, the obtained identifications were not dependable. Previous studies have shown that competition for reagents in mixed samples represents a major challenge in the performing of broad-range PCR and DNA sequencing directly from polybacterial samples (Kommedal et al. 2009). To minimise this problem, the use of Gram type-specific broad-range primers and the amplification of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in different tubes could be an alternative approach (Kommedal et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Resumo: Reiki, Toque Terapêutico (TT) e Healing Touch (HT) são Técnicas de Imposição de Mãos (TIM) que trabalham na harmonização do fluxo natural de energia vital do organismo. Esta energia, apesar de ainda não ser qualificada pela física, é citada por alguns autores como sendo o biocampo: o campo de energia intrínseco a todos os seres vivos, chamado também de campo quântico, clássico e não clássico. Um dos efeitos mais comumente reportados proveniente da aplicação dessas técnicas é o relaxamento, este, pode auxiliar na melhora da qualidade de vida de pessoas com câncer, assim como no alívio de sintomas como dor e stress-ansiedade. Este trabalho teve como objetivo verificar o uso e o efeito das TIM aplicadas ao câncer, a dor e ao stress-ansiedade, para isto foi realizada uma revisão sistemática da {{literatura}} nas bases de dados "PubMed/Medline", "Lilacs", "Embase", "Ebsco" e "Web Of Science" com os termos: "Reiki and Cancer, Reiki and Pain, Reiki and Stress, Reiki and Anxiety, Therapeutic Touch and Cancer, Therapeutic Touch and Pain, Therapeutic Touch and Stress, Therapeutic Touch and Anxiety, Healing Touch and Cancer, Healing Touch and Pain, Healing Touch and Stress e Healing Touch and Anxiety". Foram incluídos artigos sem limite em relação ao tempo e de língua Inglesa ou Portuguesa, foram excluídos artigos de revisão, duplicatas, artigos que não realizaram experimentos em seres humanos e que não reportassem o uso e/ou efeito dessas técnicas. Os resultados demonstram que as TIM são um recurso terapêutico não convencional benéfico para pessoas em tratamento do câncer, com dor e stress-ansiedade, revelando melhores resultados quando aplicadas sob abordagem fenomenológica e personalizada.;;Abstract:Reiki, Therapeutic Touch (TT) and Healing Touch (HT) are Techniques of Laying on of Hands (TLH) {{that work}} on harmonizing the natural flow of vital {{energy in the}} body. This energy, though not yet described by physics, is cited by some authors as the biofield: the field of energy intrinsic to all living beings, also called quantum, classical and non-classical field. One {{of the most commonly}} reported effects from the application of these techniques is relaxation, this can assist in improving {{the quality of life of}} people with cancer, as well as in relieving symptoms such as pain, anxiety and stress. This study aimed to examine the use and effect of TLH applied to cancer, pain and stress-anxiety, therefore systematic literature review was performed in the databases "PubMed/Medline ", " Lilacs ", " Embase ", " Ebsco" and " Web of Science " with the words: "Reiki and Cancer, Reiki and Pain, Reiki and Stress, Reiki and Anxiety, Therapeutic Touch and Cancer, Therapeutic Touch and Pain, Stress and Therapeutic Touch, Therapeutic Touch and Anxiety, Healing Touch and Cancer, Healing Touch and Pain, Healing Touch and Stress and Healing Touch and Anxiety". Articles were <b>included</b> <b>without</b> <b>limitation</b> in relation to time in English or Portuguese. Review articles, duplicates, items that did not perform experiments on humans and did not report use and/or effect of these techniques were excluded. The results show that TLH is a beneficial unconventional therapeutic resource for people in cancer treatment, or who fell pain and stress-anxiety, revealing better results when implemented in phenomenological and personalized approaches...|$|R
