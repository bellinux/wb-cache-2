5000|$|High-power vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers {{can also}} be fabricated, either by {{increasing}} the <b>emitting</b> <b>aperture</b> size of a single device or by combining several elements into large two-dimensional (2D) arrays. There have been relatively few reported studies on high-power VCSELs. Large-aperture single devices operating around 100 mW were first reported in 1993. Improvements in the epitaxial growth, processing, device design, and packaging led to individual large-aperture VCSELs emitting several hundreds of milliwatts by 1998. More than 2 W continuous-wave (CW) operation at -10 degrees Celsius heat-sink temperature was also reported in 1998 from a VCSEL array consisting of 1,000 elements, corresponding to a power density of 30 W/cm2. In 2001, more than 1 W CW power and 10 W pulsed power at room temperature were reported from a 19-element array. [...] The VCSEL array chip was mounted on a diamond heat spreader, taking advantage of diamond’s very high thermal conductivity. A record 3 W CW output power was reported in 2005 from large diameter single devices emitting around 980 nm.|$|E

Following this approach, for a given <b>emitting</b> <b>aperture</b> and for an arbitrary set of target points, {{it is possible to}} define a spatial monochromatic transfer matrix (MTM). The amplitude and phase of the acoustic field at the target points are computed by multiplying this matrix by the excitation vector formed by a spatial sampling of the acoustic field on the aperture. Interfaces are considered as secondary sources from which the incident wave is re-emitted. This way, it is possible modelling reflection, transmission and changes of vibration modes at interfaces...|$|E

40|$|The average {{intensity}} of finite laser beam propagating through turbulent atmosphere is {{calculated from the}} extended Huygens Fresnel principle. Formulas are presented for the slant path average intensity from an arbitrarily truncated Gaussian beam. The new expressions are derived from the modified von Karman spectrum for refractive-index fluctuations, quadratic approximation of the structure function, and Gaussian approximation for the product of Gaussian function and Bessel function. It is shown that the form of average intensity is not a Gaussian function but a polynomial {{of the power of}} the binomial function, Gaussian function, and the incomplete gamma function. The results also show that the mean irradiance of a finite optical beam propagating in slant path turbulent atmosphere not only depends on the effective beam radius at the transmitting aperture plane, propagation distance, and long-term lateral coherence length of spherical wave, but also on the radius of <b>emit</b> <b>aperture.</b> OCIS codes: 010. 1300, 010. 1290, 010. 1330.

40|$|A new {{procedure}} for {{the calculation of}} spatial impulse responses for linear sound fields is introduced. This calculation procedure uses the well known technique of calculating the spatial impulse response from the intersection of a circle emanating from the projected spherical wave with the boundary of the <b>emitting</b> <b>aperture.</b> This general result holds for all aperture boundaries for a flat transducer surface, and this is used in the procedure to yield the response for all types of flat transducers. An arbitrary apodization function over the aperture can be incorporated through a simple one-dimensional integration. The case of a soft baffle mounting of the aperture is also included. Specific solutions for transducer boundaries made from lines are given, so that any polygon transducer can be handled. Specific solutions for circles are also given. Finally, a solution for a general boundary is stated, and all these boundary elements can be combined to, e. g., handle annular arrays [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Using linear {{acoustics}} the emitted {{and scattered}} ultrasound field {{can be found}} by using spatial impulse responses as developed by Tupholme and Stepanishen. The impulse response is calculated by the Rayleigh integral by summing the spherical waves emitted {{from all of the}} aperture surface. The evaluation of the integral is cumbersome and quite involved for different aperture geometries. This paper re-investigates the problem and shows that the field can be found from the crossings between the boundary of the aperture and a spherical wave emitted from the field point onto the plane of the <b>emitting</b> <b>aperture.</b> Summing the angles of the arcs within the aperture readily yields the spatial impulse response for a point in space.

40|$|A special GaAs lidar using fiber coupled diode lasers was {{constructed}} {{for the purpose}} of measuring the extinction coefficient distribution within a large atmospheric volume at a rate compatible with atmospheric kinematics. The technique is based on taking backscatter signature ratios over spatial increments after the returns are normalized by pulse integration. Essential aspects of the lidar design are beam pulse power, repetition rate, detection system dynamic range and decay linearity. It was necessary to preclude the possibility of eye hazard under any operating conditions, including directly viewing the <b>emitting</b> <b>aperture</b> at close distance with a night-adapted eye. The electronic signal processing and control circuits were built to allow versatile operations. Extinction coefficient measurements were made in fog and clouds using a low-power laboratory version of the lidar, demonstrating feasibility. Data are presented showing range squared corrected backscatter profiles converted to extinction coefficient profiles, temporal signal fluctuations, and solar induced background noise. These results aided {{in the design of the}} lidar which is described. Functional tests of this lidar and the implications relevant to the design of a prototype model are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} imaging objects behind layers of scattering media. The transmitter is a focused array or an <b>aperture</b> <b>emitting</b> a short pulse. The scattered pulse is received by a focused array or aperture. The received signal consists of two components: the pulse scattered from a random medium and from the target, and these two components can be distinguished {{by the use of}} ultra wide band (UWB) pulse. The second moment of the received signal includes the fourth order moments of stochastic Green’s functions which are reduced to the second moments by the use of the circular complex Gaussian assumption, and of the generalized two-frequency mutual coherence function. This imaging theory is a generalization of optical coherence tomography (OCT), SAR and confocal imaging. It clarifies the relationships among resolution, coherence length, shower curtain effects, and backscattering enhancement. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{applications}} {{emerge as}} drivers for higher brightness fiber-coupled diode lasers: advanced solid-state pumping schemes and materials processing. In {{contrast to the}} well-established side-pumping schemes of laser rods, advanced pumping schemes for today's solid-state lasers {{make use of the}} high brightness of the pump sources to increase the performance and efficiency of the solid-state laser. Materials processing applications such as metal welding and cutting are commonly served with solid-state lasers or CO 2 lasers. Lately, the increased lifespan, reduced systems costs and increased brightness of fiber-coupled diode laser systems make them a new alternative. In this work, a diode laser system is described that yields 250 watts in a 600 micrometer spot with a numerical aperture 0. 2 of the focused beam, corresponding to a F/# of 2. 4. The system is based on a single 15 bar stack that operates in cw-mode. For brightness enhancement, it incorporates a measure to increase t he fill factor of the <b>emitting</b> <b>aperture</b> and polarization multiplexing. The brightness in the focus spot is 105 W/cm 2 with a F/# of 2. 4 focusing optic and 3. 105 W/cm 2 with a high speed F/# of 1. 4. To achieve the required symmetry for fiber coupling, the system incorporates a beam transformer that assimilates the beam quality along the two main axes of the beam profile.

40|$|Dynamic {{generation}} of obitial angular momentum (OAM) of light has enabled complex manipulation of micro-particles, high-dimension quantum entanglement and optical communication. We report an analog vortex transmitter made of one bilaterally symmetric grating and an <b>aperture,</b> <b>emitting</b> optical vortices {{with the average}} OAM value continuously variant in the entire rational range. Benefiting from linearly-varying transverse dislocation along its axis of symmetry, this diffractive transmitter possesses extra degree of freedom in engineering broadband optical vortices meanwhile preserving a novel spiniform phase with equally spaced singularities. It unlimitedly increases the average OAM of light by embracing more singularities, which is significantly different from that for Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and Bessel vortex beams.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} of {{measuring}} acoustic intensity automatically is presented. The method uses measur-ments of the cross spectrum of the pressures at two closely spaced microphones. The acoustic intensity probe used is composed of two microphones which are arranged in parallel and with a short distance slided along those axes, and combined symmetrically {{with respect to a}} holder axis. The holder can be turned around its axis by steps of a constant angle for measuring three directional components of an acoustic intensity vector. The acoustic intensity at a field point can be automatically measured by using such composed microphones. A transfer function technique is used for approximately correcting the phase-mismatch error between the instru-mentation of the signal channels of two microphones. This method of measuring acoustic intensity automatical-ly is actually applied to a visualization technque of the flow pattern of sound energy <b>emitted</b> from one <b>aperture</b> of an enclosure with a speaker inside.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} an {{analysis}} of the influence of the geometrical parameters on the sensitivity and linear range of the fiber optic angular displacement sensor, through computational simulations and experiments. The geometrical parameters analyzed were the lens focal length, the gap between fibers, the fibers cladding radii, the emitting fiber critical angle (or, equivalently, the <b>emitting</b> fiber numerical <b>aperture),</b> and the standoff distance (distance between the lens and the reflective surface). Besides, we analyzed the sensor sensitivity regarding any spurious linear displacement. The simulation and experimental results showed that the parameters which play the most important roles are the emitting fiber core radius, the lens focal length, and the light coupling efficiency, while the remaining parameters have little influence on sensor characteristics.

40|$|Image-based {{holographic}} stereogram rendering {{methods for}} holographic video have the attractive properties of moderate computational cost and correct handling of occlusions and translucent objects. These methods are also {{subject to the}} criticism that (like other stereograms) they do not present accommodation cues consistent with vergence cues and thus do not make use {{of one of the}} significant potential advantages of holographic displays. We present an algorithm for the Diffraction Specific Coherent Panoramagram [...] a multi-view holographic stereogram with correct accommodation cues, smooth motion parallax, and visually defined centers of parallax. The algorithm is designed to take advantage of parallel and vector processing in off-the-shelf graphics cards using OpenGL with Cg vertex and fragment shaders. We introduce wavefront elements - "wafels" - as a progression of picture element "pixels", directional element "direls", and holographic element "hogels". Wafel <b>apertures</b> <b>emit</b> controllable intensities of light in controllable directions with controllable centers of curvature, providing accommodation cues in addition to disparity and parallax cues. Based on simultaneously captured scene depth information, sets of directed variable wavefronts are created using nonlinear chirps, which allow coherent diffraction of the beam across multiple wafels.

40|$|Natural {{structures}} exhibiting simultaneous negative bulk permittivity and permeability {{have not}} yet been discovered. However, research interest {{over the past five years}} has grown with the proposition that artificial structures exhibiting these properties are realizable using specially-designed metallic inclusions embedded in host dielectric bodies. A periodic structure of metallic inclusions much smaller than the guided wavelength and embedded in a host dielectric medium is known in the physics and microwave communities as a 2 ̆ 2 metamaterial 2 ̆ 2. Such frequency-dependent effectively homogeneous materials may be designed to exhibit negative permeability and permittivity at certain frequencies. As predicted by electromagnetic theory, such negative index or 2 ̆ 2 left-handed 2 ̆ 2 metamaterials are shown to have unique filtering properties and exhibit negative refraction and 2 ̆ 2 backward wave 2 ̆ 2 propagation. The 2 ̆ 2 backward wave 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon describes the anti-parallel nature of phase velocity and group velocity in a negative index metamaterial and can be additionally characterized in vector theory using the left hand rule. Additionally, 2 ̆ 2 epsilon-near zero 2 ̆ 2 (ENZ) metamaterials are characterized by a bulk permittivity equal to zero. Applications include focusing radiation <b>emitted</b> by small <b>apertures.</b> This thesis provides the theory for metamaterial structures supported by simulations conducted with the commercial finite element method solver: Ansoft HFSS. Metallic inclusions such as the split ring resonator structure (SRR), S-shaped split ring resonator (SSRR), wire rod and capacitively loaded strip (CLS) are presented analytically and simulated in HFSS. Metamaterial structures designed to exhibit left-handed behavior in the X-band frequency region are simulated for frequency-dependent transmission, reflection and refractive properties. A test configuration for measuring a metamaterial slab 2 ̆ 7 s match to free space is proposed and constructed. Additionally a prism design and test plan geared for anechoic chamber testing and refraction measurement is proposed and built. Simulated inclusions are fabricated on FR- 4 epoxy laminate boards, combined to form metamaterial structures, and tested in the Cal Poly Anechoic chamber. Results show that transmission properties match closely with HFSS simulations. Prism metamaterial testing shows that negative refraction is visible in the 8 to 9 GHz region. A modified form of the Nicolson Ross-Weir method for parameter extraction using S-parameter data is shown to provide an initial approximation for the permeability and permittivity of the structure under test. Finally, both negative and zero-index metamaterials are analyzed in HFSS simulations to improve the directivity of EM radiation from sub-wavelength apertures. Epsilon-near zero metamaterials placed on sub-wavelength apertures are shown to improve directivity by two fold in the far-field at design frequencies...|$|R
40|$|A {{near-field}} scanning optical (NFO) system utilizes a subwavelength sized aperture {{to illuminate}} a sample. The aperture raster scans the sample. During the scan, the aperture {{is held in}} proximity to the sample. At each sampling point, the integrated far-zone energy distribution is stored. This collection of data is used to generate {{an image of the}} sample's surface. The main advantage of NFO systems is their very high spatial resolution. In this dissertation a hybrid finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) /angular spectrum code is used to study the electromagnetic and imaging properties of a NFO scanning system. In addition, a finite-difference thermal (FD-thermal) code is used to calculate the thermal properties of a NFO system. Various aperture/sample geometries are studied numerically using both TE and TM polarization within a two-dimensional metallic waveguide that forms the aperture. The spatial properties of the electric field <b>emitted</b> by the <b>aperture</b> with no sample present are greatly influenced by the polarization. In particular, the electric field with TM polarization exhibits sharp peaks near the corners of the aperture, while the field with TE polarization is smooth and peaked {{at the center of the}} aperture. For both polarizations, the electric field remains collimated for a distance comparable to the aperture size. The electric field for both polarizations is altered when a dielectric sample is placed in proximity to the aperture. It is shown that the most representative image of the sample's topography is obtained using TE polarization and the resulting total far-zone energy as the sampled data. It is also shown that simpler scalar methods do not accurately predict the imaging behavior of a NFO system. Under certain circumstances the relationship between the sample's topography and the detected image is nearly linear. Under these conditions a system transfer function is calculated. Using the transfer function, it is shown that the spatial resolution of a NFO system is on the order of the aperture size plus the aperture to sample spacing. Interestingly, the transfer function is object dependent. Post image equalization techniques are shown to increase system resolution. When a metallic sample is imaged, the object/image relationship is more complex than with a pure dielectric sample. In the metallic sample, signal enhancement is observed over sharp topographic features. In addition, the optical power that is absorbed in a metallic sample is converted to heat that flows throughout the sample. Thermal transfer between the tip and the sample is shown to play a smaller role in sample heating. It is shown that a wider thermal profile in the sample is obtained with TM polarization than with TE polarization. This is important in areas such as optical data storage, where an elliptically shaped data mark is predicted...|$|R
