2500|$|The {{explosion}} heavily {{damaged or}} destroyed six <b>high</b> <b>rise</b> <b>apartment</b> buildings in the complex.

[...] In the minutes following the blast, the residents of the complex evacuated severely injured U.S. military personnel from the area. With power out in many of the buildings near #131, the scene was chaotic and tense as little was known about the safety of the area from further attacks.

2500|$|A {{chapter of}} The Atrocity Exhibition is titled [...] "Crash!", and in 1970 Ballard {{organised}} {{an exhibition of}} crashed cars at the New Arts Laboratory, simply called [...] "Crashed Cars". The crashed vehicles were displayed without commentary, inspiring vitriolic responses and vandalism. In both the story and the art exhibition, Ballard dealt with the sexual potential of car crashes, a preoccupation he also explored in a short film in which he appeared with Gabrielle Drake in 1971. His fascination with the topic culminated in the novel Crash in 1973. The main character of Crash is called James Ballard and lives in Shepperton, though other biographical details do not match the writer, and curiosity {{about the relationship between}} the character and his author increased when Ballard suffered a serious automobile accident shortly after completing the novel. [...] Regardless of real-life basis, Crash, like The Atrocity Exhibition, was also controversial upon publication. In 1996, the film adaptation by David Cronenberg was met by a tabloid uproar in the UK, with the Daily Mail campaigning actively for it to be banned. In the years following the initial publication of Crash, Ballard produced two further novels: 1974's Concrete Island, about a man who becomes stranded in the waste area of a high-speed motorway, and High-Rise, about a modern luxury <b>high</b> <b>rise</b> <b>apartment</b> building's descent into tribal warfare.|$|E
