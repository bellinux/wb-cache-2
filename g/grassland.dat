5|$|Much of the Mendips is open {{calcareous}} <b>grassland,</b> {{supporting a}} wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for arable agriculture, particularly since World WarI. As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to <b>grassland,</b> but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the <b>grassland</b> habitat.|$|E
5|$|Páramo mountaintops {{have both}} <b>grassland</b> and lakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecoregions}} include tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands of the miombo woodland, {{dominated by}} miombo trees; and the Zambezian and mopane woodlands, {{characterized by the}} mopane tree; and also flooded <b>grassland</b> providing <b>grassland</b> and swamp vegetation.|$|E
50|$|These <b>grasslands</b> are {{classified}} with tropical and subtropical savannas and shrublands as the tropical and subtropical <b>grasslands,</b> savannas, and shrublands biome. Notable tropical and subtropical <b>grasslands</b> include the Llanos <b>grasslands</b> of South America.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grasslands</b> cover no {{less than}} 17% of the park. Seasonally wet {{headwater}} dambo <b>grasslands</b> include the larger part of the <b>grasslands</b> in LMNP. Bog <b>grasslands</b> are common especially near the mountains where seepage water creates year-round wet conditions.|$|R
50|$|The refuge <b>grasslands</b> are {{a habitat}} model for {{maritime}} <b>grasslands,</b> a disappearing habitat type on Long Island due to development. Maritime <b>grasslands</b> are native <b>grasslands</b> composed of little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), poverty grass (Danthonia spicata), hairgrass (Deschampsia flexuosa), and {{prickly pear cactus}} (Opuntia humifusa).|$|R
5|$|Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic}} of the area: ash–maple woodland (Fraxinus spp. and Acer spp.) often with abundant small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), calcareous <b>grassland</b> and mesotrophic <b>grassland.</b>|$|E
5|$|Besides parasitizing {{the host}} ant, P. rebeli also parasitizes the <b>grassland</b> plant Gentiana cruciata {{as a source}} of {{nutrition}} and feeds off of its flowers and developing fruits.|$|E
5|$|Faith et al. 2013 further {{suggested}} that the bluebuck, being a grazer, probably favoured <b>grassland</b> habitats. This hypothesis is supported by fossil evidencebluebuck fossils appear in significant numbers {{along with those of}} <b>grassland</b> antelopes. Kerley et al. 2009 {{suggested that}} the bluebuck frequented grasslands and shunned wooded areas and thickets. In a 1976 study of fossils in the Southern Cape, Klein observed that the bluebuck's habitat preferences were {{similar to those of the}} Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the reedbuck (Redunca).|$|E
25|$|Grass-dominated biomes {{are called}} <b>grasslands.</b> If only large, {{contiguous}} areas of <b>grasslands</b> are counted, these biomes cover 31% of the planet's land. <b>Grasslands</b> include pampas, steppes, and prairies.|$|R
40|$|At {{the second}} America’s <b>Grasslands</b> Conference, we grappled {{with this issue}} of loss of <b>grasslands</b> (especially since USDA does not measure the lost of <b>grasslands</b> in a formal fashion). We also {{explored}} and discussed other critical issues including how to raise the profile of <b>grasslands,</b> what federal policy opportunities exist to conserve <b>grasslands,</b> and importantly, how conservationists and private landowners (mostly ranchers) can better work together to conserve <b>grasslands.</b> The focus on working with ranchers was an important one. There was {{a high level of}} energy and enthusiasm around this issue, and participants (especially researchers) were particularly excited by the opportunity to have conversations with ranchers and other private landowners about ways to work together to conserve <b>grasslands...</b>|$|R
40|$|The montane (shola) <b>grasslands</b> of Western Ghats, South India are a {{component}} of a landscape mosaic including the better-studied shola forests. The conservation of the <b>grasslands</b> depends upon understanding their ecology. This review compiles available information and aims to evaluate the conservation potential of these <b>grasslands.</b> Most studies on these <b>grasslands</b> are descriptive in nature. There is little information regarding habitat heterogeneity, landscape configuration, natural disturbance, grazing and productivity in maintaining the <b>grasslands.</b> Succession is poorly understood because of the short-term nature of most studies. Human activities have historically influenced these <b>grasslands</b> {{and will continue to}} do so in more intensive manner. Threats to these <b>grasslands</b> include habitat loss, fragmentation, fires, and invasive species...|$|R
5|$|<b>Grassland</b> on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid <b>grassland</b> species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, in Wales {{there were}} 1,048,000 {{hectares}} under permanent grass, a further 437,000 hectares were rough <b>grassland,</b> 87,000 hectares were woodland and 239,000 hectares were arable land (including temporary <b>grassland).</b> The number of horses for agricultural purposes are {{not mentioned in}} the statistics, but there were 290,000 dairy cows, 214,000 other cattle, 28,400 pigs and 9,739,000 sheep in the country. There were also 945 arable and horticultural holdings, 1,753 dairy farms, 12,650 beef and sheep farms, 95 specialist pig units and 426 specialist poultry units.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} area planted, the arable crops grown in Wales were: foods for stock-feeding, spring barley, wheat, maize, winter barley, other cereals for combining, oilseed rape, {{potatoes}} and other crops. The <b>grassland</b> was predominantly permanent pasture, with only 10% of the <b>grassland</b> being under five years old.

5|$|Overgrazing, {{agriculture}} {{and the loss}} of wetland and moist <b>grassland</b> have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the African crake in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, <b>grassland</b> may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears to be under no real threat.|$|E
5|$|Tangascootack Creek's {{watershed}} covers 36.4 {{square miles}} (94km2) {{in the southern}} part of Clinton County, half of which is the watershed for North Fork Tangascootack Creek. A small amount of the watershed, less than 1%, has occasional residential uses, including sport camps and summer retreats. In formerly strip-mined areas there are patches of <b>grassland</b> and reforestation. Almost all of the area that is considered impaired by the Environmental Protection Agency, is forested. However, in areas where strip mining was done in the past, there are patches of <b>grassland</b> or reforested land. This land includes sports camps and summer retreats.|$|E

The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E
