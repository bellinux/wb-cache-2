40|$|Background Strategies {{to dissect}} {{phenotypic}} and genetic heterogeneity of {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD) have mainly relied on subphenotypes, such as age at onset (AAO) and recurrence/episodicity. Yet, evidence on whether these subphenotypes are familial or heritable is scarce. The aims {{of this study are}} to investigate the familiality of AAO and episode frequency in MDD and to assess the proportion of their variance explained by common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP heritability). Method For investigating familiality, we used 691 families with 2 - 5 full siblings with recurrent MDD from the DeNt study. We fitted (square root) AAO and episode count in a linear and a negative binomial mixed model, respectively, with family as random effect and adjusting for sex, age and center. The strength of familiality was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). For estimating SNP heritabilities, we used 3468 unrelated MDD cases from the RADIANT and GSK Munich studies. After similarly adjusting for covariates, derived residuals were used with the GREML method in GCTA (genome-wide complex trait analysis) software. Results Significant familial clustering was found for both AAO (ICC = 0. 28) and <b>episodicity</b> (ICC = 0. 07). We calculated from respective ICC estimates the maximal additive heritability of AAO (0. 56) and <b>episodicity</b> (0. 15). SNP heritability of AAO was 0. 17 (p = 0. 04); analysis was underpowered for calculating SNP heritability of <b>episodicity.</b> Conclusions AAO and <b>episodicity</b> aggregate in families to a moderate and small degree, respectively. AAO is under stronger additive genetic control than <b>episodicity.</b> Larger samples are needed to calculate the SNP heritability of <b>episodicity.</b> The described statistical framework could be useful in future analyses.

Over the last two decades, cross-disciplinary discussions between these two fields have increased as they tackle shared concerns, such as the phenomenology of recollection, and therefore allow for fruitful interaction.

After delineating Tulving’s chief theoretical import and multifaceted legacy, {{it goes on to}} chart the different attempts to capture the <b>episodicity</b> feature of memory according to three categories: a first approach aims to show the cognitive abilities required for a subject to episodically remember; the second defines <b>episodicity</b> as a stage-specific feature; the last explains <b>episodicity</b> in terms of the epistemological properties of episodic memory.

40|$|One of {{the major}} ways in which forest and grass fires {{have an impact on}} global climate is through the release of aerosols. Most studies {{focusing}} on calculating the radiative forcing and other climate impacts of fire aerosols use monthly mean emissions derived from the Global Fire Emissions Database that captures only the seasonal cycle of fire aerosol emissions. Here we present the results of a sensitivity study that investigates the climate response to the <b>episodicity</b> of the fires, based on the standard approach which releases emissions every day, and contrasts that to the response when fires are represented as intense pulses of emissions that occur only over 1 – 2 days on a monthly, yearly, or five-yearly basis. Overall we find that in the modified cases with increased levels of <b>episodicity,</b> the all sky direct effect radiative forcing increases, the clear sky direct effect radiative forcing remains relatively constant, and the magnitude of the indirect effect radiative forcing decreases by about 1 W m − 2 (from − 1. 6 to − 0. 6 W m − 2). In the long term, we find that an increase in aerosol emission <b>episodicity</b> leads to an asymmetric change in indirect radiative forcing in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere contributes to a slight shift in the annual average position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This shift is found to have a mixed effect on the overall performance of the model at predicting precipitation rates in the tropics. Given these results we conclude that future studies that look to assess the present day global climate impacts of fire aerosols should consider the need to accurately represent fire <b>episodicity...</b>|$|E

Executive functions, and episodic and personal semantic memory were assessed. Results showed that recent autobiographical memories (AMs) were mainly episodic, unlike remote ones. An age-related increase in the indices of <b>episodicity</b> and specific spontaneity for recent AMs was mainly mediated by an age-related increase in {{the efficiency of the}} three cognitive abilities.

40|$|In 1984 when Bill Williams {{highlighted}} the regionalization of salt lakes in Australia, little {{was known about}} lakes in the remote inland. It was thought the invertebrate fauna of such lakes was depauperate due to their being poor evolutionary loci associated with extreme <b>episodicity.</b> However, work {{in the last two}} decades, has shown the fauna of many inland lakes is relatively rich. Part of the reason for restricted faunas in the larger lakes is habitat homeogeneity. Nevertheless there is little diversification at the species level, indicating restrictions on speciation. There are also limits on diversity imposed by the harsh environment, as indicated by the lack of forms unable to survive severe desiccation, e. g. higher crustaceans. Lakes in central and the eastern inland are dominated by characteristic lower crustaceans such as Parartemia minuta, Daphniopsis queenslandensis, Moina baylyi, Trigonocypris globulosa and a new mytilocyprid ostracod, as well as some forms widespread in Australia and in salt lakes on other continents. This invertebrate fauna is just as distinct as those of other salt lake districts in southern Australia, further reinforcing the concept of regionalization in Australia.

40|$|A {{variety of}} models {{are used to}} explain an {{apparent}} <b>episodicity</b> in kimberlite emplacement. Implicit in these models {{is the assumption that}} the preserved kimberlite record is largely complete. However, some cratons now mostly devoid of Phanerozoic cover underwent substantial Phanerozoic burial and erosion episodes that should be considered when evaluating models for global kimberlite distributions. Here we show a broad temporal coincidence between regional burial phases inferred from thermochronology and gaps in the kimberlite record in the Slave craton, Superior craton, and cratonic western Australia. A similar pattern exists in the Kaapvaal craton, although its magmatic, deposition, and erosion history differs in key ways from the other localities. One explanation for these observations {{is that there is a}} common cause of cratonic subsidence and suppression of kimberlite magmatism. Another possibility is that some apparent gaps in kimberlite magmatism are preservational artifacts. Even if kimberlites occurred during cratonic burial phases, the largest uppermost portions of the pipes would have been subsequently eroded along with the sedimentary rocks into which they were emplaced. In this model, kimberlite magmatism was more continuous than the preserved record suggests, implying that evidence for <b>episodicity</b> in kimberlite genesis should be carefully evaluated in light of potential preservational bias effects. Either way, the correlation between burial and kimberlite gaps suggests that cratonic surface histories are important for understanding global kimberlite patterns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is well {{established}} that certain periods through geological time have been more favourable {{to the formation of}} phosphorite deposits than others. These 'phosphogcnic episodes ' have been correlated with periods of eustatic high sea-levels, global warm temperatures and increased marine productivity, amongst other factors. The development of phosphorite concretions in marine sediments of {{the southern part of the}} North Sea Tertiary Basin reflects <b>episodicity</b> corresponding to times of sea-level high-stands. In particular, concretions in Early Eocene marine mudstones make their appearance just above levels which indicate initiation of a more open connection between the Atlantic Ocean and the relatively nclosed North Sea Basin. Similarly, during the Middle Miocene, phosphoritc oncretions occur associated with indicators of oceanic influence. Elsewhere in the world, remote from the North Sea, phosphate-rich sediments also formed during these stratigraphically brief episodes. Occurrences of relatively sparse diagenetic phosphorite concretions inthe North Sea Basin therefore appear to be linked to large scale, possibly global, cycles and not solely to the local diagenctic environment. Most sedimentary rocks contain some phos-phate but some rocks contain anomalously high concentrations. Phosphate-rich sediments have probably been deposited uring all major sea-level transgressions during the Tertiary. How-ever, some periods have been more important than others and resulted in the formation of large phosphorite deposits (Riggs 1987). Many authors have discussed the occurrence and causes of <b>episodicity</b> in the formation of phos-phorites (e. g. Cook & McElhinny 1979; Bento...|$|E

We explored their correlations with vividness in personally significant autobiographical memories to provide evidence to support their relative claim to define episodic memories.

We asked a lifespan sample (N = 168) of 8 -, 12 -, 16 -, 20 -, 40 -, and 65 -year-olds of both genders (N = 27, 29, 27, 27, 28, 30) to provide brief oral life narratives. These were segmented into thematic memory units. Detailedness of person, place, and time did not correlate with each other or either vividness, memory specificity, or narrative text type.

We aimed to investigate the genetic underpinnings of total depressive episode count in recurrent MDD. Methods: Our primary sample included 1966 MDD cases with negative family history of bipolar disorder from the RADIANT studies. Total episode count was adjusted for gender, age, MDD duration, study and center before being tested for association with genotype in two separate genome-wide analyses (GWAS), in the full set and in a subset of 1364 cases with positive family history of MDD (FH+). We also calculated polygenic scores from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD and bipolar disorder studies. Results: <b>Episodicity</b> (especially intermediate episode counts) was an independent index of MDD familial aggregation, replicating previous reports. The GWAS produced no genome-wide significant findings. The strongest signals were detected in the full set at MAGI 1 (p= 5. 1 × 10 − 7), previously associated with bipolar disorder, and in the FH+ subset at STIM 1 (p= 3. 9 × 10 − 6 after imputation), a calcium channel signaling gene. However, these findings failed to replicate in an independent Munich cohort. In the full set polygenic profile analyses, MDD polygenes predicted <b>episodicity</b> better than bipolar polygenes; however, in the FH+ subset, both polygenic scores performed similarly. Limitations: Episode count was self-reported and, therefore, subject to recall bias.

40|$|The {{effects of}} plates and slabs on phase change {{dynamics}} {{have been investigated}} with convection models. Two complementary methods to simulate plates are used: material property and imposed surface velocity methods with temperature-dependent viscosity. For {{a wide range of}} model parameters, plates and slabs exert a significant control on phase change dynamics. As plate length (and hence plate age and convection cell aspect ratio) increases, both the propensity for slab penetration and the mass flux across an endothermic phase change increase. When cold downwellings are stiffened with a temperature-dependent rheology, slab penetration is enhanced, but total mass flux changes little. Plates organize large-scale flow and thermal structure and thereby affect phase change dynamics. As plates become larger, the resulting largerscale structures are influenced less by endothermic phase changes, thus reducing the degree of layering. A model showing completely layered convection for a plate of unit length becomes unlayered when the plate is 3 or 5 times longer. For a given Clapeyron slope, the proportion of time for slab penetration increases from zero for cases with small plates to more than 0. 5 for cases with large plates. The degree of layering, plate velocity, and mass flux are controlled by large-scale structures, while slab penetration may be more related to small-scale features. Therefore, whether or not subducted slabs penetrate the phase change may not necessarily indicate that convection is entirely layered or entirely unlayered. The <b>episodicity</b> of convection induced by an endothermic phase change strongly depends on plate length, rheology, and Clapeyron slope. A large plate and a stiff slab both weaken the <b>episodicity</b> of convection. Only for a certain range of Clapeyron slopes can the phase change induce a strong episodic thermal convection...|$|E

During this event, thermal rejuvenation and increased buoyancy of ocean lithosphere caused arc-terrane collision, marginal-basin shoaling, back-arc basin closure and ophiolite obduction. Convergent margins were placed in compression with increased coupling between subducting and overriding plates resulting in major ocean margin deformation.

40|$|Intra-plate {{volcanism}} {{in western}} Europe shows statistically significant <b>episodicity</b> during the Quaternary period. By comparing the known ages for eruptions in France and Germany, which are compiled here, with a composite oxygen isotope record, we {{have investigated the}} link between this episodic volcanism and the climate record {{over the last two}} million years. We show that increased volcanism between 415 - 400 ka and 17 - 5 ka correlates with warming phases {{at the end of the}} last Weichselian (Devensian) and earlier Elsterian (Anglian) glacial stages. The three significant caldera explosions in the eastern Eifel, Germany, are all associated with warming phases at the onset of interglacials. The growth and decay of nearby ice sheets suggest that surface changes in continental mass distribution during glacial Milankovich cycles could provide a mechanism for this correlation by means of the distal effects of flexural loading on the lithosphere.

40|$|The Precambrian {{geological}} {{record shows}} peak of activity at 1. 1, 1. 9 – 2. 1, 2. 7 and 3. 5 Ga, {{often associated with}} massive crustal production, orogenesis and supercontinent cycles. It {{has been suggested that}} these bursts of tectonic activity are due to mantle avalanche events, where accumulating subducted slabs periodically penetrate the 670 km discontinuity, and subsequent upwelling counterflow and plume activity results in massive volcanism. Here we present paleomagnetic evidence for periods of rapid plate motions coinciding with the observed peaks in crustal age distribution. We present a new model for plate-driven episodic tectonics in the Precambrian, where higher mantle temperatures result in lower lithospheric stresses, causing rapid pulses of subduction interspersed with periods of relative quiescence. Plate-driven <b>episodicity</b> will naturally arise for hotter mantle temperatures of the early Earth and can explain rapid pulses of plate motion and crustal production without the need to invoke mantle avalanche events. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} a backarc basin {{are linked to the}} dynamics of the subduction system. The opening of the central Mediterranean basins is a well-documented example of backarc extension characterized by short-lived episodes of spreading. The underlying reasons for this <b>episodicity</b> are obscured by the complexity of this subduction system, in which multiple continental blocks enter the subduction zone. We present results from three-dimensional numerical models of laterally varying subduction to explain the mechanism of backarc basin opening and the episodic style of spreading. Our results show that efficient backarc extension can be obtained with an along-trench variation in slab buoyancy that produces localized deformation within the overriding plate. We observe peaks in the trench retreating velocity corresponding first to the opening of the backarc basin, and later to the formation of slab windows. We suggest that the observed episodic trench retreat behavior in the central Mediterranean is caused by the formation of slab windows...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1800 ’s, oceanographers have {{explored}} and sampled across two-thirds of Earth using ships as observational platforms. Measurements and models from this exploratory, mapping and sampling, phase of oceanography {{have resulted in}} growing recognition of the diversity and complexity of processes that operate above, within and beneath the oceans. The questions posed from these efforts increasingly cannot be answered using only {{the tools of the}} present, {{in large part because of}} a limited ability to resolve <b>episodicity</b> and temporal change. For this and other reasons, the ocean sciences are beginning a new phase in which scientists will enter the ocean environment and establish interactive networks for adaptive observation of the earth-ocean system. The growing move to establish ocean observatories reflects this trend. It is reasonable to expect that the construction of substantial new ocean sciences observing systems will carry new requirements that may impact on existing ocean sciences facilities, and especially oceanographic research ships and deep submergence vehicles. As a consequence, th...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{studies of}} fluid {{flow in the}} mantle suggest that magma {{migration}} is an inherently time-dependent process that produces magmatic solitary waves from obstructions in melt flux. Previous work has considered one and two dimensional problems. Here we present the results of three dimensional calculations that utilize a new, efficient multigrid scheme. We demonstrate that one and two dimensional solitary waves are unstable and break up into sets of 3 -D solitary waves which are perfectly spherical when propagating through a uniform porosity medium. While these waves are not solitons, their non-linear interactions are qualitatively similar. The solitary waves are highly opportunistic and establish efficient pathways for migration by linking up with nearby waves. When the initial condition is a random distribution of porosity, the porosity structure can organize into elongate, time-dependent channels formed from chains of solitary waves. These results are natural consequences of the assumptions that the matrix is permeable and viscously deformable. We suggest that solitary waves are likely {{to exist in the}} mantle and may contribute to the <b>episodicity</b> of mantle magmatism...|$|E
40|$|Peaks in the Precambrian {{preserved}} crustal record {{are associated}} with major volcanic, tectonic and climatic events. These include addition of juvenile continental crust, voluminous high-temperature volcanism, massive mantle depletion, widespread orogeny and mineralization, large apparent polar wander velocity spikes, and subsequent palaeomagnetic intensity increases. These events impinge on the glaciation record, atmospheric and ocean chemistry, and on the rise of oxygen. Here we summarize and assess a number of geodynamic models that have been proposed to explain the observed <b>episodicity</b> in the Precambrian record. We find that episodic behaviour from nonlinear slab-driven models best explains the observed record. Examples of such slab-driven systems include mantle avalanches or episodic subduction. In these cases, rapid descent of slabs into the mantle drives fast plate motions and convergence at the surface. This is accompanied by large-scale upwellings of deep hot mantle, which contribute to voluminous volcanism. Further modelling will determine {{the relative importance of}} each mechanism, and reinforce the fundamental contribution of the mantle to the evolution of Earth's surface systems. 24 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Plate tectonic history, geological, geochemical (element and isotope ratios), and seismological (P-wave {{tomography}} and SKS splitting) {{data are}} combined with laboratory modeling {{to present a}} three-dimensional reconstruction of the subduction history of the central Mediterranean subduction. We fi nd that the dynamic evolution of the Calabrian slab {{is characterized by a}} strong <b>episodicity</b> revealed also by the discrete opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Calabrian slab has been progressively disrupted by means of mechanical and thermal erosion leading to the formation of large windows, both in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea and in the southern Apennines. Windows at lateral slab edges have caused a dramatic reorganization of mantle convection, permitting infl ow of subslab mantle material and causing a complicated pattern of magmatism in the Tyrrhenian region, with coexisting K- and Na-alkaline igneous rocks. Rapid, intermittent avalanches of large amounts of lithospheric material at slab edges progressively reduced the lateral length of the Calabrian slab to a narrow (200 km) slab plunging down into the mantle and enhancing the end of the subduction process...|$|E
