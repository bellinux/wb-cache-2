We find that both indicators affect the market value of a firm significantly even if we extensively control the effects of the other major determinants of the market value, including R&D investment and current return on asset. In addition, the forward citation affects the market value more in cumulative innovation area such as in IT, consistent with a theoretical proposition that the value of having a <b>dependent</b> <b>patent</b> is larger in the industry where innovation is cumulative among firms. patent quality, market value, forward citation, science linkage, cumulative innovation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author gives an {{overview}} of the regulation of compulsory licence in international and Serbian sources of patent law. From international sources the subjects of analysis are the Paris Convention, TRIPS Agreement and the Community Patent Convention, whereby the last one has not come into force yet, but also contains rules on compulsory license. As far as Serbian law is concerned, all patent laws are analyzed, from the first one adopted as early as 1922 in the first Yugoslavia, until the effective Patent Law from 2011. The evolution of compulsory license is traditionally paralleled to the institution of forfeiture of patent. As the forfeiture of patent, as a sanction against the patent owner who does not intend to exploit the invention, was gradually losing its significance, so were the rules on compulsory license becoming more detailed and nuanced. Nevertheless, at present compulsory license is an instrument rarely applied in practice. This is primarily true of cases of compulsory licenses that are usually referred to as classical, such as the one issued when the patent holder does not exploit the invention or exploits it insufficiently and the one issued for the purpose of exploitation of a <b>dependent</b> <b>patent,</b> on the one hand, and the compulsory license issued in public interest in narrower sense, on the other. It is to be expected, however, that two latest subcategories of compulsory license, the one issued as a remedy for the infringement of the rules of competition and the one issued for the production of medicines for the purpose of export into countries with problems relating to public health, will be applied more frequently in practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} performed {{throughout this}} dissertation aims at implementing quantitative methods {{in order to}} assess economic and technological performances of firms, i. e. it tries to assess the impacts of the determinants of technological activity on the results of this activity. For this purpose, a representative sample of the most important R&D firms in the world is constituted. The micro-economic nature of the analysis, as well as its international dimension are two main features of this research at the empirical level. The second chapter illustrates the importance of R&D investments, patenting activities and other measures of technological activities performed by firms over the last 10 years. The third chapter describes the main features as well as the construction of the database. The raw data sample consists of comparable detailed micro-level data on 2676 large manufacturing firms from several countries. These firms have reported important R&D expenditures over the period 1980 - 1994. The fourth chapter explores the dynamic structure of the patent-R&D relationship by considering the number of patent applications as a function of present and lagged levels of R&D expenditures. R&D spillovers as well as technological and geographical opportunities are taken into account as additional determinants in order to explain patenting behaviours. The estimates are based on recently developed econometric techniques that deal with the discrete non-negative nature of the <b>dependent</b> <b>patent</b> variable as well as the simultaneity that can arise between the R&D decisions and patenting. The results show evidence of a rather contemporaneous impact of R&D activities on patenting. As far as R&D spillovers are concerned, these externalities have a significantly higher impact on patenting than own R&D. Furthermore, these effects appear to take more time, three years on average, to show up in patents. The fifth chapter explores the contribution of own stock of R&D capital to productivity performance of firms. To this end the usual productivity residual methodology is implemented. The empirical section presents a first set of results which replicate the analysis of previous studies and tries to assess the robustness of the findings with regard to the above issues. Then, further results, based on different sub samples of the data set, investigate to what extent the R&D contribution on productivity differs across firms of different industries and geographic areas or between small and large firms and low and high-tech firms. The last section explores more carefully the simultaneity issue. On the whole, the estimates indicate that R&D has a positive impact on productivity performances. Yet, this contribution is far from being homogeneous across the different dimensions of data or according to the various assumptions retained in the productivity model. The last empirical chapter goes deeper into the analysis of firms' productivity increases, by considering besides own R&D activities the impact of technological spillovers. The chapter begins by surveying the alternative ways proposed in the literature in order to asses the effect of R&D spillovers on productivity. The main findings reported by some studies at the micro level are then outlined. Then, the framework to formalize technological externalities and other technological determinants is exposed. This framework is based on a positioning of firms into a technological space using their patent distribution across technological fields. The question of whether the externalities generated by the technological and geographic neighbours are different on the recipient's productivity is also addressed by splitting the spillover variable into a local and national component. Then, alternative measures of technological proximity are examined. Some interesting observations emerge from the empirical results. First, the impact of spillovers on productivity increases is positive and much more important than the contribution of own R&D. Second, spillover effects are not the same according to whether they emanate from firms specialized in similar technological fields or firms more distant in the technological space. Finally, the magnitude and direction of these effects are radically different within and between the pillars of the Triad. While European firms do not appear to particularly benefit from both national and international sources of spillovers, US firms are mainly receptive to their national stock and Japanese firms take advantage from the international stock.

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) yields important clinical informa-tion which often cannot {{be obtained from}} other imaging modalities. Cardiac pacemakers have conventionally been considered a contraindication to CMR, and relatively few data exist on CMR in such patients. Methods and results: We present 5 patients who underwent 6 CMR scans in a 0. 5 Tesla scanner. The patients were non-pacemaker dependent, and the pacemakers were reprogrammed prior to scanning to have sub-threshold output. Spin echo, gradient echo and real-time sequences were used with specific absorption rates of up to 0. 1 W/kg. A cardiologist was present during each scan, and the patient had continuous electrocardiographic and non-invasive monitoring of vital signs. Five of the scans were carried out without incident providing useful diagnostic information, which was not compromised by obvious artifact from the pace-maker box. In one case, the pacemaker began pacing at maximum voltage at a fixed rate of 100. This patient {{was removed from the}} magnet, and there were no clinical sequelae. The mean pre-and post-scan ventricular lead voltage threshold was the same (2. 28 V vs 2. 28 V).

40|$|Summary: Electric {{telegraphy}} developed {{rapidly in}} France between 1850 and 1880, {{so that by}} the end of that period the French had the largest network and most innovative system in the world. The same cannot be said for their telephone system, which at the turn of the century had a second-rate network and was almost totally <b>dependent</b> on foreign <b>patents.</b> In order to explain this contrasting situation the author examines the logic of two principal agents: on the one hand a group of engineers who, by means of what would today be called research and development, played a decisive role in the growth of telegraphy; on the other hand the Post Office, which, with its administrative logic, carried through its project to merge the post and telegraph administrations and to reduce this group of engineers to a minimum. The creation of the Ecole supérieure de télégraphie and its transformation into the Ecole professionnelle des P. et T. were milestones in the battle between these two parties.

40|$|In recent years, the {{biotechnology}} industry has surpassed a market worth of 200 billion dollars, with over 1. 4 million jobs dependent on that market. However, the {{biotechnology industry}} is also uniquely <b>dependent</b> on the <b>patent</b> system {{to protect the}} huge investments {{of time and money}} required to bring new research to the market. Increasingly, courts have improperly used the Patent Act 2 ̆ 7 s Section 101 subject matter eligibility requirement as a functional barrier for new biotechnological patents, creating substantial uncertainty in the validity of many patents. In particular, the courts have utilized judicially created exceptions to allowable subject matter [...] laws of nature, natural phenomenon, and abstract ideas [...] to invalidate a wide variety of biotechnology patents. This improper use has resulted in a tangled and confusing body of law, and a merging of Section 101 subject matter eligibility and Section 103 obviousness requirements for a valid patent. Recently, the Federal Circuit has begun to push back against this improper use, providing limiting principals in the use of Section 101 and the judicial exceptions. Instead of using Section 101 as a new functional barrier to patent validity, the Federal Circuit has properly delineated between the subject matter eligibility and obviousness requirements.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} glucose and cumulus cells on oocyte ATP levels and {{germinal}} vesicle breakdown (GVB) in isolated mouse oocytes have been examined. Oocyte-cumulus cell complexes or denuded oocytes (DO) from pregnant mare serum gonadotropin-primed immature mice were cultured in {{minimum essential medium}} containing 4 mM hypoxanthine and 1 mM pyruvate, in the absence or presence of 0. 55 mM glucose. After 17 - 18 hr {{in the presence of}} glucose, ATP in both the oocyte-cumulus cell complexes and oocytes derived from such complexes (cumulus cell-enclosed oocytes; CEO) was elevated, and less than one-half of the oocytes had resumed maturation (48 % GVB). Removal of glucose caused a decrease in ATP levels in complexes and CEO and reversed the meiotic arrest in CEO (98 % GVB), and these effects were mimicked by iodoacetate treatment. Higher frequencies of GVB were observed in glucose-free medium after more than 6 hr of culture, while ATP levels were reduced within 3 hr. Glucose had no effect on ATP levels or the meiotic state of denuded oocytes. Interestingly, iodoacetate had a stimulatory effect on GVB in DO (86 % GVB compared to 57 % in controls), but did not effect ATP levels. Glycerrhetinic acid, a gap junction uncoupler, completely suppressed oocyte-cumulus cell coupling in cultured complexes (0. 15 % coupling compared to 16. 6 % in controls) and reversed the inhibitory effect of glucose on oocyte maturation (91 and 95 % GVB at 10 and 25 μM compared to 42 % GVB in controls). This agent also prevented follicle-stimulating hormone-induced meiotic maturation in dibutyryl cAMP-arrested CEO. These results thus implicate mediation by gap junctions of both inhibitory and stimulatory signals from the cumulus cells. Comparison of ATP levels in spontaneously maturing CEO in vitro with those from oocytes maturing in vive in response to human chorionic gonadotropin revealed that a decrease in oocyte ATP preceded or accompanied GVB in spontaneously maturing oocytes but not in those maturing in vivo. The results {{of this study indicate that}} glucose-derived elevation of oocyte ATP contributes to meiotic arrest in cumulus cell-enclosed oocytes that is <b>dependent</b> on <b>patent</b> gap junctions. Furthermore, a model for reinitiation of oocyte maturation is supported in which spontaneous GVB results from cessation or interruption of inhibitory influences, while ligand-provoked GVB is brought about by the generation of stimulatory signals that override inhibitory input...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{with regard}} to the {{etiology}} of temporary proximal tubal obstruction, a recent paper [5] hypothesizes that small air bubbles, but more likely tubal kinking, may be an explanation of these findings in the patients undergoing HSG in the supine position. In a series of 156 patients, unilateral PTO was diagnosed in 15 % of patients (24 of 156) and bilateral PTO in 3 % (4 of 156). Rotating the patient such that the obstructed tube was inferior to the uterus resolved 63 % of the unilateral PTO, likely by unkinking the tube at the uterotubal junction, thus dramatically lowering the resistance to the flow of contrast medium. The same manoeuvre was less effective in bilateral PTO, where 25 % of the more <b>dependent</b> tubes became <b>patent.</b> Still, this report offers an important contribution to the explanation of “reversible” PTO. The possibility that some PTO are obstructions and not true occlusions is supported by the study of Sulak et al. [6] who in 1987 reported on 18 patients who were found to have bilateral PTO by both HSG and subsequent laparoscopy with chromopertubation and therefore underwent resection of the occluded tubal segment and anastomosis. Resected tubal segments were studied histologically, and in 11 of the 18 cases no tubal occlusion could be demonstrated. In six cases (three with occlusion and three with apparent patency) the tubal lumen contained an amorphous material of unknown etiology, often appearing to form a cast of the tube. The authors were the first to report on such “plugs” and speculated that, if they cause tubal obstruction, this would explain previously published findings of high pregnancy rates in infertility patients after HSG. The suggested mechanism would be, among others, dislodging of tubal mucus plugs.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} economics of historical and modern innovation. The first chapter makes inroads into understanding how competition and incentives shape the creative process which {{lies at the heart}} of all technological progress. The creative act is a classic example of a black box in academic research: we can see the inputs and outputs, but we know little about what happens in between. This paper uses new tools for measuring the content of digital media to see how commercial graphic designers’ work evolves in winner-take-all competition. In this chapter, I show that competition both creates and destroys incentives for innovation: some competition is necessary to motivate high-performers to experiment with novel, untested ideas over tweaking tried-and-true approaches, but heavy competition will drive them out of the market. In the second chapter, I study the effects of performance feedback on innovation in competitive settings. Feedback typically serves two functions: it informs agents of their relative performance, and it also helps them improve the quality of their product. The presence of these effects suggests a tradeoff between participation and improvement, as the revelation of asymmetries discourages effort. Using data from the same setting as chapter one, I first show that this tradeoff is real. I then develop a structural model of the setting [...] the first of its kind in the literature [...] and use the results to evaluate counterfactual feedback policies. The results suggest that feedback is on net a desirable mechanism for a principal seeking high-quality innovation. In the third chapter, I use the farm tractor as a case study to demonstrate that technologies diffuse along two distinct margins: scale and scope. Although tractors are now used in nearly every field operation and with nearly all crops, early models were far more limited in their capabilities, and only in the late 1920 s did the technology begin to generalize for broader use with row crops such as corn. Diffusion prior to 1930 was accordingly heavily concentrated in the Wheat Belt, while growth in diffusion from 1930 - 1940 was concentrated in the Corn Belt. Other historically important innovations in agriculture and manufacturing share similar histories of expanding scope. The key to understanding the pace and path of technology diffusion is thus not only in explaining the number of different users, but also in explaining the number of different uses. A common theme across all three chapters is the focus on developing tools or strategies to study innovation that are less <b>dependent</b> on <b>patent</b> data than the extant literature, since the majority of innovation is not patented (and often not patentable), and doing so while advancing the empirical literature on innovation in new directions...|$|R
40|$|Doutoramento em EconomiaThis thesis {{consists}} {{of a series of}} essays focusing upon regional and national differences and variations in terms of their innovation and growth performances, while also approaching the role played by intellectual property rights (IPR), knowledge intensive business services (KIBS), entrepreneurship and other traditional factors that influence innovation. The title of the thesis reflects the enormous variation of economic performance across regions and countries worldwide. Throughout the five essays of the thesis we attempt to highlight the most important forces that might be contributing to the reduction or widening of the existing gaps in economic performance. In our first essay, we argue that the "missing link" between economic growth and the production of knowledge is entrepreneurship as it enables new knowledge to be turned into economic valuable knowledge that generate commercial opportunities. We survey this concept and adopt a recently proposed model to demonstrate that a linkage between regional growth and entrepreneurship exists and apply it to Southern Europe (NUTS 2 regions in Italy, Portugal and Spain). We establish how any policy designed to bring about economic growth has to contend with the promotion of entrepreneurship as new firms are vital instruments in the commercial exploitation of knowledge. Thus, entrepreneurship plays a vital role in closing the gap between poor and rich regions within Southern Europe. The second essay puts forward a methodology for the construction of an innovation performance measurement tool for the 30 NUTS 3 regions in Portugal. This measurement is based upon the aggregation of a set of indicators collectively understood as representative of the "innovation phenomenon". The task proposed bears relevance across two distinct dimensions: in methodological terms conceptualising just what might be accepted as innovation within these spatial units, and, in practical terms given it results in identifying the relative positioning of each territorial unit. In general terms, we conclude that innovation in Portugal congregates around the main urban and industrial centres (Grande Lisboa and Grande Porto). Nevertheless, there are also other regions where efforts in terms of R&D investment and high technology production have been made and proven to be case studies of success, triggering a possible catching-up dynamic (Alentejo Central and Baixo Vouga). In our third essay, we follow various streams in the literature and estimate a knowledge/ innovation production function based on various determinants such as degree of urbanization, research and development (R&D) intensity, the structure of human resources, institutions and infrastructures and the existence of KIBS and technology companies. We use a composite measure of innovation as our <b>dependent</b> variable (using <b>patent</b> and trademark application counts), emphasizing different forms of intellectual capital as the outcome of the innovation process. This analysis is done on a regional scale, at the NUTS 3 level in Portugal. This micro-sphere allows us to discern the importance of local factors in innovation and, more specifically, the role of KIBS entrepreneurship as a key factor in generating innovation and as a means of transforming knowledge into marketable innovation. Further it allows us to highlight the importance of having trademarks as an output of our function. Deploying several econometric approaches, we manage to confirm the importance of KIBS, entrepreneurship, human capital, geographical location and good institutions as the main drivers of regional innovation in Portugal. The fourth essay studies the determinants of regional innovation in the European Union (EU) NUTS 2 regions through a knowledge production function approach that adopts a set of explanatory variables reflecting various factors linked to innovation systems. In order to measure regional innovation in the EU we build a composite variable, using trademark applications and patent applications, both at the NUTS 2 level. Our results demonstrate that this measure may be appropriate to identifying innovation that is not as technologically intensive as that captured by patent counts. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that traditional factors (such as business R&D, schooling and wealth) have a statistically significant effect on the production of innovation (measured through patents and trademarks), {{while at the same time}} entrepreneurship in the KIBS sector also has a significant role. In our last essay we survey the evidence behind the IPR boom in China and India, and its link to innovation. In terms of trademark applications lodged with domestic IP offices in 2009, the evidence demonstrates that, worldwide, China now ranks 1 st and India 5 th, while for patent filings China ranks 3 rd and India 9 th.

İhtiyaç duyulan teknik bilgiler, patentlerin genel erişime açık {{internet}} veri tabanlarına ulaşılarak temin edilebilmektedir. Patentler, yenilikçiliği ve kolay erişebilirliği nedeniyle endüstriyel araştırma ve ürün geliştirme için önemli bir bilgi kaynağıdır. Bu bilgi kaynağının yenilikçi/yenileşim tasarımlarda nasıl kullanılabileceğini bilmek çok daha önemlidir. Açık kaynaklardan kolaylıkla erişim sağlanabilecek olan patent veri tabanları bir çok farklı teknoloji istihbaratı metodları arasında öne çıkmaktadır. Tez çalışması kapsamında kullanılan patent kırma metodolojisi ve patentin kapsamını aşma yöntemleri istemlerin yeniden düzenlenmesini ifade eden yasal ve bir teknik sistemin yeni versiyonunu oluşturmayı sağlayan bir mühendislik yöntemidir. Bu çalışmada TRIZ yenilikçi problem çözme teorisi araçları incelenerek patent kapsamını aşma yaklaşımı ile izlenebilecek olası inovasyon yolları irdelenmiştir. Akabinde savunma endüstrisinde gelecekte çok stratejik öneme sahip olacak olan insansız hava araçları üzerinde alınmış patentler incelenmiş ve seçilen bir patentin kapsamını aşma tasarımına yer verilmiştir. 'Industrial espionage' {{activities that}} emerged after the Industrial Revolution have referred many states to take precaution against dangers {{that occur in}} enemy elements and have been effective in countering the shortcomings that will occur in war times. Both in short term to increase the deterrent strength of our national defense {{as well as in}} the long term in order to have a strong national defense technology, every way should be tried to become a global power.   At this point, starting from recent period of war history that has changed the nature of the world of politics, it is required to investigate the technology intelligence operations conducted in the states by using example case analysis and to determine the importance level of technology intelligence activities among the nationalization strategies for defense technology of Turkey. As part of the thesis, literature research was made within the framework of technology transfer, technology intelligence and the concepts of patent breaking techniques. According to the data obtained in accordance with the literature; future studies constitute a basis for technology management and the activities to set a national technology strategy.   Methods that mainly used in future studies appears on the topics of technology intelligence, technology assessment, technology forecasting and technology prediction. In this context, accelerated technology strategies for the Turkish defense industry were investigated among alternative forms of intelligence technology foresight activities by examining technology intelligence methods. This thesis presents a novel technical intelligence method of patent mapping for visualising conflicts between patent claims that incorporates the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ). Implemantation of “TRIZ: innovative invention technique” (the theory of inventive problem solving" in English acronym TIPS) as a method of accelerated technology intelligence to identify and to evaluate the certain technologies that could affect the current and future activities of the defense industry firms is the main objective of our study.   Between technology intelligence activities, providing information over patents, that were disclosed, has been increasing its importance across every day. The required technical data can be obtained by accessing publicly accessible internet database of patents. Patents are an important source of information for industrial research and product development because of easy accessibility and the inherent innovativeness. To know how to use this information resource in innovative/innovation designs is much more important. Patent intelligence; the transformation of content found in multiple patents into technical, business, and legal insight, is considered a key factor in gaining a competitive advantage in technologically competitive business environments. Patents provide a wealth of information about design concepts, their physical realization, and their relationship to prior designs in the form of citations. Patent databases which can be easily accessible from the open source stand out among many different methods of technology intelligence. The methodology of breaking patents and the method utilised to exceed the scope of the patent, that used in the context of thesis work, are engineering techniques that represents the rearrangement of claims which allows to create new versions of a legal and technical system.   In this study, possible innovation paths to exceed the scope of the patent were discussed by examining the tools of “TRIZ: the theory of innovative problem solving”. And finally, patents taken on unmanned aerial vehicles which will have strategic importance for the defense industry in the future have been examined and a design of exceeding the scope of a selected patent is included in dissertation. In the thesis, primarily one was selected by examining patents were approved in the field of defense industry and then TRIZ method to produce innovation over existing patents is used. Selected <b>dependent</b> and independent <b>patent</b> claims have been analyzed in detail. Data required for functional analysis examining the relationship between sub-functions with the patent's main functions have been created.   Subsequently patent function graph was revealed. After this step we used comprising a plurality of TRIZ method of ARIZ algorithm to obtain innovative proposals. Patents have been made taking into account the physical condition of the evaluation on each of the innovative proposals. An innovative form of patents on existing patents as a result of assessment work has been developed in this context. This thesis analyzed accelerated technical intelligence for Turkish defence industry developmet.  Technology intelligence tools have come to be regarded as vital components in planning for technology development and formulating technology strategies.
