The System has been designed and developed to monitor the electric parameters including voltage, current, phase angle and electric power consumption of a residence. The system {{is made up of}} intelligent realizing model which detects and regulates the <b>household</b> <b>electric</b> <b>equipments</b> for way of life by means of pursuing the contract price costs. It could keep costs low for the people and also boost the smart grid stability. The developed prototype has been carefully tested in the real home environment context for typical household appliances usages and the results are encouraging to apply in the real environment. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} of household appliances and the division of labor in accomplishing household tasks in the family. It investigated the relationship between ownership of specific items of <b>household</b> <b>equipment</b> and the performance of directly related household tasks and the overall ownership of <b>household</b> <b>equipment</b> and the overall division of labor in the family. Data for this study came from 2 ̆ 2 Determinants and outcomes of Household Time Use, 2 ̆ 2 which is part of the S- 206 Regional Research Project. Data from 214 two-parent, two-child households were analyzed to determine the relationship between ownership of <b>household</b> <b>equipment</b> and time spent in three categories of household tasks by husbands, wives and children. Ownership of <b>household</b> <b>equipment</b> was determined by means of an equipment inventory. The ownership of appliances and their relationship to the performance of directly associated tasks included: (microwave oven and time spent in food preparation; (2) dishwasher and garbage disposal and time spent in dishwashing; and (3) power garden and/or yard equipment and power shop tools and time spent in maintenance of home, yard, car, and pets. The total time spent in household production by husbands, wives, children and its relationship to the total number of household appliances owned was also studied. The t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis were used to analyze the differences in proportion of time spent in the various household tasks by wives, husbands, and children by ownership of related <b>household</b> <b>equipment.</b> No significant differences were found in the proportion of time spent in food preparation, dishwashing, and maintenance by wives, husbands, and children in households that did and did not own the related <b>household</b> <b>equipment.</b> The correlation between level of equipment ownership and husbands 2 ̆ 7 and children 2 ̆ 7 s proportion of total family time spent in household work was not significant indicating that as more equipment is acquired husbands and children do not contribute a smaller proportion of total family time in household work...|$|R

40|$|Every {{one of us}} uses {{carbon dioxide}} {{emitting}} energy source in our daily activities. The purposes of this research were to obtain information {{on the level of}} household activities of carbon footprint and to obtain information on the most influential factor of household activities in Denpasar City. The research method employed was the descriptive quantitative. The analysis of the first purpose was obtained by the multiplication of emission factor and the use of LPG and electrical capacity. The analysis of the second purpose was obtained by implementing the analysis of doubled linier regression supported by employing SPSS version 16. 00 program for Windows. The research result showed that the average of the total carbon footprint was as big as 138, 037. 02 g of carbon/month. Based on that average, the total of carbon footprint in Denpasar city with as many as 15, 908 households was 2, 195. 89 ton CO 2 e/month. The statistic analysis test showed the factors that influenced the carbon footprint were the amount of household members, the amount of <b>household</b> <b>equipments</b> which needed LPG to operate, the amount of <b>household</b> <b>equipments</b> which needed electricity to operate and the duration of using <b>electric</b> <b>equipments</b> whose R 2 power was as big as 90 %. The duration of using <b>electric</b> <b>equipments</b> had the highest correlation with the value of 62. 70 %. It is suggested that households should use energy saving equipments such as LED products; the government should consistently promote carbon saving movements; and to future research to calculate carbon footprint by using DNPI carbon calculator, or by using software LEAP. </p...|$|R
