40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) Program faces {{unprecedented}} logistics {{challenges in}} both upmass and downmass. Some items employed on the ISS exterior present significant technical issues for a controlled de-orbit {{on either the}} shuttle or an <b>expendable</b> <b>supply</b> vehicle. Such manifest problems arise due to structural degradation, insufficient containment of hazardous pressures or contents, excessive size, {{or some combination of}} all of these factors. In addition, the mounting hardware and other flight service equipment to manifest the returned equipment must itself be launched, competing with other upmass. EVA techniques and equipment to successfully contain and secure such problematic equipment result in numerous significant risks to the spacewalking crews and cost and schedule risks to the program. The ISS Program office has therefore developed a policy that advises the jettison of the most problematic objects. Such jettisoned items join a small family of nearly co-planar orbital debris objects that threaten the ISS on several timescales, besides threatening all satellites with perigee below the ISS orbit and the general human population on Earth. This analysis addresses the governing physics and the ensuing risks when an object is jettisoned. It is shown that there are four time domains which must be considered, each with its own inherent problems, and that a ballistic solution is usually possible that satsfies all constraints in all domains...|$|E

GAO was asked to evaluate VA's purchasing and tracking of <b>expendable</b> medical <b>supplies</b> and RME and their potential impact on veterans' safety. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing work and provides preliminary observations on (1) the extent of compliance with VA's requirements for purchasing and tracking of <b>expendable</b> medical <b>supplies</b> and RME and (2) steps VA plans to take to improve its oversight of VAMCs' purchasing and tracking of <b>expendable</b> medical <b>supplies</b> and RME. GAO reviewed VA policies and selected three requirements that GAO determined to be relevant to patient safety. At each of the five VAMCs GAO visited, GAO reviewed documents used to identify issues related to the three requirements and interviewed officials to gather further information on these issues. The VAMCs GAO visited represent different surgical complexity groups, sizes of veteran populations served, and geographic regions. GAO also interviewed VA headquarters officials and obtained and reviewed documents regarding VA headquarters' oversight. GAO shared the information in this statement with VA officials. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} proposes a {{theoretical}} model to discuss an optimal pricing {{strategy for the}} installbase business under monopoly. The installbase business considered here is such that a manufacturer deals in a system along with its replaceable parts as <b>expendable</b> <b>supplies</b> which are indispensable for the system to provide its services. The proposed model introduces three representative types of consumer segments: (1) a segment of power users who show rational purchase behaviors and use the system very frequently, (2) a segment of rational normal users who also have rationality in purchase behaviors but do not use the system very frequently, and (3) a segment of myopic normal users who are stimulated to purchase a system only by the system price and do not use it very frequently. Under the proposed model, {{it is suggested that}} the manufacturer should not target the power users only but should attract myopic normal users as well to be successful in the business...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} search and theoretical analysis {{were conducted to}} investigate the feasibility of cooling a craft on Venus through chemical reformation of materials from the atmosphere. The core concept was to take carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the Venus atmosphere and chemically reform it into simpler compounds such as carbon, oxygen, and carbon monoxide. This process is endothermic, taking energy from the surroundings to produce a cooling effect. A {{literature search}} was performed to document possible routes for achieving the desired reactions. Analyses indicated that on Venus, this concept could theoretically be used to produce cooling, but would not perform {{as well as a}} conventional heat pump. For environments other than Venus, the low theoretical performance limits general applicability of this concept, however this approach to cooling may be useful in niche applications. Analysis indicated that environments with particular atmospheric compositions and temperatures could allow a similar cooling system to operate with very good performance. This approach to cooling may also be useful where the products of reaction are also desirable, or for missions where design simplicity is valued. Conceptual designs for Venus cooling systems were developed using a modified concept, in which an <b>expendable</b> reactant <b>supply</b> would be used to promote more energetically favorable reactions with the ambient CO 2, providing cooling for a more limited duration. This approach does not have the same performance issues, but the use of <b>expendable</b> <b>supplies</b> increases the mass requirements and limits the operating lifetime. This paper summarizes the findings of the literature search and corresponding analyses of the various cooling option...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida on the {{conservation}} of forages as round bale silage. Grasses and legumes have been harvested using conventional hay making equipment and ensiled as large, round bales of high moisture forage sealed in plastic. When compared to hay, round bale silage offers an alternative forage conservation system that decreases {{the amount of time}} spent drying the forage prior to storage. The benefits of this system include reduced rain damage and field losses, and increased flexibility in scheduling harvesting (allowing producers to harvest for optimum forage quality and yield). When compared with chopped silage, the benefits of round bale silage include excellent dry matter recovery, decreased energy costs and lowered initial capital investment. Main disadvantages are increased capital investment and costs for <b>expendable</b> <b>supplies</b> (when the system is compared to hay), and the susceptibility of plastic used to store round bale silage to rodent damage and deterioration under intense sunlight. Field wilting (to increase dry matter at time of storage to 40 to 50 %) improves the quality of round bale silage made under Florida conditions. Three to four hours usually is required to accomplish this degree of wilt with bermudagrass. Adding ammonia to round bale silage prevents external molding but may result in undesirable fermentation characteristics, especially when high moisture, tropical forages are ensiled. Microbial inoculation (to promote lactic acid production) temporarily improves the quality of direct-cut, high moisture (< 30 % dry matter) round bale silage made with bermudagrass, but pH of inoculated silage generally is not lowered enough to stabilize such silage in a high-quality state. The combination of cellulase-enzyme treatment and inoculation, however, has shown potential to improve the quality of bermudagrass round bale silage...|$|R

The effects of increases in <b>expendable</b> system <b>supplies</b> required due to increases in life support system complexity are shown. Minimizing resupply through increased recycling and source reduction is illustrated. The effects of recycling upon resupply launch cost is also shown. Finally, material balance analyses have been performed based on quantity and composition data for both supplies and wastes, to illustrate the use of this approach by comparing ten different closed-loop life support system cases...|$|R
40|$|Progress towards {{development}} of an air revitalization system (ARS) for spacecraft breathable atmosphere regeneration is assessed, and a preliminary design for a one-person ARS is described. The ARS is considered a necessary component of any permanently manned orbital station, and {{studies have demonstrated that}} penalties for <b>expendable</b> air <b>supplies</b> justify an ARS for missions longer than 40 days. CO 2 must be removed and O 2 returned along with N 2, which can be extracted from hydrazine, with the H 2 component returning to the operation of the CO 2 reduction subsystem. An experimental ARS (ARX- 1) features a cabin humidity control unit, a CO 2 concentrator, an air-cooled CO 2 reduction reactor, an oxygen generator (electrolysis), the hydrazine N 2 generator, and a water handling unit.

40|$|A fully functional, microgravity-compatible {{microwave}} sterilization and depyrogenation system (MSDS) prototype {{was developed}} that {{is capable of}} producing medical-grade water (MGW) without <b>expendable</b> <b>supplies,</b> using NASA potable water that currently is available aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and will be available for Lunar and planetary missions in the future. The microwave- based, continuous MSDS efficiently couples microwaves to a single-phase, pressurized, flowing water stream that is rapidly heated above 150 C. Under these conditions, water is rapidly sterilized. Endotoxins, significant biological toxins that originate from the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria and which represent another defining MGW requirement, are also deactivated (i. e., depyrogenated) albeit more slowly, with such deactivation representing a more difficult challenge than sterilization. Several innovations culminated in the successful MSDS prototype design. The most significant is the antenna-directed microwave heating of a water stream flowing through a microwave sterilization chamber (MSC). Novel antenna designs were developed to increase microwave transmission efficiency. These improvements resulted in greater than 95 -percent absorption of incident microwaves. In addition, incorporation of recuperative heat exchangers (RHxs) in the design reduced the microwave power required to heat a water stream flowing at 15 mL/min to 170 C to only 50 W. Further improvements in energy efficiency involved the employment of a second antenna to redirect reflected microwaves back into the MSC, eliminating the need for a water load and simplifying MSDS design. A quick connect (QC) is another innovation that can be sterilized and depyrogenated at temperature, and then cooled using a unique flow design, allowing collection of MGW at atmospheric pressure and 80 C. The final innovation was the use of in-line mixers incorporated in the flow path to disrupt laminar flow and increase contact time at a given flow rate. These technologies can be employed in small-scale systems for efficient production of MGW in the laboratory or in a range of larger systems that meet various industrial requirements. The microwave antennas can also be adapted to selectively sterilize vulnerable connections to ultra-pure water production facilities or biologically vulnerable systems where microorganisms may intrude...|$|R

40|$|Excavating and {{transporting}} planetary regolith {{are examples}} of surface activities that may occur during a future space exploration mission to a planetary body. Regolith, whether it is collected on the Moon, Mars or even an asteroid, consists of granular minerals, {{some of which have}} been identified to be viable resources that can be mined and processed chemically to extract useful by-products, such as oxygen, water, and various metals and metal alloys. Even the depleted "waste" material from such chemical processes may be utilized later in the construction of landing pads and protective structures at the site of a planetary base. One reason for excavating and conveying planetary regolith is to deliver raw regolith material to in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems. The goal of ISRU is to provide <b>expendable</b> <b>supplies</b> and materials at the planetary destination, if possible. An in-situ capability of producing mission-critical substances such as oxygen will help to extend the mission and its success, and will greatly lower the overall cost of a mission by either eliminating, or significantly reducing, the need to transport the same expendable materials from the Earth. In order to support the goals and objectives of present and future ISRU projects, NASA seeks technology advancements in the areas of regolith conveying. Such systems must be effective, efficient and provide reliable performance over long durations while being exposed to the harsh environments found on planetary surfaces. These conditions include contact with very abrasive regolith particulates, exposure to high vacuum or dry (partial) atmospheres, wide variations in temperature, reduced gravity, and exposure to space radiation. Regolith conveying techniques that combine reduced failure modes and low energy consumption with high material transfer rates will provide significant value for future space exploration missions to the surfaces of the moon, Mars and asteroids. Pneumatic regolith conveying has demonstrated itself to be a viable delivery system through testing under terrestrial and reduced gravity conditions in recent years. Modeling and experimental testing have been conducted at NASA Kennedy Space Center to study and advance pneumatic planetary regolith delivery systems in support of NASA's ISRU project. The goal of this work is to use the model to predict solid-gas flow patterns in reduced gravity environments for ISRU inlet gas line allowing the eductor inlet gas flow to vary and depend on the flow pattern developed at the eductor as inferred by the experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|It {{is almost}} as {{difficult}} to find individuals opposed to waterfowl conservation {{as it is to}} hear Americans speaking out against motherhood or corn on the cob. Yet, in a real sense, it has been the American tradition of unchecked population expansion, taming the wilderness, and converting prairies and marshes into cornfields that has nearly spelled disaster for some of our native waterfowl. Of a wetland area in the United States that originally covered some 127 million acres, nearly 50 million acres have already been drained and lost as waterfowl habitat. Marshes have not only been converted to farmland but also have provided land for expanding suburbs and have been covered with cement or asphalt for roads, airports, and the other hallmarks of modern civilization. All of this has been done in the hallowed name of progress, for the benefits of a greater gross national product, and in hopes of a higher collective standard of living. Unfortunately, waterfowl have had few spokesmen to decry their changing standards of living, and their gross national product can only be measured in terms of the numbers of birds that annually fly southward toward their wintering areas. These numbers, as reflected in annual harvests and changes in season lengths and bag limits, provide a measure of the health of our waterfowl resource. In recent decades that health index has often sagged alarmingly, and a few species have scarcely been able to recover from these setbacks. Some persons might well pose the questions: 2 ̆ 2 Just how important to our economy is a healthy waterfowl population? So what if one or two species might become extinct, aren 2 ̆ 7 t there plenty more to take their places? 2 ̆ 2 It is nothing if not traditional to measure the value of things in terms of dollars, the very lodestone of American values. Thus, there are the annual license fees and 2 ̆ 2 duck stamp 2 ̆ 2 costs paid by some two million hunters-and the costs of ammunition, gas, lodging, and <b>expendable</b> <b>supplies</b> that are used on every hunt. Then there are the depreciation costs on guns, clothes, vehicles, boats, decoys, and all the other special equipment on which the waterfowl hunter lavishes his care and dollars. Costs of raising and training hunting dogs, rental or lease costs for hunting areas, hunting club costs, and similar ancillary expenses all contribute to the overall economic impact of waterfowl hunting. The 1965 National Survey of Hunting and Fishing reported that the average American waterfowl hunter spends over fifty dollars per year on his sport. With more than two million waterfowl hunters in the United States and Canada, at least a hundred million dollars per year would be a minimum economic value of waterfowl hunting...|$|R
