500|$|At {{the end of}} , {{the podium}} {{positions}} were unchanged, but the time difference between Loeb and Sordo had decreased to seven seconds, although the gap between first place and fourth was over a minute. Petter Solberg {{had dropped out of}} contention for points, in ninth place overall, eighth being taken by Jan Kopecký in a privately entered [...] Before [...] got underway, the crews had a chance to change their tyres to a set with a more suitable compound. A new WRC rule for 2007 allowed for Remote Service Zones to be set up away from the main Service Park at Rally HQ. For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled, re-tyred, and have any necessary maintenance carried out, as long as the parts and tools to do so (except fuel and tyres) were already in the vehicle. For Grönholm this was a major relief. On the previous stage his car had developed an issue with the hydraulic flappy-paddle gearchanges on his steering wheel, which meant he had had to resort to shifting gears manually. The technicians were unsure why or how it had occurred and were hoping that their repairs would last until the car got back to Valence. Loeb won an uneventful , but only by one-tenth of a second ahead of Sordo, and on [...] Sordo was quicker than Loeb, after Loeb stalled on the start-line and was unable to make up the lost seconds. At the midday break, Loeb was lamenting his lead over Sordo. [...] "Now it's a big battle between the two C4s. The other cars for the moment are behind, so it's good news for the team. It would be easier if Dani were bit further behind but I have to deal wit that," [...] he said. [...] "I'll try to keep position this afternoon, but it's not easy. Dani is really fast. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> a six-second lead." [...] Grönholm was also complaining. [...] " [...] The only good thing here is to win this rally, but to drive here; I don't like it." ...|$|E

Coretta quoted her mother as having said, [...] "My {{children are going to}} college, even if it means <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> but one dress to put on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ma Chao died in 222 {{at the age}} of 47 (by East Asian age reckoning). His {{cause of}} death was not {{recorded}} in history. Before his death, he wrote to Liu Bei: [...] "Over 200 members of my family were killed by Cao Cao. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> my cousin Ma Dai left with me. He will be the one to continue my family line. I entrust him to Your Majesty's care. That is all I have to say." [...] In 260, Liu Bei's son and successor, Liu Shan, granted Ma Chao the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Wei" [...] (威侯).|$|E
2500|$|Nelson {{ordered that}} the signal be acknowledged, but not repeated. He {{turned to his}} flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> one eye — I {{have the right to}} be blind sometimes," [...] and then, holding his {{telescope}} to his blind eye, said [...] "I really do not see the signal!" [...] Rear Admiral Graves repeated the signal, but in a place invisible to most other ships while keeping Nelson's 'close action' signal at his masthead. Of Nelson's captains, only Riou, who could not see Nelson's flagship , followed Parker's signal. Riou withdrew his force, which was then attacking the Tre Kroner fortress, exposing himself to heavy fire that killed him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1858, Li was reassigned to serve in Zeng Guofan's office, where {{he was in charge}} of {{drafting}} documents. Li led a carefree life, flouted rules and regulations, and often woke up late. Zeng Guofan once chided him, [...] "Shaoquan, now that you're working in my office, <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> this piece of advice for you: 'Commitment' is the only thing that matters to us here." [...] Li was shocked and he improved his behaviour after that. In the same year, Weng Tongshu (翁同書), the xunfu of Anhui, abandoned his post when he came under attack by the Taiping rebels. Zeng Guofan drew from Li's draft when he wrote a memorial to the imperial court to accuse Weng Tongshu of failing in his duty. The lines from Li's draft that were included in Zeng Guofan's actual memorial included: [...] "It is my duty, as Your Majesty's subject, [...] I do not dare to let this pass just because of Weng Tonghe's fame and prestige." [...] Although Li earned Zeng Guofan's praise for drafting the memorial, he also caused Weng Tonghe (Weng Tongshu's brother) to bear a grudge against him for what he wrote. While serving under Zeng Guofan, he was put in charge of Yanjianshao Circuit (延建邵道) in Fujian Province but did not take up his appointment and remained with Zeng.|$|E
