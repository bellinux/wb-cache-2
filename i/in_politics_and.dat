5|$|At the 1910 election, Labour gained sixteen {{additional}} {{seats to}} hold a total of forty-two of the seventy-five House of Representatives' seats, and all eighteen Senate seats up for election {{to hold a}} total of twenty-two out of thirty-six seats. This gave Labour control of both upper and lower houses and enabled Fisher to form his Second Fisher Ministry, Australia's first elected federal majority government, Australia's first elected Senate majority, and the world's first Labour Party majority government. The 113 acts passed {{in the three years}} of the second Fisher government exceeded even the output of the second Deakin government over a similar period. The 1910–13 Fisher government represented the culmination of Labour's involvement <b>in</b> <b>politics,</b> <b>and</b> was a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s, under John Curtin and Ben Chifley.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the north}} of Norway to a fairly {{distinguished}} family, he soon became interested <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> history. Starting his political career in the Liberal Party, he switched to the Labour Party {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. He represented that party in the Bærum municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of Parliament, but served nonetheless as Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1941. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, an action that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to an academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Born to a {{merchant}} {{and his wife}} in Gresik, Dutch East Indies, Fakih studied {{with his father and}} at a series of pesantren (Islamic boarding schools) until the 1920s.

When a group of Islamic organisations formed the Indonesian Islamic Assembly in 1937, Fakih became treasurer. He continued to be involved <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> Islamic groups during the Japanese occupation and ensuing national revolution. While serving as minister of religious affairs, he oversaw educational and institutional reform, growing in prominence within the Muhammadiyah. He served as deputy chairman of the organisation under several different leaders before being chosen as its chairman in late 1968, several days before his death.|$|E

5|$|By then, Reitz had {{developed}} {{a keen interest in}} law, and he continued his studies at South African College, reading law with professor F.S. Watermeyer. The latter's death only months after Reitz started working with him, made Reitz decide to continue his studies in London, at the Inner Temple. It was a decision that needed deliberation, as his father was hoping for his son to return to the farm in due time, and the financial situation of the family was not strong. However, Reitz did go to London, and finished his studies successfully. He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867. During his time in England Reitz became interested <b>in</b> <b>politics,</b> <b>and</b> regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons. Before returning to South Africa he made a tour of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Despite this decision, Bird {{returned}} to government on 15 May 1996 as Minister of Science, Technology and Communications, with a {{transfer to the}} Ministry of Trade, Industry and Business Development following the 1999 general election.

The ALP lost the 2004 general election and were replaced by a United Progressive Party government under Baldwin Spencer. Bird remained involved <b>in</b> <b>politics,</b> <b>and</b> along with six other senior ALP members was arrested in 2009 after an unauthorised May Day rally. The seven politicians were found guilty of public order offences, although the trial was delayed following a seizure suffered by Bird. He suffered two more seizures in 2010, after the completion of the trial, and died on 31 March 2013 of heart failure.|$|E
