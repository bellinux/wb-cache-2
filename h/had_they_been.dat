5|$|Australia {{became the}} first team to win three World Cups, and {{registered}} a record 17 consecutive ODI wins. They also {{became the first}} team to win all the matches in a World Cup tournament.

5|$|The Vrba–Wetzler {{report was}} not {{distributed}} widely until weeks after Vrba's escape in April 1944. Between 15 May and 7 July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews (12,000 a day) were deported to Auschwitz. Vrba believed {{they would have}} run or fought <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> told they were being sent to their deaths.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} {{welfarist}} thought is Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's meat manifesto. Point three of eight is:Think about {{the animals that}} the meat you eat comes from. Are you at all concerned about how <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> treated? <b>Have</b> <b>they</b> lived well? <b>Have</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> fed on safe, appropriate foods? <b>Have</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> cared for by someone who respects them and enjoys contact with them? Would {{you like to be}} sure of that? Perhaps it's time to find out a bit more about where the meat you eat comes from. Or to buy from a source that reassures you about these points.|$|R
5|$|Later {{studies of}} the {{events leading up to}} the tragedy found several factors {{contributing}} to the extent of the damage. A. Malheiro (2006) linked five major causes to damage from these earthquakes. The buildings most damaged by the earthquake were near fault lines on top of loosely packed soil. They tended to be of poor construction and did not conform to proper building code, nor <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> adequately examined.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{campaign}} {{ended with}} a complete German and Italian victory. The British {{did not have the}} military resources to carry out big simultaneous operations in North Africa and the Balkans. Moreover, even <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> able to block the Axis advance, they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counter-thrust across the Balkans. The British came very near to holding Crete and perhaps other islands that would have provided air support for naval operations throughout the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Montana-class battleships {{would have}} been similar to the preceding Iowa-class battleships, but {{with an increase in}} the number of primary guns and more potent secondary guns for use against enemy surface ships and aircraft. <b>Had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> completed, the Montanas {{would have been}} gun-for-gun the most powerful battleships the United States had constructed, and the only US battleship class that would have come close to equaling the Imperial Japanese Navy battleships Yamato and Musashi in armament, armor, and displacement.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} for the French was dire. Not only <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> trounced in southwestern Germany, the legendary Alexander Suvorov {{was on his way}} to northern Italy with 60,000 Russians, to take command of Coalition forces there. Count Heinrich Bellegarde, positioned with 20,000 men in the Grisons, effectively isolated Masséna's force from any assistance out of Italy. Most threatening, Archduke Charles' main army lay less than a day away; in size alone, it could overwhelm him, or, if he withdrew to the west, its position cut off his avenue of withdrawal toward France. If Charles' left wing, commanded by Nauendorf, united with Hotze's force, approaching from the east, Masséna knew Charles would attack and very likely push him out of Zürich.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} these resolutions, <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> passed, can never be known. Unfortunately, Burke {{delivered}} this speech just {{less than a month}} before the explosive conflict at Concord and Lexington, and as these resolutions were not enacted, little was done that would help to dissuade conflict.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union envisaged {{and almost}} {{realized}} various concepts for large cargo submarines during the 1950s and 1960s, though these {{would not have}} been counted as merchant ships, being envisaged as navy landing ships to transport troops.

25|$|Tolliver {{argues that}} drama both {{reflects}} and foreshadows social change. It {{is likely that}} there was already much skepticism about the gods in Plautus' era. Plautus did not make up or encourage irreverence to the gods, but reflected ideas of his time. The state controlled stage productions, and Plautus' plays would have been banned, <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> too risqué.|$|E
25|$|The fires, {{started by}} {{lightning}} strikes, {{might have been}} contained, <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> attacked more aggressively in the 24 hours after they broke out.

25|$|As soon as wartime {{restrictions}} on producing passenger locomotives were eased in February 1945, the PRR placed {{an order for}} 50 production examples. This was a fateful step, since the problems encountered with the prototypes had not been ironed out nor <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> tested with the intensity required {{to be sure of}} production reliability. The production locomotives differed in detail in their streamlined casings, and in the suspension in an attempt to increase adhesion.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{the removal}} of the child suited the plans of the comte de Provence, now Louis XVIII, along with those of the revolutionary government. The royal family made no serious attempt to {{ascertain}} the truth, though they paid no tributes to the memory of the deceased king as might have been expected, <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> convinced of his death.

25|$|Non-scholarly literature, however, {{continued}} {{to rely on}} adaptation.
