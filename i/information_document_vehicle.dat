40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} {{an outgrowth of}} research performed with a data base of merged individual income tax returns and <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> Tax Year 1989 was the first year for which such a data base was created and perfected. Traditionally, the Statistics of Income (SOI) Division of the Internal Revenue Service has interpreted its mandate to produce "statistics reasonably available {{with respect to the}} operations of the internal revenue laws " [1] as meaning tabulating data shown on tax returns. In recent years, with the computerization of the millions of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> prepared by employers, banks, stock brokers, payers of pensions, etc., data from these documents have increasingly become "reasonably available. " Data from <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> when matched to tax returns, can be used to serve as a check on the data shown on individual income tax returns, as well as to provide an indication of how much of the income on a joint return belongs to the husband and how much to the wife. In addition, it is possible to pull a sample of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> that do not match to tax returns, and use them to tally data about non-filers. The data base used for this paper was created as a tool to compare tax return data to data gathered from <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> It includes a sample of tax returns matched to <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> as well as unmatched tax returns and unmatched <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> The age of each individual in the sample was determined by matching his or her social security number (SSN) to the Year of Birth file, whic...|$|R

The first phase was a baseline cross-sectional assessment of the frequency and depth of medication history <b>information</b> <b>documented</b> by physicians in case notes of systematic samples of 900 patients that were stratified over 9 Medical outpatients Units at a premier teaching hospital in south western Nigeria. The second phase was an exploratory study involving 10 pharmacists who conducted cross-sectional medication history interview for 324 randomly selected patients. Results: 49. 2 % of patients, whose medication history were documented at the baseline, by physicians, were males; while 50. 3 % of patient interviewed by pharmacists were male. Mean age (SD) of males and females whose medication histories were documented by physicians and pharmacists were 43. 2 (SD= 18. 6), 43. 1 (SD= 17. 9) years and 51. 5 (SD= 17. 6), 52. 1 (SD= 17. 4) years respectively. The frequency of medication history <b>information</b> <b>documented</b> by pharmacists was significantly higher for twelve of the thirteen medication history components (P < 0. 0001). These include prescription medicines; over the counter medicines; source of medicines; adverse drug reactions; allergy to drugs, allergy to foods, allergy to chemicals; patient adherence; alcohol use; cigarette smoking; dietary restrictions and herbal medicine use. The depth of medication history <b>information</b> acquired and <b>documented</b> by pharmacist was significantly better for all the thirteen medication history components (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion: Pharmacists’ participation resulted in significant increase in frequency and depth of medication history <b>information</b> <b>documented</b> in a developing setting like Nigeria.
