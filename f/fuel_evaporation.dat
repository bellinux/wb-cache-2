The cause of the oscillation is the phase change from liquid to vapour which happens when the preheat temperature of the air flowing through the burner exceeds the boiling temperature at the operating pressure and the fuel flow is so low that heat transfer to the liquid <b>fuel</b> causes <b>evaporation</b> within the <b>fuel</b> channels of the burner. Liquid fuel and vapour alternatively enter the airstream of the burner. This leads to an instable situation for the flame.

50|$|The FAA did not {{consider}} lightweight inerting systems for commercial jets until the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800. The crash was blamed on {{an explosion in the}} center wing fuel tank of the Boeing 747 used in the flight. This tank is normally used only on very long flights, and little fuel was present in the tank {{at the time of the}} explosion. A small amount of fuel in a tank is more dangerous than a large amount, since heat entering the fuel tank with residual fuel causes the fuel to increase in temperature faster and evaporate. This causes the ullage fuel-to-air ratio to increase rapidly and exceed the lower flammability limit. A large quantity of fuel (high mass loading) in the fuel tank can retain the heat energy and slow the <b>fuel</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate. The explosion of a Thai Airways International Boeing 737 in 2001 and a Philippine Airlines 737 in 1990 also occurred in a tank that had residual fuel. All the above three explosions occurred on a warm day, in the center wing tank (CWT) that is within the contours of the fuselage. These fuel tanks are located in the vicinity of external equipment that heats the fuel tanks. The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) final report on the crash of TWA 747 concluded “The fuel air vapor in the ullage of the TWA flight 800 CWT was flammable at the time of the accident.” NTSB identified “Elimination of Explosive Mixture in Fuel tanks in Transport Category Aircraft” as Number 1 item on its Most Wanted List in 1997.|$|E

The work focuses on the numerical modelling of diesel spray evaporation in an "SCF" reactor, operating under atmospheric pressure conditions.

The complex oxidative phenomena encountered under SCF conditions are accounted for by implementing two reduced chemical kinetic schemes consisting of five (S 5) and seven (S 7) active species.

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} {{investigate}} the impact of liquid <b>fuel</b> droplet <b>evaporation</b> on the autoignition properties of a n-heptane/air mixture. To this purpose, mass and heat source terms due to spray vaporization {{have been added to}} a detailed chemistry solver. The considered configuration is a constant volume homogeneous reactor applied over a wide range of thermochemical conditions (temperature, pressure, fuel/air equivalence ratio). Different droplet diameters are tested from 2 µm to 100 µm. Results are compared to reference gaseous cases. The increase of the two-phase flow ignition delay compared to purely gaseous case is readily explained by the mass coupling with the gas phase. Nevertheless, evaporation characteristic time does not explain all observed phenomena. Indeed, a competition between the heat transfers (depending on the initial temperature of the mixture) and the available mass of fuel vapor (depending directly on the droplet evaporation properties) occurs. Both properties depend not only on the local thermodynamical conditions but also on the spray properties...|$|R
40|$|Alternative fuels are {{becoming}} more important as fossil fuels become more expensive. This thesis describes the production and properties of a bio-oil produced from waste biomass, in this case chicken litter. A higher quality fuel was produced through thermal and chemical upgrading of the raw bio-oil; this fuel is similar in some respects to fossil fuels, as it has a high hydrocarbon content and energy density comparable to gasoline. Combustion of liquid fuels commonly occurs in clouds of droplets, and studying the evaporation of single liquid drops provides information on the evaporation characteristics of the fuel as a whole. Droplet evaporation tests on the chicken litter fuel were carried out using the suspended droplet/moving furnace technique. For some tests, a fine wire thermocouple {{was used as the}} droplet suspension in order to measure the distillation characteristics of the fuel. An existing computational model based on continuous ther- modynamics was used to model the <b>evaporation</b> of the <b>fuel.</b> The modelled composition of the fuel was based on an existing pyrolysis field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS) analysis and used five major groups of compounds. The properties for these groups re- quired for the model were determined using several prediction methods and the values then used in a numerical model. Model predictions of droplet temperatures calculated for the fuel showed good agree- ment with the measured temperatures, indicating that the modelled composition gave an accurate picture of the <b>fuel.</b> Droplet <b>evaporation</b> histories also agreed well with mea- surements, but were not capable of reproducing the observed disruption of the droplet produced by internal boiling at higher temperatures, nor the formation of a solid residue at the end of evaporation.
