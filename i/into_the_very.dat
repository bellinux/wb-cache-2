The Indians had been provoked to attack the settlement of the monks because of the repeated slave raids by Spaniards operating from Cubagua. As Ocampo's ships began returning with slaves from the land Las Casas had been granted, he went to Hispaniola to complain to the Audiencia. After several months of negotiations Las Casas set sail alone; the peasants he had brought had deserted, and he arrived in his colony already ravaged by Spaniards.|$|E

25|$|DHT signals {{mainly in}} an intracrine and paracrine manner in the tissues {{in which it}} is produced, playing only a minor role, if any, as a {{circulating}} endocrine hormone. Circulating levels of DHT are 1/10th and 1/20th those of testosterone in terms of total and free concentrations, respectively, whereas local DHT levels may be up to 10times those of testosterone in tissues with high 5α-reductase expression such as the prostate gland. In addition, unlike testosterone, DHT is inactivated by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> weak androgen 3α-androstanediol in various tissues such as muscle, adipose, and liver among others, and in relation to this, has been reported to be a very poor anabolic agent when given exogenously.|$|E

25|$|When Atta was ten, {{his family}} moved to the Cairo {{neighborhood}} of Abdeen, located {{near the center of the}} city. Atta's father continued to keep the family private, and did not allow Atta to socialize with other neighborhood children. Atta spent most of his time at home studying, and he excelled in school. In 1985, Atta entered Cairo University, where he studied engineering. Atta was one of the highest-scoring students, and during his senior year he was admitted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> selective architecture program. In 1990, Atta graduated with a degree in architecture and joined the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Engineers Syndicate organization. He then worked for several months at the Urban Development Center in Cairo, where he undertook tasks on architectural, planning, and building design.

The Byzantine army passed through the mountains around Ihtiman and besieged Sredets in 986. The Byzantines assaulted the city for 20 days, but their attacks proved fruitless and costly: the Bulgarians {{came out of the}} city several times, killed many enemy soldiers and captured draught animals and horses. Eventually, the Bulgarian troops burned the siege equipment of the Byzantine army, forcing Basil II to withdraw to Thrace, but on 17 August 986, while passing through the mountains, the Byzantine army was ambushed and routed at the Trajan's Gates Pass. This was a significant blow for Basil, {{who was one of the}} few to return to Constantinople; his personal treasure was captured by the victors.|$|E
25|$|After conquering Stilwater,The Boss has {{the option}} of visiting Stilwater Police Headquarters and {{listening}} to 3 wiretap conversations recorded under Bradshaw's authority. According to the recordings, Julius was responsible for planting the bomb that nearly killed the Boss, believing that doing so {{would allow him to}} disband the Saints and retire. The Boss can also contact Jackson by phone, in which he offers to set up a meeting at The Saints' old base to discuss turning over Julius. If the player does so, however, Julius appears there instead and it will become clear that Dex plans to have both of them killed on Ultor's behalf. After Julius and the Boss fight the Ultor Masako units across Stillwater in a car chase the Boss shoots him in an abandoned amphitheater. Julius claims that he had no choice, since the player was turning the Saints <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> criminals they were supposed to fight. Without acknowledging his point, The Boss kills Julius.|$|E

As Robert Babe notes, the railway brought industrialization, transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites. It was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to the spread of European civilization. Babe writes that, for Innis, the CPR's equipment [...] "comprised a massive, energy-consuming, fast-moving, powerful, capital-intensive 'sign' dropped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> midst of indigenous peoples, whose entire way of life was disrupted, and eventually shattered as a result.|$|E

The two-spar wings had a thickness of 10% to preserve aileron control and avoid tip stall. They were fitted with Frise ailerons and slotted flaps. Fuel was contained in a [...] fuselage tank and a [...] tank in each wing. The conventional landing gear mainwheels had a levered suspension and retracted inwards.

This is a protest song, more ironic than angry perhaps, but a protest nonetheless. In the singers' hands, the word nigger has a sardonic tone... in the very opening, Hammerstein has established the gulf between the races, the privilege accorded the white folks and denied the black, and a flavor of the contempt built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> language that whites used about African Americans. This is a very effective scene.... These are not caricature roles; they are wise, if uneducated, people capable of seeing and feeling more than some of the white folk around them.|$|E
500|$|Those {{within the}} regime {{are also a}} mix of fictional {{characters}} and real people. President Balaguer is real, but the entire Cabral family is completely fictional. According to Wolff, Vargas Llosa [...] "uses history {{as a starting point}} in constructing a fictionalized account of Trujillo's [...] "spiritual colonization" [...] of the Dominican Republic as experienced by one Dominican family. The fictional Cabral family allows Vargas Llosa to show two sides of the Trujillo regime: through Agustin, the reader sees ultimate dedication and sacrifice to the leader of the nation; through Urania, the violence of the regime and the legacy of pain it left behind. Vargas Llosa also fictionalized the internal thoughts of the characters who were non-fictional, especially those of the Goat himself. According to literary scholar Richard Patterson, [...] "Vargas Llosa's expands all the way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> [...] "dark area" [...] of Trujillo's consciousness (as the storyteller dares to conceive it)." ...|$|E

500|$|As Madoka contemplates {{accepting}} {{the contract with}} Kyubey, she witnesses the death of Mami {{at the hands of}} a witch and realizes that a magical girl's life is filled with danger, anguish, and suffering. This is further enforced by the appearance of Kyoko Sakura, a veteran magical girl whose wish indirectly caused the death of her family. Madoka also discovers that not only do magical girls give up their souls to form their Soul Gems, the source of their magic, but when those Soul Gems become too tainted with despair, they transform <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> witches they fight against. This is exemplified when Sayaka, heavily disillusioned with the current state of the world, falls into an irrecoverable despair that turns her into a witch. It is then revealed that Kyubey's alien race is harvesting the emotions from magical girls to use as energy to counteract the spread of entropy. Madoka also learns that Homura is a magical girl from a different timeline who has repeated the same month countless times in order to try to save Madoka from a grisly fate.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the match, the Port Philip cricketers won further matches at Bishopthorpe College and may have played further games in Tasmania. Social events continued during and after the game; one journalist, Edmund Finn, wrote: [...] "From the time of landing to the time of embarking the same spirit continued—dinners, balls, musical parties, picnics and every description of entertainment was got up to give a hearty welcome to the strangers from Port Phillip." [...] On the evening of the first day's play, there was a dinner and ball at the Cornwall Hotel; the day after the match, a public ball organised by the Tasmanian hosts took place at the Cornwall Hotel, where the visiting cricketers were staying. The event—attended by more than 350 people, including the Victorians, many of the supporters that had accompanied them, and many of the leading figures in Launceston society—continued <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> early morning. The Tasmanian and Victorian players, accompanied by the Launceston Brass Band, walked together to the wharf from where the visiting players were to depart. The Port Philip team returned on the Shamrock and reported upon their return that they were [...] "well entertained and well beaten". The Tasmanian bowling—described by the Victorians as [...] "slow and peculiar in character"—was their main explanation for the defeat. One of the umpires from the game, C. J. Weedon, retained a ball used in the match. His family later donated it to the Launceston museum.|$|E
500|$|Progressive education, a {{pedagogy}} promoting {{learning through}} real-life experiences, {{was at its}} zenith in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, and the Avery Coonley School was a widely known model of these theories in action. Avery Coonley was featured regularly in Progressive Education and other professional journals, and in 1938, the editor of Progressive Education, Gertrude Hartman, published {{a profile of the}} Avery Coonley School in her book Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today. She noted, [...] "isitors {{from all parts of the}} United States and from foreign countries [...] to see the school—sometimes as many as thirty in a day." [...] Hartman described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that the most noticeable thing about it is the spirit of earnestness and joy which pervades it... There is a fundamental philosophy of life and education underlying the work of the school, which gives clear direction to all its activities. Broad areas are planned, which form the framework of the curriculum. These however are flexible and subject to modification depending upon conditions. The book described the progress of the students from their first year of kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded with observations about the importance of the daily life of the school in developing social responsibility: It is the belief of those concerned with the school that out of the kind of education described here will emerge more socially enlightened members of society than the education of our generation has produced... The method in which those in the school place their faith is the building <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> nature of growing boys and girls, through their growing years, those qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new attitude towards human relations can evolve. Finding Wisdom became a classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's national reputation as a model of progressive education.|$|E
