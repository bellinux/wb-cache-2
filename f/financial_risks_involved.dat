40|$|The {{objectives}} and priorities for managing woodlands vary widely. They {{can range from}} maximizing timber production or returns on investment, to management for sporting purposes or conservation and amenity. The financial viability of a woodland management regime is usually assessed by considering the return on the investment at an appropriate real discount rate. This is conventionally done because forestry, unlike many other forms of investment, has very long cycles between investing the money in a new plantation and obtaining a return. Discounting provides a method of bringing all expenditures and returns to a single point in time and expresses the disadvantage of having to wait. The discount rate selected depends on such factors as the <b>financial</b> <b>risks</b> <b>involved,</b> or conversely the value put on woodlands as a secure investment and values other than maximised return.

Developing {{countries}} have {{an abundance of}} renewable energy sources but the implementation of cost effective projects, to harness this energy and provide a support system to the ever-increasing demand from the conventional sources, are rare. Rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources and the environmental concerns associated with them make electricity generation from certain alternate sources increasingly important for the future. This project presents a system running solely on renewable energy sources. It utilizes solar energy and biomass as fuels in a {{combined cycle power plant}} to provide clean energy to the rapidly developing city of Maninagar in India. The solar and biomass parts of the plant will share turbines and connecting infrastructure, reducing the project cost and allowing continuous power generation. The plant can provide peaking power using a combination of the two, regardless of the time or weather. Operating strategy is designed to maximize solar energy use. The biomass is used to provide fuel during cloudy periods. The turbine-generator efficiency is optimal at full load, therefore the use of biomass supplement to allow full load operation maximizes plant output. The cost assessment of the project remains the most crucial part in planning of a non-conventional energy based power generation system.

40|$|Privatization [...] the {{transfer}} of activities from the public {{to the private sector}} [...] gained international prominence in the 1980 s because of the need to reduce budget deficits and growing concerns about the efficiency of state-owned enterprises and government bureaucracies. This article examines privatization in Canada and its effect on governments' fiscal positions. Privatization has generally been less rapid and extensive in Canada than elsewhere, partly because of the comparatively moderate size of our public sector. Nevertheless, federal, provincial, and municipal governments have increasingly reduced their direct involvement in the Canadian economy by selling Crown corporations, contracting with private firms to deliver public services, and transferring the development of public infrastructure projects to the private sector. The fiscal impact of privatizing Crown corporations varies with such factors as the profitability of the enterprise, the size of the government's initial investment, and past write-downs. In general, when privatizations are part of a broader effort to improve public finances, they can contribute to fiscal consolidation by reducing budgetary requirements and debt levels. When services and infrastructure projects are privatized, it is expected that more efficient private sector management will reduce government expenditures. For example, a private consortium may be better able to manage the <b>financial</b> <b>risks</b> <b>involved</b> in building an infrastructure facility, such as cost overruns or the withdrawal of contractors, than the public sector. The key to raising efficiency and lowering costs, however, is competition, not privatization per se. Therefore, the cost savings arising from the privatization of services or public works depend crucially on the terms of the contract. Overall, when structured to improve economic efficiency, privatization is likely to enhance the economy's performance, thereby producing long-term economic and budgetary gains. ...|$|E

A theoretical model of farm financial risk evaluates borrower behavior in light of cash flow constraints, volume discounts, and social capital. Monte-carlo simulation was used to empirically apply the model to a representative 2, 000 -acre Northern Plains crop farm. The stochastic simulation model embodied local price and yield distributions, tax policy, and financial repayment risks. A survey of local input suppliers and lenders provided key information on levels of price discount and credit forebearance. Competition among suppliers resulted in less difference between retail and wholesale prices than expected a priori. Results of the analysis delineated the <b>financial</b> <b>risks</b> <b>involved</b> and value of social capital received in the form of credit forebearance. The distribution of year-end available funds when inputs were purchased locally had a slightly lower mean and longer left tail. While a longer and bulkier left tail appeared to present the farm with additional financial risk, it was actually the result of additional borrowing arising from credit forebearance. If forebearance were not available, the firm would have been bankrupt. In this model, bankruptcy occurred with 2. 6 percent frequency. Personal exemptions provided under statutory bankruptcy provisions altered the shape of the left tail.

In South Africa, the emphasis being placed on promoting small businesses in the government's GEAR strategy {{is an indication of}} how important small and medium businesses are regarded, even at national government level. Statistical evidence underlining the valuable contribution ofSME's is frequently quoted in the literature. The following statistics are an indication of the contribution of SME's to the South African economy: • in 1991 there were approximately 800 000 formal businesses in South Africa of which approximately 700 000 or 85 % could be classified as 5 MB's; • their estimated contribution to the GDP at that stage was in the region of 30 %; • in 1991 SME's employed more than 2. 4 million people (2. 7 million people in 1994) which represented about 17 % ofthe economically active population of 14. 3 million at that stage; • "informal" Small Enterprises in 1991 was thought to be employing about 4. 4 million additional people.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} and analyze factors affecting completion, non-completion, and non-participation in five Farmer Field Schools (FFS) administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, and Marine Resources (MALMR) of Trinidad and Tobago. The research objectives used to accomplish the purpose of this study focused on the relationship between participation status and 1) personal characteristics, 2) individuals? motivations for participation, 3) perceptions about selected farming practices, 4) individuals? priority rankings of their sources of information regarding farming practices, 5) the deterrents to participation, and 6) perceptions of the usefulness of competitions as a means for increasing the popularity of FFS. This study employed an ex post facto, causal comparative research design. Three instruments were developed. The sample population (N= 109) consisted of farmers classified as FFS completers (n= 56), non-completers (n= 15), and non-participants (n= 38). Data were gathered from late May to late September 2007. Individuals with a greater number of participating friends are more likely to complete the program FFS completers 1) were more driven by social reasons to participate in FFS than were non-completers, 2) possessed a greater concern for the environment than did non-completers, 3) had higher expectations than did noncompleters that participation in a FFS would improve their occupational performance and status, 4) more likely than non-completers to be willing to take on the <b>financial</b> <b>risks</b> <b>involved</b> in the adoption of IPM on their farms, 5) believed more strongly than did noncompleters that IPM is compatible with agricultural practices and the market in Trinidad and Tobago. Completers most highly value the information received from MALMR whereas the non-completers and non-participants most highly value information received from the agro-shops. Completers vs. non-completers and non-participants held widely divergent views on the deterrents to participation in FFS.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the past several decades the {{benefits}} of redeveloping brownfields have been widely recognized. Actions have been taken to foster sustainable redevelopment of brownfields by government, policy makers and stakeholders across the world. However, redevelopments encounter great challenges and risks related to environmental and non-environmental issues. In this work, we intend to build a comprehensive and practical framework to evaluate the hydrogeological and <b>financial</b> <b>risks</b> <b>involved</b> during redevelopment and to ensure developers reserve sufficient capital to cover unexpected future costs within the guarantee period. Punitive damages, which contribute to these costs, are in this thesis solely associated with the cost of repossessing a house within a development should the indoor air concentration of TCE exceed the regulatory limit at a later time. The uncertainties associated with brownfield remediation have been among the barriers to brownfield redevelopment. This is mainly caused by the lack of knowledge about a site’s environmental condition. In order to alleviate uncertainties and to better understand the contaminant transport process in the subsurface, numerical simulations have been conducted to investigate the role of controlling parameters in determining the fate and transport of volatile organic compounds originating from a NAPL source zone located below the water table in the subsurface. In the first part of this thesis, the numerical model CompFlow Bio is used on a hypothesized three-dimensional problem geometry where multiple residential dwellings are built. The simulations indicate that uncertainty in the simulated indoor air concentration is sensitive to heterogeneity in the permeability structure of a stratigraphically continuous aquifer with uncertainty defined as the probability of exceeding a regulatory limit. Houses which are laterally offset from the groundwater plume are less affected by vapour intrusion due to limited transverse horizontal flux of TCE within the groundwater plume in agreement with the ASTM (2008) guidance. Within this uncertainty framework, we show that the Johnson and Ettinger (1991) model generates overly-conservative results and contributes to the exclusion zone being much further away from the groundwater plume relative to either CompFlow Bio or ASTM (2008). The probability of failure (or the probability of exceedence of the regulatory limit) is defined and calculated for further study. Due to uncertainties resulting from parameter estimation and model prediction, a methodology is introduced to incorporate field measurements into the initial estimates from the numerical model in order to improve prediction accuracy. The principle idea of this methodology is to combine the geostatistical tool kriging with the statistical data assimilation method Kalman filter to evaluate the worth and effectiveness of data in a quantitative way in order to select an optimal sampling scenario. This methodology is also used to infer whether one of the houses located adjacent to affected houses has indoor air problems based on the measurements subject to the observation that the affected house is monitored and has problems and developers have liability if a problem occurs. In this part of the study, different sampling scenarios are set up in terms of permeability (1 – 80 boreholes) and soil gas concentration (2, 4 and 7 samples) and three metrics are defined and computed as a criterion for comparison. Financing brownfield redevelopment is often viewed as a major barrier to the development process mainly due to risks and liabilities associated with brownfields. The common way of managing the risk is to transfer it to insurers by purchasing insurance coverage. This work provides two different strategies to price the risk, which is equivalent to an insurance premium. It is intended to give an instructive insight into project planning and feasibility studies during the decision-making process of a brownfield project. The two strategies of risk capital valuation are an actuarial premium calculation principle and a martingale premium calculation principle accounting for the hydrogeological and financial uncertainties faced in a project. The data used for valuation are the posterior estimates of data assimilation obtained from the results of different sampling scenarios. The cost-benefit-risk analysis is employed as a basis to construct the objective function in order to find the least cost among sampling scenarios for the project. As a result, it shows that drilling seven boreholes to extract permeability data and taking soil gas samplings in four locations or seven locations alternatively give the minimum total cost. Sensitivity analysis of some influential parameters (the safety loading factors and the possible methods to calculate the probability of failure) is performed to determine their roles of importance in the risk capital valuation. This framework can be applied to provide guidance for other risk-based environmental projects...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{substantial}} increase in investor-state disputes. In many cases matters of public interest, including environmental regulations, are being tried. While it is crucial to assess the outcomes of investor-state disputes that involve matters of public policy, the procedures followed in investment arbitration make this difficult and, in some cases, impossible.

Most notably, the 39-episode Revolutionary Girl Utena TV series was created {{by some of the}} same production staff responsible for Sailor Moon, including writer and director Kunihiko Ikuhara. Ikuhara was already well known {{for his role in the}} production of Sailor Moon, including his contributions to the highly acclaimed third season, Sailor Moon S. When working on Utena Ikuhara was unsure if he would be fit for the role as producer and worried about the <b>financial</b> <b>risk</b> <b>involved.</b> Believing it may be the last show he ever worked on, Ikuhara set out to make Utena the pinnacle of his work. The member of Be-Papas responsible for the manga version of Utena was Chiho Saito, a well-established shōjo manga author. Though she and the other members of Be-Papas discussed concepts together, Saito had little influence on the direction of the anime.|$|R
40|$|A {{zootechnical}} {{and economical}} study on fattening of Santa Gertrudis steers under Moroccan conditions. Ten Santa Gertrudis steers were purchased and fattened {{in the stable}} du ring 213 to 425 days. They were controlled individually and there after they were sold on the market. The diet mainly consisted in different farm and industrial by-products. Mean daily gain was 0. 655 kg and one kg weight gain was obtained by 13. 6 kg dry matter. The best performances were 0. 841 kg per day and 9. 65 kg dry matter per kg weight gain. Economical results were very unsatisfactory : there was a mean financial loss of 772 DH per steer. These bad economical results {{were considered to be}} due to a fall of the meat price during the selling period, a high price per kg liveweight at the purchase and a bad feeding efficiency, due to lengthening of the fattening period in the hope of better prices for 5 animals. In this extra period, new feeds-tuffs were used in the diet. Advices are given for a better management of the <b>financial</b> <b>risk</b> <b>involved</b> in the fattening of Santa Gertrudis steers in the stable...|$|R
