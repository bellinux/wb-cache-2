5|$|The Paleo-Indians {{that survived}} are {{now known as}} the Archaic peoples of the Florida peninsula. They lived on after the {{extinction}} of most big game and were primarily hunter-gatherers who depended on smaller <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish.</b> They relied on plants for food more than their ancestors. They were able to adapt to the shifting climate and the resulting change of animal and plant populations.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} of the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the younger man took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona <b>Game</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> Department officer after running a red light, but was released with a reminder when it was determined that he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E
5|$|Native fish in Fossil Creek include {{headwater}} chub, roundtail chub, speckled dace, longfin dace, Sonora sucker, {{and desert}} sucker. Between 2007 and 2010, the Arizona <b>Game</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added native spikedace, loach minnows, Gila topminnows, and razorback suckers {{as well as}} more longfin dace above the barrier. All except speckled dace are special-status fish listed as endangered, threatened, or sensitive by federal or state agencies. In addition, more than 100 macroinvertebrate species live in the Fossil Creek watershed. One, the fossil springsnail, is listed sensitive by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|The park's 36 reptile species include desert tortoises, diamondback rattlesnakes (one of {{the more}} {{commonly}} seen snakes), coral snakes, Gila monsters, short-horned lizards, spiny lizards, and zebra-tailed lizards. Despite the aridity, three amphibian species inhabit the park: the canyon tree frog, the lowland leopard frog, and Couch's spadefoot, which lives in underground burrows, emerging to breed during summer rains. Forest fires, which create erosion-prone burned areas, have destroyed many of the leopard frog's breeding pools, which fill with sediment. The Arizona <b>Game</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> Department lists the lowland leopard frog as a species of special concern.|$|E

5|$|While {{the north}} of the {{peninsula}} was already settled in the 7thâ€“5th millennium BCE, the rest of its territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BCE, when various peoples started to arrive from the south. However, by the 1st millennium CE only the Sami people remained. This changed in the 12th century, when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula's <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> riches. Soon after, the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic, and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands. No permanent settlements, however, were established by the Novgorodians until the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his trap-shooting career, Bain {{developed}} an appreciation for nature. He bought an ownership share of the Portage Country Club, on the Delta Marsh near the south shore of Lake Manitoba, and later donated the land to Ducks Unlimited. Bain built the Mallard Lodge as a personal retreat on land adjacent to the club. He strictly enforced his privacy, even building a road to his lodge that he allowed no one else to use; members of the Portage Country Club were required to take a different route. Bain intended to donate his lodge to the government of Manitoba for preservation, though he died before he could do so. The lodge passed into the control of the government regardless, and was donated to the University of Manitoba as a research facility in 1966 that remains active today. Bain was {{also a member of the}} Manitoba <b>Game</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> Association and the Winnipeg Humane Society.|$|E
5|$|Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri {{are largely}} {{dictated}} by the food that is available for harvesting or gathering. Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick. The primary staple grain is rice, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time. Some families have begun to plant maize to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include potatoes, cassava, and taro. Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability. Wild <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest. (Vegetables are generally not cultivated.) Commonly eaten fruits include bananas, jackfruit, papayas, and mangoes.|$|E

5|$|Strandzha Nature Park was {{established}} on 25 January 1995 to protect ecosystems and biodiversity, {{as well as}} the traditional cultural, historical and folklore heritage of the region. Before 1995 the protection of the region had been fragmented, consisting of isolated nature reserves and protected areas. The park is administered by a directorate based in Malko Tarnovo and subordinated to the Executive Forest Agency of the Ministry of Environment and Water of Bulgaria. The directorate implements the state policy for the management and control of the protected area, aiming at the long-term conservation of the unique nature and ensuring the sustainable social and economic development of the region. It monitors the management and conservation of the forests, <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> resources while encouraging tourism and environmental protection.|$|E
5|$|Jimenez stopped {{feeding the}} pups after Thanksgiving that same year. Though the pups learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} poacher. Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, a sanctuary in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The fates of the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses hope that they survived and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to continue in the wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming <b>Game</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> Department's Wolf Program Coordinator.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the larger}} species are {{considered}} <b>game</b> <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> are <b>fished</b> commercially {{to a minor}} extent, oarfish are rarely caught alive; their flesh is not well regarded for eating due to its gelatinous consistency.|$|R
25|$|The cuisine {{of ancient}} Egypt covers {{a span of}} over three {{thousand}} years, but still retained many consistent traits until well into Greco-Roman times.

25|$|Related to the state's {{frontier}} past, hunting {{continues in}} the state. The state created the Arkansas <b>Game</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> Commission in 1915 to regulate hunting and enforce those regulations. Today {{a significant portion of}} Arkansas's population participates in hunting duck in the Mississippi flyway and deer across the state. Millions of acres of public land are available for both bow and modern gun hunters.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} {{are common}} {{due to the}} abundance of springs and waterways. The Neosho National Fish Hatchery was built in 1888; {{it was the first}} Federal hatchery. The Arkansas <b>Game</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> Commission, Missouri Department of Conservation and United States Fish and Wildlife Service operate numerous warm and cold water hatcheries and trout parks; private hatcheries such as Rockbridge are found throughout the region.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the accomplishments}} since {{those early years}} has been the Sewall's Falls project, {{stopping}} a dam at Livermore Falls, writing the legislation that established the moose management program and moose hunt, creating public access legislation that has been the only success in providing public access to the state's water, insisting that <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> season be set by the professional managers at the <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game</b> Department, not by the whims of the Legislature, allowing sporting clubs a voice in the selection of <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game</b> Commissioners, <b>and</b> keeping <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>game</b> funds secure in the department and not siphoned to the general fund of the state. NHWF was also a key player in the establishment of the Non-Game and Endangered Wildlife division at <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game</b> <b>and</b> helped provide the initial funding for that program.

25|$|When the Department of Conservation was created, {{it brought}} {{together}} four separate state entities: forestry, <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish,</b> drainage and waters, and lands and timber, while adding {{a division of}} state parks and a tourist bureau as well. The Great Depression was an important time for the Department of Conservation. Federal unemployment {{programs such as the}} Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration provided labor to construct buildings, clear trails, and plant trees. Many of the buildings in Minnesota's state parks were built during this period.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, Leopold was {{assigned}} to the Forest Service's District 3 in the Arizona and New Mexico territories. At first, he was a forest assistant at the Apache National Forest in the Arizona Territory. In 1911, he was transferred to the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico. Leopold's career, which kept him in New Mexico until 1924, included developing the first comprehensive management plan for the Grand Canyon, writing the Forest Service's first <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> handbook, and proposing Gila Wilderness Area, the first national wilderness area in the Forest Service system.|$|E
