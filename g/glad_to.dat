5|$|The 2nd Virginia Cavalry was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> {{be back at}} winter {{quarters}} in Camp Piatt, Virginia, and believed they had completed their work for the year. On November 22, Colonel Paxton received a surprising order from the new division commander, recently promoted Brigadier General George Crook.|$|E
5|$|We're <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> {{see this}} {{short-lived}} debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and Internet censorship—two very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention—so {{perhaps this was}} all just a blessing in disguise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{recollect}} that," [...] replied Dick, laughing. [...] "George, I'll bet you I'm <b>gladder</b> <b>to</b> see {{you than}} you are to see me. It seems so long. You went into the army, didn't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} that after the war he'd be <b>glad</b> enough <b>to</b> get anything. Grateful! They'll all be coming back after the war--all of 'em, <b>glad</b> enough <b>to</b> get anything. Asking for another {{shilling}} indeed!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To be sure, stranger,' {{said the}} shepherd. 'And faith, you've been lucky in {{choosing}} your time, for {{we are having}} {{a bit of a}} fling for a <b>glad</b> cause--though, <b>to</b> be sure, a man could hardly wish that <b>glad</b> cause <b>to</b> happen more than once a year.' ...|$|R
5|$|Grace {{comments}} {{in his memoirs}} that he was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> make his hundredth century at Gloucestershire's ground. Excluding the two centuries not considered first-class by some modern statisticians, Grace's hundredth century came later in the same month when he scored 169 for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Lord's. He scored his final first-class century in July 1904 for London County, reaching 166 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played first-class cricket for another four seasons, and scored 15 and 25 for the Gentlemen of England in his final outing, an innings defeat against Surrey.|$|E
5|$|He {{was asked}} to leave the college in 1908 after {{offering}} a stranded chorus girl tea and his bed for the night when she {{was caught in a}} snowstorm. When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, his insistence that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief. <b>Glad</b> <b>to</b> be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.|$|E
5|$|Jack tells TGS producer, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), {{to do an}} on-air tribute of Jenna on the show. On the TGS set, a huge {{poster of}} Jenna is hung with her real {{birthday}} and death date. When Jenna sees that her real birth date is displayed, she comes out of hiding and appears on stage to cover the poster. After witnessing this, Liz confronts Jenna and Tracy for their behavior, but is <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be back at work.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, {{who owned}} a Yiddish theater there, was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> have a figure of Goldfaden's stature. Goldfaden {{completed}} the play he'd started in Paris, Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas ("Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree"), in five acts and 23 scenes, based {{on the life of}} Josel of Rosheim. At this time he also wrote an operetta Rothschild and a semi-autobiographical play called Mashiach Tzeiten (Messiah Times) that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.|$|E
5|$|A specimen-collecting {{expedition}} {{along the}} Pacific Coast {{and down into}} Mexico provided them {{with a chance to}} relax, and, for Steinbeck, a chance for a brief escape from the controversy mounting around The Grapes of Wrath. Ricketts, suffering {{as a result of the}} breakup of his long-term relationship with a married woman in Monterey, was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> get away too. They planned to collect specimens from the rock and tide pools and the shore line uncovered between tides which would allow them build up a picture of the macro level ecosystem in the Gulf. The preserved specimens of the fauna they collected could be identified and catalogued or sold on their return.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{graduated}} on July 1, 1843, ranked 21st in a {{class of}} 39, and was promoted to the rank brevet second lieutenant. <b>Glad</b> <b>to</b> leave the academy, he planned to resign his commission after his four-year term of duty. Despite his excellent horsemanship, he was not assigned to the cavalry, but to the 4th Infantry Regiment. He served as regimental quartermaster, managing supplies and equipment. Grant's first assignment took him to the Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, the barracks was the nation's largest military base in the west. Grant was happy with his new commander, but looked forward {{to the end of his}} military service and a possible teaching career.|$|E

5|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the class of 1965, which also included Guy Chamberlain, Paddy Driscoll, Dan Fortmann, Otto Graham, Sid Luckman, and Bob Waterfield. He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> have broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a great honor to be here. The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly bring me back every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E
5|$|John and Prudentia Hogg were <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> {{hear that}} the Shelleys had left England, hoping that their son would become more {{conservative}} in Percy's absence. They were disappointed with his continued rejection of their Tory political views, but he did attend church with them during his visits and {{was no longer a}} vegetarian. They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London's literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson. Hogg also met John Keats, who gave him a copy of his first book of poetry.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights were <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be {{free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights {{made a decision to}} begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E

"Dick Darvall," [...] exclaimed Jackson, as {{the former}} rode up, [...] "I never was <b>gladder</b> <b>to</b> see any man than I am to see you this hour, though but for my Mary I'd surely have sent you to kingdom come. Her ears are better than mine, you see. She {{recognised}} the voice an' knocked up my rifle just as I pulled the trigger. But I'm afeared it's too late, lad." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{results were}} applauded by the Senate at first, who were <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> {{be rid of}} the former emperor. But {{tradition}} held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus {{was a member of}} the equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action. Their opposition, however, was not backed by any actual power. The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey), so there was no force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus.|$|E
5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> have seen me.|$|E

50|$|Following the meeting, Gray was {{instructed}} by <b>Glading</b> <b>to</b> go to India to deliver money and messages to insurgent elements. However, {{the cover story}} provided to Gray by the CPGB was so flimsy for a woman travelling alone during the monsoon season to India that she would easily rouse the suspicion of the authorities. Knight's B5(b) section, therefore, stepped in to concoct a plausible cover story to enable her to continue to gain evidence of CPGB espionage.|$|R
