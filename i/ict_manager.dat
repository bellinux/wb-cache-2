This grounded theory study explored emergency response <b>ICT</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 understanding of how social media, mobile, analytics, and cloud computing technologies (SMAC) are related to and can inform disaster response strategies. Sociotechnical theory served as the conceptual framework to ground the study. Data were collected from document reviews and semistructured interviews with 9 <b>ICT</b> <b>managers</b> from emergency management agencies in the state of Hawaii who had experience in responding to major disasters. The data were analyzed using open, axial coding, and selective coding. Three elements of a theory emerged from the findings: (a) the <b>ICT</b> <b>managers</b> were hesitant about SMAC technologies replacing first responder 2 ̆ 7 s radios to interoperate between emergency response agencies during major disasters, (b) the <b>ICT</b> <b>managers</b> were receptive to converging conventional ICT with SMAC technologies, and (c) the <b>ICT</b> <b>managers</b> were receptive to joining legacy information sharing strategies with new information sharing strategies based on SMAC technologies. The emergent theory offers a framework for aligning SMAC technologies and disaster response strategies. The implications for positive social change include reduced interoperability failures between disaster agencies during major catastrophes, which may lower the risk of casualties and deaths to emergency responders and disaster victims, thus benefiting them and their communities...|$|R

The abundance of information shared through the internet, the ever-increasing specialization of tasks, {{the possibility of}} immediately accessible information through social networks, the participation of stakeholders in the social web, and the increased requirements for separation of duty in a corporate context have contributed to {{a situation where the}} current ‘knowledge worker’ is not expected to have the same level of readily available knowledge as before. In this chapter we will describe this phenomenon in detail with a case study from ICT-expert jobs. We will show that an <b>ICT</b> <b>manager</b> can no longer overlook the work of collaborators, just by virtue of being the smartest employee around. He/she will increasingly rely on organizational procedures and professional standards to assess whether the right people - with the right competencies for the job – are at his/her disposal. After describing the specifics of professional knowledge for ICT experts and the role of social software plays in this, we will focus on the epistemological aspects of ICT expertise.

This paper presents the comparison of research institutes characteristics against business organizations and institutes of higher learning. A survey questionnaire was sent to the Heads of IT in IPA. The results of the status study of ICTSP development and implementation in Malaysian Public Research Institute and Government Agencies (IPA) provide a better understanding of their requirements. The finding of the study showed that one of IPAs ICTSP aim is to promote innovation in their organization since they are a dynamic and innovative organization. The research also revealed that even though IPA had experienced in ICTSP development and implementation, they were still facing several problems in developing and implementing ICTSP using existing methodologies.

Selected from 200 papers from 7 th Mechatronics Forum International Conference, USA, for a Special issue on Virtual Manufacturing (International Society of Agile Manufacturing). To support all phases of an agile modular manufacturing machine life cycle with CAE and Virtual Manufacturing tools, {{a number of different}} engineering applications (e. g. specialist software based tools) are typically used for design, simulation, analysis, programming, control and monitoring of a machine. These applications mainly exist today as small applications islands where each of them manages their own data. When a manufacturing machine is designed, simulated, programmed, analyzed, tested, or operated, the information, connected to that specific machine, used and generated by each application island is stored separately by each application. These application islands often use different storage technologies. Each one of the applications has an information structure to separate the information connected to each machine; however, they do not necessarily use the same information structure. Another issue concerning these applications is the functionality that is implemented in them to manage information; namely, processes such as store, retrieve, search, permissions, etc. The functionality for one process is the same in all applications that has the process implemented. But the implementation of the process functionality may differ, due to misinterpretation of the functionality specification and regular implementation bugs, which could lead to problem with integrity and consistency of the data. Applications that make use of newer information technologies, such as databases and software development tools can simplify the implementation of the functionality but each application still has to implement their own version of the functionality. This paper presents a research investigation focused on the development of a distributed integration platform that supports the whole life cycle of agile modular machine systems, which includes the design, simulation, programming, analysis, machine operation and re-configuration. The environment supports distributed management and storage of information in a system-wide library, information management and storage that is machine oriented, not application oriented, and information storage structured as reusable components to enable reuse of information and know-how that is produced throughout the life cycle of machines.

40|$|Projects in the {{information}} and communication technology (ICT) domain fail at an alarming rate, due to the inability of project managers to deal with complexity. This inability starts with the inadequate training that many project managers receive.

The training and career management framework was developed for <b>ICT</b> project <b>managers</b> through documentary analysis and constructed through the addition of elements and components {{at the end of each}} chapter. The theoretical framework that was developed, together with its description, suggests that <b>ICT</b> project <b>managers</b> need to be trained and developed by considering a framework that contains the following components and elements:  The training and development legislative framework of a specific country  The ambit of professional bodies, as well as the certifications and qualifications that they offer (in this case Project Management)  How projects and programmes, as well as the inclination to manage them from a portfolio perspective, can contribute to the execution of the strategy  How the organisational design can contribute to the definition of roles and functions in a projectised organisation  How the grouping of these roles and functions, within the concept of a job family, can contribute to the achievement of competence in <b>ICT</b> project <b>managers</b> The entire framework is presented at the end of the study.

40|$|Appointing <b>ICT</b> project <b>managers</b> is a {{delicate}} issue for management; not least since ICT projects {{are known to be}} unsuccessful in delivering the required product in time and on budget. Hence, it is even more important to find the “right” individual for the job. According to project management associations, certification in project management is a prerequisite for a project manager’s successful career. The appreciation of project management certifications among Swedish employers was studied using data collected from job advertisements for <b>ICT</b> project <b>managers</b> during four years (2010 - 2013). Judged on how the advertisements were worded the result indicates surprisingly low interest from the employers’ side, which conflicts with the project management associations statements about the certifications’ indispensable value for successful projects. Furthermore, it conflicts with a common understanding of certifications as essential for appointment as a project manager. The findings identify a possible gap between PM associations’ and employers’ views regarding the certifications’ value, and highlight the necessity of seriously considering whether it is worthwhile for the individuals to strive for, and for the organizations to promote certification, since it is costly in both time, effort and money...|$|R
40|$|Background: This paper {{reports on}} a {{research}} study that aims to identify and explain barriers to knowledge sharing (KS) {{in the provision of}} healthcare referral services in Chinese healthcare organisations. Design: An inductive case study approach was employed, in which 24 healthcare professionals and workers from four healthcare organisations in the province of Hubei, Central China, were interviewed using semi-structured scripts. Results: Through data analysis, 14 KS barriers emerged in four main themes: interpersonal trust barriers, communication barriers, management and leadership barriers, and inter-institutional barriers. A cause–consequence analysis of the identified barriers revealed that three of them are {{at the core of the}} majority of problems, namely, the absence of national and local policies for inter-hospital KS, lack of a specific hospital KS requirement, and lack of mutual acquaintance. Conclusions: To resolve KS problems, it is of great importance that healthcare governance agencies, both at the national and regional levels, take leadership in the process of KS implementation by establishing specific and strong policies for inter-institutional KS in the referral process. This paper raises important issues that exceed academic interests and are important to healthcare professionals, hospital managers, and Information communication technology (<b>ICT)</b> <b>managers</b> in hospitals, as well as healthcare politicians and policy makers...|$|R
