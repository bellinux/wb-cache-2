25|$|A 2007 {{study by}} the California Department of Public Health {{found that women who}} lived near farm fields sprayed with {{endosulfan}} and the related organochloride pesticide <b>dicofol</b> during the first eight weeks of pregnancy are several times more likely to give birth to children with autism. This is the first study to look for an association between endosulfan and autism, and additional study is needed to confirm the connection. A 2009 assessment concluded that epidemiology and rodent studies that suggest male reproductive and autism effects are open to other interpretations, and that developmental or reproductive toxicity in rats occurs only at endosulfan doses that cause neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Certain toxicants act as {{endocrine}} disruptors by {{interacting with}} the androgen receptor. DDE {{is one example of}} a chemical that acts via this mechanism. DDE is a metabolite of DDT that is widespread in the environment. Although production of DDT has been banned in the Western world, this chemical is extremely persistent and is still commonly found in the environment along with its metabolite DDE. DDE is an antiandrogen, which means it alters the expression of specific androgen-regulated genes, and is an androgen receptor (AR)-mediated mechanism. DDE is a lipophilic compound which diffuses into the cell and binds to the AR. Through binding, the receptor is inactivated and cannot bind to the androgen response element on DNA. This inhibits the transcription of androgen-responsive genes which can have serious consequences for exposed wildlife. In 1980, there was a spill in Lake Apopka, Florida which released the pesticide <b>dicofol</b> and DDT along with its metabolites. The neonatal and juvenile alligators present in this lake have been extensively studied and observed to have altered plasma hormone concentrations, decreased clutch viability, increased juvenile mortality, and morphological abnormalities in the testis and ovary.|$|E
2500|$|DDT {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to the insecticide methoxychlor and the acaricide <b>dicofol.</b> It is highly hydrophobic and nearly insoluble in water but has good solubility in most organic solvents, fats and oils. DDT does not occur naturally and is synthesised by a Friedel–Crafts hydroxyalkylation reaction between chloral (...) and chlorobenzene (...) , {{in the presence of}} an acidic catalyst. DDT has been marketed under trade names including Anofex, Cezarex, Chlorophenothane, Clofenotane, Dicophane, Dinocide, Gesarol, Guesapon, Guesarol, Gyron, Ixodex, Neocid, Neocidol and Zerdane.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dicofol</b> is an {{organochlorine}} pesticide that is chemically related to DDT. <b>Dicofol</b> is a miticide {{that is very}} effective against red spider mite.|$|E
5000|$|Appearance: Pure <b>dicofol</b> {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} solid. Technical <b>dicofol</b> is a red-brown or amber {{viscous liquid}} with an odor like fresh-cut hay.|$|E
50|$|Breakdown in {{soil and}} groundwater: <b>Dicofol</b> is {{moderately}} persistent in soil, with a half-life of 60 days. <b>Dicofol</b> {{is susceptible to}} chemical breakdown in moist soils. It is also subject to degradation by UV light. In a silty loam soil, its photodegradation half-life was 30 days. Under anaerobic soil conditions, the half-life for <b>dicofol</b> was 15.9 days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicofol</b> is {{practically}} {{insoluble in water}} and adsorbs very strongly to soil particles. It is therefore nearly immobile in soils and unlikely to infiltrate groundwater. Even in sandy soil, <b>dicofol</b> was not detected below the top 3 in in standard soil column tests. It is possible for <b>dicofol</b> to enter surface waters when soil erosion occurs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicofol</b> is {{converted}} in rats to the metabolites 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone and 4,4'-dichlorodicofol. Studies of the metabolism of <b>dicofol</b> in rats, mice, and rabbits {{have shown that}} ingested <b>dicofol</b> is rapidly absorbed, distributed primarily to fat, and readily eliminated in feces. When mice were given a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg <b>dicofol,</b> approximately 60% of the dose was eliminated within 96 hours, 20% in the urine, and 40% in the feces. Concentrations in body tissues peaked between 24 and 48 hours following dosing, with 10% of the dose found in fat, followed by the liver and other tissues. Levels in tissues other than fat declined sharply after the peak.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicofol</b> {{is usually}} {{synthesized}} from technical DDT. During the synthesis, DDT is first chlorinated to an intermediate, Cl-DDT, followed by hydrolyzing to dicofol.After the synthesis reaction, DDT and Cl-DDT may {{remain in the}} <b>dicofol</b> product as impurities.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{temporarily}} {{canceled the}} use of <b>dicofol</b> because relatively high levels of DDT contamination were ending up in the final product. Modern processes can produce technical grade <b>dicofol</b> that contains less than 0.1% DDT.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, {{the use of}} <b>dicofol</b> was {{suspended}} in Sweden for environmental reasons. In Switzerland its use is permitted for research purposes only. Throughout the European Union <b>dicofol</b> containing more than lg/kg (0.1%) of DDT or DDT related compounds cannot be used.|$|E
50|$|The Pesticide Survey, USA 1987 through 1996, {{reports that}} the total annual {{domestic}} agricultural usage of <b>dicofol</b> averaged about 860,000 pounds active ingredient (a.i.) for about 720000 acre treated. Most of the area is treated with 2 pounds a.i. or less per application, and the average acre is treated with about 1.2 pounds a.i. per year (1.3 kg/(ha·yr)). Fruits tend to have the highest application rates.The largest markets for <b>dicofol</b> in terms of total pounds active ingredient are cotton (over 50%) and citrus (almost 30%). Although only about 4% of the cotton acres grown are treated with <b>dicofol,</b> over 60% of all crop acres treated with <b>dicofol</b> are cotton acres. The remaining usage is primarily on other fruits and vegetables. Most of the US usage is in California and Florida.|$|E
50|$|Breakdown {{in water}}: <b>Dicofol</b> degrades in water or {{when exposed to}} UV light at pH levels above 7. Its {{half-life}} in solution at pH 5 is 47 to 85 days. Because of its very high absorption coefficient (Koc), <b>dicofol</b> is expected to adsorb to sediment when released into open waters.|$|E
50|$|Effects {{on other}} organisms: <b>Dicofol</b> is not toxic to bees.|$|E
5000|$|Mutagenic effects: Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that <b>dicofol</b> is not {{mutagenic}} ...|$|E
50|$|The 1998 US EPA {{review of}} <b>dicofol</b> {{recommended}} {{a number of}} changes {{in order to protect}} the environment and wildlife. <b>Dicofol</b> applications are limited to no more than one per year. In the UK, the maximum number of treatments permitted is two per year for apples and hops, and two per crop for strawberries, protected crops and tomatoes.|$|E
5000|$|Endocrine disruption: Evidence for <b>dicofol</b> {{to cause}} {{endocrine}} disruption is suggestive, but not definitive ...|$|E
50|$|In 1980, an {{accident}} at the US Tower Chemical Company {{led to a}} release of <b>dicofol</b> into Lake Apopka in Florida. Ten years later Dr Guillette of Florida University linked this incident to a subsequent decline in the fertility of alligators in the lake. The US EPA is still not clear whether <b>dicofol</b> {{is involved in the}} reproductive failure of the alligator population following the accidental spill.|$|E
50|$|Other {{examples}} include <b>dicofol,</b> mirex, kepone and pentachlorophenol. These {{can be either}} hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on their molecular structure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dicofol,</b> a {{compound}} structurally {{related to the}} insecticide DDT, is a miticide that is effective against the red spider mite Tetranychus urticae.|$|E
50|$|Breakdown in vegetation: In {{a number}} of studies, <b>dicofol</b> {{residues}} on treated plant tissues {{have been shown to}} remain unchanged for up to 2 years.|$|E
50|$|An {{assessment}} of <b>dicofol</b> by the UK Pesticides Safety Directorate in 1996 found that residues in apples, pears, blackcurrants and strawberries {{were higher than}} expected.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicofol</b> can {{be stored}} in fatty tissue. Intense {{activity}} or starvation may mobilize the chemical, resulting in the reappearance of toxic symptoms long after actual exposure.|$|E

50|$|Tests on {{laboratory}} animals {{show that}} the primary effects after long term exposure to <b>dicofol</b> include increases in liver weight and enzyme induction in the rat, mouse and dog.|$|E
5000|$|Manufacturing-use <b>dicofol</b> {{products}} {{contain a}} number of DDT analogs as manufacturing impurities. These include the o,p' and p,p' isomers of DDT, DDE, DDD, and a substance called extra-chlorine DDT or Cl-DDT ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicofol</b> is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} DDT. It differs from DDT by {{the replacement of}} the hydrogen (H) on C-1 by a hydroxyl (OH) functional group. One of the intermediates used in its production is DDT.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{established}} US maximum contaminant level (MCL) {{or health}} advisory levels for residues of <b>dicofol</b> in drinking water. In the European Union, the maximum level {{is the same}} for all active ingredients 0.1 mg/l.|$|E
50|$|The US National Pesticides Telecommunications Network {{database}} collected {{reports from}} 1984 to 1991 showing 91 human, 9 animal and 31 other poisoning incidents {{for a total}} of 131 incidents involving <b>dicofol</b> from 571 phone calls made to the hotline.|$|E
50|$|Effects on aquatic organisms: <b>Dicofol</b> {{is highly}} toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates, and algae. The LC50 is 0.12 mg/L in rainbow trout, 0.37 mg/L in {{sheepshead}} minnow, 0.06 mg/L in mysid shrimp, 0.015 mg/L in shell oysters, and 0.075 mg/L in algae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicofol</b> is a nerve poison. The exact mode {{of action}} is not known, {{although}} in mammals it causes hyperstimulation of nerve transmission along nerve axons (cells). This effect {{is thought to be}} related to the inhibition of certain enzymes in the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|Effects on birds: <b>Dicofol</b> is {{slightly}} toxic to birds. The 8-day dietary LC50 is 3010 ppm in bobwhite quail, 1418 ppm in Japanese quail, and 2126 ppm in ring-necked pheasant. Eggshell thinning and reduced offspring survival were {{noted in the}} mallard duck, American kestrel, ring dove, and screech owl.|$|E
5000|$|Reproductive {{effects in}} rat {{offspring}} {{have been observed}} only at doses high enough to also cause toxic effects on the livers, ovaries, and feeding behavior of the parents. Rats fed diets containing <b>dicofol</b> through two generations exhibited adverse effects on the survival and/or growth of newborns at 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg/day ...|$|E
