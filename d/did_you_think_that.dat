6000|$|Now, my dear friends, {{let me ask}} you as {{reasonable}} beings, <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> hearing me or any man preach, {{can save}} your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> sitting over a book for an hour a day, or all day long, will save your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins are washed away in Christ's blood, when they are there still, and you are committing them? Would they be here, and <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> them, if they were put away? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins can be put away out of God's sight, if they are not even put out of your own sight? If <b>you</b> are <b>doing</b> wrong, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> God will treat you as if <b>you</b> were <b>doing</b> right? Cannot God see in you what you see in yourselves? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a man can be clothed in Christ's righteousness at the very same time that he is clothed in his own unrighteousness? Can he be good and bad at once? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a man can be converted--that is turned round--when he is going on his old road the whole week? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a man has repented--that is, changed his mind--when he is in just the same mind as ever as to how he shall behave to his family, his customers, and everybody with whom he has to <b>do?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a man is renewed by God's Spirit, when except for a few religious phrases, and a little more outside respectability, he is just the old man, the same character at heart he ever was? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is any use in a man's belonging to the number of believers, if he does not do what he believes; or any use in thinking that God has elected and chosen him, when he chooses not to do what God has chosen that every man must do, or die? ...|$|R

[...] "Without a penny, indeed! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would dance {{attendance}} upon him {{if he were a}} poor man? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Laura would ever have looked twice at him?

6000|$|... "I {{understand}} that," [...] she said, gently, [...] "and I {{know that}} you acted for the best. But {{there are other things}} you have not told me, Major Mallett--other things that George Lechmere has told me. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it would have been of no interest to me to {{know that you}} had forgiven the man who tried to take your life; and, more than that, had restored his self respect, taken him as your servant, treated him as a friend?" ...|$|E

When such a one comes, casting his pearls about, {{throwing}} sweet odours through the air, whispering words which are soft-sounding as music in the heavens, whispering them to me, casting them at me, turning on me the laughing glances of his young eyes, how could I help to love him? Do you remember when {{for a moment he}} knelt almost at my feet, and told me that I was his friend, and spoke to me of his hearth? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that did not move me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young lady," [...] he answered, with {{a solemn}} voice, [...] "had this levity been sworn to me, I {{could never have}} {{believed}} it!

6000|$|... 'One {{that has}} heard,' said a sweet silvery voice; and {{from behind a}} pillar came a woman, dark and pale, but very beautiful, clothed in a rich Eastern robe that shone and shifted from colour to colour. Lightly she threw her white arms round the neck of Theseus, lightly she kissed his cheeks, and a strange sweet {{fragrance}} hung about her. Then, holding him apart, with {{her hands on his}} shoulders, she laughed, and half-turning to Ægeus, who had fallen back into his chair, she said: 'My lord, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you could hide anything from me?'
