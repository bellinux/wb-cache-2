40|$|Theme of {{this thesis}} is <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> and Business Continuity Planning. Main goal is design of <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>plan</b> for {{specific}} healthcare organization. One {{part of the}} design is analysis of analyzed hospital and identification of core applications and weak spots of the system. Within the analysis is risk assessment and assessment of {{its impact on the}} main applications. Based on this research the <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Plan</b> is proposed. First part defines basic parts of Business Continuity Management and process of creating <b>plans</b> of <b>recovery,</b> including theoretical description of all steps necessary to implement these plans. Second part contains analysis of examined hospital with all the steps defined in previous chapters and definition of <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>plan,</b> which is main output of this work. Partial goal of this thesis includes proposal of implementation of <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>plan</b> and final assessment of analysis and its output...|$|R
2500|$|Good <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>planning</b> {{ensures that}} both {{management}} and the recovery team have disaster recovery procedures which allow for effective communication. [...] This {{can be accomplished by}} ensuring contact information is easily accessible and that drills conducted test for communication abilities. [...] A good disaster recovery plan includes not only internal communication considerations but external issues as well. Such external communications considers issues related to communication between the organization and outside individuals and organizations, such as business partners. [...] Procedures to test this communication capability generally mirror those of the organization itself. [...] The disaster recovery evaluates these procedures and assumptions to determine if they are reasonable and likely to be effective. [...] Some techniques used by a DR auditor in evaluating readiness include testing of procedures, interviewing [...] employees, making comparison against the DR plans of other company and against industry standards, and examining company manuals and other written procedures. The auditor can verify through direct observation that emergency telephone numbers are listed and easily accessible {{in the event of a}} disaster.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> (DRPs) for IT {{systems have}} been {{improving}} over the past decades; some metrics became widely accepted such as recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO). However, <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> and solutions vary in their design, sophistication and their required RTO/RTO. Therefore, a need to categorize <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> into tiers has become necessary. Fortunately, a number of classifications exist but sometimes they are not fully explained; so, independent researchers may find the classification confusing or inappropriate for {{the current state of}} technology with significant overlap among tiers. Moreover, advances in communication and technology and the introduction of <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> as a service (DRaaS) by several cloud service providers (CSPs) has reshaped the area of <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> and development of DRPs. Therefore, one can argue that the old classification of 7 -tiers of DRPs is obsolete and a new classification is needed. Here, we try to survey these classifications, understand the common grounds and the differences and try to suggest some improvements to gap them...|$|R

50|$|At {{the same}} time the need for {{business}} continuity management (BCM), including incident preparedness, <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>planning,</b> and emergency response and management, has become steadily more prevalent in developed and developing economies.Failures of supporting ICT services (including information security issues such as systems intrusion and malware infections) are recognized as having the potential to impact the continuity of business operations. As a result managing ICT and related continuity and other security aspects forms an essential component of business continuity requirements. In addition it is often the case that critical business functions that require business continuity are usually dependent upon ICT. This dependence means that disruptions to ICT can constitute strategic risks to the reputation of an organization and its ability to operate effectively.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> (DR) and {{business}} continuity {{refers to an}} organization’s ability to recover from a disaster and/or unexpected event and resume operations.

5000|$|There is no {{one right}} type of <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plan,</b> nor is there a one-size-fits-all <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plan.</b> However, there are three basic {{strategies}} that feature in all <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> plans: (1) preventive measures, (2) detective measures, and (3) corrective measures. Preventive measures will try to prevent a disaster from occurring. These measures seek to identify and reduce risks. They are designed to mitigate or prevent an event from happening. These measures may include keeping data backed up and off site, using surge protectors, installing generators and conducting routine inspections. Detective measures are taken to discover the presence of any unwanted events within the IT infrastructure. Their aim is to uncover new potential threats. They may detect or uncover unwanted events. These measures include installing fire alarms, using up-to-date antivirus software, holding employee training sessions, and installing server and network monitoring software. Corrective measures are aimed to restore a system after a disaster or otherwise unwanted event takes place. These measures focus on fixing or restoring the systems after a disaster. Corrective measures may include keeping critical documents in the <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Plan</b> or securing proper insurance policies, after a [...] "lessons learned" [...] brainstorming session.|$|R
