5|$|A {{documentary}} film was commissioned {{to celebrate the}} 25th anniversary of Last of the Summer Wine. Produced and directed by Alan J. W. Bell, it featured interviews {{with the majority of}} cast and crew members, outtakes from the show, and a behind-the-scenes look at production. Segments with Duncan Wood and Barry Took explained the origins of the show and how <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filmed in Holmfirth. The documentary was broadcast on 30 March 1997.|$|E
5|$|After Gandhi {{returned}} from Second Round Table conference, {{he started a}} new satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.|$|E
5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by planters {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy {{with the use of}} slave labor, Mobile's population exploded. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie accent very poorly, however, he won the part and <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regarded as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair did not speak for the entire period that Our Friends in the North was filming.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} {{named the}} peak Skinner Butte, after Alonzo A. Skinner, the Rogue Valley Indian agent between 1851 and 1853. The current {{name of the}} mountain originates from one of its first residents, Roxy Ann Bowen. Two couples—Roxy Ann and her husband John McKee and Stephen and Mary Taylor—claimed almost the entire peak in 1853, and by the late 1850s, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known as Roxy Ann Peak.|$|E
5|$|His partisans sought vengeance for his {{killing and}} a {{splinter}} group developed within Fatah consisting of {{men from the}} Tiger Cubs and other Fatah dissidents. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known as the Black September Organization (BSO) and Abu Ali's men provided its initial membership. On November 28, {{one of his former}} Tiger Cubs, Munshir al-Khalifa, assassinated al-Tal in Cairo. According to Seale, this was the first attack carried out by the BSO.|$|E

5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used {{after the battle}} while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the wagon to run down the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing {{some of the men}} off the wagon and aggravated their injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{death toll}} was {{increased}} {{by the lack}} of early warnings, unwise land use, as villages were built in the likely path of lahars, and the lack of preparedness in communities near the volcano. Colombia's worst natural disaster, the Armero tragedy (as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known) was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée). It was the fourth-deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 AD. Its lahars were the deadliest in volcanic history.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{synthesis}} of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held {{that there was no}} naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of heredity could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the methodological naturalism of the sciences.|$|E

60|$|There is one inconvenience, {{not to say}} danger, in this {{argument}} of Mr. Shepherd's; namely, that of its not standing in the same force, when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repeated in the particular miraculous facts in support {{of which it is}} adduced.|$|R
5|$|This {{series of}} events was {{consequential}} to the Indian independence movement. Though largely subdued {{by the end of}} World War I, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a major factor in reforming the Raj's Indian policy. Similar efforts were made during World War II in Germany and in Japanese-controlled Southeast Asia, where Subhas Chandra Bose formed the Indische Legion and the Indian National Army respectively, and in Italy where Mohammad Iqbal Shedai formed the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan.|$|E
5|$|When Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen as {{unlikely}} {{that there would}} be any attempted landing as long as that conflict was undecided — from the British point of view at the time, the matter hung in the balance. In July 1941, construction of field fortifications was greatly reduced and concentration given to the possibility of a raid in force rather than a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as a well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{dissatisfaction with}} British rule, a serious {{rebellion}} erupted {{in various parts}} of North India; Bengal regiment's sepoy stationed at Meerut cantonment, Mangal Pandey, is widely credited as its starting point. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857. After the revolt failed, the British attempted to divide the most rebellious regions by reorganising the administrative boundaries of the region, splitting the Delhi region from 'NWFP of Agra' and merging it with Punjab, while the Ajmer- Marwar region was merged with Rajputana and Oudh was incorporated into the state. The new state was called the North Western Provinces of Agra and Oudh, which in 1902 was renamed as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. It was commonly referred to as the United Provinces or its acronym UP.|$|E
5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called, {{but it was}} {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; {{no mention of the}} sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E

5|$|In March 1782, 160 Pennsylvania militiamen under Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson rode {{into the}} Ohio Country, {{hoping to find}} the warriors who were {{responsible}} for raids against Pennsylvania settlers. Enraged by the gruesome murder by Indians of a white woman and her baby, Williamson's men detained about 100 Christian Delawares at the village of Gnadenhütten. The Christian Delawares (mostly women and children) had returned to Gnadenhütten from Captive Town in order to harvest the crops they {{had been forced to}} leave behind. Accusing the Christian Indians of having aided hostile raiding parties, the Pennsylvanians murdered them all by hammer blows to the head. The Gnadenhutten massacre, as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called, would have serious repercussions for the next American expedition into the Ohio Country.|$|E
5|$|In November 1997, Robin Raphel was {{appointed}} as United States Ambassador to Tunisia. Tunisia {{was a frequent}} partner for Mediterranean military exercises with U.S. naval squadrons and marine battalions, allowing more exercises in its waters {{than any other country}} in North Africa. When Raphel was ambassador, Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economics, Business and Agriculture, proposed a new initiative to liberalize trade further with Tunisia. The Eizenstat Initiative, as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known informally, implemented lower tariffs on industrial and manufacturing sector goods to enable Tunisia to become a supplier for goods throughout Arab and African states. President Zine El Abidine visited the Clinton White House in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In Parliament, a {{political}} crisis {{developed over the}} king's policy of seeking a Spanish wife for Charles, Prince of Wales, {{as part of a}} proposed alliance with the Habsburgs. In the parliament of 1621, it fell to Calvert to advocate the Spanish Match, as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called, against the majority of Parliament, who feared an increase in Catholic influence on the state. As a result of his pro-Spanish stance and defence of relaxations in the penal laws against Catholics, Calvert became estranged from many in the Commons, who were suspicious of his close familiarity with the Spanish ambassador's court. Calvert also faced difficulties in his private life: his wife's death on 8 August 1622 left him the single father of ten children, the oldest of whom, Cecil, was sixteen years old.|$|E
