5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels <b>get</b> <b>at</b> pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills <b>get</b> <b>at</b> the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to <b>get</b> <b>at</b> the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to <b>get</b> <b>at</b> the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove dirt {{and oil and}} realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that are otherwise hard to <b>get</b> <b>at.</b> Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and apply it by wiping their plumage with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E

5|$|Falco peregrinus {{was first}} {{described}} under its current binomial name by English ornithologist Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 work Ornithologia Britannica. The scientific name Falco peregrinus is a Medieval Latin phrase {{that was used}} by Albertus Magnus in 1225. The specific name taken {{from the fact that}} juvenile birds were taken while journeying to their breeding location rather than from the nest, as falcon nests were difficult to <b>get</b> <b>at.</b> The Latin term for falcon, falco, is related to falx, the Latin word meaning sickle, in reference to the silhouette of the falcon's long, pointed wings in flight.|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to <b>get</b> <b>at</b> it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E
5|$|During the February 21, 2000 {{game between}} the Canucks and the Boston Bruins, Brashear was {{involved}} in a fight with Marty McSorley. Brashear handily won the fight and {{on his way to the}} penalty box taunted the Bruins bench. Later in the game, Brashear collided with Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe, who had to be taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury. For the rest of the game, McSorley attempted to fight Brashear, who refused. With 4.6 seconds left in the game, McSorley struck Brashear with a two-handed slash to the temple with his stick; Brashear collapsed, and his helmet fell off upon impact. He suffered a seizure on the ice and the slash resulted in a grade three concussion. Goaltender Garth Snow then tried to fight McSorley, but a pile-up occurred, and Snow couldn't <b>get</b> <b>at</b> McSorley, who was ejected with 2.8 seconds left in the game. McSorley later received an indefinite suspension from the NHL and was charged with assault with a weapon as a result of his actions.|$|E

Pujols had five hits, three home runs, four runs scored, and six RBIs in the game. He joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players in {{baseball}} history to hit three home runs in a World Series game (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year), {{became the first}} player in series history to have hits in four consecutive innings, and tied records for most hits and most RBIs in a World Series game. He had one hit and no RBIs the other six games of the series but became a World Series champion for the second time as the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees to <b>get</b> <b>at</b> the coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of}} the coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to <b>get</b> <b>at</b> the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the monstrous birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E
