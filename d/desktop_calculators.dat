2500|$|The world's first all-electronic <b>desktop</b> <b>calculator</b> was the British Bell Punch ANITA, {{released}} in 1961.

The ANITA sold well {{since it was}} the only electronic <b>desktop</b> <b>calculator</b> available, and was silent and quick. The tube technology was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured Friden EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a [...] CRT, and introduced reverse Polish notation (RPN).|$|R
50|$|Volder {{teamed up}} with Malcolm MacMillan to build Athena, a fixed-point <b>desktop</b> <b>calculator</b> {{utilizing}} his binary CORDIC algorithm. The design was introduced to Hewlett-Packard in June 1965, but not accepted. Still, MacMillan introduced David S. Cochran (HP) to Volder's algorithm and when Cochran later met Volder he referred him to a similar approach John E. Meggitt (IBM) had proposed as pseudo-multiplication and pseudo-division in 1961. Meggitt's method was also suggesting the use of base 10 rather than base 2, as used by Volder's CORDIC so far. These efforts led to the ROMable logic implementation of a decimal CORDIC prototype machine inside of Hewlett-Packard in 1966, build by and conceptually derived from Thomas E. Osborne's prototypical Green Machine, a four-function, floating-point <b>desktop</b> <b>calculator</b> he had completed in DTL logic in December 1964. This project resulted in the public demonstration of Hewlett-Packard's first <b>desktop</b> <b>calculator</b> with scientific functions, the hp 9100A in March 1968, with series production starting later that year.|$|R

Busicom used the Mostek design in a new handheld line, the Busicom LE-120A, which went on the market in 1971 and was the smallest calculator available for some time.

5000|$|The first {{commercial}} microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004, {{began with the}} [...] "Busicom Project" [...] in 1968 as Masatoshi Shima's three-chip CPU design for the Busicom 141-PF calculator. In April 1968, Shima was tasked with designing a special-purpose LSI chipset, along with his supervisor Tadashi Tanba, {{for use in the}} Busicom 141-PF desktop calculator. This later became known as the [...] "Busicom Project". His initial design consisted of seven LSI chips, including a three-chip CPU. His design included arithmetic units (adders), multiplier units, registers, read-only memory, and a macro-instruction set to control a decimal computer system. Busicom then wanted a general-purpose LSI chipset, for not only <b>desktop</b> <b>calculators,</b> but also other equipment such as a teller machine, cash register and billing machine. Shima thus began work on a general-purpose LSI chipset in late 1968.|$|E
5000|$|The Intel 4004 is {{generally}} regarded as the first commercially available microprocessor, and cost [...] The first known advertisement for the 4004 is dated November 15, 1971 and appeared in Electronic News. The project that produced the 4004 originated in 1969, when Busicom, a Japanese calculator manufacturer, asked Intel to build a chipset for high-performance <b>desktop</b> <b>calculators.</b> Busicom's original design called for a programmable chip set consisting of seven different chips. Three of the chips were to make a special-purpose CPU with its program stored in ROM and its data stored in shift register read-write memory. Ted Hoff, the Intel engineer assigned to evaluate the project, believed the Busicom design could be simplified by using dynamic RAM storage for data, rather than shift register memory, and a more traditional general-purpose CPU architecture. Hoff {{came up with a}} four-chip architectural proposal: a ROM chip for storing the programs, a dynamic RAM chip for storing data, a simple I/O device and a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU). Although not a chip designer, he felt the CPU could be integrated into a single chip, but as he lacked the technical know-how the idea remained just a wish for the time being.|$|E
50|$|The company {{developed}} a <b>desktop</b> <b>calculator</b> {{based on a}} MOSFET chip for use by its engineers.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} a single-chip {{calculator}} was conceived by Sharp engineer Tadashi Sasaki in 1968. The first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the Busicom LE-120A [...] "HANDY", the first single-chip calculator to be built, released in February 1971. The Busicom 141-PF <b>desktop</b> <b>calculator,</b> released in March 1971, was the first computing machine to use a microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004 (co-designed by Busicom's Masatoshi Shima).|$|R
