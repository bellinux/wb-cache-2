25|$|Once the {{transmission}} {{characteristics of a}} system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a transceiver. A key consideration {{in the design of}} transmitters is their power consumption as this is closely related to their signal strength. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's <b>information</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> corrupted by noise.|$|E

25|$|The {{advances}} in bisulfite sequencing {{have led to}} the possibility of applying them at a genome-wide scale, where, previously, global measure of DNA methylation was feasible only using other techniques, such as Restriction landmark genomic scanning.

This epigenomic <b>information</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> important in understanding how the function of the genetic sequence is implemented and regulated.

25|$|The running key {{variant of}} the Vigenère cipher was also {{considered}} unbreakable at one time. This version uses as the key a block of text {{as long as the}} plaintext. Since the key is as long as the message the Friedman and Kasiski tests no longer work (the key is not repeated). In 1920, Friedman was the first to discover this variant's weaknesses. The problem with the running key Vigenère cipher is that the cryptanalyst has statistical information about the key (assuming that the block of text is in a known language) and that <b>information</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> reflected in the ciphertext.|$|E
25|$|However, {{many times}} there are methodological {{problems}} in these tests. Unconditional risk questions in cross-sectional studies are used consistently, leading to problems, as they {{ask about the}} likelihood of an action occurring, but does not determine {{if there is an}} outcome, or compare events that haven't happened to events that have. Concerning vaccines, perceptions of those who have not been vaccinated are compared to the perceptions of people who have been. Other problems which arise include the failure to know a person's perception of a risk.

25|$|Since the gay {{and lesbian}} {{veterans}} are not asked to disclose information about their sexual orientation on medical forms, the healthcare providers are often unaware of this information when they consider medical treatment options.
