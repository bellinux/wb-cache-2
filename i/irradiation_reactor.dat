40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} {{process for}} the detoxification of carbon tetrachloride- (CCl{sub 4 }{sup {minus}}) contaminated soil was investigated in the laboratory by using a batch <b>irradiation</b> <b>reactor</b> equipped with a 600 -W ultrasonic power supply operated at a frequency of 20 kHz. Key parameters studied included soil characteristics, irradiation time, CCl{sub 4 } concentration, steady-state operating temperature, applied ultrasonic-wave energy, and the ratio of soil to water in the system. The results of the experiments showed that (1) residual CCl{sub 4 } concentrations could be decreased with longer irradiation periods and (2) detoxification efficiency was proportional to steady-state operating temperature and applied ultrasonic-wave energy. The characteristics of the contaminated soil {{were found to be}} an important factor in the design of an ultrasonic detoxification system. A soil-phase CCl{sub 4 } concentration below 1 ppm (initial concentration of 56 ppm) was achieved through this process, indicating that the application of ultrasonic irradiation is feasible and effective in the detoxification of soil contaminated by organic compounds.

40|$|A {{scalable}} {{method for}} {{the synthesis of}} polyethylene terephthalamide microcapsules grafted with polyacrylic acid to enable pH responsiveness has been developed. Microcapsules were produced by interfacial polymerisation of an oil-in-water emulsion in a 2 L batch reactor and subsequently circulated through an external loop reactor for UV irradiative surface grafting. Ungrafted microcapsule samples yielded 1. 0 - 1. 2 g desiccated capsules per experiment. Initial production trials were subject to severe agglomeration, observed during dialysis of the microcapsules with 30 % (v/v) ethanol solution. Lowering of the terephthaloyl dichloride monomer concentration, to 0. 2 mol L⁻¹ in the chloroform / cyclohexane (3 : 1) organic solution, alleviated this unwanted agglomeration. Laser diffraction particle size analysis revealed microcapsules were produced with a 51 µm average diameter. A purpose built external loop <b>irradiation</b> <b>reactor</b> was used to facilitate graft polymerisation of acrylic acid on the microcapsules, using 254 nm UV light at 19 mW cm⁻². Characterisation of the external loop flow regime showed a mild deviation from ideal plug flow, with a vessel dispersion number of 0. 014 and a Reynolds number of 1310. Confirmation of monomer polymerisation was ascertained by back titration and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. No distinction between homopolymer and grafted polyacrylic acid could be made by these characterisation methods. A Taguchi analysis on variables influencing grafting revealed high temperature to contribute most significantly to graft yield, followed by a long irradiation period. The development of a packed column pulse response method for testing pH response showed a high repeatability. However, release profile testing of a microcapsule slurry with an observed graft yield of 1. 13 mmol g⁻¹ did not provide a definitive pH-based release of mPEG 5000 or PEGylated TAMRA dye. Determination of acrylic acid polymerisation kinetics following UV irradiation of the microcapsules is required for future optimisation of a functional graft yield...|$|E
40|$|Plutonium (Pu) is a predominately {{anthropogenic}} element {{produced during}} neutron irradiation of U in reactors and nuclear weapon detonations. Pu {{has been released}} to the environment during nuclear weapon detonations, nuclear reactor accidents, and in association with reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The most important source of Pu in the environment were the 543 atmospheric nuclear detonations conducted worldwide in the period 1945 – 1980 by the former Soviet Union (FSU), USA, United Kingdom (UK), China and France. The most intensive period of atmospheric nuclear testing was 1945 – 1962, interrupted by a moratorium during November 1958 to September 1961. This period was dominated by US testing during the premoratorium period and FSU testing during the post-moratorium period. Debris from the atmospheric nuclear detonations was deposited on a local, regional and global scale depending on detonation height, yield and meteorological conditions. The isotopic composition of Pu is source dependent. Pu is produced by neutron capture in 238 U, generating 239 U which rapidly (t 1 / 2 = 23. 5 min) decay to 239 Pu. Heavier isotopes are produced due to neutron capture in this 239 Pu. Heavier isotopes of Pu are successively produced during continued neutron <b>irradiation.</b> <b>Reactor</b> derived Pu would have 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios reflecting the irradiation history of the fuel (burn up). For technical reasons, the 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios in weapon purpose Pu has to be below 0. 07. The burn up in weapon production reactors kept low by frequent exchange of the fuel {{in order to ensure}} this. For power production reactors on the other hand, frequent exchange of the fuel is impracticable and uneconomical. The fuel is exchanged after a prolonged irradiation and high burn up. As the proportion of heavier Pu isotopes increase in relation to 239 Pu, all Pu atom ratios, and in particular the 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios increase; 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios up to 0. 67 have been reported. Debris from undetonated weapons and low yield detonations would also have low 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios, similar to the original weapon material. Post detonation Pu atom ratios depend on the yield and design of the device with high yield detonations generally producing Pu with higher 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios than low yield detonations. Global fallout was the mixed debris injected into the stratosphere by high yield detonations. After a considerable retention time in the stratosphere, this debris was deposited to form a general Pu background with an easily recognizable 240 Pu/ 239 Pu signature of ~ 0. 18. Pu isotopic signatures substantially different from global fallout indicates significant influence from local or regionally deposited Pu from nuclear weapon test sites, reactor accidents or releases from reprocessing. In the present thesis U and Pu isotopic signatures has been utilised for source identification and quantification purposes. The samples employed have been humic surface soils from 45 geographically well distributed sites in Norway (Paper I); an ice core from Austfonna (Svalbard) covering the period 1949 – 1999 (Paper II); and air filter samples from Norway during 1957 - 1963 (Paper III). Radioactive particles have been identified in the air filter samples the ice core samples (Paper II) and (Paper III), while atmospheric dispersion modelling (NOAA HYSPLIT_ 4) has been used to corroborate the source identification in (Paper III). Debris from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 was distributed over vast areas of Europe, including Fenno-Scandinavia. Whereas the deposition of caesium from the Chernobyl accident is known to have been strong in Norway, knowledge of the Pu deposition is scarce. In order to assess the relative importance of sources to Pu deposition in mainland Norway, Pu concentrations and atom ratios in humic surface soil samples collected from 45 geographically well distributed sites were determined by SF-ICP-MS (sector field inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry) and AMS (Accelerator mass spectrometry). Pu concentrations in samples collected from the same sites in 1990 and 2005 were compared in order to assess the relative migration of Pu from the surface layers. Pu concentrations (0. 7 – 149 Bq m- 2) were found to be higher at coastal sites with high annual precipitation than at inland sites with lower annual precipitation, this is in accordance with the global fallout theory. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios were found to vary within 0. 161 – 0. 211, mainly in accordance with the global fallout signature. However, at some inland sites Pu atom ratios were found to exceed global fallout Pu signatures, indicating a slight Chernobyl influence. Time resolved samples permit the investigation of variations of deposition and isotopic signatures in deposited debris. Pu and 236 U concentrations and atom ratios were determined by AMS in an Arctic ice core from Austfonna (Svalbard) covering the period 1951 – 1999, and in air filter samples collected during 1957 – 1963. The Austfonna represents an interesting sampling location in its proximity to FSU test site Novaya Zemlya (NZ). In addition tropospheric transport from Eurasia, and possibly the FSU test site in Semipalatinsk (STS) is facilitated by a semi-permanent high pressure area above Siberia during winter. Digital autoradiography indicated the presence of radioactive particles at depths corresponding to atmospheric nuclear testing (1949 – 1962) and the Chernobyl accident or a vented NZ underground detonation (1985 – 1989). Concentrations of Pu and 236 U in the Austfonna ice core (0. 008 to 0. 254 mBq cm- 2 and 0. 0039 to 0. 053 μBq cm- 2 respectively) were found to be higher at depths corresponding to the pre-moratorium period (1956 – 1959) than at depths corresponding to the post- moratorium period (1959 – 1962). This observation contrasts with observations at other sites where the deposition of anthropogenic radionuclides was found to be higher in the post-moratorium period. The discordance either indicates post depositional redistribution or a different depositional regime at the Austfonna glacier than at other sites. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratio measured in air filters (0. 0517 – 0. 237) showed a strong dependence on northern hemisphere atmospheric test activities, tending towards a value reflecting stratospheric fallout during periods without atmospheric nuclear testing, and substantially lower ratios in periods associated with atmospheric nuclear testing activities. The lower Pu atom ratios observed during periods of atmospheric nuclear testing indicates significant influence of tropospherically transported Pu from FSU atmospheric nuclear testing. A further indication is provided by the presence of radioactive particles in filters from the autumn and winter seasons of 1961 and 1962, i. e. periods associated with atmospheric testing at FSU test sites NZ and STS. Direct tropospheric transport from FSU test site STS was indicated by high Pu and 236 U concentrations and low 240 Pu/ 239 Pu, 241 Pu/ 239 Pu and 236 U/ 239 Pu atom ratios during November 1962. Atmospheric dispersion modelling (HYSPLIT) using real time meteorological data confirmed the plausibility of this transport, and limited the potential source to three low yield STS test detonations during 30 October – 1 November 1962...|$|E
