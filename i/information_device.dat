25|$|Java ME devices {{implement}} a profile. The most common {{of these are}} the Mobile <b>Information</b> <b>Device</b> Profile aimed at mobile devices, such as cell phones, and the Personal Profile aimed at consumer products and embedded devices like set-top boxes and PDAs. Profiles are subsets of configurations, {{of which there are}} currently two: the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) and the Connected Device Configuration (CDC).|$|E
25|$|Designed for mobile phones, the Mobile <b>Information</b> <b>Device</b> Profile {{includes}} a GUI, and a data storage API, and MIDP 2.0 {{includes a}} basic 2D gaming API. Applications written for this profile are called MIDlets. Almost all new cell phones {{come with a}} MIDP implementation, {{and it is now}} the de facto standard for downloadable cell phone games. However, many cellphones can run only those MIDlets that have been approved by the carrier, especially in North America.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe current {{technological}} {{trend in}} automotive navigation systems is toward “Display Audio” systems {{connected to a}} smartphone. However, there are some issues stemming from the differing life cycles of on-vehicle <b>information</b> <b>devices</b> and smartphones. Therefore, we expect that Display Audio will result in simple I/O devices connected via smartphones and a car-based network (e. g., Controller Area Network). However, there are numerous situations when {{it is necessary for}} a driver to easily and safely operate on-vehicle <b>information</b> <b>devices.</b> In this paper, we first discuss various types of on-vehicle <b>information</b> <b>devices,</b> and their intended use in driving situations. Second, we discuss the relation of those situations to various on-vehicle information applications. Third, we propose a simple user interface (UI) for connecting on-vehicle <b>information</b> <b>devices.</b> To conclude, we discuss the UI for on-vehicle <b>information</b> <b>devices,</b> based on context-aware technologies...|$|R

40|$|The MIDAS {{project is}} {{developing}} infrastructure and policies for optimal display of digital <b>information</b> on <b>devices</b> with diverse characteristics. In this paper we present the preliminary {{results of a}} study that explored the effects of scaling and color-depth variation in digital photographs on user perceptions of similarity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{relationships}} among employees' usage intention pertaining to mobile <b>information</b> <b>devices,</b> focusing on subjective judgement, technology acceptance tendency, information sharing behavior and information transfer. A research model was established to verify several hypotheses. The research model based on integrated concepts of knowledge management and technology acceptance modeling. Participants were employees of enterprises in Taiwan, selected by combining snowball and convenience sampling. Data obtained from 779 e-surveys. Multiple-regression analysis was employed for hypothesis verification. The results indicate that perceived ease-of-use of mobile devices was affected by computer self-efficacy and computer playfulness directly; meanwhile, perceived ease-of-use directly affects perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness can predict information-sharing behavior in a positive manner, and impact knowledge transfer as well. Based on the research findings, it suggested that enterprises should utilize mobile <b>information</b> <b>devices</b> to create more contact with customers and enrich their service network. In addition, it is recommended that managers use mobile devices to transmit key information to their staff and that they use these devices for problem-solving and decision-making. Further, the staff's skills pertaining to the operation of mobile <b>information</b> <b>devices</b> and to fully implement their features are reinforced in order to inspire the users' knowledge transfer. Enhancing the playfulness of the interface is also important. In general, it is useful to promote knowledge transfer behavior within an organization by motivating members to share information and ideas via mobile <b>information</b> <b>devices.</b> In addition, a well-designed interface can facilitate employees' use of these devices...|$|R

We compared the index such as mean task completion time, subjective rating on usability, tracking error, and NASA-TLX workload between young and older adults. The results suggest that young will be better than older adults at both abilities on processing displayed information and operating the switch. We were found that there was a significant interaction between the switch types and installation location. On the other hand, the displayed information did not affect the performance...|$|R
