500|$|This myth {{tells of}} Arachne, the {{daughter}} of a famous Tyrian purple wool dyer in Hypaepa of Lydia. Due to her father's skill with cloth dyeing, Arachne became adept in the art of weaving. Eventually, she began to consider herself to be a <b>greater</b> <b>weaver</b> than the goddess Athena herself, and challenged the goddess to a weaving contest to prove her superior skill. Athena wove the scene of her victory over Poseidon that had earned her the patronage of Athens, while Arachne wove a tapestry featuring many episodes of infidelity among the Gods of Olympus, which angered Athena. The goddess conceded that Arachne's weaving was flawless, but she was infuriated by the mortal's pride. In a final moment of anger, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and loom with her shuttle and cursed Arachne to live with extreme guilt. Out of sadness, Arachne soon hanged herself. Taking pity on her, Athena brought her back to life transformed as a spider, using the poison aconite; [...] "—and ever since, Arachne, as a spider, weaves her web." ...|$|E

30|$|Ghosh is the <b>great</b> <b>weaver</b> of this {{narrative}} that interweaves his criticisms and his ironies. The latter seeks to harmonize the dualities and oppositions that Europeans always emphasized, trying through negotiations with Hindu philosophy to harmonize them. He himself, through the narrator, emphasizes {{the relationship between}} weaving and language: “[I]t is because the weaver, in making cloth, makes words too, and trespassing on {{the territory of the}} poets gives names to things the eye can’t see. That is why the loom has given language more words, more metaphor, more idiom than all the world’s armies of pen-wielders” (Ghosh 2005 a, 74).|$|R

While there, he composed the story Undir Helgahnjúk, published in 1924. Soon after his baptism, he became a member of a group which prayed for reversion of the Nordic countries back to Catholicism. Laxness wrote of his experiences in the books Undir Helgahnúk (1924) and, more importantly, in Vefarinn mikli frá Kasmír (The <b>Great</b> <b>Weaver</b> from Kashmir). The novel, published in 1927, was hailed by noted Icelandic critic Kristján Albertsson: [...] "Finally, finally, a grand novel which towers like a cliff above the flatland of contemporary Icelandic poetry and fiction!

6000|$|This, at least, is a not unfriendly explanation. Yet I cannot {{but believe}} that, though Dickens took great pains with his plots, {{he was not}} a great plotter. He was not, any more than Thackeray, a story-teller first and foremost. We can hold in our minds every thread of Mr. Wilkie Collins' web, or of M. Fortune du Boisgobey's, or of M. Gaboriau's--all <b>great</b> <b>weavers</b> of intrigues. But Dickens goes about darkening his intrigue, giving it an extra knot, an extra twist, hinting here, ominously {{laughing}} there, till we get mystified and bored, and give ourselves up to the fun of the humours, indifferent to the destinies of villains and victims. Look at [...] "Edwin Drood." [...] A constant war about the plot rages in the magazines. I believe, for one, that Edwin Drood was resuscitated; but it gives me no pleasure. He was too uninteresting. Dickens's hints, nods, mutterings, forebodings, do not at all impress one like that deepening and darkening of the awful omens in [...] "The Bride of Lammermoor." [...] Here Scott--unconsciously, no doubt--used the very manner of Homer in the Odyssey, and nowhere was his genius more Homeric. That was romance.|$|R

50|$|Influenced by his University of Kentucky professors, {{who were}} mostly of Midwestern origin and of social {{democratic}} inclinations, {{and by the}} crisis of the <b>Great</b> Depression, <b>Weaver</b> believed that industrial capitalism had caused a general moral, economic, and intellectual failure in the United States. Hoping initially that socialism would afford an alternative to the prevailing industrialist culture, he joined the Kentucky chapter of the American Socialist Party. During 1932 Weaver actively campaigned for Norman Thomas, the standard-bearer of that party. A few years later, he made a financial contribution to the Loyalist cause in the Spanish Civil War. Encounters with intellectuals in coming years, such as Dr. Tricia McMillan, would unsettle his early acceptance of socialism.|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been fairly common to see Indonesian {{textiles}} displayed on walls in museums, galleries, and private homes rather than being worn as clothing, even though the objects themselves were usually originally intended to be worn. Likewise, the term “textile arts” is widely used when referring to high quality Indonesian textiles. Less common in the Indonesian context, however, is the production of textiles specifically as objects of art rather than as clothing. In the present paper I would like to explore the development of producing textiles as art objects in Indonesia. In practice, of course, it is not common for textiles to come to mind {{in the realm of}} art. This is especially true in the Western world, and Western perceptions of art have tended to be dominant globally in the modern world. This lack of appreciation of textiles as art possibly {{has its roots in the}} Greco-Roman world. The ancient Greeks and Romans were not especially <b>great</b> <b>weavers</b> and weaving did not feature among the attributes of the nine Muses, who were associated with music, dance, poetry, theater, history, and astronomy, but certainly not weaving. While examples of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures and even ceramics, though not being linked to the Muses, may have made it into the realm of fine art for modern connoisseurs—defined as “A critical judge of art, esp. of one of the fine arts ” (Little, et al 1955 : 372) —their textiles have not. The notion of “fine art ” is especially important for the present discussion, because whereas in the Western tradition textiles may be perceived as art, when art is defined broadly as “the application of skill to subjects of taste ” (Little, et al 1955 : 102), they are generally relegated to the inferio...|$|R

50|$|Weaver {{married his}} partner for life Helen Betty Spiegel of Cincinnati on August 29, 1952. Betty became <b>Weaver's</b> <b>greatest</b> critic and champion.

Weaver continued his position teaching mural design at Herron. In December, 1954 sketches of murals to be painted by his Herron students were presented to Dr. Fabien Sevitsky, music director of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. Sevitsky chose three scenes that were executed by a group of third year students of Beaux-Arts design under the supervision of Weaver. Throughout the decade Weaver continued to exhibit in faculty exhibitions at Herron, and at the Hoosier Salon.|$|R
6000|$|Between {{eight and}} nine o'clock that evening, Eppie and Silas were seated {{alone in the}} cottage. After the <b>great</b> {{excitement}} the <b>weaver</b> had undergone from {{the events of the}} afternoon, he had felt a longing for this quietude, and had even begged Mrs. Winthrop and Aaron, who had naturally lingered behind every one else, to leave him alone with his child. The excitement had not passed away: it had only reached that stage when the keenness of the susceptibility makes external stimulus intolerable--when there is no sense of weariness, but rather an intensity of inward life, under which sleep is an impossibility. Any one who has watched such moments in other men remembers the brightness of the eyes and the strange definiteness that comes over coarse features from that transient influence. It is as if a new fineness of ear for all spiritual voices had sent wonder-working vibrations through the heavy mortal frame--as if [...] "beauty born of murmuring sound" [...] had passed into the face of the listener.|$|R

50|$|Paisley, as {{with other}} areas in Renfrewshire, was at one time famous for its weaving and textile industries. As a consequence, the Paisley pattern has long {{symbolic}} associations with the town. Until the Jacquard loom {{was introduced in the}} 1820s, weaving was a cottage industry. This innovation led to the industrialisation of the process and many larger mills were created in the town. Also as a consequence of <b>greater</b> mechanisation, many <b>weavers</b> lost their livelihoods and left for Canada and Australia. Paisley was for many years a centre for the manufacture of cotton sewing thread. At the heyday of Paisley thread manufacture in the 1930s, there were 28,000 people employed in the huge Anchor and Ferguslie mills of J & P Coats Ltd, said to be the largest of their kind in the world at that time. In the 1950s, the mills diversified into the production of synthetic threads but production diminished rapidly as a result of less expensive imports from overseas and the establishment of mills in India and Brazil by J & P Coats. By the end of the 1993, there was no thread being produced in Paisley. Both industries have left a permanent mark on the town {{in the form of the}} many places with textile related names, for example, Dyer's Wynd, Cotton Street, Thread Street, Shuttle Street, Lawn Street, Silk Street, Mill Street, Gauze Street and Incle Street.|$|R
60|$|Having thus {{given the}} reader the first {{objections}} made against {{the existence of}} spirits, and the refutations thereof, I must now frankly own on which side my opinion leans; and for my part, it seems manifest {{to me that there}} are two beings; we conceive very plainly and distinctly, viz., body and spirit, {{and that it would be}} as absurd and ridiculous to deny the existence of the one as of the other; and really, if the refuters have got the better in their way of reasoning, they have still a much greater advantage over the objectors, when they come to back these reasons with fresh arguments drawn from experience. Of this, there having been many undoubted narratives given in the foregoing pages, concerning the apparitions of spirits, I shall refer the reader back again to them, and only subjoin here one or two instances, which may, if required, be proved upon oath, of spirits seen by two persons of our Duncan Campbell's own acquaintance. In the year 1711, one Mrs. Stephens and her daughter were together with Mr. Campbell, at the house of Mr Ramell, a very <b>great</b> and noted <b>weaver</b> at Haggerstone, where the rainy weather detained them till late at night. Just after the clock struck twelve, they all of them went to the door to see if the rain had ceased, being extremely desirous to get home. As soon as ever they had opened the door and where all got together, there appeared before them a thing all in white, the face seemed of a dismal palid hue, but the eyes thereof fiery and flaming, like beacons, and of a saucer size. It made its approaches to them till it came up within the space of about three yards of them, there it fixed and stood like a figure agaze, for some minutes; and they all stood likewise stiff, like the figure, frozen with fear, motionless, and speechless; when all of a sudden it vanished from their eyes, and that apparition to the sight was succeeded by a noise, or the appearance of a noise, like that which is occasioned by the fighting of twenty mastiff dogs.|$|R
40|$|The {{narrative}} probes the affect changing {{textile technology}} had on handloom weavers and weaving in Rhode Island 1780 - 1840. Research emphasized how {{the introduction of}} power spinning and weaving modified the work performed by textile craftsmen and altered {{the composition of the}} weaving population. Technological descriptions focus on the work of Rhode Island mechanics and experimentation in Taunton and Whitinsville. Humanistic considerations designed to answer questions relating to craft structure, social and economic standing, age, sex, ethnicity, kinship, marital status, religion, residence, length of employment and geographical mobility delineate shifts in craft definition from the traditional model. ^ The weaving accounts of A. and W. Sprague, Almy and Brown. Blackstone Manufacturing Company, Lippitt Manufacturing Company, White and Robinson, George Thurston and Company, Rowse Babcock and Russell Wheeler determined the base population for study. Newspaper advertisements, tax lists, land records, vital statistics, diaries and census data buttressed the information uncovered in the business documents. A computer analysis of the 1248 member sample aided in sorting material by index type and determining duration of time webs remained in weavers 2 ̆ 7 hands. ^ Initially innovations served to expand the market for handloom weaving. The opportunities available to the craftsmen led to the breakdown of the craft by eliminating the importance of traditional stratification. Fabrics produced by factories limited the need for skilled weavers as the firms manufactured simple utilitarian goods. By reducing the need for formerly apprenticed workmen, mill manufacture satisfied the <b>great</b> demand for <b>weavers</b> and encouraged semi-skilled part time artisans to join the labor force. As the introduction and improvement of the powerloom eroded the market for handloom weavers, part time employees sought alternate occupations. Some found employment weaving other fibers, or fancier patterns. Others farmed, worked as mill agents, picked, carded or developed skills in other trades. Weavers did not suffer bankruptcy as a result of mechanization since the majority of the workforce used weaving to supplement their income. Powerloom improvements usurped the demand for skilled weavers gradually which allowed the workers time to adjust to changes in the demand for their labor. ...|$|R
