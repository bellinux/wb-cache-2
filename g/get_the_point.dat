It's a video about understanding that no matter what you do, there's a way to be successful doing it. It's one of those motivational videos. It actually ends with a quote from Barack Obama which {{is one of my favorite}} quotes I've ever read, so we decided to put it in the video. It's vivid." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{writing and}} {{recording}} commencing {{almost immediately after}} finishing touring, the band were inspired to capture the energy of their live performances. Despite having previously received acclaim for redefining their sound record-to-record, the band felt little pressure to repeat this, Brian Lane simple stated that as with previous recording sessions, the band had become bored of performing their older material, and would naturally look to write and record songs that were different. Guitarist Vincent Accardi commented that [...] "after The Devil and God, the structures of songs were a bit more complex and things {{were a little bit}} delicate. I think we all just had a great urge to try to write simple, loud rock songs and just <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> across immediately".|$|E

Ulrich added that the band was feeling a musical insecurity — [...] "We felt inadequate as musicians and as songwriters, That made us go too far, around Master of Puppets and Justice, {{in the direction of}} trying to prove ourselves. 'We'll do all this weird-ass shit sideways to prove that we are capable musicians and songwriters'" [...] – and Hetfield added he wanted to avoid getting stale: [...] "Sitting there and worrying about whether people are going to like the album, therefore we have to write a certain kind of song — you just end up writing for someone else. Everyone's different. If everyone was the same, it would be boring as shit." ...|$|E

[...] However, when asked whether he liked Spamalot during an interview with Dennis Daniel on 98.5 WBON-FM The Bone shortly after the musical's opening on Broadway, Jones said, [...] "Well, I thought it was terrific good fun.

For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings 'Whatever Happened to My Part' since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she's really furious!

2500|$|The series finale {{received}} generally {{positive reactions}} from critics.

[...] Despite this, Firth's acting was praised, and she stated that the finale was [...] "brilliant because {{it goes back to}} what it was always best at... looking at {{the lives of the people}} who became spooks." [...] Jonathan Angwin of CultBox rated the finale five stars out of five, calling it a [...] "spectacular tour de force of an episode, never before has the ending of a British television programme been so perfectly executed." [...] Angwin however noted that Elena's false confession was a [...] "terrible move" [...] and did not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of Sasha's role despite the actor's strong performance, as he was [...] "impossible to sympathise with" [...] and was [...] "a little irritating." [...] Despite this the reviewer believed that the terror plot, Elena's interrogation, and the realisation Harry and Ruth would not have a happy ending proved [...] "the final hour of Spooks is easily one of its finest." ...|$|E

60|$|The biggest boy in his dormitory, Singer, took a dislike to him, and Philip, {{small for}} his age, {{had to put}} up with a good deal of hard treatment. About half-way through the term a mania ran through the school for a game called Nibs. It was a game for two, played on a table or a form with steel pens. You had to push your nib with the finger-nail so as to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of it over your opponent's, while he manoeuvred to prevent this and to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of his nib over the back of yours; when this result was {{achieved}} you breathed on the ball of your thumb, pressed it hard on the two nibs, and if you were able then to lift them without dropping either, both nibs became yours. Soon nothing was seen but boys playing this game, and the more skilful acquired vast stores of nibs. But in a little while Mr. Watson made up his mind that it was a form of gambling, forbade the game, and confiscated all the nibs in the boys' possession. Philip had been very adroit, and it was with a heavy heart that he gave up his winning; but his fingers itched to play still, and a few days later, on his way to the football field, he went into a shop and bought a pennyworth of J pens. He carried them loose in his pocket and enjoyed feeling them. Presently Singer found out that he had them. Singer had given up his nibs too, but he had kept back a very large one, called a Jumbo, which was almost unconquerable, and he could not resist the opportunity of getting Philip's Js out of him. Though Philip knew that he was at a disadvantage with his small nibs, he had an adventurous disposition and was willing to take the risk; besides, he was aware that Singer would not allow him to refuse. He had not played for a week and sat down to the game now with a thrill of excitement. He lost two of his small nibs quickly, and Singer was jubilant, but the third time by some chance the Jumbo slipped round and Philip was able to push his J across it. He crowed with triumph. At that moment Mr. Watson came in.|$|E

6000|$|Chad meanwhile, {{after having}} easily named his companion, had still more easily {{turned away and}} was already {{greeting}} other persons present. He was as easy, clever Chad, with the great artist as with his obscure compatriot, and as easy with every one else as with either: this fell into its place for Strether and made almost a new light, giving him, as a concatenation, something more he could enjoy. He liked Gloriani, but should never see him again; of that he was sufficiently sure. Chad accordingly, who was wonderful with both of them, {{was a kind of}} link for hopeless fancy, an implication of possibilities--oh if everything had been different! Strether noted at all events that he was thus on terms with illustrious spirits, and also that--yes, distinctly--he hadn't in the least swaggered about it. Our friend hadn't come there only for this figure of Abel Newsome's son, but that presence threatened to affect the observant mind as positively central. Gloriani indeed, remembering something and excusing himself, pursued Chad to speak to him, and Strether was left musing on many things. One of them was the question of whether, since he had been tested, he had passed. Did the artist drop him from having made out that he wouldn't do? He really felt just to-day that he might do better than usual. Hadn't he done well enough, so far as that went, in being exactly so dazzled? and in not having too, as he almost believed, wholly hidden from his host that he felt the latter's plummet? Suddenly, across the garden, he saw little Bilham approach, and it {{was a part of the}} fit that was on him that as their eyes met he guessed also HIS knowledge. If he had said to him on the instant what was uppermost he would have said: [...] "HAVE I passed?--for of course I know one has to pass here." [...] Little Bilham would have reassured him, have told him that he exaggerated, and have adduced happily enough the argument of little Bilham's own very presence; which, in truth, he could see, was as easy a one as Gloriani's own or as Chad's. He himself would perhaps then after a while cease to be frightened, would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view for some of the faces--types tremendously alien, alien to Woollett--that he had already begun to take in.
