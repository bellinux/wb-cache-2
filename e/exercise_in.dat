The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like she did in September 1920, when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project. Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandøren provided transport support to a large-scale Norwegian Army field <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> Western Norway.

He was promoted to lieutenant on 18 November 1908, and transferred to the 2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles on 16 September 1909.

5|$|On 1 March 1903, {{she became}} the {{flagship}} of KAdm Gustav Schmidt, the deputy commander of the I Squadron. That year, the squadron was occupied with the normal peacetime routine of individual and unit training, including a training cruise in the Baltic, followed by a voyage to Spain that lasted from 7 May to 10 June. In July, she embarked on the annual cruise to Norway {{with the rest of}} the squadron. The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> the North Sea, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September. The year's training schedule concluded with a cruise into the eastern Baltic that started on 23 November and a cruise into the Skagerrak that began on 1 December. Wittelsbach and the I Squadron participated in an <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904. Further squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March, and a major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May. In July, the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain, including a stop at Plymouth on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; the I Squadron anchored in Vlissingen the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when they departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea {{with the rest of the}} fleet. The squadron stopped in Molde, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 1951, Sydney {{was part}} of an eighteen-ship fleet present in Sydney Harbour to {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary of Australia's Federation. Following this, the carrier joined a multinational training <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> south-east Australian waters, then visited Hobart for the Royal Hobart Regatta. During the exercise, a Sea Fury accidentally fired four practice rockets into the superstructure of the New Zealand flagship, : although an inquiry concluded that the pilot had unintentionally pressed the fire button, it was later found that certain signal frequencies transmitted by Sydneys radio aerials could trigger a Fury's firing circuits. Sydney was presented with the Gloucester Cup in April 1951, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN for 1950. The two CAGs were switched over in April, and on 3 May, a Sea Fury crashed during a rocket-assisted take off; the pilot became the carrier's first fatality.|$|E
