40|$|The paper {{shows how}} {{excessive}} reporting, called "crying wolf", can dilute the information value of reports. Excessive reporting is investigated by undertaking the first formal analysis of money laundering enforcement. Banks monitor transactions and report suspicious activity to government agencies, which use these reports to identify investigation targets. Banks face fines should {{they fail to}} report money laundering. However, excessive fines force banks to report transactions which are less suspicious. The empirical evidence is shown {{to be consistent with}} the model''s predictions. The model is used to suggest implementable corrective policy measures, such as decreasing fines and introducing reporting fees.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe domestic terrorist {{threat in the}} United States is active and complex, with ongoing threats from violent left- and right-wing extremist groups, and radicalization and recruitment efforts by international terrorist groups. In response, domestic intelligence agencies, {{at all levels of}} government, have instituted reforms and improvements since 9 / 11, but there are still gaps in information-sharing and community engagement. For example, a review of the Boston Marathon bombings uncovered that important risk-based information was not shared with local law <b>enforcement.</b> Concerning domestic <b>terrorism,</b> the United States may, once again, be failing to connect the dots. This thesis synthesizes existing studies, reports, and expert testimony concerning domestic terrorism and the roles of domestic intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and the public, and proposes {{the development and implementation of}} a formal, national counterterrorism (CT) doctrine. The CT doctrine, in conjunction with a counter-radicalization strategy, should focus on bottom-up intelligence/information-sharing, training to strengthen and focus intelligence collection efforts, and culturally sensitive and engaging messaging on social media and the Internet to counter extremist propaganda.
