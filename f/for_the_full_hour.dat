50|$|Each morning, {{the first}} sentries are marched {{out with a}} duty piper and, upon taking their posts, are read their orders by the posting non-commissioned member: both are ordered arms and to stand at ease, weapon thrust out to {{the full extent of}} the right arm, head up, and feet 30 inches apart. Sentries hold their post for one hour before being replaced, though, a sentry may stand for two shifts in a day. Sentries on duty may march their beat, which {{consists}} of the senior sentry giving a sharp tap on the ground with his or her rifle butt, then acknowledged by the other sentry with a tap of his or her own rifle. A two-three pause between each movement, both sentries then come to attention, take a pace forward, shoulder their rifles, turn outwards, and start marching their beat of nine paces. At the ninth pace, both execute an about-turn and return to their original position, if a halt is signalled. Marching the beat can continue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour,</b> if desired.

40|$|This is {{a report}} on the use of a science-focused video game in five very {{different}} secondary school settings in Ontario, Canada. A mixed-methods approach was used in the study, and included data gathered on general gameplay habits and technology use, as well as informal interviews with teachers and students who played the game. In total, 161 participants played a series of games focused on the “life of a plant”, and were given both a pre and post quiz to determine if the game helped them retain and/or change what they knew about scientific processes like plant cell anatomy and photosynthesis. Participants showed statistically significant improvement on quizzes that were taken after playing the game for approximately one-hour sessions, despite difficulties in some cases both accessing and playing the game <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour.</b> Our findings also reveal the ongoing challenges in making use of technology in a variety of school sessions, even when using a browser-based game, that demanded very little other than a reliable internet connection...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of 25 tethered sows in {{an intensive}} piggery was observed for 1 h before and 1 h after {{the delivery of}} food to determine if behavioural stereotypies appeared as adjunctive behaviours. The different components of behavioural stereotypies {{were found to have}} different associations with the feeding period. Head-waving, bar-biting, and rubbing the snout against the cage were most common before feeding, and were shown particularly by the older sows. Manipulating the drinker and, for some sows, rubbing were most common after. There was some evidence of polydipsia. Vacuum chewing, playing with the chain, and aggressive behaviours, however, {{did not appear to be}} associated with the feeding period. The last two behaviours occurred only rarely. Seven sows showed stereotyped sequences of rapid rubbing or rapid drinking after the delivery of food, and these sows showed more excitement before food was delivered. Rooting was common <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> after all food had been consumed, and occurred in conjunction with long duration drinking. I suggest that the occurrence of adjunctive drinking by sows results from the persistence of feeding motivation, perhaps because concentrated food does not provide sufficient stomach distension, combined with the knowledge that food will definitely not be forthcoming. Stereotyped sequences of behaviour may be a means of reducing the arousal generated by the expectation of food...|$|E

50|$|In 2006, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} examined how this model held up in the laboratory. Locusts were placed in a circular arena, and their movements were tracked with computer software. At low densities, below 18 locusts per square metre, the locusts mill about in a disordered way. At intermediate densities, they start falling into line and marching together, punctuated by abrupt but coordinated changes in direction. However, when densities reached a critical value at about 74 locusts/m2, the locusts ceased making rapid and spontaneous changes in direction, and instead marched steadily in <b>the</b> same direction <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> eight <b>hours</b> of <b>the</b> experiment (see video on the left).

40|$|AbstractThe {{vertical}} distribution of {{gross primary production}} rates of periphyton communities was determined based on changes in the oxygen concentration. The gross primary production conformed to the colonization pattern of the epiphytic algae on submerged shoots of Phragmites australis. The algae produced the most on stem sections that grew from 0. 2 to 0. 5 m deep in the littoral zone. The PB rates, however, decreased on these middle sections of the stems due to increasing self-shading by the periphyton.

50|$|A {{constantly}} recurring, central {{element in}} Fasching’s {{work is the}} creation of his pieces of art amidst his visitors and audience. There were 7 periods between 1987 and 2006 when, under the title 12 Tage 12 Nächte/12 Days 12 Nights, Fasching lived and worked in various galleries around the world, where he could be observed at work and was always open to discussions. During this time he did not leave the place of work. Fasching created 12 paintings with themes inspired by the talks with the visitors to his work sessions. <b>For</b> each of <b>the</b> seven stations of the project (1987), Amsterdam (1990), Cologne (1991), Zurich (1992), Jerusalem (1994), New York (1997) and finally Vienna again (2006) a special soundtrack was composed, which was played in <b>the</b> respective gallery <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> 288 <b>hours</b> of <b>the</b> project.|$|R

All team managers signed the petition {{with the exception of}} Ken Tyrrell which meant the race was not officially shortened. Ironically, this would work against his team when Jonathan Palmer lost a certain 4th place after his Tyrrell-Ford ran out of fuel on lap 69. Had the race been flagged after 70 laps, Palmer would have finished 4th having already been lapped by Prost instead of running out of fuel and being classified as 9th and last.|$|R

40|$|How does {{international}} {{public support}} via social media influence conflict dynamics? To answer this question, I construct a unique, extremely disaggregated dataset drawn from social media sources {{to examine the}} behavior of Israel and Hamas during the 2012 Gaza Conflict. The dataset contains conflict actions and international audience behavior at <b>the</b> hourly-level <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> 179 <b>hours</b> of <b>the</b> conflict. Notably, I also include popular support for each side from international audiences on social media. I employ a Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregression (BSVAR) to measure how Israel’s and Hamas’s actions respond to shifts in international public support.
