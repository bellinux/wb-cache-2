40|$|The Conradi–Hünermann–Happle {{syndrome}} is an X-linked dominant disease that {{is due to}} mutations in the gene for <b>emopamil</b> binding protein. <b>Emopamil</b> binding protein is a Δ 8 –Δ 7 sterol isomerase and plays {{a pivotal role in}} the final steps of cholesterol biosynthesis. We wanted to know to what extent this X-linked dominant enzyme defect has functional consequences at the biochemical level and whether it is possible to predict the clinical phenotype from serum sterol measurements. Therefore we performed sterol biochemical studies in 11 Conradi–Hünermann–Happle syndrome families and compared the results obtained to the clinical and molecular genetic findings. To assess disease severity a score considering bone and skin involvement and further features was used. For evaluation of the functional consequences we studied serum samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. For mutation screening we analyzed the <b>emopamil</b> binding protein gene using polymerase chain reaction, heteroduplex analysis of all exons, direct sequencing, and restriction enzyme analysis. Mutations in the <b>emopamil</b> binding protein gene were found in all 11 families including seven novel mutations affecting exons 2, 4, and 5. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis revealed markedly elevated levels of 8 -dehydrocholesterol and of cholest- 8 (9) -en- 3 β-ol and helped to identify somatic mosaicism in a clinically unaffected man. The extent of the metabolic alterations in the serum, however, do not allow prediction of the clinical phenotype, nor the genotype. This lack of correlation may be due to differences in X-inactivation between different tissues of the same patient and/or loss of the mutant clone by outgrowth of proficient clones after some time...|$|E

40|$|A {{previous}} transcriptomic {{analysis of}} 3, 032 fungal genes identified the Botrytis cinerea PIE 3 (BcPIE 3) gene to be up-regulated early in planta (A. Gioti, A. Simon, P. Le Pêcheur, C. Giraud, J. M. Pradier, M. Viaud, and C. Levis, J. Mol. Biol. 358 : 372 - 386, 2006). In the present study, BcPIE 3 was disrupted {{in order to}} determine its implication in pathogenicity. BcPIE 3 was shown to be a virulence factor, since the ΔBcPIE 3 mutant was blocked during the colonization of tomato and bean leaves, giving lesions reduced in size by at least 74 %. Within the <b>emopamil</b> binding domain (EBD), BcPIE 3 shows significant structural similarities to mammalian <b>emopamil</b> binding proteins (EBPs). Mammalian EBPs function as sterol isomerases, but an analysis of the sterol content and the results of growth inhibition experiments with the ΔBcPIE 3 strain indicated that BcPIE 3 is dispensable for ergosterol biosynthesis. The systematic identification of EBD-containing proteins included in public databases showed that these proteins constitute a protein superfamily present only in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ancestral EBD-encoding gene was duplicated in the common ancestor of animals and fungi after the split from plants. Finally, we present evidence that the EBP phylogenetic clade of this superfamily has further expanded exclusively in euascomycetes, especially in B. cinerea, which contains three copies of the EBP gene...|$|E
40|$|Background]: Conradi-Hünermann-Happle {{syndrome}} (CDPX 2, OMIM 302960) is {{an inherited}} X-linked dominant variant of chondrodysplasia punctata which primarily affects the skin, bones and eyes. CDPX 2 results from mutations in EBP (<b>emopamil</b> binding protein), and presents with {{increased levels of}} sterol precursors 8 (9) -cholestenol and 8 -dehydrocholesterol. [Objectives]: To expand the understanding of CDPX 2, clinically, biochemically and genetically. [Methods]: We present {{one of the largest}} series reported to date, including 13 female patients belonging to nine Spanish families. Patients were studied biochemically using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, genetically using polymerase chain reaction and in their methylation status using the HUMARA assay. [Results]: In our cases, there was a clear relationship between abnormal sterol profile and the EBP gene mutation. We describe three novel mutations in the EBP gene. EBP mutations were inherited in three out of nine families and were sporadic in the remaining cases. [Conclusions]: No clear genotype-phenotype correlation was found. Patients' biochemical profiles did not reveal a relationship between sterol profiles and severity of disease. A skewed X-chromosome inactivation may explain the clinical phenotype in CDPX 2 in some familial cases. © 2011 The Authors. BJD © 2011 British Association of Dermatologists. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The sigma-drug {{binding site}} of {{guinea-pig}} liver is carried by a protein which shares significant {{amino acid sequence}} similarities with the yeast sterol C 8 –C 7 isomerase (ERG 2 protein). Pharmacologically - but not structurally - the sigma 1 -site is also related to the <b>emopamil</b> binding protein, the mammalian sterol C 8 –C 7 isomerase. We therefore investigated if sterol C 8 –C 7 isomerase inhibitors are high affinity ligands for the (+) -[3 H]-pentazocine labelled sigma 1 -binding site. Among the compounds which bound with high affinity to native hepatic and cerebral {{as well as to}} yeast expressed sigma 1 -binding sites were the agricultural fungicide fenpropimorph (Ki 0. 005 [*]nM), the antihypocholesterinaemic drugs triparanol (Ki 7. 0 [*]nM), AY- 9944 (Ki 0. 46 [*]nM) and MDL 28, 815 (Ki 0. 16 [*]nM), the enantiomers of the ovulation inducer clomiphene (Ki 5. 5 and 12 [*]nM, respectively) and the antioestrogene tamoxifen (Ki 26 [*]nM). Except for tamoxifen these affinities are essentially identical with those for the [3 H]-ifenprodil labelled sterol C 8 –C 7 isomerase of S. cerevisiae. This demonstrates that sigma 1 -binding protein and yeast isomerase are not only structurally but also pharmacologically related. Because of its affiliations with yeast and mammalian sterol isomerases we propose that the sigma 1 -binding site is localized on a sterol isomerase related protein, involved in postsqualene sterol biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|CHO 2, {{encoding}} human sterol 8 -isomerase (hSI), {{was introduced}} into plasmids pYX 213 or pET 23 a. The resulting native protein was overexpressed in erg 2 yeast cells and purified to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme exhibited a K (m) of 50 microM and a turnover number of 0. 423 s(- 1) for zymosterol, an isoelectric point of 7. 70, a native molecular mass of 107000 Da and was tetrameric. The structural features of zymosterol provided optimal substrate acceptability. Biomimetic studies of acid-catalysed isomerization of zymosterol resulted in formation of cholest- 8 (14) -enol, whereas the enzyme-generated product was a Delta(7) -sterol, suggesting absolute stereochemical {{control of the}} reaction by hSI. Using (2) H(2) O and either zymosterol or cholesta- 7, 24 -dienol as substrates, the reversibility of the reaction was confirmed by GC-MS of the deuterated products. The positional specific incorporation of deuterium at C- 9 alpha was established {{by a combination of}} (1) H- and (13) C-NMR analyses of the enzyme-generated cholesta- 7, 24 -dienol. Kinetic analyses indicated the reaction equilibrium (K (eq) = 14; DeltaG(o') =- 6. 5 kJ/mol) for double-bond isomerization favoured the forward direction, Delta(8) to Delta(7). Treatment of hSI with different high-energy intermediate analogues produced the following dissociation constants (K (i)) : <b>emopamil</b> (2 microM) =tamoxifen (1 microM) =tridemorph (1 microM) < 25 -azacholesterol (21 microM) <ketoconazole (156 microM) <cholesterol (620 microM).

At present, there are over 40 known distinct mutations along the EBP gene, although there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation. These intermediates may have teratogens effects on a devolving fetus, producing any of several birth defects. These include a variety of Chondrodysplasia syndromes, such as CDPX 1, CDPX 2 and RCP. Trademark features of CDPX 2 include cataracts, stippling of the vertebrae and the ribs, ichthyosis, and prominent lines of Blaschko. Individuals diagnosed with CDPX 2 may exhibit a diverse series of phenotypes and Biochemical and DNA analysis are the two methods to confirm the disorder. In this study, I performed DNA analysis on an individual diagnosed with CDPX 2 due to phenotypic characteristics present at birth and persisting through adulthood. My findings present no known mutation within EBP to neither explain nor validate the CDPX 2 diagnosis. A close examination of current literature brings forth several possibilities to explain a case where an individual shows clinical features, but does not have a mutated EBP gene...|$|E
40|$|Summary Since the {{discovery}} of vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC 1), the key enzyme for the regeneration of vitamin KH 2, numerous studies have addressed the role of VKORC 1 in the posttranslational modification of vitamin K-dependent proteins. VKORC 1 is also the target protein of anticoagulant drugs of the coumarin type (e. g. warfarin). Genetic variants in VKORC 1 have recently been shown to significantly affect the coumarin dose and international normalised ratio level. In the present study, we have used the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system to identify potential interaction partners of VKORC 1. With this system we could identify 90 candidates. Out of these, we focused on VKORC 1 itself, its paralog VKORC 1 L 1, <b>emopamil</b> binding protein (EBP) and stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP 1).

40|$|Sterol Delta(8) -isomerase (SI) (EC 5. 3. 3. 5), {{also known}} as <b>emopamil</b> binding protein or sigma receptor, catalyses the {{conversion}} of the 8 -ene isomer into the 7 -ene isomer in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in mammals. Recently, mutations of SI {{have been found to be}} associated with Conradi-Hünermann syndrome in humans. To investigate the in vitro and in vivo modes of molecular regulation of SI and its role in cholesterol biosynthesis in mammals, we isolated a full-length cDNA encoding rat SI. The deduced amino-acid sequence of rat SI predicts a 230 -residue protein (26737 Da) with 87 % and 80 % amino-acid identity to mouse and human counterparts. The rat SI gene was mapped to chromosome 12 q 1. 2 using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The biological function of the cloned rat SI cDNA was verified by overexpressing recombinant Myc-SI in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It showed a characteristic pattern of inhibition on exposure to trans- 2 -[4 -(1, 2 -diphenylbuten- 1 -yl) phenoxy]-N,N-dimethylethylamine (tamoxifen; IC(50) = 11. 2 microM) and 3 beta-[2 -(diethylamino) ethoxy]androst- 5 -en- 17 -one (U 18666 A; IC(50) = 4. 2 microM), two well known potent inhibitors of SI. Northern-blot analysis of 3 -week-old rats compared with 2 -year-old rats showed that SI mRNA expression in both age groups was restricted to liver, where a 70 % reduction in mRNA levels was observed in 2 -year-old rats. The FISH studies revealed ubiquitous expression of SI mRNA in rat hepatocytes. The in vitro studies showed that the SI mRNA was highly suppressed by 25 -hydroxycholesterol in H 4 IIE cells. Treatment of H 4 IIE cells grown in medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum with tamoxifen for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent induction of SI mRNA, with a concomitant suppression of sterol regulatory element binding protein- 1 mRNA. Interestingly, this effect was not seen in emopamil-treated cells. The in vivo experiments also indicate that both mRNA expression and enzymic activity of SI in liver were induced approx. 3 -fold in rats fed 5 % (w/w) cholestyramine plus 0. 1 % (w/w) lovastatin in normal chow for 2 weeks. With this newly cloned rat SI cDNA, it becomes possible to gain molecular understanding of previously unknown and tamoxifen-mediated gene regulation of SI that is involved in cholesterol metabolism, ischaemia and genetic diseases...|$|E
