50|$|Metro Radio Inc., the {{broadcast}} company that owned WLZA LAZER 96.1 FM radio, began with founder and Station Manager Harry Jackson {{and his wife}} Carolyn Jackson in May 1974 with “King Country” WEPA-AM 710. The station’s music format was modern country music with a sprinkle of Southern and Country Gospel music each day. Many of you remember the days when Harry and Carolyn hosted The Party Line Program Monday through Saturday at 8:30am. This program allowed listeners to call the radio station live {{on the air and}} list the items they had to buy, sell, or trade. This was the most popular program on WEPA {{and was one of the}} longest running programs on the air. In the later years Harry would <b>host</b> <b>Party</b> Line on a part-time basis. But Carolyn would remain co-host until March 1998 when WEPA signed off the air. Another program that shared Party Line’s many years on the air was The Sunday Morning Worship broadcast at First Baptist Church In Eupora. Sunday Gospel music was also very popular with listeners from 6am until 6pm every Sunday.|$|E

50|$|The 'ava {{ceremony}} {{is the least}} significant ritual which takes place during all important occasions, including the bestowal of matai chiefly titles. The overall {{ceremony is}} highly ritualized, with specific gestures and phrases to be used at various times. Ceremonial items for the 'ava ceremony include the tanoa (round wooden bowl) {{similar to those used}} in the kava cultures of other Polynesian societies. The tanoa are made of varying sizes supported by many short legs around it. These bowls and other related instruments are often highly decorated. Known as kava in other parts of Polynesia, the 'ava is a beverage produced from a plant that is drunk throughout the western Pacific region. The drinking of ava in Samoa is generally done through highly ritualized ava ceremonies. The kava is prepared by a group of people called aumaga. It is brought to each participant by the tautuaava, or ava server, in the order proscribed by the tufaava, or ava distributor. Usually, the highest chief of the visiting party is served first, followed by the highest chief of the <b>host</b> <b>party,</b> and then service proceeds based on the rank {{of the rest of the}} participants. The drink is served in a polished coconut half.|$|E
40|$|Designing a {{measurement}} system {{that might be}} used in a nuclear facility is a challenging, if not daunting, proposition. The situation is made more complicated when the system needs to be designed to satisfy the disparate requirements of a monitoring and a <b>host</b> <b>party</b> - a relationship that could prove to be adversarial. The cooperative design of the elements of the AVNG (Attribute Verification with Neutrons and Gamma Rays) system served as a crucible that exercised the possible pitfalls in the design and implementation of {{a measurement}} system that could {{be used in a}} <b>host</b> <b>party</b> nuclear facility that satisfied the constraints of operation for both the host and monitoring parties. Some of the issues that needed to be addressed in the joint design were certification requirements of the <b>host</b> <b>party</b> and the authentication requirements of the monitoring party. In this paper the nature of the problem of cooperative design will be introduced. The details of cooperative design revolve around the idiosyncratic nature of the adversarial relationship between the parties involved in a possible measurement regime, particularly if measurements on items that may contain sensitive information are being pursued. The possibility of an adversarial interaction is more likely if an information barrier is required for the measurement system. The origin of the antagonistic elements of the <b>host</b> <b>party</b> and hosted party relationship will be considered. In addition, some of the conclusions will be presented that make cooperative design (and development) proceed more efficiently. Finally, some lessons learned will be presented as a result of this expedition into cooperative design...|$|E
