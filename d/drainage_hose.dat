3000|$|The {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in a rectangular flume tank specifically designed for this study. Prior {{to the construction of}} the tank, the size, scale, and position of the dam model were considered to enable timely collection of accurate data. The flume tank was 2  m long, 0.45  m high and 0.45  m wide, and was made entirely of glass, with two 4  cm diameter drainage outlets at the downstream end to allow steady discharge of fluidized sediments. The flume was gently tilted to make a bed slope of 5 °. The construction and modification of the flume tank considered the dimensions of other flume tanks used by previous studies, including the 1  m[*]×[*] 0.6  m[*]×[*] 0.45  m model used by Sidle et al. (1995), 5  m[*]×[*] 0.3  m[*]×[*] 0.5  m (Awal et al. 2009), 1.5  m[*]×[*] 1  m (Wilson 2009), 1.4  m[*]×[*] 1  m (Wilson 2011), and 0.5  m[*]×[*] 0.5  m[*]×[*] 0.5  m (Fox et al. 2014) flumes. The upstream lake was recharged from a <b>drainage</b> <b>hose</b> fed by a water tap. Pre-failure crest settlements associated with the onset of internal erosion and piping were measured with two CMOS multi-function analog laser displacement sensors attached to a wooden overboard. Concave-upward depressions observed during the initiation of internal erosion and piping were monitored by positioning one of the sensors (H [...]...|$|E
