40|$|Abstract: Internal {{models are}} neural {{mechanisms}} that can mimic the input–output or output–input {{properties of the}} motor apparatus and external objects. <b>Forward</b> internal <b>models</b> predict sensory consequences from efference copies of motor commands. There is growing acceptance {{of the idea that}} <b>forward</b> <b>models</b> are important in sensorimotor integration as well as in higher cognitive function, but their anatomical loci and neural mechanisms are still largely unknown. Some of the most convincing evidence that the central nervous system (CNS) makes use of <b>forward</b> <b>models</b> in sensory motor control comes from studies on grip force–load force coupling. We first present a brief review of recent computational and behavioral studies that provide decisive evidence for the utilization of <b>forward</b> <b>models</b> in grip force–load force coupling tasks. Then, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the brain activity related to this coupling and demonstrate that the cerebellum is the most likely site for <b>forward</b> <b>models</b> to be stored...|$|R

Inverse models (controllers) generate the motor command that will cause a desired change in state, given an environmental context. During motor learning, the <b>forward</b> and inverse <b>models</b> are paired and tightly coupled by a responsibility signal within modules.

50|$|Theoretical {{work has}} shown that in models of motor control, when inverse models are used in {{combination}} with a <b>forward</b> <b>model,</b> the efference copy of the motor command output from the inverse model {{can be used as}} an input to a <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> for further predictions. For example if, in addition to reaching with the arm, the hand must be controlled to grab an object, an efference copy of the arm motor command can be input into a <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> to estimate the arm's predicted trajectory. With this information, the controller can then generate the appropriate motor command telling the hand to grab the object. It has been proposed that if they exist, this combination of inverse and forward models would allow the CNS to take a desired action (reach with the arm), accurately control the reach and then accurately control the hand to grip an object.|$|E

5000|$|The {{centerpiece}} of seismic linear inversion is the <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> which models {{the generation of}} the experimental data collected. According to Wiggins (1972), it provides a functional (computational) relationship between the model parameters and calculated values for the observed traces. Depending on the seismic data collected, this model may vary from the classical wave equations for predicting particle displacement or fluid pressure for sound wave propagation through rock or fluids, to some variants of these classical equations. For example, the <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> in Tarantola (1984) is the wave equation for pressure variation in a liquid media during seismic wave propagation while by assuming constant velocity layers with plane interfaces, Kanasewich and Chiu (1985) used the brachistotrone model of John Bernoulli for travel time of a ray along a path. In Cooke and Schneider (1983), the model is a synthetic trace generation algorithm expressed as in Eqn. 3, where R(t) is generated in the Z-domain by recursive formula. In whatever form the <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> appears, {{it is important that}} it not only predicts the collected field data, but also models how the data is generated. Thus, the <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> by Cooke and Schneider (1983) can only be used to invert CMP data since the model invariably assumes no spreading loss by mimicking the response of a laterally homogeneous earth to a plane-wave source ...|$|E

50|$|The {{deterministic}} {{nature of}} linear inversion requires a functional relationship which models, {{in terms of}} the earth model parameters, the seismic variable to be inverted. This functional relationship is some mathematical model derived from the fundamental laws of physics and is more often called a <b>forward</b> <b>model.</b> The aim of the technique is to minimize a function which is dependent on the difference between the convolution of the <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> with a source wavelet and the field collected seismic trace. As in the field of optimization, this function to be minimized is called the objective function and in convectional inverse modeling, is simply the difference between the convolved <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> and the seismic trace. As earlier mentioned, different types of variables can be inverted for but for clarity, these variables will be referred to as the impedance series of the earth model. In the following subsections we will describe in more detail, in the context of linear inversion as a minimization problem, the different components that are necessary to invert seismic data.|$|E

40|$|Robots {{that operate}} in human environments can learn motor skills asocially, from self-exploration, or socially, from imitating their peers. A robot {{capable of doing}} both can be more {{adaptive}} and autonomous. Learning by imitation, however, requires the ability to understand the actions of others {{in terms of your}} own motor system: this information can come from a robot's own exploration. This thesis investigates the minimal requirements for a robotic system that learns from both self-exploration and imitation of others. Through self-exploration and computer vision techniques, a robot can develop <b>forward</b> models: internal <b>models</b> of its own motor system that enable it to predict the consequences of its actions. Multiple <b>forward</b> <b>models</b> are learnt that give the robot a distributed, causal representation of its motor system. It is demonstrated how a controlled increase in the complexity of these <b>forward</b> <b>models</b> speeds up the robot's learning. The robot can determine the uncertainty of its <b>forward</b> <b>models,</b> enabling it to explore so as to improve the accuracy of its predictions. Paying attention to the <b>forward</b> <b>models</b> according to how their uncertainty is changing leads to a development in the robot's exploration: its interventions focus on increasingly difficult situations, adapting to the complexity of its motor system. A robot can invert <b>forward</b> <b>models,</b> creating inverse models, in order to estimate the actions that will achieve a desired goal. Switching to social learning, the robot uses these inverse models to imitate both a demonstrator's gestures and the underlying goals of their movement.
