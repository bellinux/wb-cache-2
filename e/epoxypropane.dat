The calculated results show that cyclopropenylidene can insert into oxirane at its CO bond and into <b>epoxypropane</b> at its CO or CC bond. From the kinetic viewpoint, it is easier for cyclopropenylidene to insert into the CO bond of oxirane than that of the CO bond of <b>epoxypropane.</b> For insertion into <b>epoxypropane,</b> it is easier for cyclopropenylidene to insert into its CO bond than CC bond. Through the first insertion step and the second ring-opened step, spiro and carbene intermediates can been formed between cyclopropenylidene and epoxy compounds, respectively. Through the following two H-transfer steps, carbene intermediate forms the products of allenes and alkynes, respectively. From the thermodynamics viewpoint, the allenes are the dominant product for the title reaction...|$|E
40|$|<b>Epoxypropane</b> {{isomerase}} from Xanthobacter Py 2 {{has been}} resolved into {{at least two}} components (A and B) by ion-exchange chromatography. Both components were required for the degradation of <b>epoxypropane</b> and were purified further. Component A was apparently homohexameric with a subunit M(r) of about 44, 000, and possessed NAD(+) -dependent dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase activity and lipoamide reductase activity. It was sensitive to inhibition by o-phenanthroline and the thiol-specific reagents N-ethylmaleimide(NEM) and p-chloromercuribenzoate. Component B was homodimeric with a subunit M(r), of 62, 170 and contained 2 mol. mol- 1 FAD. It had an NADPH-dependent lipoamide reductase activity which was sensitive to NEM and p-chloromercuribenzoate. The N-terminal amino acid sequences and monomer sizes of components A and B correspond to those of ORF 1 and ORF 3 respectively (ORF = open reading frame) of a recently published sequence of a clone which complements mutants unable to degrade <b>epoxypropane.</b> NADPH was found to replace {{the need for a}} low-M(r), fraction in <b>epoxypropane</b> degradation assays containing components A and B and NAD+. The predicted amino acid sequence of component A (ORF 1) has been analysed and shown to contain a potential ADP binding site near the N-terminus and putative cofactor binding domain near the C-terminus, with sequence similarity to the biotinyl and lipoyl binding domains of biotin-dependent carboxylases and 2 -oxoacid dehydrogenases respectively.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of aliphatic epoxides (epoxyalkanes) by the alkene-utilizing actinomycete Nocardia corallina B 276 was investigated. Suspensions of N. corallina cells grown with propylene as {{the carbon}} source readily degraded propylene and <b>epoxypropane,</b> while suspensions of glucose-grown cells did not. The addition of propylene and <b>epoxypropane</b> to glucose-grown cells {{resulted in a}} time-dependent increase in propylene- and epoxypropane-degrading activities that was prevented {{by the addition of}} rifampin and chloramphenicol. The expression of alkene- and epoxide-degrading activities was correlated with the high-level expression of several polypeptides not present in extracts of glucose-grown cells. <b>Epoxypropane</b> and epoxybutane degradation by propylene-grown cell suspensions of N. corallina was stimulated by the addition of CO 2 and inhibited by the depletion of CO 2. Cell extracts catalyzed the carboxylation of <b>epoxypropane</b> to form acetoacetate in a reaction that was dependent on the addition of CO 2, NAD+, and a reductant (NADPH or dithiothreitol). In the absence of CO 2, <b>epoxypropane</b> was isomerized by cell extracts to form acetone at a rate approximately 10 -fold lower than the rate of <b>epoxypropane</b> carboxylation. Methylepoxypropane was found to be a time-dependent, irreversible inactivator of epoxyalkane-degrading activity. These properties demonstrate that epoxyalkane metabolism in N. corallina occurs by a carboxylation reaction forming β-keto acids as products and provide evidence for the involvement in this reaction of an epoxide carboxylase with properties and cofactor requirements {{similar to those of the}} four-component epoxide carboxylase enzyme system of the gram-negative bacterium Xanthobacter strain Py 2 (J. R. Allen and S. A. Ensign, J. Biol. Chem. 272 : 32121 – 32128, 1997). The addition of epoxide carboxylase component I from Xanthobacter strain Py 2 to methylepoxypropane-inactivated N. corallina extracts restored epoxide carboxylase activity, and the addition of epoxide carboxylase component II from Xanthobacter Py 2 to active N. corallina extracts stimulated epoxide isomerase rates to the same levels observed with the purified Xanthobacter system. Antibodies raised against Xanthobacter strain Py 2 epoxide carboxylase component I cross-reacted with a polypeptide in propylene-grown N. corallina extracts with the same molecular weight as component I but did not cross-react with glucose-grown extracts. Together, these results suggest a common pathway of epoxyalkane metabolism for phylogenetically distinct bacteria that involves CO 2 fixation and the activity of a multicomponent epoxide carboxylase enzyme system...|$|E

In the present work the CoM analog 2 -bromoethanesulfonate (BES) was {{shown to be a}} specific inhibitor of propylene-dependent growth of and <b>epoxypropane</b> metabolism by Xanthobacter autotrophicus strain Py 2. BES (at low [millimolar] concentrations) completely prevented growth with propylene but had no effect on growth with acetone or n-propanol. Propylene consumption by cells was largely unaffected by the presence of BES, but <b>epoxypropane</b> accumulated in the medium in a time-dependent fashion with BES present. The addition of BES to cells resulted in time-dependent loss of <b>epoxypropane</b> degradation activity that was restored upon removal of BES and addition of CoM. Exposure of cells to BES resulted in a loss of epoxypropane-dependent CO 2 fixation activity that was restored only upon synthesis of new protein. Addition of BES to cell extracts resulted in an irreversible loss of epoxide carboxylase activity that was restored by addition of purified 2 -ketopropyl-CoM carboxylase/oxidoreductase (2 -KPCC), the terminal enzyme of epoxide carboxylation, but not by addition of epoxyalkane:CoM transferase or 2 -hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase, the enzymes which catalyze the first two reactions of epoxide carboxylation. Comparative studies of the propylene-oxidizing actinomycete Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain B 276 showed that BES is an inhibitor of propylene-dependent growth in this organism as well but is not an inhibitor of CoM-independent growth with propane. These results suggest that BES inhibits propylene-dependent growth and epoxide metabolism via irreversible inactivation of the key CO 2 -fixing enzyme 2 -KPCC...|$|E

40|$|A novel enzymatic {{reaction}} {{involved in}} the metabolism of aliphatic epoxides by Xanthobacter strain Py 2 is described. Cell extracts catalyzed the CO 2 -dependent carboxylation of propylene oxide (<b>epoxypropane)</b> to form acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

Analogous C 5 carboxylation products were identified with 1, 2 -epoxybutane as the substrate. In the absence of CO 2, propylene oxide and 1, 2 -epoxybutane were isomerized to form acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, respectively, as dead-end products.

40|$|Chiral {{discrimination}} {{with high}} harmonic generation (cHHG method) {{has been introduced}} in the recent work by R. Cireasa et al (Nat. Phys. 11, 654 - 658, 2015). In its original implementation, the cHHG method works by detecting high harmonic emission from randomly oriented ensemble of chiral molecules driven by elliptically polarized field, {{as a function of}} ellipticity. Here we discuss future perspectives in the development of this novel method, the ways of increasing chiral dichroism using tailored laser pulses, new detection schemes involving high harmonic phase measurements, and concentration-independent approaches. Using the example of the <b>epoxypropane</b> molecule C$_ 3 $H$_ 6 $O (also known as 1, 2 -propylene oxide), we show theoretically that application of two-color counter-rotating elliptically polarized laser fields yields an order of magnitude enhancement of chiral dichroism compared to single color elliptical fields. We also describe how one can introduce a new functionality to cHHG: concentration-independent measurement of the enatiomeric excess in a mixture of randomly oriented left-handed and right-handed molecules. Finally, for arbitrary configurations of laser fields, we connect the observables of the cHHG method to the amplitude and phase of chiral response, providing a basis for reconstructing wide range of chiral dynamics from cHHG measurements, with femtosecond to sub-femtosecond temporal resolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} metabolism of short-chain aliphatic alkenes occurs via oxidation to epoxyalkanes followed by carboxylation to β-ketoacids. Epoxyalkane carboxylation requires four enzymes (components I–IV), NADPH, NAD+, and a previously unidentified nucleophilic thiol. In the present work, coenzyme M (2 -mercaptoethanesulfonic acid), a compound previously {{found only in}} the methanogenic Archaea where {{it serves as a}} methyl group carrier and activator, has been identified as the thiol and central cofactor of aliphatic epoxide carboxylation in the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthobacter strain Py 2. Component I catalyzed the addition of coenzyme M to <b>epoxypropane</b> to form a β-hydroxythioether, 2 -(2 -hydroxypropylthio) ethanesulfonate. Components III and IV catalyzed the NAD+-dependent stereoselective dehydrogenation of R- and S-enantiomers of 2 -(2 -hydroxypropylthio) ethanesulfonate to form 2 -(2 -ketopropylthio) ethanesulfonate. Component II catalyzed the NADPH-dependent cleavage and carboxylation of the β-ketothioether to form acetoacetate and coenzyme M. These findings evince a newfound versatility for coenzyme M as a carrier and activator of alkyl groups longer in chain-length than methane, a function for coenzyme M in a catabolic pathway of hydrocarbon oxidation, and the presence of coenzyme M in the bacterial domain of the phylogenetic tree. These results serve to unify bacterial and Archaeal metabolism further and showcase diverse biological functions for an elegantly simple organic molecule...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Coenzyme M (2 -mercaptoethanesulfonate; CoM) is one {{of several}} {{atypical}} cofactors discovered in methanogenic archaea which participate in the biological reduction of CO 2 to methane. Elegantly simple, CoM, so named for its role as a methyl carrier in all methanogenic archaea, is the smallest known organic cofactor. It was thought that this cofactor was used exclusively in methanogenesis until it was recently discovered that CoM is a key cofactor in the pathway of propylene metabolism in the gram-negative soil microorganism Xanthobacter autotrophicus Py 2. A four-step pathway requiring CoM converts propylene and CO 2 to acetoacetate, which feeds into central metabolism. In this process, CoM is used to activate and convert highly electrophilic <b>epoxypropane,</b> formed from propylene epoxidation, into a nucleophilic species that undergoes carboxylation. The unique properties of CoM provide a chemical handle for orienting compounds for site-specific redox chemistry and stereospecific catalysis. The three-dimensional structures of several of the enzymes in the pathway of propylene metabolism in defined states have been determined, providing significant insights into both the enzyme mechanisms and the role of CoM in this pathway. These studies provide the structural basis for understanding the efficacy of CoM as a handle to direct organic substrate transformations at the active sites of enzymes...|$|E

Isoprene-grown cells also degraded cis- 1, 2 - dichloroepoxyethane and trans- 1, 2 -dichloroepoxyethane. All organic chlorine was liberated as chloride during degradation of cis- 1, 2 -dichloroepoxyethane, A glutathione (GSH) -dependent activity towards 3, 4 -epoxy- 3 -methyl- 1 -butene, <b>epoxypropane,</b> cis- 1, 2 -dichloroepoxyethane, and trans- 1, 2 -dichloroepoxyethane was detected in cell extracts of cultures grown on isoprene and 3, 4 -epoxy- 3 - methyl- 1 -butene.

The catabolic pathway of alkene assimilation in mycobacteria is not well characterized. It {{is clear that the}} initial step is a monooxygenase-mediated epoxidation that produces epoxyethane from ethene and chlorooxirane from VC, but the enzymes involved in subsequent transformation of the epoxides have not been identified. We investigated epoxyethane metabolism in Mycobacterium strain JS 60 and discovered a coenzyme M (CoM) -dependent enzyme activity in extracts from VC- and ethene-grown cells. PCR amplifications using primers targeted at epoxyalkane:CoM transferase (EaCoMT) genes yielded part of the JS 60 EaCoMT gene, which was used to clone an 8. 4 -kb genomic DNA fragment. The complete EaCoMT gene (etnE) was recovered, along with genes (etnABCD) encoding a four-component monooxygenase and two genes possibly involved in acyl-CoA ester metabolism. Reverse transcription-PCR indicated that the etnE and etnA genes were cotranscribed and inducible by ethene and VC. Heterologous expression of the etnE gene in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc 2155 using the pMV 261 vector gave a recombinant strain capable of transforming epoxyethane, <b>epoxypropane,</b> and chlorooxirane. A metabolite identified by mass spectrometry as 2 -hydroxyethyl-CoM was produced from epoxyethane. The results indicate that the EaCoMT and monooxygenase enzymes encoded by a single operon (etnEABCD) catalyze the initial reactions in both the VC and ethene assimilation pathways.

40|$|Alkene monooxygenase (AMO) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous (formerly Nocardia corallina) B- 276 {{belongs to}} a family of {{multicomponent}} nonheme binuclear iron-centre oxygenases that includes the soluble methane monooxygenases (sMMOs) found in some methane-oxidizing bacteria. The enzymes catalyse the insertion of oxygen into organic substrates (mostly hydrocarbons) {{at the expense of}} O- 2 and NAD(P) H. AMO is remarkable in its ability to oxidize low molecular-mass alkenes to their corresponding epoxides with high enantiomeric excess. sMMO and other well-characterized homologues of AMO exhibit two adventitious activities: (1) turnover-dependent inhibition by alkynes and (2) activation by hydrogen peroxide in lieu of oxygen and NAD(P) H (the peroxide shunt reaction). Previous studies of the AMO had failed to detect these activities and opened the possibility that the mechanism of AMO might be fundamentally different from that of its homologues. Thanks to improvements in the protocols for cultivation of R. rhodochrous B- 276 and purification and assay of AMO, it has been possible to detect and characterize turnover-dependent inhibition of AMO by propyne and ethyne and activation of the enzyme by hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate a similar mechanism to that found in sMMO and also, unexpectedly, that the enantiomeric excess of the chiral <b>epoxypropane</b> product is significantly reduced during the peroxide shunt reaction. Inhibition of the oxygen/NADH-activated reaction, but not the peroxide shunt, by covalent modification of positively charged groups revealed an additional similarity to sMMO and may indicate very similar patterns of intersubunit interactions and/or electron transfer in both enzyme complexes...|$|E

In the present work, the CoM analog 2 -bromoethanesulfonate (BES) is {{shown to be a}} reversible inhibitor of 2 -KPCC and hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase but not of epoxyalkane:CoM transferase. Further investigations revealed that BES is a time-dependent inactivator of dithiothreitol-reduced 2 -KPCC, where the redox active cysteines are in the free thiol forms. BES did not inactivate air-oxidized 2 -KPCC, where the redox active cysteine pair is in the disulfide form. The inactivation of 2 -KPCC exhibited saturation kinetics, and CoM slowed the rate of inactivation. Mass spectral analysis demonstrated that BES inactivation of reduced 2 -KPCC occurs with covalent modification of the interchange thiol (Cys 82) by a group with a molecular mass identical to that of ethylsulfonate. The flavin thiol Cys 87 was not alkylated by BES under reducing conditions, and no amino acid residues were modified by BES in the oxidized enzyme. The UV-visible spectrum of BES-modifed 2 -KPCC showed the characteristic charge transfer absorbance expected with alkylation at Cys 82. These results identify BES as a reactive CoM analog that specifically alkylates the interchange thiol that facilitates thioether bond cleavage and enolacetone formation during catalysis...|$|E
40|$|Evidence for a {{requirement}} for CO 2 in the productive metabolism of aliphatic alkenes and epoxides by the propylene-oxidizing bacterium Xanthobacter strain Py 2 is presented. In the absence of CO 2, whole-cell suspensions of propylene-grown cells catalyzed the isomerization of propylene oxide (<b>epoxypropane)</b> to acetone. In the presence of CO 2, no acetone was produced. Acetone was not metabolized by suspensions of propylene-grown cells, in either the absence or presence of CO 2. The degradation of propylene and propylene oxide by propylene-grown cells supported the fixation of 14 CO 2 into cell material, and {{the time course of}} 14 C fixation correlated with the time course of propylene and propylene oxide degradation. The degradation of glucose and propionaldehyde by propylene-grown or glucose-grown cells did not support significant 14 CO 2 fixation. With propylene oxide as the substrate, the concentration dependence of 14 CO 2 fixation exhibited saturation kinetics, and at saturation, 0. 9 mol of CO 2 was fixed per mol of propylene oxide consumed. Cultures grown with propylene in a nitrogen-deficient medium supplemented with NaH 13 CO 3 specifically incorporated 13 C label into the C- 1 (major labeled position) and C- 3 (minor labeled position) carbon atoms of the endogenous storage compound poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate. No specific label incorporation was observed when cells were cultured with glucose or n-propanol as a carbon source. The depletion of CO 2 from cultures grown with propylene, but not glucose or n-propanol, inhibited bacterial growth. We propose that propylene oxide metabolism in Xanthobacter strain Py 2 proceeds by terminal carboxylation of an isomerization intermediate, which, in the absence of CO 2, is released as acetone...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} metabolism of propylene proceeds by epoxidation to <b>epoxypropane</b> {{followed by a}} sequence of three reactions resulting in epoxide ring opening and carboxylation to form acetoacetate. Coenzyme M (2 -mercaptoethanesulfonic acid) (CoM) plays {{a central role in}} epoxide carboxylation by serving as the nucleophile for epoxide ring opening and the carrier of the C 3 unit that is ultimately carboxylated to acetoacetate, releasing CoM. In the present work, a 320 -kb linear megaplasmid has been identified in the gram-negative bacterium Xanthobacter strain Py 2, which contains the genes encoding the key enzymes of propylene oxidation and epoxide carboxylation. Repeated subculturing of Xanthobacter strain Py 2 under nonselective conditions, i. e., with glucose or acetate as the carbon source in the absence of propylene, resulted in the loss of the propylene-positive phenotype. The propylene-negative phenotype correlated with the loss of the 320 -kb linear megaplasmid, loss of induction and expression of alkene monooxgenase and epoxide carboxylation enzyme activities, and the loss of CoM biosynthetic capability. Sequence analysis of a hypothetical protein (XecG), encoded by a gene located downstream of the genes for the four enzymes of epoxide carboxylation, revealed a high degree of sequence identity with proteins of as-yet unassigned functions in the methanogenic archaea Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and Methanococcus jannaschii and in Bacillus subtilis. The M. jannaschii homolog of XecG, MJ 0255, is located next to a gene, MJ 0256, that has been shown to encode a key enzyme of CoM biosynthesis (M. Graupner, H. Xu, and R. H. White, J. Bacteriol. 182 : 4862 – 4867, 2000).

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Butane-grown {{cells of}} Pseudomonas butanovora, Nocardioides sp. CF 8 and Mycobacterium vaccae JOB 5 were tested {{for their ability}} to cooxidize methane, ammonia and ethylene. Less than 10 nmol of methane were {{degraded}} by each of the bacteria (0. 17 - 0. 35 mg protein) in 30 minutes. Hydroxylamine and nitrite accumulated when Nocardioides CF 8 and P. butanovora were incubated with ammonia, while M. vaccae JOB 5 accumulated only nitrite. The butane monooxygenase (BMO) was implicated in the formation of hydroxylamine and possibly nitrite as the presence of acetylene or butane decreased the production of hydroxylamine and nitrite and the addition of butyrate enhanced hydroxylamine and nitrite production. Oxygen was also required for ammonia oxidation. All three strains oxidized ethylene to ethylene oxide. This reaction was inhibited by acetylene and enhanced by butyrate. Production of ethylene oxide in P. butanovora stopped after 20 minutes, while proceeding at a constant rate for 2 hours in M. vaccae and Nocardioides CF 8. Further tests indicated inactivation of butane oxidizing activity by ethylene oxide in P. butanovora. The characteristics of ethylene oxide inactivation of butane monooxygenase (BMO) in P. butanovora were investigated. BMO was found to be irreversibly inactivated by ethylene oxide in a time and concentration dependent manner. Butane protected BMO from inactivation and 0 ₂ was required for inactivation implying turnover was required. Other epoxides were found to inactivate BMO including <b>epoxypropane,</b> 1, 2 -epoxybutane and 1, 2 -epoxyhexane. Cis and trans- 2, 3 -epoxybutane did not inactivate. Other bacterial monooxygenases were tested for sensitivity to ethylene oxide including ammonia monooxygenase in N. europaea, toluene- 2 -monooxygenase in Burkholderia cepacia G 4 and alkane monooxygenases in M. vaccae JOB 5, Nocardioides CF 8 and Pseudomonas oleovorans. Of these, only alkane monooxygenases in Nocardioides sp. CF 8 and M. vaccae JOB 5 exhibited ethylene oxide sensitivity. The results presented here provide strong evidence that ethylene oxide is a mechanism-based inactivator of BMO in P. butanovora...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on {{understanding}} protein function by describing how paralogous proteins with overlapping and distinct functions interact with their substrates and with other proteins. Two model systems {{are the subject of}} this research: (1) the stereospecific dehydrogenases R- and S-HPCDH, and (2) the zinc knuckle proteins Air 1 and Air 2. R- and S-HPCDH are homologous enzymes that are central to the metabolism of propylene and epoxide in the soil bacterium Xanthobacter autotrophicus. The bacterium produces R- and S-HPCDH simultaneously to facilitate transformation of R- and S-enantiomers of <b>epoxypropane</b> to a common achiral product 2 -ketopropyl-CoM (2 -KPC). Both R- and S-HPCDH are highly stereospecific for their respective substrates as each enzyme displays less than 0. 5 % activity with the opposite substrate isomer. Presented here are substrate-bound x-ray crystal structures of S-HPCDH. Comparisons to the previously reported product-bound structure of R-HPCDH reveal structural differences that provide each enzyme with a distinct substrate binding pocket. These structures demonstrate how chiral discrimination by R- and S-HPCDH results from alternative binding of the distal end of substrates within each substrate binding pocket, providing a structural basis for stereospecificity displayed by R- and S-HPCDH. Air 1 and Air 2 are homologous eukaryotic proteins that individually function within a trimeric protein complex called TRAMP. In the nucleus, TRAMP participates in RNA surveillance, processing, and turnover by stimulating the 3 ’- 5 ’ exonucleolytic degradation of targeted RNAs by the nuclear exosome. Previous studies have indicated that within TRAMP Air 1 and Air 2 provide crucial protein-protein interactions that link the individual subunits of the complex. However, the mechanistic details of these protein-protein interactions are poorly understood. The work in this dissertation has characterized a previously unknown binding interface between Air 2 and another TRAMP component, the helicase Mtr 4. This interaction may explain how helicase activity is modulated in TRAMP. In addition to TRAMP protein interactions, preliminary studies have identified a small region of Air 1 that is required for modulating the activity of a protein that is not found in TRAMP, the methyltransferase Hmt 1. Collectively, these studies provide important characterization of Air 1 and Air 2 protein-binding interactions, and establish a foundation for future research efforts aimed at exploring Air protein function...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of propylene in Xanthobacter autotrophicus occurs via <b>epoxypropane</b> {{formation and}} subsequent metabolism by a three-step, four-enzyme pathway, utilizing the atypical cofactor Coenzyme M (CoM) to form acetoacetate. The last {{step in the}} epoxide carboxylase pathway is catalyzed by a distinctive member of the disulfide oxidoreductase (DSOR) family of enzymes, NADPH: 2 -ketopropyl CoM oxidoreductase/carboxylase (2 -KPCC). 2 -KPCC catalyzes the unorthodox cleavage of a thioether bond and successive carboxylation of the substrate. The focus of the research presented in this dissertation aims to elucidate the details of 2 -KPCC that allow it to perform chemistry unconventional for typical DSOR members. Sitedirected mutagenesis was used to mutate specific active site residues and to examine the catalytic properties of 2 -KPCC upon these changes. Mutation of His 137, the proximal histidine that directly coordinates the water molecule, eliminated essentially all redox-dependent activity of the enzyme while mutation of His 84, the distal histidine that coordinates the water molecule through His 137, diminished redoxdependent enzymatic activity to approximately 25 % that of the wild type enzyme, confirming the respective roles of the histidine residues in stabilizing the enolate intermediate formed upon catalysis. Neither mutation of either histidine residue, nor mutation of either redox active cysteine residue had any {{negative effect on the}} rate of the redox-independent reaction catalyzed by 2 -KPCC, the decarboxylation of acetoacetate. Mutation of Met 140 resulted in an enzyme with drastically altered kinetic parameters and suggests Met 140 plays a role in shielding the substrate from undesired electrostatic interactions with the surroundings. The inhibitory properties of the structural CoM analogs, 2 - bromoethanesulfonate (BES) and 3 -bromopropanesulfonate (BPS), were examined and exploited to provide further detail on the active site microenvironment of 2 - KPCC. Modification by BES results in a charge transfer complex between the thiolate of Cys 87 and the oxidized flavin. The spectral features of this charge transfer complex have allowed the determination of the pKa of the Cys 87 to be significantly higher than the flavin thiol in other DSOR enzymes. BPS {{has been shown to be}} a competitive inhibitor of 2 -KPCC with an inhibition constant over two orders of magnitude lower than for that of BES...|$|E
40|$|Methane gas is {{produced}} from many natural and anthropogenic sources. As such, methane gas plays {{a significant role}} in the Earth's climate, being 25 times more effective as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. As with nearly all other naturally produced organic molecules on Earth, there are also microorganisms capable of using methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. The microbes responsible (methanotrophs) are ubiquitous and, for the most part, aerobic. Although anaerobic methanotrophs are believed to exist, so far, none have been isolated in pure culture. Methanotrophs have been known to exist for over 100 years; however, it is only in the last 30 years that we have begun to understand their physiology and biochemistry. Their unique ability to use methane for growth is attributed to the presence of a multicomponent enzyme system-methane monooxygenase (MMO) -which has two distinct forms: soluble (sMMO) and membrane-associated (pMMO); however, both convert methane into the readily assimilable product, methanol. Our understanding of how bacteria are capable of effecting one of the most difficult reactions in chemistry-namely, the controlled oxidation of methane to methanol-has been made possible by the isolation, in pure form, of the enzyme components. The mechanism by which methane is activated by sMMO involves abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by a high-valence iron species (Fe-IV or possibly Fe-V) in the hydroxylase component of the MMO complex to form a methyl radical. The radical combines with a captive oxygen atom from dioxygen to form the reaction product, methanol, which is further metabolized by the cell to produce multicarbon intermediates. Regulation of the sMMO system relies on the remarkable properties of an effector protein, protein B. This protein is capable of facilitating component interactions in the presence of substrate, modifying the redox potential of the diiron species at the active site. These interactions permit access of substrates to the hydroxylase, coupling electron transfer by the reductase with substrate oxidation and affecting the rate and regioselectivity of the overall reaction. The membrane-associated form is less well researched than the soluble enzyme, but is known to contain copper at the active site and probably iron. From an applied perspective, methanotrophs have enjoyed variable successes. Whole cells have been used as a source of single-cell protein (SCP) since the 1970 s, and although most plants have been mothballed, there is still one currently in production. Our earlier observations that sMMO was capable of inserting an oxygen atom from dioxygen into a wide variety of hydrocarbon (and some non-hydrocarbon) substrates has been exploited to either produce value added products (e. g. <b>epoxypropane</b> from propene), or in the bioremediation of pollutants such as chlorinated hydrocarbons. Because we have shown that it is now possible to drive the reaction using electricity instead of expensive chemicals, there is promise that the system could be exploited as a sensor for any of the substrates of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{discusses the}} combined use of {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) spectroscopy, electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate a number of transition metal catalyst systems the binding of epoxide molecules by a vanadyl analogue of the catalytically important metallosalen class of compounds the binding of a chiral aryl amine by a copper salen complex and the incorporation of copper(II) ions in aluminophosphate materials. Two classes of epoxide selectivity by a vanadyl salen derivative are presented here, the discrimination of the geometric isomers of 2, 3 -epoxybutane, cw- 2, 3 -epoxybutane and /ra 5 - 2, 3 -epoxybutane by Ar,Ar'-bis(3, 5 -di-tert-butylsalicylidene) -l, 2 -diaminocyclohexa- ne-vanadium(IV) oxide (VO(l)) 1 and the stereoselectivity of <b>epoxypropane,</b> 1, 2 - epoxybutane, chloromethyloxirane and fluoromethyloxirane by VO(l). In both cases it is shown that hydrogen-bonding interactions, including interactions between the epoxide oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom bonded to a stereocentre carbon atom of the complex are important in determining the binding mode, thus implicating the given stereocentre carbon atom in the transfer of chirality. In the geometric isomerism of 2, 3 -epoxybutane, steric arguments regarding the obstruction caused by the methyl groups {{made on the basis}} of the DFT structures explain the selectivity observed in the EPR/ENDOR spectra. In the chiral selectivity of the other epoxides, more complicated reasoning, based on tripodal weak hydrogen-bonding configurations involving the hydrogen atoms of the epoxide ring and the oxygen atoms of the complex ligand is required to fully explain the selectivity observed, with different selectivity effects in the more electronegative halogenated epoxides compared to the alkyl cases. The coordination of methyl benzyl amine to a series of analogues of Cu(l) with various levels of tert-butylation, to model the steric effects in this interaction is studied here using DFT methods to explain the coordination preference for heterochiral pairings observed in the EPR spectra. Reasoning based on the preference of each enantiomer of the MBA to become involved in % - n interaction with alternate benzene rings of the complex, along with a slightly increased crowding of one ring over the other caused by the same hydrogen atom as implicated in determining selectivity in the epoxide study (above), namely the hydrogen atom bonded to one of the stereocentre C atoms, explains the selectivity observed in terms of n n interactions, also identifying the role of the stereocentre C atoms in conferring chirality. In combination, these studies demonstrate the importance of weak interactions, namely hydrogen-bonding andn-n interactions, in determining the binding configurations, and by extension the selectivity of these transition metal complexes. They also describe the nature of the involvement of the stereocentres of the complex in directing that selectivity, delineating a link between the chirality of the complex and that of the bound species in each case. The importance of using both EPR/ENDOR and DFT techniques in such studies, namely of explaining selectivity observed by EPR in terms of ENDOR and DFT derived geometry parameters is further explored in this thesis in the development of genetic algorithm routines to modify DFT-derived structures, by means of the ENDOR spectra simulated with the hyperfine parameters derived from a simple point-dipole model applied to the coordinates. The application of this process to a sample axial system, VO(acac) 2, demonstrates the effectiveness of exploiting the complementary nature of the ENDOR and DFT techniques in this manner. Finally, a second copper study is reported here. This example is of a microporous aluminophosphate material, and concerns the incorporation of Cu 11 ions into framework vs. extra-framework sites, a subject of some controversy. Here, evidence is presented for the ability of copper to distort the tetrahedral lattice into a distorted octahedral and a square- based pyramidal environment in which one or both of the remaining coordination sites is/are occupied by the templating molecules and water molecules, without rendering the lattice unstable, arguing in favour of framework site incorporation.
