40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the efficiency of the flow-wrap packaging process in soap industry through the reduction of <b>defectives.</b> At the 95 % confidence level, with the regression analysis, the sealing temperature, temperatures of upper and lower crimper are found to be the significant factors for the flow-wrap process with respect to the number/percentage of <b>defectives.</b> Twenty seven experiments have been designed and performed according to three levels of each controllable factor. With the general linear model (GLM), the suggested values for the sealing temperature, temperatures of upper and lower crimpers are 185, 85 and 85 ๐ C, respectively. Under the suggested process condition, the percentage of <b>defectives</b> is reduced from 12. 47 % to 5. 51 % and at the significant level of 5 %, the percentage of <b>defectives</b> is between 5. 05 % and 5. 98 %.

30|$|Note that as {{discussed}} in Theorem 5, the score function for the classical model is equivalent to simply checking whether some subset of c items matches the test results, i.e., whether these would indeed have been the test results, had this subset been the set of <b>defectives.</b> With high probability, only the correct set of <b>defectives</b> passes this test.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} ways we can extend the problem of group testing. One of the most {{important}} is called noisy group testing, and deals with a big assumption of the original problem: that testing is error-free. We say that a group-testing problem is noisy when there is some chance that the result of a group test is erroneous (e.g. comes out positive when the test contained no <b>defectives).</b> The Bernoulli noise model assumes this probability is some constant, , but in general it can depend on the true number of <b>defectives</b> in the test and the number of items tested. For example, we may model the effect of dilution by saying a positive result is more likely when there are more <b>defectives</b> (or more <b>defectives</b> as a fraction of the number tested), present in the test. A noisy algorithm will always have a non-zero probability of making an error (that is, mislabeling an item).|$|R
5|$|The <b>Defective</b> Premises Act 1972 (c. 35) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} landlords' and builders' {{liability}} for poorly constructed and poorly maintained buildings, {{along with any}} injuries that may result. During the 19th century, the common law principle that a landlord could not be liable for letting a poorly maintained house was established, while a long-running principle was that, in practice, builders could not be sued for constructing <b>defective</b> buildings. The courts began to turn against the first principle during the 20th century, imposing several restrictions on the landlord's immunity, but the landlord was still largely free from being sued.|$|E
5|$|Barnard's Inn, {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an Inn of Chancery.

When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a <b>defective</b> word, a farthing for a <b>defective</b> syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E
