5|$|The {{extent of}} the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> fairly varies greatly from case to case. Basic norms of {{fairness}} {{in the conduct of}} disciplinary proceedings need to be observed more strictly where the vocational future of a person is at stake, where there is an express duty on an association to make a decision only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry, and where the exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a penalty on him or her.|$|E
25|$|A {{person is}} barred from {{deciding}} any {{case in which}} he or she may be, or may fairly be suspected to be, biased. This principle embodies the basic concept of impartiality, and applies to courts of law, tribunals, arbitrators and all those having the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> judicially. A public authority has a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> judicially whenever it makes decisions that affect people's rights or interests, and not only when it applies some judicial-type procedure in arriving at decisions.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirements}} of natural justice or a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> fairly {{depend on the}} context. In Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999), the Supreme Court of Canada set out a list of non-exhaustive factors that would influence {{the content of the}} duty of fairness, including the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the statutory scheme under which the decision-maker operates, the importance of the decision to the person challenging it, the person's legitimate expectations, and the choice of procedure made by the decision-maker. Earlier, in Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19 (1990), the Supreme Court held that public authorities which make decisions of a legislative and general nature do not have a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> fairly, while those that carry out acts of a more administrative and specific nature do. Furthermore, preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> fairly, but decisions of a more final nature may have such an effect. In addition, whether a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> fairly applies depends on the relationship between the public authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause. Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority's decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual.|$|E

25|$|The Second Amendment {{was based}} {{partially}} {{on the right}} {{to keep and bear arms}} in English common law and was influenced by the English Bill of Rights of 1689.

25|$|The duty of {{good faith}} {{requires}} control persons to exercise care and prudence in making business decisions—that is, the care that a {{reasonably prudent person}} in a similar position would use under similar circumstances. Control persons fail to act in good faith, even if their actions are not illegal, when they take actions for improper purposes or, in certain circumstances, when their actions have grossly inequitable results. The <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in good faith is an obligation not only to make decisions free from self-interest, but also free of any interest that diverts the control persons from acting {{in the best interest}} of the company. The <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in good faith may be measured by an individual's particular knowledge and expertise. The higher the level of expertise, the more accountable that person will be (e.g., a finance expert may be held to a more exacting standard than others in accepting a third party valuation).|$|E

25|$|The rule of {{fair hearing}} {{is the other}} of the two pillars of natural justice. It is {{encapsulated}} in the Latin maxim audi alteram partem, which implies that everyone {{has a right to}} be heard and that none ought therefore to be condemned unheard. This principle must be observed by courts, tribunals, arbitrators and all persons or bodies having the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> judicially, save where their application is excluded expressly or by necessary implication. The need for fair hearing is important as it forms a part of good procedure by reflecting a universal sense of fair play.|$|E
25|$|In {{the common}} law of England and Wales there is no {{criminal}} liability for failing {{to act in the}} event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances where there has been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, or there is a contractual or statutory <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action. The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue and English law makes provision for the actions of 'good Samaritans,' unless their actions were grossly negligent or made a situation worse.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, the {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation has been viewed as an offshoot of natural justice. The <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> fairly is a core tenet of administrative law and a predominant feature {{in the application of}} the rules of natural justice. With each individual's entitlement to natural justice and fairness, legitimate expectation reinforces the duty of public bodies to act fairly. It is this protection of fairness that made way for the courts' acknowledgement of legitimate expectations. In their elaboration of {{the doctrine}}, courts of the United Kingdom adopted other key aspects of judicial review such as Wednesbury unreasonableness, fairness, and abuse of power to justify the existence and the protection of legitimate expectations.|$|E

25|$|In some jurisdictions, good Samaritan laws only {{protect those}} who have {{completed}} basic first aid training and are certified by health organizations, such as the American Heart Association, or American Red Cross, provided that they have acted {{within the scope of}} their training. In these jurisdictions, a person who is neither trained in first aid nor certified, and who performs first aid incorrectly, can be held legally liable for errors made. In other jurisdictions any rescuer is protected from liability so long as the responder acted rationally. In Florida, paramedics, EMTs, and Emergency Medical Responders (First Responders) are required by law to act under the <b>Duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>Act</b> law, which requires them to stop and give aid that falls within their practice.|$|E
25|$|Luther {{made his}} pronouncements from Wartburg {{in the context}} of rapid {{developments}} at Wittenberg, of which he was kept fully informed. Andreas Karlstadt, supported by the ex-Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling, embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521, exceeding anything envisaged by Luther. The reforms provoked disturbances, including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior, the smashing of statues and images in churches, and denunciations of the magistracy. After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521, Luther wrote A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion. Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots, the so-called Zwickau prophets, arrived, preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man, adult baptism, and Christ's imminent return. When the town council asked Luther to return, he decided it was his <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{basic duty}} of the {{receiver}} was to realise value for the floating charge holder, although all preferential debts, or those with priority, {{would have to be}} paid. For other unsecured creditors, the possibility of recovering money was remote. The floating owed no duty to other creditors with regard to the timing of the appointment of a receiver, even if it could have an effect on negotiations for refinancing the business. It was accepted that a receiver had a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> only for the proper purpose of realising debts, and not for some ulterior motive. In Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd, a company had given floating charges to two banks (Westpac first, and First City Corp second). The directors, wishing to install a friendly figure in control asked Westpac to assign its floating charge to their friend Mr Russell, who proceeded to run the business with further losses of $500,000, and refused to pass control to First City Corp, even though they offered the company discharge of all the money owed under the first debenture. The Privy Council advised that Mr Russell, as administrative receiver, had acted for an improper purpose by refusing this deal. A further case of breach of duty occurred in Medforth v Blake where the administrative receiver of a pig farm ignored the former owner's advice on how to get discounts on pig food of £1000 a week. As a result, larger debts were run up. Sir Richard Scott VC held this was a breach of an equitable duty of exercising due diligence. However, a more general duty to creditors was tightly constrained, and general liability for professional negligence was denied to exist. In Silven Properties Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland a receiver of a property business failed to apply for planning permission on houses that could have significantly raised their value, and did not find tenants for the vacant properties, before selling them. It was alleged that the sales were at an undervalue, but the Court of Appeal held that the receiver's power of sale was exercisable without incurring any undue expense. Everything was subordinate to the duty to the receiver to realise a good price. In this respect, an administrator is not capable of disregarding other creditors, at least in law. One {{of the reasons for the}} partial abolition of administrative receivership was that after the receiver had performed his task of realising assets for the floating charge holder, very little value was left in the company for other creditors because it appeared to have fewer incentives to efficiently balance all creditors' interests. Ordinarily, once the receiver's work was done, the company would go into liquidation.|$|E

500|$|It {{requires}} that the defendant owed a duty of care to the victim (it is for the judge to decide on which facts such a duty would be created). These rules are typically those of tort. For example, in R v Pittwood, the defendant was put under a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on account of being contractually obliged to close the gates at a railway crossing. Similar duties include those of a doctor of his patients, an electrician over a householder he has done work for, parents over their children, and, developed more recently, a police officer over persons he arrests. Included, however, are those of a criminal enterprise, which would not attract tortious liability in the civil law. Where the defendant is liable through an omission and not an act, then a legal <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> – rather than a duty of care – is needed. Andrew Ashworth has criticised {{the nature of the}} duty of care requirement as [...] "decision-making at its retrospective worst".|$|E
500|$|A county Magistrate was {{in charge}} of {{maintaining}} law and order, storing grain in case of famine, registering the populace for taxation, mobilizing conscripted commoners for corvée labor projects, supervising public works, renovating schools, and performing rituals. They were also given the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as judge for all lawsuits brought to the county court. The judicial jurisdictions of the commandery Administrator and county Magistrate overlapped, so it was generally agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first would try him or her.

500|$|Once a {{duty of care}} (or <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> as required) {{has been}} shown, the jury should then be asked, {{following}} Lord Mackay in R v Adamoko: [...] "having regard {{to the risk of}} death involved, [...] the conduct of the defendant... so bad in all the circumstances as to amount to a criminal act or omission". This has two elements: firstly, the breach of the duty of care must relate to the risk of death (confirmed in R v Singh), and not to any lesser harm. In other words, the breach of the duty of care must cause the victim's death. Secondly the breach of the duty of care must be so egregious as to amount to a crime. For example, on the fact of Adomako itself, the defendant, an anaesthetist, failed to spot a problem with the victim's breathing tube for 11 minutes, something expert evidence suggested a competent anaesthetist would spot within thirty seconds or so. The defendant was convicted. This definition has been opposed as being circular, as defining the crime of manslaughter as gross negligence as being negligence to a criminal degree. The jury may, under this characterisation, be ruling upon a point of law and not a point of fact.|$|E
