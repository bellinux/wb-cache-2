5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (<b>hypercoagulability).</b> Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to <b>hypercoagulability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with an increased risk of thrombosis. This probably results from a physiological <b>hypercoagulability</b> in pregnancy that protects against postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|The {{three factors}} of Virchow's triad—venous stasis, <b>hypercoagulability,</b> {{and changes in}} the endothelial blood vessel lining (such as {{physical}} damage or endothelial activation)—contribute to DVT and are used to explain its formation. Other related causes include activation of immune system components, the state of microparticles in the blood, the concentration of oxygen, and possible platelet activation. Various risk factors contribute to DVT, though many at high risk never develop it.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes <b>hypercoagulability</b> or a prothrombotic state) is an {{abnormality}} {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such as deep vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercoagulability</b> in {{pregnancy}} is the propensity {{of pregnant women}} to develop thrombosis (blood clots). Pregnancy itself is a factor of <b>hypercoagulability</b> (pregnancy-induced <b>hypercoagulability),</b> as a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent post partum bleeding. However, in combination with an underlying hypercoagulable states, the risk of thrombosis or embolism may become substantial.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy {{in itself}} causes {{approximately}} a five-fold {{increased risk of}} deep venous thrombosis. Several pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia, cause substantial <b>hypercoagulability.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercoagulability</b> in pregnancy, {{particularly}} due to inheritable thrombophilia, {{can lead}} to placental vascular thrombosis. This can in turn lead to complications like early-onset hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, pre-eclampsia and small for gestational age infants (SGA). Among other causes of <b>hypercoagulability,</b> Antiphospholipid syndrome {{has been associated with}} adverse pregnancy outcomes including recurrent miscarriage. Deep vein thrombosis has an incidence of one in 1,000 to 2,000 pregnancies in the United States, and is the second most common cause of maternal death in developed countries after bleeding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercoagulability</b> or thrombophilia, {{is caused}} by, for example, genetic {{deficiencies}} or autoimmune disorders. Recent {{studies indicate that}} white blood cells play {{a pivotal role in}} deep vein thrombosis, mediating numerous pro-thrombotic actions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercoagulability</b> {{states as}} a {{pre-existing}} condition in pregnancy include both acquired ones, such as antiphospholipid antibodies, and congenital ones, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation, proteins C and S deficiencies, and antithrombin III deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Glomerulonephritis* is the {{presence}} of immune complexes in the glomerulus, resulting in leakage of protein into the urine. It can be caused by cancer, heartworm disease, pyometra, rickettsial infection, or systemic lupus erythematosus. It can result in chronic kidney failure, hypoalbuminemia, which can cause ascites and peripheral edema, and nephrotic syndrome, which can cause hypertension or <b>hypercoagulability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors such}} as toxicants can {{adversely}} impact bone cells. Infections, chronic or acute, can affect blood flow by inducing platelet activation and aggregation, contributing to a localized state of excess coagulability (<b>hypercoagulability)</b> that may contribute to clot formation (thrombosis), a known cause of bone infarct and ischaemia. Exogenous estrogens, also called hormonal disruptors, have been linked with an increased tendency to clot (thrombophilia) and impaired bone healing.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy-induced <b>hypercoagulability</b> is {{probably}} a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent post partum hemorrhage. Pregnancy changes the plasma levels of many clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, which can rise up to three times its normal value. Thrombin levels increase. Protein S, an anticoagulant, decreases. However, the other major anticoagulants, protein C and antithrombin III, remain constant. Fibrinolysis is impaired {{by an increase in}} plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 or PAI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), the latter synthesized from the placenta. Venous stasis may occur {{at the end of the}} first trimester, due to enhanced compliance of the vessel walls by a hormonal effect.|$|E
25|$|An {{international}} registry {{and risk}} assessment calculator {{is being used}} to centralize data on post-surgical venous thrombosis and its prevention. Hospitals are implementing a multi-disciplinary approach to prevent of blood clots. This includes adequate assessment of the risks, follow up on missed doses of medication and instituting a 'patient-centered' approach endorsed by the Joint Commission. Recommendations regarding the prevention of blood clots vary widely between clinicians and treatment facilities. Research continues to clarify these discrepancies. The metabolic state of <b>hypercoagulability</b> (the tendency to form blood clots) tests are being developed. These include the evaluation of the thrombin–antithrombin complexes (TAT), low levels of the anticoagulants ATIII and protein C, but these tests are not yet widely available.|$|E
25|$|Causes of {{disturbed}} {{blood flow}} include stagnation of blood flow {{past the point}} of injury, or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure, or after long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. Also, atrial fibrillation, causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA), or left atrial appendage (LAA), and can lead to a thromboembolism. Cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances (paraneoplastic syndrome), by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins). Also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional <b>hypercoagulability.</b> There are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data (comorbidities, vital signs, and others) to risk of thrombosis, such as the POMPE-C, which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer, who typically have higher rates of thrombosis.|$|E
500|$|In 1856, German {{pathologist}} Rudolf Virchow postulated {{the interplay}} of three processes resulting in venous thrombosis, now known as Virchow's triad: a decreased blood flow rate (venous stasis), increased tendency to clot (<b>hypercoagulability),</b> and changes to the blood vessel wall. DVT formation typically begins inside the valves of the calf veins, where the blood is relatively oxygen deprived, which activates certain biochemical pathways. Several medical conditions increase the risk for DVT, including cancer, trauma, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Other risk factors include older age, surgery, immobilization (as with bed rest, orthopedic casts, and sitting for prolonged periods), combined hormonal birth control, pregnancy, the postnatal period, and genetic factors. Those genetic factors [...] include deficiencies with antithrombin, protein C, and protein S, the mutation of factor V Leiden, and the property of having a non-O blood type.|$|E
2500|$|Also, {{pregnancy}} {{can cause}} <b>hypercoagulability</b> by other factors, e.g. the prolonged bed rest that often occurs post partum {{that occurs in}} case of delivery by forceps, vacuum extractor or Caesarean section.|$|E
2500|$|The CT is the {{latency time}} from adding the start reagent to blood until the clot starts to form. Prolongation of CT {{may be a}} result of {{coagulation}} deficiencies, primarily coagulation factors, or heparin (dependent on the test used). [...] A potential contribution of heparin can be detected by comparing INTEM- with HEPTEM CT data (see “reagents” below). A shortening of CT indicates <b>hypercoagulability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The alpha {{angle is}} {{the angle of}} tangent between 0mm and the curve when the clot {{firmness}} is 20mm, while CFT is the time from CT until a clot firmness of [...] 20mm point has been reached. These parameters denote {{the speed at which}} a solid clot forms and are primarily influenced by platelet function, but to a certain extent especially fibrinogen and coagulation factors contribute. A prolonged CFT (or a lower alpha-angle) is usually caused by poor platelet function, low platelet count, fibrin polymerization disorders or fibrinogen deficiency. Apparently also FXIII seems to be involved already in this phase. Higher concentrations of heparin can also prolong CFT in the INTEM assay, but not in HEPTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM or APTEM (see under “reagents”). A shortening of CFT (or a high alpha-angle) indicate <b>hypercoagulability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dogs become {{infected}} through oral contact with CPV2 in feces, infected soil, or fomites that carry the virus. Following ingestion, the virus replicates in the lymphoid {{tissue in the}} throat, and then spreads to the bloodstream. From there, the virus attacks rapidly dividing cells, notably those in the lymph nodes, intestinal crypts, and the bone marrow. There is depletion of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and necrosis and destruction of the intestinal crypts. Anaerobic bacteria that normally reside in the intestines can then cross into the bloodstream, {{a process known as}} translocation, with [...] bacteremia leading to sepsis. The most common bacteria involved in severe cases are Clostridium, Campylobacter and Salmonella species. This can lead to a syndrome known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS leads to a range of complications such as <b>hypercoagulability</b> of the blood, endotoxaemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bacterial myocarditis has also been reported secondarily to sepsis. Dogs with CPV are at risk of intussusception, a condition where part of the intestine prolapses into another part. Three to four days following infection, the virus is shed in the feces for up to three weeks, and the dog may remain an asymptomatic carrier and shed the virus periodically. The virus is usually more deadly if the host is concurrently infested with worms or other intestinal parasites.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hypercoagulability</b> is an {{abnormality}} of {{the blood}} that {{increases the risk of}} the formation blood clots. Nephrotic syndrome patients have a higher risk of RVT development due to <b>hypercoagulability</b> caused by proteinuria. The increased loss of proteins in the urine caused by nephrotic syndrome results in lower osmotic pressure. Reduced osmotic pressure will trigger the liver to produce more proteins like fibrinogen and beta-thromboglobulin, which promote blood clotting. Other than nephrotic syndrome, there are many other factors that can promote <b>hypercoagulability.</b> <b>Hypercoagulability</b> can be promoted by increased platelet count, enhanced platelet aggregation, increased protein S count, and a decrease in coagulation inhibiters like antithrombin. <b>Hypercoagulability</b> can be inherited and/or acquired. Hyperhomocysteine, a condition known to promote clots, can be caused by a combination of genetic factors and vitamin B6, vitamin b12 and folic acid deficiency. Factor V Leidan and mutations of the prothrombin gene are the two most common genetic causes of <b>hypercoagulability.</b> About 5% of the general population have these heterozygous mutations and in the thrombophilic population, 45-63% have these mutations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypercoagulability</b> (e.g. leukaemia, Factor V {{mutation}} (Leiden)) ...|$|E
50|$|Prolonged still {{standing}} significantly activates the coagulation cascade, called orthostatic <b>hypercoagulability.</b> Overall, it causes {{an increase in}} transcapillary hydrostatic pressure. As a result, approximately 12% of blood plasma volume crosses into the extravascular compartment. This plasma shift causes {{an increase in the}} concentration of coagulation factors and other proteins of coagulation, in turn causing <b>hypercoagulability.</b>|$|E

50|$|Factor V Leiden is {{a variant}} (mutated form) of human factor V (one of several {{substances}} that helps blood clot), which causes {{an increase in}} blood clotting (<b>hypercoagulability).</b> With this mutation, the anticoagulant protein secreted (which normally inhibits the pro-clotting activity of factor V) {{is not able to}} bind normally to Factor V, leading to a hypercoagulable state, i.e., an increased tendency for the patient to form abnormal and potentially harmful blood clots. Factor V Leiden is the most common hereditary <b>hypercoagulability</b> (prone to clotting) disorder amongst ethnic Europeans. It is named after the Dutch city Leiden, where it was first identified in 1994 by Prof R. Bertina et al.|$|E
