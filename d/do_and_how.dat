25|$|Herbert Hoover {{had already}} {{considered}} a bank holiday {{to prevent further}} bank runs, but rejected the idea because {{he was afraid to}} trip a panic. Roosevelt, however, gave a radio address, held in the atmosphere of a Fireside Chat, and explained to the public in simple terms the causes of the banking crisis, what the government will <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> the population could help. He closed all the banks in the country and kept them all closed until he could pass new legislation.|$|E

The Count dreamily, and ineffectually, pursues Concetta, while Concetta's younger sisters (Carolina and Caterina) dream romantically of Tancredi and the Count, and Tancredi and Angelica {{spend their time}} exploring the palace's many rooms, each of which contains some representation of a leopard, the family insignia. Narration describes how, on several occasions, Tancredi and Angelica are tempted {{to give in to}} their mutual sensual desire, but never <b>do...</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> this idyllic time of romantic, intimate gaming between them was a happy prelude to the miserable, unsuccessful marriage that followed.|$|E

25|$|The size of {{the brown}} facial {{markings}} on the heads of females {{also serves as a}} visual cue for members of the colony and serves as a badge of higher ranking status and reproductive status. Females with larger brown facial markings also have larger ovaries. These visual cues help other wasps to not only determine if a wasp is of the same species, but also to determine what to <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> to distribute themselves around the nests. Visiting females that lack these brown visual marks {{are more likely to be}} accepted into foreign nests. Acts of aggressions are much more likely to be exhibited towards a female with these distinctive markings in order to maintain a control system within the nest.|$|E
25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
500|$|Much of what {{characters}} can <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> {{well they}} do it, {{is determined by}} the game's eighty-three distinct character skills. A skill is a numerical representation of a character's proficiency in an area of skill, starting at zero. As players kill computer-controlled enemies, they gain experience points for their character. After gaining enough points, the character levels up. The current maximum level is 220. At each new level, the character is given some [...] "skill points", which are used to increase any combination of the eighty-three skills that they choose.|$|E

500|$|Taborn's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} came in 1994, {{and was released}} by DIW. Craig Taborn Trio, with bassist Jaribu Shahid and drummer Tani Tabbal, featured Taborn playing {{in a range of}} styles on piano and included several of his own compositions. At this stage in his career, his comments on his tastes in composition and performance were: [...] "Even though I like avant garde jazz and classical music, I like to swing. I like to work with harmony and melody in my own music, and I like acoustical instruments. But I can be quite dictatorial about the composed section, and lay down in great detail what everyone is supposed to <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> they should do it." ...|$|E

Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society we really need to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we really could <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> we could stabilize what's really {{going on in the world}} right now".|$|E
500|$|While {{brainstorming}} {{for ideas}} to the game's plot, Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a Metroid game because he [...] "always [...] to do something really unprecedented, something people have never played before". He continued, saying, [...] "Many of our designers and creators want to challenge something new rather than simply porting over an old title. That's something I hope we'll always do. If you can challenge something new, you {{can look forward to}} the public response, be it good or bad." [...] The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion offers a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas. Objectives are also flexible in how they can be completed, acting [...] "more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying 'Here you go, figure out what to <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> to do it.|$|E

500|$|Ferguson congratulated Arsenal {{on their}} win and {{said of the}} game: [...] "It was about {{trying to make sure}} {{everyone}} was fit for Wednesday. I think we have managed to do that. There are no new injuries so far. Hopefully by tomorrow morning it will be a definite." [...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, which is why I left him on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's got a lot to do with summer football. It's not down to the European Championship, but you do wonder why the Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that." [...] Giggs said Manchester United needed to take the positives out of the match and anticipated Arsenal as their main rivals in the league: [...] " [...] know what to <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> to handle the pressure when it comes around." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Abby West commented of Dwight's ouster, [...] "There's no way Rainn Wilson {{is off the}} show, {{but it was a}} bold move to let him {{appear to}} be bested by the (slightly) more Machiavellian Andy. I can't wait to see how they play out this storyline." [...] West {{referred}} to [...] "Phyllis' expert psychological move" [...] with the makeovers as her favorite subplot of the night, and appreciated the spotlight on the sales pairings; she expanded on this latter point, [...] "The trip out of the office was also a great reminder of what these Dunder Mifflin-ers actually <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> good most of them are. Isn't it interesting that as much as they normally clash, Dwight and Jim make a very effective sales team, while the seeming bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to keep Andy from punting their pitch? When Dwight started using the client's phone, Jim didn't skip a beat. They'd either used the ploy (of dialing the competition's customer service number and showing how long the wait time was) before, or Jim is comfortable going with Dwight's flow, at least in that kind of setting. They essentially played good cop/bad cop... or good cop/weird cop." [...] Other television critics also praised the various sales call pairings.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Randall H. Langer, a young {{real estate}} {{developer}} active in apartment rehabilitation in the neighborhood, aided {{the creation of a}} local historic district, the Sheridan Park Historic District, which critics charged was of dubious historical value and created to facilitate gentrification. Nineteen tax delinquent properties in Uptown were offered for sale by auction by Cook County in Fall, 1987. Since 1983 Cook County had a program to afford local governments the opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing, prior to the county's scavenger sale to the public, if the local government had a specific development plan. On October 28, 1987, Shiller urged the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board to accept a no-cash bid from the City for the 19 tax-delinquent parcels in Uptown. A decision was deferred when Commissioner Rosemarie Love requested a delay on grounds that the Washington administration had not provided a development plan. Subcommittee chairman Commissioner Richard Siebel said the County's no-cash sales program was [...] "designed to place property back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible – not for land-banking. It's not appropriate for us to pass this until the city tells us, parcel by parcel, what they intend to <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> they plan to pay for it." [...] Another commissioner noted that the City already owned 7,000 tax-delinquent properties, and another added, [...] "Properties we gave to the city 12 years ago are still war zones. I don't want the same thing to happen here." ...|$|E
