[...] This contrasts with the thread of modernism that holds that people must be taught to appreciate good design. Another contrast with modernism is in the aesthetic of functionality: Ruskin saw no beauty in well-designed tools: beauty is out of place where there is not serene leisure, or [...] "if you thrust it into the places of toil. Put it in the drawing-room, not into the workshop; put it on <b>domestic</b> <b>furniture,</b> not upon tools of handicraft." [...] For Ruskin, Beauty was not an inherent characteristic but a thing that could be applied to an object or withheld from it.|$|E

6000|$|We halted {{a day at}} Gudingaras, {{wishing to}} see the {{migration}} of a tribe. Before dawn, on the 30th November, the Somali Stentor proclaimed from the ridge-top, [...] "Fetch your camels!--Load your goods!--We march!" [...] About 8 A.M. we started in the rear. The spectacle was novel to me. Some 150 spearmen, assisted by their families, were driving before them divisions which, in total, might amount to 200 cows, 7000 camels, and 11,000 or 12,000 sheep and goats. Only three wore the Bal or feather, which denotes the brave; several, however, had the other decoration--an ivory armlet. [24] Assisted by the boys, whose heads were shaved in a cristated fashion truly ridiculous, and large pariah dogs with bushy tails, they drove the beasts and carried the colts, belaboured runaway calves, and held up the hind legs of struggling sheep. The sick, of whom there were many,--dysentery being at the time prevalent,--were carried upon camels with their legs protruding in front from under the hide-cover. Many of the dromedaries showed the Habr Awal brand [25]: laden with hutting materials and <b>domestic</b> <b>furniture,</b> they were led by the maidens: the matrons, followed, bearing their progeny upon their backs, bundled in the shoulder-lappets of cloth or hide. The smaller girls, who, {{in addition to the}} boys' crest, wore a circlet of curly hair round the head, carried the weakling lambs and kids, or aided their mammas in transporting the baby. Apparently in great fear of the [...] "All" [...] or Commando, the Bedouins anxiously inquired if I had my [...] "fire" [...] with me [26], and begged us to take the post of honour--the van. As our little party pricked forward, the camels started in alarm, and we were surprised to find that this tribe did not know the difference between horses and mules. Whenever the boys lost time in sport or quarrel, they were threatened by their fathers with the jaws of that ogre, the white stranger; and the women exclaimed, as they saw us approach, [...] "Here comes the old man who knows knowledge!"

Drawing forth two very small scraps of paper, he proceeded--'And now, gentlemen, but one word more. Two letters have passed between these parties, letters which are admitted to be in the handwriting of the defendant, and which speak volumes, indeed. The letters, too, bespeak the character of the man. They are not open, fervent, eloquent epistles, breathing nothing but the language of affectionate attachment. They are covert, sly, underhanded communications, but, fortunately, far more conclusive than if couched in the most glowing language and the most poetic imagery--letters that must be viewed with a cautious and suspicious eye--letters that were evidently intended at the time, by Pickwick, to mislead and delude any third parties into whose hands they might fall. Let me read the first: [...] "Garraways, twelve o'clock. Dear Mrs. B.--Chops and tomato sauce. Yours, PICKWICK." [...] Gentlemen, what does this mean? Chops and tomato sauce. Yours, Pickwick! Chops! Gracious heavens! and tomato sauce! Gentlemen, is the happiness of a sensitive and confiding female to be trifled away, by such shallow artifices as these? The next has no date whatever, which is in itself suspicious. [...] "Dear Mrs. B., I shall not be at home till to-morrow. Slow coach." [...] And then follows this very remarkable expression. [...] "Don't trouble yourself about the warming-pan." [...] The warming-pan! Why, gentlemen, who DOES trouble himself about a warming-pan? When was the peace of mind of man or woman broken or disturbed by a warming-pan, which is in itself a harmless, a useful, and I will add, gentlemen, a comforting article of <b>domestic</b> <b>furniture?</b> Why is Mrs. Bardell so earnestly entreated not to agitate herself about this warming-pan, unless (as is no doubt the case) it is a mere cover for hidden fire--a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise, agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence, artfully contrived by Pickwick with a view to his contemplated desertion, and which I am not in a condition to explain? And what does this allusion to the slow coach mean? For aught I know, it may be a reference to Pickwick himself, who has most unquestionably been a criminally slow coach during the whole of this transaction, but whose speed will now be very unexpectedly accelerated, and whose wheels, gentlemen, as he will find to his cost, will very soon be greased by you!' ...|$|E

60|$|The key of {{the lower}} door of the block-house hung {{where it had been}} deposited; the ladder was replaced, and Content mounted quietly to the {{apartment}} where he had placed his captive. The room was the lowest of three that the building contained, all being above that which might be termed its basement. The latter, having up aperture but its door, was a dark, hexagonal space, partly filled with such articles as might be needed {{in the event of an}} alarm, and which, at the same time, were frequently required for the purposes of domestic use. In the centre of the area was a deep well, so fitted and protected by a wall of stone, as to admit of water being drawn into the rooms above. The door itself was of massive hewn timber. The squared logs of the upper stories projected a little beyond the stone-work of the basement, the second tier of the timbers containing a few loops out of which missiles might be discharged downwards, on any assailants that approached nearer than should be deemed safe for the security of the basement. As has been stated, the two principal stories were perforated with long narrow slits through the timber, which answered the double purposes of windows and loop-holes. Though the apartments were so evidently arranged for defence, the plain <b>domestic,</b> <b>furniture</b> they contained was suited to the wants of the family, should they be driven to the building for refuge. There was also an apartment in the roof, or attic, as already mentioned; but it scarcely entered into the more important uses of the block-house. Still the advantage which it received from its elevation was not overlooked. A small cannon, of a kind once known and much used under the name of grasshoppers, had been raised to the place, and time had been, when it was rightly considered as of the last importance to the safety of the inmates of the dwelling. For some years its muzzle had been seen, by all the straggling aborigines who visited the valley, frowning through one of those openings which were now converted into glazed windows; and there is reason to think, that the reputation which the little piece of ordnance thus silently obtained, had a powerful agency in so long preserving unmolested the peace of the valley.|$|E
6000|$|XXIII. Must not beauty, then, {{it will be}} asked, {{be sought}} for in the forms which we {{associate}} with our every-day life? Yes, {{if you do it}} consistently, and in places where it can be calmly seen; but not if you use the beautiful form only as a mask and covering of the proper conditions and uses of things, nor if you thrust it into the places set apart for toil. Put it in the drawing-room, not into the workshop; put it upon <b>domestic</b> <b>furniture,</b> not upon tools of handicraft. All men have sense of what is right in this manner, if they would only use and apply that sense; every man knows where and how beauty gives him pleasure, if he would only ask for it when it does so, and not allow it to be forced upon him when he does not want it. Ask any one of the passengers over London Bridge at this instant whether he cares about the forms of the bronze leaves on its lamps, and he will tell you, No. Modify these forms of leaves to a less scale, and put them on his milk-jug at breakfast, and ask him whether he likes them, and he will tell you, Yes. People have no need of teaching if they could only think and speak truth, and ask for what they like and want, and for nothing else: nor can a right disposition of beauty be ever arrived at except by this common sense, and allowance for the circumstances of the time and place. It does not follow, because bronze leafage is in bad taste on the lamps of London Bridge, that it would be so on those of the Ponte della Trinita; nor, because it would be a folly to decorate the house fronts of Gracechurch Street, that it would be equally so to adorn those of some quiet provincial town. The question of greatest external or internal decoration depends entirely on the conditions of probable repose. It was a wise feeling which made the streets of Venice so rich in external ornament, for there is no couch of rest like the gondola. So, again, there is no subject of street ornament so wisely chosen as the fountain, where it is a fountain of use; for it is just there that perhaps the happiest pause takes place in the labor of the day, when the pitcher is rested on the edge of it, and the breath of the bearer is drawn deeply, and the hair swept from the forehead, and the uprightness of the form declined against the marble ledge, {{and the sound of the}} kind word or light laugh mixes with the trickle of the falling water, heard shriller and shriller as the pitcher fills. What pause is so sweet as that--so full of the depth of ancient days, so softened with the calm of pastoral solitude? ...|$|E

It {{is a part}} of a larger research project on the combustion of <b>domestic</b> upholstered <b>furniture</b> at the University of Canterbury. The project aims to predict the ignition time of New Zealand upholstered furniture composites. Fourteen fabrics, one of which was fire retardant cotton, were chosen for testing according to their compositions and content. They represented the most common used fabrics in the manufacture of upholstered furniture in New Zealand. One foam was chosen as it is the most commonly used foam for <b>domestic</b> and commercial <b>furniture.</b> In total, the study tested fourteen types of fabric-foam combination composites, of which there were 750 specimens in this project. The time-to-ignition data are presented in a statistical way with mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and included the ratio of standard deviation to mean. The Flux Time Product concept and linearized thermal ignition model were applied to predict the time-to-ignition, the critical heat flux for ignition and the ignition temperature for the fabric foam composites. Predicting the ignition of upholstery composites by applying the thermally thin theory obtains a reasonably good comparison to the measured ignition data. Therefore, it is applicable to apply the thermally thin theory in engineering calculations and design. The prediction by the thermally thick theory is not as accurate as that by the thermally thin theory. In this research, it was found that Flux Time Product index is smaller than 1. 0 for melting fabrics and greater than 1. 0 for charring fabrics, when the best-fit linear correlation is achieved. There needs to be further research to justify these values for the FTP index for the fabric-foam composites. The ignition data obtained by the ISO Ignitability Apparatus in this study was compared with that obtained from previous research in the Cone Calorimeter. The comparison shows that the two test methods have a good agreement...|$|R
