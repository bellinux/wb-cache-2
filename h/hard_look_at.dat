25|$|According to musicologist Gerald Abraham, the operas on {{the whole}} embody an {{enormous}} mass of music far too beautiful and interesting to be ignored. Moreover, he maintains, Tchaikovsky's search for operatic subjects, along with his views on their nature and treatment and his own work on librettos, throw considerable light on his creative personality. Nevertheless, according to musicologist Francis Maes, most of Tchaikovsky's operas failed for three reasons. First, the composer could not get good librettos, despite continued requests to some of Russia's leading playwrights and his brother Modest. Second, he was no Verdi, Puccini or Leoncavalo. While he could write music that was often beautiful and sometimes very moving, it was generally not as arresting dramatically as anything those three provided. Third, and perhaps most sadly, Tchaikovsky's enthusiasm for opera writing did not match his theatrical sense. Apparently either unaware of this deficiency or unable to curb his excitement long enough to take a cold, <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the true stage-worthiness of a libretto, he seemed destined to repeat his failures.|$|E

[...] According to Chicago City Council member Toni Preckwinkle, an early Obama supporter, Obama [...] "took a <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> himself after that campaign and became a much better campaigner, more at ease on the campaign trail."

On her way to the court however, Mercedes was [...] "all over the place". According to Metcalfe, everyone was shocked when Mercedes walked into the courtroom. She said that Mercedes was unsure of {{what she was going to}} tell the court, [...] "but her alibi is vital to Warren's case - his fate lies in her hands". Metcalfe said that even if Mercedes and Russ ended their relationship, which they did shortly after she confessed the truth, would not matter because she believed that it would not take Mercedes [...] "long before she goes back to her old ways" [...] because [...] "that's just the type of person she is - Mercedes likes playing the field and having fun, and no man's going to change her" ...|$|E

Lisa Hand of the Sunday Independent noted the influence of America on the track, remarking, [...] " [...] does not confine itself simply to the music, but also extends to some of the lyrics.

Richard Harrington of The Washington Post described the song as [...] "a simple lament of great beauty and sadness pleading for the realization that ideological battles about right and left obscure the more important issue of right and wrong."

2500|$|The revelation had {{a ripple}} effect, causing both more {{criticism}} about {{the responsibilities of}} notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 [...] "to develop {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities." [...] Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states to take a <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a notified body is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s, Davis {{created a}} comic strip called Gnorm Gnat, which met with little success. One editor said, [...] "his art was good, his gags were great," [...] but that [...] "nobody can {{identify}} with Bugs." [...] Davis {{decided to take a}} long, <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well, but there were no cats at the time. Davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with 25 cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat. He then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created Garfield, who borrows the first letter of his name from Davis's earlier work. Garfield originally consisted of four main characters. Garfield, the titular character, was based on the cats Davis was around growing up; he took his name and personality from Davis's grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis, who was, in Davis's words, [...] "a large, cantankerous man". Jon Arbuckle came from a 1950s coffee commercial, and Odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by Davis, which featured Odie the Village Idiot. Early on in the strip, Odie's owner was a man named Lyman. He was written in to give Jon someone to talk with. Davis later realized that Garfield and Jon could [...] "communicate nonverbally". The strip, originally centered on Jon, was first rejected by the King Features, Post-Hall and the Chicago Tribune-New York News agencies, all of which asked Davis to focus on the cat, who in their opinion, got the better lines. United Feature Syndicate accepted the retooled strip in 1978 and debuted it in 41newspapers on June 19 of that year (however, after a test run, the Chicago Sun-Times dropped it, only to reinstate it after readers' complaints). Garfields first Sunday page ran on June 25, 1978, being featured as a third-pager until March 22, 1981. A half-page debuted the following Sunday, March 29, with the strips for March 14 and 21, 1982, having a unique nine-panel format, but UFS curtailed further use of it (it did, however, [...] allow Davis to use the format for his U.S. Acres strip).|$|E
