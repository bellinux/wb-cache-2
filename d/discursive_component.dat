40|$|Football as {{an object}} of {{knowledge}} is one of the types of content whose meaning seems to be singularly apprehended in practice. To better understand the process by which its various categories manage to construct meaning (anchor modes of its actions, the arrangement of its classes of units (cores and catalysis), the modes of establishment and operation of its actants, etc.), football must be analyzed in terms of the general syntax of his discourse operations. In doing so, the football semiotization discourse attempt to enter the structures of these signifying ensembles that this sport mobilizes throughout his praxis. This does not appear obvious when one is the theoretical point of view. Thus, analyzing football as a discourse act is likely to highlight other forms, other categories, other content of <b>discursive</b> <b>component</b> that could enhance the development of non-semiotic schemes languages verbal.

30|$|These {{estimated}} numbers {{suggest that}} in both countries the policy tool implies a strong <b>discursive</b> <b>component</b> directed towards the voting population (see Van Oorschot, 2009). It is {{a signal to the}} general public that welfare for “unwanted migrants” is provided only on a conditional basis. In fact, it has to be earned individually by demonstrating the willingness to cooperate with the return procedure. The underlying rationale is that only good and needy migrants may be rewarded with basic social services. No doubt the tool aims at clearing away practical barriers against effectuating removals, but the effects are demonstrated less in numbers than in political discourse. Distinct gaps, tensions and ambiguities remain: between immigration control and welfare policy networks, between the stages of legislation and implementation, and between national, sub-national and international actors. These gaps occur, however, in different intensity in the two country contexts.|$|E
40|$|The chapter {{explores the}} {{relation}} between the artistic and <b>discursive</b> <b>component</b> in artistic research. Starting from a suggestion made by James Elkins to consider the possibility of a written dissertation that asks to be understood as fiction, different fictional writing strategies are explored to see how they can be dialectically related to an artistic practice. The ever-questioning attitude of the ironist, as he was portrayed by Richard Rorty in Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, takes up a central role in that discussion. Irony brings a layer of meta-representation and meta-reflection into the research process. It therefore allows the artistic researcher to question in a productive way his/her own work, and the notion of artistic research as such. A dialectical model is proposed in which work and text act as mediated redescriptions offering the floor to different (fictional) voices that might become starting points for more detailed questions, for more specific insights, and for alternative redescriptions of the research questions at stake. status: publishe...|$|E

Armenian and Greek-Pontic), a standardized related language is taught at school. Not allowing any social mobility to the speakers, those oral tradition varieties {{are used in}} parallel with other valorised languages, such as Greek and Turkish.

40|$|Design {{activity}} {{has a significant}} <b>discursive</b> <b>component.</b> Based on the well-established Hierarchical Task Analysis Method, which links human behavior to syntactic analysis and the hypothesis that design as a problem solving activity can be characterized by its discursive space, we attempt to identify dependencies between design features, defined by codifications based on pairings of nouns (tasks) and verbs (actions) in protocol data. This enables their integration into a complete solution, within a team design setting. Using the Service Learning dataset provided on the Purdue University Research Repository and focusing on the protocols corresponding to the requirement specification, preliminary design and design development stages of design delivery, we carried out macro-, midi- and micro-level analyses. In the macro-level data analysis, statistical tests showed significant correlation between major and minor nouns (tasks). In the midi-level we established similarities between the occurrence of nouns and verbs in protocols. We also observed that certain nouns were more prevalent during specific design stages. In the micro-level data analysis, we found correlations between nouns. Overall, {{the results show that}} design actions are anchored around a central task and discursive data can provide significant insight into the integration of successive design actions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Contrary to most {{traditional}} approaches, ideologies are defined here within a multidisciplinary framework that combines a social, cognitive and <b>discursive</b> <b>component.</b> As 'systems of ideas', ideologies are sociocognitively defined as shared representations of social groups, {{and more specifically}} as the `axiomatic ' principies of such representations. As {{the basis of a}} social group's self-image, ideologies organize its identity, actions, aims, norms and values, and resources as well as its relations to other social groups. Ideologies are distinct from the sociocognitive basis of broader cultural communities, within which different ideological groups share fundamental beliefs such as their cultural knowledge. Ideologies are expressed and generally reproduced in the social practices of their members, and more particularly acquired, confirmed, changed and perpetuated through discourse. Although general properties of language and discourse are not, as such, ideologically marked, systematic discourse analysis offers powerful methods to study the structures and functions of underlying ' ideologies. The ideological polarization between ingroups and outgroups — a prominent feature of the structure of ideologies—may also be systematically studied at all levels of text and talk, e. g. by analysing how members of ingroups typically emphasize their own good deeds and properties and the bad ones of the outgroup, and mitigate or deny their own bad ones and the good ones of the outgroup...|$|E
40|$|We seek to {{understand}} how nanotechnology {{can contribute to the}} development of a more sustainable society in general, and to investigate Swedish nanotechnology in particular. On the one hand, the research interest is on how nanoscience can be turned into used products, that is, innovation. On the other hand, we acknowledge that innovation itself is the main producer of risk in modern societies. Inspired by sociology and economics of innovation, we try to capture this by introducing the term 'reflexive system of innovation' to denote a system made up of heterogenous elements, such as <b>discursive</b> <b>components</b> (expressions of knowledge and normative and regulative stands) and organizational components (actors and knowledge), evolving in a non-linear way through external influences as well as self re-enforcing and self-regulating processes. We present the evolution of a Swedish nanotechnology system from the 1980 s to the present, as it moves through phases characterized by different kinds of discourse and organization. Evaluating the Swedish case against the concept of a reflexive system of innovation, we find advanced academic knowledge production but a lack of interconnectivity between actors, few actors outside the research community entering the system and a weak function of anticipation, guidance and risk handling. Broad national nanotechnology initiatives (NNIs) may be important for the crystallization of the desired processes, but because neither innovation nor risk can be fully contained, an NNI may only be part of the input to a fully fledged reflexive system of innovation in nanotechnology...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study of}} the {{relations}} between foreign relations and trade. By employing the methodical approach of the theoretical school of critical geopolitics, the thesis aims to study the U. S. geopolitical discourse {{in order to understand the}} <b>discursive</b> <b>components</b> that construct an overarching geopolitical discourse, through a discourse analysis within the practical sphere of the U. S. geopolitical discourse, such as presidential speeches. Furthermore, a literary review of the trade relation between oil producing Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and the U. S. is performed, and with the gathered data attempts to establish the level of economic interdependence. By benchmarking with the Freedom House (2016) political and civil freedom ranking, the thesis then attempts to study whether there are discursive conflicts at play, and then attempts to study the relation between that and the level of economic interdependence. The identified regime of truth in the U. S. foreign policy discourse is notably superceded in the case of Saudi Arabia, where numerous discursive conflicts are present, while at the same time being more economically independent with Saudi Arabia than with Venezuela. On the other hand, in the case of Venezuela, there appears to be few discursive conflicts, while the economic interdepence is smaller. Thus, while the results are tentative, this thesis argues that indications of a correlation between positive political relationship and strong trade relations is present, which even overrules the discursive regime of truth...|$|R
40|$|In this text, Rudolf Brucci’s opera Gilgamesh {{is viewed}} {{in the light of}} Ralph Locke’s “All the Music in the Full Context” Paradigm which {{promotes}} the approach that one should search for the exotic elements in musical works first in the <b>discursive</b> <b>components</b> (title, program, accompanying notes), visual representations (costume, scenery) and a “horizon of expectations” of a particular culture, and only then to observe exoticism as the aspect of a musical style. In the light of this Paradigm, “exoticism” of the opera Gilgamesh is detected {{at the level of the}} music material and compositional procedures, but not in the dramaturgical profiling of characters, narrative adaptation of the Sumerian epic, costumes and scenery. The plot, costumes and the scenery of the opera do not construct the Orient with either positive or negative projections attributed to it by the Western European Orientalist discourse, but portray Gilgamesh and Enkidu as ancient mythic protagonists on the margin of the (not-always) exoticist once/now binarism. The musical language of the opera, which abounds in the usage of oriental musical scales and citations, indicates that oriental/exotic was one of the author’s “target levels” when conceiving and composing Gilgamesh. Brucci, however, did not build the “ethnological model” in his opera, but gave oriental scales and “exotic” musical citations their meaning within the Western musical tradition, which is why his approach can be compared with the “veiled exoticism” of the French composers of the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. In the light of the self/other binarism, reaching for the exotic in Gilgamesh can be presented as an auto-exotic creative behavior of Brucci as a composer who perceives his “minority identity” in a relation to an imaginary referential system of the Center. However, I am more inclined to see Brucci’s identificational intention in his advocacy of the Yugoslav NAM (Non-Aligned Movement) project, and his dealing with the “exotic” as part of his strategy to support cultural achievements of the Third World which predominantly participated in that project...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to focus on some aspects tied up with Laughter in Vietnamese popular {{literature}} in the feudal time, namely the Middle Age period and more specifically from the Xth to the XIVth centuries. The Vietnamese popular literature, of people’s creative endeavour and commonly of oral transmission from generation to generation, has largely contributed to characterize the Vietnamese culture and its national identity. Further back in time claimed Rabelais «Rire est le propre de l’homme». In the multi-millennial Vietnamese culture, laughter, embedded with an instructive/pedagogic significance while inculcating ethic values in its criticism of vicious and sinful conduct, has {{played an important role}} on people’s everyday life, simultaneously creating moments of joy, of entertainment, i. e. comic relief. Indeed, one laughs at misshapenness often linked to mistakes or the fake. The bad is the comic’s theme. One never laughs at beautiful and pleasant issues. Sometimes, bad is one’s inner feature without one’s own awareness. Thus, one tries to show one’s beauty. It is precisely in this paradoxical relation that bad becomes above all laughter’s origin. Laughter is also a weapon against negative phenomena greatly featuring the feudal society. In so doing, laughter has a deep social meaning. Vietnamese popular literature falls back to a great extent upon the comic, everyday laughter. For the Vietnamese commonly optimistic people, enjoying life, laughter is deeply and outstandingly imbued of a comic dimension. All along their history the Vietnamese have created a large number of bawdy stories aimed at satisfying their needs both for entertainment and struggle against negative influences, sins or even social inequalities and oppression. As a matter of fact, the Vietnamese popular literature comprises a valuable set of tales of comic nature, popular songs, as well as satiric poems, fables, buffoon’s tall tales (from popular theatre - Sân Khâu Chèo) making use of strategies to arouse laughter. Indeed, these are the underpinnings of the extremely rich satiric popular literature. 1 Actas do Colóquio Internacional «O Riso na Cultura Medieval» @ Universidade Aberta – Todos os direitos reservados 2 Actas do Colóquio Internacional «O Riso na Cultura Medieval» @ Universidade Aberta – Todos os direitos reservados Some Vietnamese popular tales, excerpts of buffoon’s roles in the popular theatre «Chèo» will be presented to describe the object of laughter and its triggering strategies.

40|$|As {{globalization}} {{processes are}} continuously developing, and bringing {{the world in}} to every person’s backyard, many problems may arise. Insecurity in one’s self-identity, national belonging and cultural heritage may entail several shifts in the political discourse. The theoretical underpinning for this thesis, which is ontological security, addresses these issues and attempts {{to make sense of}} sociopolitical orders and events on several levels. As Sweden faces a new era in politics, one in which nationalist movements may play a greater role, they bring along issues of national identity and appeal to security aspects of identity. It may be possible that such parties are gaining strength from the central role of national identity in their party program, but then what does this mean in the formation of national identity? The importance of understanding their discursive practices in national identity formation, based on ontological security issues, may become key in understanding the consequences. Furthermore, this paper strives {{to gain a better understanding}} of what the possibilities are to mitigate ontological insecurity by a less securitized, and inclusive inference that responds to the current demographic. This paper recognizes the reflexive nature of both discourse and identity formation, hence the issue is not to step outside the discourse, but to demonstrate the discursive mechanisms and their possible implications in terms of their reflexivity. So forth, reflexivity will demonstrate the issues of discourses becoming entrenched, intertwined and possibly misguided in any attempt of mitigating of ontological security through securitizing and excluding. Awareness shall anyhow be directed toward the politolinguistic practices deployed by nationalist movements. Because, by understanding the discursive goals, we may also hypothesize on the implications. This paper will bring about central nominations, predications, argumentations, perspectivizations and intensifications/mitigations in the discursive practices of the Sweden Democrats and contextualize their rhetoric, in order to gain an understanding of their discursive means and aims. Several <b>discursive</b> <b>components</b> shall be elucidated, as well as the party’s constructed discursive role. This shall bring about an understanding of the Sweden Democrats’ constructed role in the discourse, but also by which means they approach such a depiction, and what that may ensue for defined out-group members...|$|R

40|$|O presente trabalho, situando-se na perspectiva da AnÃlise do Discurso francesa e alinhando-se Ã concepÃÃo de heterogeneidade predominante na disciplina, toma como referencial teÃrico {{principal}} a proposta de Maingueneau (1983, 1984), que desenvolveu a noÃÃo de polÃmica discursiva como interincompreensÃo generalizada. Segundo o autor, a interincompreensÃo corresponde Ã impossibilidade de os discursos produzirem e compreenderem os enunciados de outra prÃtica discursiva a partir das regras desta. Diferentemente do teÃrico, acreditamos que a interincompreensÃo, alÃm de ter uma dimensÃo constitutiva, apresenta tambÃm uma dimensÃo que se mostra na materialidade discursiva, ou seja, compreendemos que a traduÃÃo operada por uma prÃtica discursiva sobre o discurso outro serÃ frequentemente, de algum modo, mostrada no texto, atravÃs de estratÃgias linguÃstico-discursivas que sistematizamos. Para tanto, utilizamos enunciados variados do campo discursivo humorÃstico, campo que consideramos especialmente polÃmico, a partir dos quais realizamos nossa anÃlise e compusemos nossa proposta de sistematizaÃÃo. A partir da anÃlise, observamos a existÃncia de estratÃgias em que o componente linguÃstico e o discursivo encontram-se imbricados, ambos em equilÃbrio, no que concerne Ã relevÃncia. Ã o caso da refutaÃÃo, da ironia e do uso polÃmico do verbo âserâ. Outras estratÃgias, porÃm, sÃo mais marcadamente discursivas. Nesse caso, referimo-nos aos sete mecanismos identificados no Ãltimo capÃtulo: uso da 1 Â pessoa do discurso enunciando conforme simulacro do Outro; uso de aspas; recurso ao debate entre personagens (Mesmo X Outro); associaÃÃo do Outro a discursos que retiram sua credibilidade / legitimidade; recurso ao debate Mesmo X Outro a partir de sema polÃmico; uso da 1 Â pessoa e evidenciaÃÃo do simulacro do Outro a partir do exagero; atribuiÃÃo de voz ao simulacro do Outro de modo a âflagrÃ-loâ em suas contradiÃÃes. The present work, {{standing in}} {{the perspective of the}} French Discourse Analysis and aligned to the prevailing conception of heterogeneity in the discipline, takes as the main theoretical framework the contributions of Maingueneau (1983, 1984), who developed the notion of discursive controversy as generalized interincomprehension. According to the author, interincomprehension corresponds to the impossibility of discourses produce and understand utterances of another discursive practice from the rules of this one. Unlike the author, we believe interincomprehension, besides having a constitutive dimension, also has a dimension that shows in the discursive materiality, ie, we understand that the translation operated by a discursive practice on the other discourse is often somehow shown in the text through linguistic and discursive strategies that we systematize. Therefore, we use a variety of utterances from the humorous discursive field, that we consider especially controversial, from which we perform our analysis and we wrote our proposal of systematization. From the analysis, we observe the existence of strategies in which the linguistic and <b>discursive</b> <b>components</b> are interwoven, both in equilibrium with regard to relevance. This is the case of refutation, irony and the polemical use of the verb "to be". Other strategies, however, are markedly more discursive. In this case, we refer to the seven mechanisms identified in the last chapter: use of the 1 st person of the speech to enunciate as simulacrum of the Other; use of quotation marks; feature of a discussion between characters (Same X Other); association of the Other to discourses that derive their credibility / legitimacy; debate Same X Other from controversial sema; use of 1 st person and emphasis to the simulacrum of the Other from exaggeration; assigning voice to the simulacrum of the Other in order to "catch him" in its contradictions...|$|R

The film creates a pervasive ambiance of liminality and dreamlike disconnection—‘flottement’—around the central character of Vincent {{in order to}} convey the affective landscape of post-Fordist immaterial labour (in this case business consultancy). Approaching L'Emploi du temps as a diagram—in Deleuzian terms—of <b>discursive</b> and non-discursive <b>components</b> helps to explain {{the ways in which}} the film goes beyond psychoanalytic drama in order to convey a more general sense of a social reality that is frequently problematic and overwhelming for Vincent. Recent work on hypermodernity and the hypermodern self is employed in order to analyse Vincent's behaviour as an example of the kinds of subjectivity produced by control societies. In many cases, the hypermodern individual is fragile, isolated and unpredictable, prone to excessive behaviours and periodic breakdowns. Whereas Cantet's previous film, Ressources humaines, powerfully dramatised a crisis of place, L'Emploi du temps conveys an individual and collective crisis of confidence...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} gender-balanced {{recruitment}} and clear-cut criteria for promotion based on meritocracy, women in public accounting firms remain proportionally fewer in {{number in the}} highest levels of the hierarchy than men. This paper aims to explore the mechanisms fostering women’s rarity in top positions within French accounting firms in terms of organizationally constructed approved paths. Drawing on 21 semi-structured interviews with both male and female accountants, the specificities of these approved paths, alongside the construction of alternative, feminised routes, lacking the legitimacy of the former and often implying a derailment of women’s careers from a very early stage, will be explored. It is suggested that more than a matter of only lifestyle preferences or practical constraints, this rarity is constructed by the interplay between the two, often resulting in “unintended and unwanted consequences, which retroactively may become unacknowledged conditions of future actions ” (Giddens, 1984 : 76). The focus of this study is to understand how the <b>discursive</b> and practical <b>components</b> of daily routines contribute to the reproduction of Big Four’s gendered culture. Furthermore, this paper invites to question the concept of the glass ceiling and consider the construction of women’s rarity in the accounting profession in terms of a labyrinth...|$|R
40|$|Memorial landscapes are {{inextricably}} linked to the processes of national, regional, local, and individual identity formation; and are tightly bound to notions of place and space. A rich body of literature exists {{in the social sciences}} on the structure and function of national scale memorial landscapes. A nascent body of literature on informal memorial works and landscapes is emerging in the social sciences. The current study bridges these bodies of literature by investigating the collection of memorial interventions as elements of a single memorial landscape and by focusing on local, human-scale remembrance over a three years period. A triangulated, multi-method, qualitative research design has been applied to the investigation of the material, <b>discursive,</b> and representational <b>components</b> of the memorial landscape which has emerged in Baltimore's Oliver neighborhood in response to the murder of all seven members of the Dawson family on October 16, 2002. The memorial landscape is viewed here as the manifestation of the community's negotiation between the production of space and the making of place. The data reveal that the initial years in the formation of a local-scale memorial landscape are bound up with complex sociopolitical processes. The outcomes of this research are that the formation of the local-scale memorial landscape is a complex and dynamic expression of sociopolitical identity and power; that memory work is transformative with regard to space and place; that there is merit in a more inclusive definition of the memorial landscape; that multiple geographic scales produce the memorial landscape; and that participation in local-scale memory work diminishes over time. Future research should focus upon the variability of memory work across race, class, gender, faith and geography at the local scale. Such an investigation has the potential to yield greater degrees of understanding of complexity and ambiguity of local-scale identity formation. ...|$|R
40|$|Discourse {{analysis}} {{based on}} the archaeological method developed by Michel Foucault shows that International governmental organisations (UNEP and EEA) and national governments (Norway) are relying on two discursive systems {{in order to establish}} sets of policies towards sustainable consumption and production (SCP). The first system has the rational choice model at its core. Consumption is viewed as a matter of personal choice exercised by autonomous consumers making relatively unconstrained lifestyle choices based on rational deliberations. Technology, information campaigns, regulatory framework and instruments of market are the main political strategies to steer SCP. The second discursive system approaches consumption through the social world in which consumer practices are embedded in a variety of social practices, which are in their turn, influenced by social norms and constrained by institutional contexts which evoke lock-in situation. These two discursive systems, however, are part of the same SCP discursive formation. It means that the rational choice model and social practices discursive systems, rather than refer to opposite knowledge systems or belonging to two complete different worlds, they constitute alternative political options within a common framework. This acknowledgement has deep political impact, since it makes possible to argue for a conjunction of these two discursive systems in a common set of SCP political strategies. The possible emergence of a more robust political SCP strategy – combining the rational choice model and social practices discursive systems within a common framework – depends on changes in the balance of power between these two discursive sub-groups. A Foucaultian genealogical analysis shows that the rational choice model discursive sub-group has, firstly, dominated the formation of SCP politics, since this discursive sub-group has produced strategies that are viewed as politically useful and economically advantageous, i. e. undoubtedly contributing to the general functioning of the wheels of power. Secondly, it is also imposing a political economy of truth, i. e. to produce, regulate, distribute and circulates its principles within the archive SCP. The social practices discursive sub-group, in its turn, has been deemed as inadequate to its task, since there are no guarantees of economic advantages and political utility being derived from the adoption of cultural and social contexts of dynamics of consumption as SCP political strategies. On the other hand, the genealogical analysis has also identified that the political struggle of knowledge between the rational choice model and social practices discursive sub-groups is starting to promote discursive changes in relation to the balance of power between them, perhaps even shaping a new ‘régime’ of truth. These changes are tracked through the identification of points of discontinuity within the SCP archive, locating breaks with the ‘true’ propositions which had until now dominated the whole ensemble of discursive practices supporting SCP discourses. These points of discontinuity have not yet brought themselves to bear, neither through political results, nor by producing new sets of SCP strategies. Nevertheless, these changes refer to an already scientific acknowledgement that a systemic approach is needed, since the rational choice model discursive sub-group has not been as effective in stimulating changes in consumption patterns as expected. The argument that a discursive change is already in motion within the SCP archive is sustained as all actors – policy makers, business community, consumer scientists, eco-designers, etc. – instead of planning SCP policies in separate forums, are confronting their different perspectives, challenges, and experiences in common meetings, where the two SCP discursive sub-groups have their core principles questioned and challenged. By bringing the proponents of the two different sub-groups together, they are promoting an interdisciplinary discussion {{in order to be able}} to forward a better and broader SCP political strategy. Whether they will be able to surpass their own frameworks, power interests, and to foresee different gains from a new ‘régime’ of truth, is too early to say. This thesis’ contribution to the SCP debates is to show that the rational choice model and social practices <b>discursive</b> sub-groups are <b>components</b> of the same SCP discursive formation. That means that the challenging project of bringing both discursive sub-groups into a common political framework is achievable...|$|R
40|$| {{about the}} {{normative}} sciences, {{given the fact}} that Peirce’s classification of the normative sciences has had a troubled story, both {{from the point of view}} of their genesis and the point of view of their interpretation by the scholarship. From a general standpoint, Peirce defines the normative sciences as the study of the normative “forms,” or “normative facts,” of human, self-controlled behavior. This comprises principles of logical inference in reasoning, norms of behavior in a broader sense and affective dispositions. After unpacking the evaluative categories of each one of the normative sciences (truth and veracity for logic, or semeiotic; adequateness and effectiveness of a mean for an end – assuming that the end is good – for ethics; the admirable in itself beyond any reasons for aesthetics), I clarify that for Peirce only the aesthetic ideal constitutes the ultimate justification of the dimension of ethical and logical values. The aesthetic values, which Peirce identifies with the “development of concrete reasonableness,” is therefore the teleological ground of any value. A further point is what type of perspective Peirce’s semeiotic brings to the problem of the metaphysical status of normative facts. In particular, the idea of “final logical interpretant” (= habit) allows for an understanding of normative facts as human virtues. This does not prevent Peirce from stressing the importance of “norms” understood as linguistic formulations of a good purpose. The metaphysical status of the normative facts is further developed in the third section of the chapter, in which I inquiry into the nature of Peirce’s metaethical “realism” in relation to the so-called contemporary moral realism. Second, I bring my attention to the influence that Peirce’s growing confidence in the normative sciences had on his more mature pragmatism. However, the influence does not go only in one direction. As a matter of fact, I claim that Peirce’s more mature reflection on the nature of semeiotic and meaning led him to see the need for a normative perspective within pragmatism itself. In particular, I deal with the consequences that the normative sciences have on the evolution of Peirce’s pragmatic maxim. As it is know, the pragmatic maxim, formulated by Peirce in 1978 “How to Make Our Ideas Clear” for the first time, is mainly a principle of semantic clarification, according to which the meaning a believed proposition is ultimately given by the habits of action that that proposition would bring about in the believer. By studying the development of the maxim both from a historical and theoretical viewpoint, it becomes clear that the maxim shows an internal tension between two irreducible functions. The first function, the pragmatic-explicating, is simply aimed to determine what is the pragmatic level of the meaning of any proposition whatsoever. The second function, the pragmatic-normative, is not only meant to clarifying, but also to point at the direction in which the interpretation of the signs ought to be pursued, and, as a consequence, which propositions ought to be believed and for what purposes a proposition ought to be applied. Third, I go back to the problem of the metaphysical status of the normative facts, trying to establish a comparison between Peirce and some contemporary moral realists. In particular, I argue against four main theses of these contemporary moral realists, according to which, in order to avoid some form of moral constructivism (both relativistic and non-relativistic), it is necessary to claim that (i) moral language and knowledge are descriptive in nature; (ii) the task of moral knowledge is to provide an adequate account of what is genuinely good from a moral viewpoint; (iii) the reality of moral facts and properties is independent from any type of human function or disposition; (iv) at least some of our moral propositions are true. In the light of Peirce’s understanding of a normative fact, I show that the claim that Peirce is a non-relativistic moral constructivist is misplaced, if the assumption of this claim is that a normative fact is only something that is existent “out there” in the world, independently from the human mind. On the contrary, a normative fact is for Peirce the result of a practical self-comprehension by the human agent as a able of self-controlled agency. Chapter 3 concludes the section of the dissertation devoted specifically to Peirce with a reflection on Peirce’s understanding of deliberation and his alleged “moral sentimentalism. ” In some passages (in particular the lecture “Philosophy and the Conduct of Life”), Peirce asserts that in “vitally important matters” sentiment should have a greater weight than reason in guiding human decision. This claim has led some interpreters to say that Peirce is a non-cognitivist in ethics. On the contrary, I show how Peirce’s statements can be given a more convincing reading by in the broader framework of his philosophy, which includes both the normative sciences and what he called “critical-common sensism. ” It is highly improbable that Peirce is advocating for a non-cognitivist position in ethics in so far as his normative sciences also include a theory of deliberation, whose centrality would be at odds with an alleged non-cognitivist position. In particular, the incompatibility between a strong theory of deliberation and non-cognitivism in ethics is even less likely {{given the fact that}} Peirce puts forth (somehow in an anti-Aristotelian way), that deliberation is mainly about ends and ideals, not about means (in so doing, he also avoids the possibility of being confused with a humean of some sort). For Peirce, therefore, deliberations is at work first and foremost in figuring out what ideals are truly good for the human beings, not what particular action ought to be performed in a particular context (this is why he also claims that the most important mental act in a particular situation is not deliberation, but perception). This set of considerations help us to put Peirce’s allegedly non-cognitivist claims in a clearer light. Furthermore, Peirce articulates a semeiotic theory of sentiments for which sentiments (but also emotions, affections, passions, which are not distinguished by Peirce) is a specific type of interpretant and has therefore cognitive nature, as much as any other interpretant. From all these considerations, it follows that when Peirce underscores the “wisdom” of sentiment in vitally important matters, he is actually claiming that sentimental has a higher epistemic authority than rational deliberation in order to grasp certain normative facts. In this sense, we understand what is Peirce’s thesis and what is the correct question we should ask about that thesis: if moral sentiment has a greater epistemic authority than rational deliberation in certain dimensions of life, what are Peirce’s reasons to justify such a claim? In order to tackle this issues, I deal briefly with Peirce’s doctrine of human “instincts” and their evolution, including that particular instinct that is the moral sentiment. Two points are interesting about this: first, Peirce sees a continuity between the way in which instinct apprehends certain actions as good (and other as evil) and the forms in which this instinct has been and is articulated by human traditions over time; second, Peirce also points out a normative discontinuity between the development of certain moral instincts and the free and critical endorsement of those instincts as reliable guides in moral issues. In order to clarify these two points, I develop an analysis of Peirce “critical common sensism” and a related justification of the superior epistemic value of sentiment over reason in vitally important matters. The second part of the dissertation deals in a specific way with two problems of agency and normativity in the philosophy of John Dewey. Chapter 4 focuses on Dewey’s theory of experience, on which virtually all Dewey scholars have written. However, in this chapter, I try to show that all the objections to Dewey’s alleged subjectivist idealism and reductionist naturalism partially fade away when we study Dewey’s theory of experience in semeiotic terms. In particular, by relying on Dewey’s study of the notion of “appearance” and his naturalistic theory of perception, I develop the idea of indexical existence. I believe that this notion can put in a new light fundamental tenets of Dewey’s philosophy such as the processes of constitution of the objects of experience, the struggle between constructivism and realism, the alleged incompatibility among different ontologies, and finally the notion of truth, on which I focus in one section by drawing from both Peirce and Dewey. My intention is to show that Dewey’s metaphysical question is mainly a normative question and how this question admits different answers. We could formulate the question in the following way: “how ought we think about indexical existences?”. In this sense, the common sense objects and the experimental sciences objects are not in contradiction among themselves; rather, they are different but equally legitimate articulations of the semeiotic potentialities of experience, in so far as the same types of indexical existences enter different systems of interactions with the human beings. Furthermore, in relation to the problem of truth, I show not only that Peirce’s and Dewey’s stances are not so distant as it scholars used to think, but also that their verificationism cannot be equated to the doctrines of the logical positivists. Peirce’s and Dewey’s doctrine of truth cannot even be interpreted as implying a “plastic” conception of truth, as it was maybe in the case of F. C. S. Schiller and William James. Although different in some details, Peirce’s and Dewey’s theory of truth does not state that true propositions are only those propositions that are experientially verified (now or in an indefinitely distant future), but that true propositions are those propositions that would be indefinitely verified (or non-falsified) on the basis of experience if all the necessary epistemic conditions occurred. In Chapter 5, which is the last chapter of the dissertation, I provide a critical reconstruction of Dewey’s theory of practical, moral judgment and his ethical contextualism. In fact, according to Dewey, practical judgment is the locus in which moral normativity emerges as such. This point is even more important if we think that Dewey’s proposal represents the most articulated example of an account of practical deliberation in the pragmatist tradition. Somehow differently from Peirce, for Dewey the primary locus of exercise of deliberation is more the context of particular situations rather than the ultimate ideals (however, I am talking here of a nuanced difference in stress, without claiming that the two tendencies are mutually exclusive; as a matter of fact, both of them are present in Peirce and Dewey). After providing an overview of Dewey’s theory of the habits of action, I focus on the logical structure of moral deliberation in its various <b>discursive</b> <b>components</b> (experience of the problem, articulation of the problem, hypothesis of solution, final judgment/concrete act, passage from “is” to “ought”), including its virtues (rigor, epistemic productivity and creativity). Moreover, I dwell upon the non-discursive factors in deliberation, in particular what Dewey calls “qualitative thought,” understood as a semeiotic activity that is not alternative but complementary to the merely proposition and discursive dimensions of deliberation. It has also been usually claimed that the fact that Dewey speaks of practical deliberation as “construction of good” implies some for of anti-realism about values, or even some sort of moral sub...|$|R
