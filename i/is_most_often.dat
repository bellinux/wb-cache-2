5|$|Copper(III) <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> {{found in}} oxides. A simple example is {{potassium}} cuprate, KCuO2, a blue-black solid. The most extensively studied copper(III) compounds are the cuprate superconductors. Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7) consists of both Cu(II) and Cu(III) centres.

Both copper(III) and even copper(IV) fluorides are known, K3CuF6 and Cs2CuF6, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it may even be reduced to a small shrub.|$|E

One of the most widely distributed Banksia species, it occurs between Victoria and Central Queensland in a broad range of habitats, from coastal dunes to mountains. It is highly variable in form, but <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82ft) in height. Its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in zinc ores, and it <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. In the 1970s, the output of cadmium was 6.5 pounds per ton of zinc. Zinc sulfide ores are roasted {{in the presence of}} oxygen, converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated from the electrolysis solution.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can {{be subject}} to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This {{condition}} <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to examine representations of male characters and masculinity in Disney animated feature films. Social learning theory, gender and hegemonic masculinity were used to theoretically frame this study. Twenty-two movies were examined; a total of ninety-one characters {{were included in the}} analysis. The movies included in the sample were produced between 1930 and 2007. This study sought to examine the dimensions of character descriptions, physical descriptions, socioeconomic status, sexuality, family structures and practices, and aggression as well as to understand how constructions of masculinity in Disney films changed over time. The {{results of the present study}} regarding character role indicate that good characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> middle aged, slender and fit but not muscular, single, royalty, and had community as family. They <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> heterosexual, equally likely to be romantically involved as to be not romantically involved, were sexual in nature, and <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> the victims of physical aggression. Evil characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> middle aged, slender and fit but not muscular, single, royalty, had community as family, and were well dressed. Evil characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> likely to trap other characters and to steal. Neutral characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> old/elderly, overweight and not muscular, and <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> employed as inventors, royalty, and diamond miners. They <b>were</b> also <b>most</b> <b>often</b> single and to have community as family. The results regarding character centrality indicated that central characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> white, slender and fit but not muscular, single, middle aged, showed physical strength, and were well dressed compared to peripheral characters. Central characters were heterosexual, romantically involved, sexual in nature, engaged in hand to hand fighting, and engaged in social isolation and name calling. Peripheral characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> white, slender and fit but not muscular, single, and also more likely than central characters to be old/elderly. For the analysis of masculinity across time, it was found that the types of masculinity shown in Disney films did not match with hegemonic masculinity historically. Overall, the most common theme of masculinity that was observed throughout all decades was the fatherhood movement...|$|R
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|Falafel are fried balls or patties of spiced, mashed chickpeas or {{fava beans}} {{and are a}} common Middle Eastern street food that have become {{identified}} with Israeli cuisine. Falafel <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> served in a pita, with pickles, tahina, hummus, cut vegetable salad and often, harif, a hot sauce, the type used depending {{on the origin of}} the falafel maker. Variations include green falafel, which include parsley and coriander, red falafel made with filfel chuma, yellow falafel made with turmeric, and falafel coated with sesame seeds.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is {{most common in}} the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
