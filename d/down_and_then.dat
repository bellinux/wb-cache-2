5|$|At Issus in 333BC, {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Darius, {{he used the}} same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels {{to break up the}} phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 as the work of the Devil. In the Middle Ages, the Church had drawn-out discussions as to when the desire for martyrdom was suicidal, {{as in the case of}} martyrs of Córdoba. Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe, even for the times: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.|$|E
5|$|The Andriamboninolona (or Zanakambony), Andriandranando (or Zafinandriandranando) and Zanaralambo were {{considered}} junior nobles. They {{were excluded from}} most of the rules imposed on other noble castes and exempted from fanampoana (forced labor in lieu of monetary tax payment). Instead, they were made responsible for maintaining a key dike that supported irrigation of the capital's rice paddies, producing the silk used to make the king's clothing, and conscripting soldiers for the king's army. They were also responsible for gathering used hoes for the royal blacksmiths to melt <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> supervise the artisans as the metal was crafted into nails, shackles and other forged objects.|$|E

Jobs had died on October 5 and the release date was moved forward. The Jobs book's release had been moved forward twice; It had been moved from spring 2012 to November 21 after Jobs stepped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to the October 24 date after his death. When The Litigators debuted on November 3 on the USA Today best-seller list, which does not separate fiction and non-fiction, it debuted at number 2 behind the Jobs book.|$|E
5|$|The {{reclamation}} of Chat Moss and Trafford Moss was innovative in {{that instead}} of constructing roads to give access for the material to be dumped onto the bog, a movable light railway was developed. Narrow gauge track– which allowed {{the weight of the}} wagons to be spread evenly across an area of the bog– was temporarily laid <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> picked up and relaid elsewhere as needed. Roscoe was declared bankrupt in 1821, but the reclamation work continued under the stewardship of others who took over his leasehold interest, amongst them William Baines, the anti-Corn Law MP and owner of the Leeds Mercury newspaper.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} quarter ended in a {{scoreless}} tie, Georgia scored their first touchdown {{early in the second}} quarter. The 19-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Murray to Jay Rome was set up by a fake punt earlier in the drive that gave the Bulldogs a 7–0 lead. After each team again traded punts, Alabama drove the ball to the Bulldogs' one-yard line. However, Eddie Lacy fumbled on second <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> McCarron threw an interception in the endzone to Sanders Commings to end the drive. The Crimson Tide forced another punt on the next Bulldogs possession and Alabama responded on the drive that ensued with their first touchdown of the game on a 41-yard Lacy run that tied the game 7–7. On the next drive, Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix intercepted a Murray pass and returned it to the Georgia 47-yard line with just over 1:00 left in the half. Five plays later, Jeremy Shelley connected on a 22-yard field goal as time expired and gave the Crimson Tide a 10–7 halftime lead.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E

25|$|Hinged foot irons may be {{bolted to}} the sides of the wagon. To lock the wagon in place, the free ends of the foot iron hinges are folded <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> secured to the stage with stage screws. This is a {{reliable}} method for immobilizing wagons, but it creates holes in the stage and can slow the process of locking and unlocking a wagon. Also, if a foot iron is allowed to contact the stage while the wagon is being moved, the stage floor can be damaged.|$|E
25|$|The Lions started strongly, with captain Gareth Thomas {{scoring a}} try under the posts and Jonny Wilkinson {{converting}} two minutes in. A minute later, Wilkinson hit the post with a penalty attempt, but gathering the rebound the Lions {{were in a}} good attacking position when Paul O'Connell was penalised for diving over a ruck. The All Blacks settled <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> scored through two Daniel Carter penalties before he set up their first try, racing 50 metres off a turnover before offloading to captain Tana Umaga to score near the posts. Although {{the rest of the}} half remained close, the All Blacks went into the break with a 21–13 lead.|$|E

25|$|Denny then {{approached}} (or {{was approached}} by) Nelson Paul Whittier, grandson of famous California Quaker pioneer, John Greenleaf Whittier. The two formed Reginald Denny Industries in 1935 {{to develop a}} new radio controlled model, and were joined by electronics engineer Kenneth Case. For the next three years they attempted to produce a design known as the Radioplane One, or RP-1, essentially a greatly enlarged model airplane, complete with a fuselage area that included the step where a windscreen was in a real aircraft. The control system was based on a telephone dial: dial 4 for elevator <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> 2 to stop the motion. Due to the latencies in the system, the aircraft were found to be almost uncontrollable.|$|E
25|$|In May 1972 it was {{announced}} by the team {{that he had been}} dropped from the STP-March Formula 3 team and replaced by Jochen Mass. When Hunt attempted to contact March, he was unable to get any response from his employers. Hunt decided to consult Chris Marshall, his former team manager, who explained that a spare car was available. This followed a period characterised by a series of mechanical failures. Hunt decided, against the express instructions of March director Max Mosley, to race at Monaco in a March from a different team. This had been vacated by driver Jean-Claude Alzerat, after Hunt's own March had first broken <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> been hit by another competitor in a practice lap.|$|E
25|$|The Helvellyn range runs broadly {{north to}} south for about 7miles, {{remaining}} above 2,000ft (600m) throughout its length. Helvellyn itself sits near the centre of this ridge and displays the characteristic form {{of many of these}} fells, namely smooth grassy slopes to the west and shattered rock to the east. Helvellyn sends out two eastward arêtes, razor-thin ridges between deep mountain corries. The southerly spur is Striding Edge, easily the most famous ridge in the district, and its northern partner is Swirral Edge. From the summit plateau of Helvellyn a rough slope drops to the start of Swirral Edge, and this narrow ridge curves gracefully <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> back up over half a mile, terminating at Catstye Cam.|$|E

25|$|During the dermal closure, the nipple-areola {{complex is}} {{transposed}} {{to its new}} locale, {{as determined by the}} skin pedicle. To create the curvilinear scar, the deep dermal closure is accomplished by rotating the lateral flap <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> medially. The deep dermis is approximated (joined) with sutures, in a simple, interrupted fashion. The key suture is emplaced at the junction where the apex of the vertical incision meets the nipple-areola complex—because it is the skin area of the breast subject to the greatest tension(s). The subcutaneous dermal closure is effected with interrupted sutures. As required, the final adjustments before suturing the skin closed, might include either micro-liposuction or additional de-epithelialization. After the dermal closure, a suture is emplaced to achieve the continuous approximation of the nipple-areola complex to the adjacent skin edge, and to the lower skin incisions.|$|E
25|$|After another Buffalo punt, Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson {{completed}} an 18-yard pass to Ross {{to give his}} team a first down on the Bills 41-yard line. Cincinnati eventually drove inside the 10, but the Bills made a key defensive stand, as defensive end Ken Johnson sacked Anderson at the 15 on third <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Robb Riddick leaped {{high in the air}} to block Jim Breech's 33-yard field goal attempt. This seemed to spark Buffalo's offense, which subsequently picked up three first downs on a drive to the Bengals 30-yard line, but they also came up empty when linebacker Bo Harris intercepted Ferguson's pass and returned it 16 yards to the 24. Following a Bengals punt, Ferguson's 54-yard completion to Jerry Butler set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Joe Cribbs, cutting the score to 14–7 by halftime.|$|E
25|$|Sequoyah first {{taught the}} syllabary to his six-year old daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka), {{because he could}} not find adults willing to learn it. He {{traveled}} to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansaw Territory where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him. Sequoyah asked each leader to say a word, which he wrote <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.|$|E
