40|$|This Article uses an {{empirical}} study to test whether, {{in the absence}} of a will, beneficiary designations in will substitutes provide reliable evidence for approximating decedents 2 ̆ 7 <b>donative</b> <b>intent</b> in an intestacy statute. No previous scholarship has explored the relationship between will-substitute beneficiary designations and intestacy statutes. We set out to investigate public attitudes about will substitutes and determine if the public prefers current law, which ignores will substitutes when determining the disposition of a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s property passing by intestate succession, or a statutory pattern that takes into account beneficiary designations found in a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s will substitutes. We are mindful that the import of will-substitute designations can be ambiguous when it comes to imputing intent with regard to an intestate decedent 2 ̆ 7 s probate estate. Our project, therefore, investigates under what circumstances and in what ways, if at all, decedents make known their <b>donative</b> <b>intent</b> with respect to their probate estates by naming a beneficiary in a will substitute...|$|E
40|$|The Article {{addresses}} the frequently litigated {{issue of the}} ownership of joint bank accounts that elderly people may have opened to protect against incapacity or to avoid FDIC insurance limits on single accounts. Despite the strong possibility of these non-donative motives, most states—by statute or court decision—award the accounts to the surviving co-tenants instead of the depositors’ heirs or will beneficiaries. This occurs even when the account contract did not contain language of survivorship and even {{when there is no}} evidence that the depositor was offered a contract that would have allowed him or her to choose an agency arrangement. The author argues that these presumptions in favor of survivorship rights exist because of a faulty analogy to other will substitutes such as life insurance, where <b>donative</b> <b>intent</b> is clear. The author also examines the few statutory account forms that purport to allow depositors to express various intents. These forms are hopelessly complex for a depositor without legal training and propose a simpler deposit account agreement that would allow a depositor to clearly indicate whether <b>donative</b> <b>intent</b> exists...|$|E
40|$|Intestacy {{statutes}} seek {{to further}} donative freedom by effectuating the attributed intent {{of those who}} fail to execute a valid estate plan during life. One might reasonably hypothesize that gay men and lesbians, on the whole, differ from the non-gay majority {{with respect to their}} <b>donative</b> <b>intent.</b> The fundamental difference in romantic and affectional preferences between gay people and non-gay people is likely to produce such a disparate <b>donative</b> <b>intent.</b> Much anecdotal evidence and recent empirical evidence strongly support this hypothesis. Article II of the Uniform Probate Code presently ignores the existence of gay men and lesbians, despite the drafters 2 ̆ 7 expressed effort to recognize the changing nature of the American family. Article II would better implement its principal goal of promoting donative freedom, however, if its intestacy provisions were redrafted to implement the attributed intent of gay men and lesbians. Such inclusion could be implemented consistent with the 1990 Code 2 ̆ 7 s desire for simplicity and certainty in succession law by utilizing a registration system for qualification of committed partners, a multi-factor approach that limits judicial discretion through objective requirements and clearly delineated factors for qualification or a combination of these two systems. Succession reform to include same-sex committed partners also would remove the badge of inferiority that Article II presently places on gay men and lesbians and their relationships. By failing to recognize the fundamental difference between gay people and non-gay people with respect to donative preferences, Article II implies that gay and lesbian relationships are insignificant or unsuitable for recognition. This implicit expression is made all the more pronounced in light of the lack of any justification for same-sex exclusion deriving from the principles of succession law on which the drafters grounded the 1990 Code...|$|E

40|$|The {{gift tax}} is {{imposed on the}} 2 ̆ 2 {{transfer}} of property by gift. 2 ̆ 2 The term gift is not expressly defined either in the Code or in the Treasury Regulations. However, section 2512 (b), dealing with the valuation of gifts, states that 2 ̆ 2 where property is transferred for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money 2 ̆ 7 s worth, 2 ̆ 2 {{the difference between the}} value of the property transferred and the consideration received constitutes a gift. Thus, for gift tax purposes, the determination of whether a gift was made does not turn so much on the intent of the transferor as it does on the mechanics of the transfer ­ whether property was transferred without full and adequate consideration in money and money 2 ̆ 7 s worth. The absence of <b>donative</b> <b>intent</b> still can be a significant factor...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophySchool of Family Studies and Human ServicesSonya BrittThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to investigate}} the determinants that explain and predict Christian’s intentions to make lifetime gifts to charities. The research was guided by the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) utilizing an expanded model that anticipated Christians who have (a) a favorable attitude toward giving, (b) a perceived pressure from social norms, (c) high levels of perceived behavioral control in their ability to make gifts, (d) a positive moral responsibility toward charitable giving, (e) a history of charitable giving, and (f) a faith based spiritual desire to pursue the Christian way of life would be more inclined to have giving intentions. Survey data were obtained through two pilot studies and a main study (N = 250). The pilot study participants were recruited through the researcher’s social network. The main study participants were enlisted through a contract with Qualtrics, an online survey organization that maintains panels of likely research subjects. Hierarchical linear regression identified support for traditional and expanded models of the theory of planned behavior. In the traditional model, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, all predicted <b>donative</b> <b>intent.</b> In the expanded model, not moral norms, past behavior, and the Christian way of life predicted donating intentions; however, perceived behavioral control a significant predictor in the traditional model, did not predict <b>donative</b> <b>intent.</b> The traditional theory of planned behavior accounted for 65 %, and expanded predictors added 11 % to the explanation of intention to donate to non-profit organizations in the coming year. The current research has both theoretical and applied implications. Consistent with Fishbein and Ajzen’s (2010) encouragement to improve the traditional model, the expanded model enhanced the predictive ability of the theory of planned behavior with a new determinant, the Christian way of life. The current research also reaffirms the predictive ability of the previously tested factor past behavior and not moral norms. Non-profit organizations may apply these findings by targeting the salient beliefs that are foundational to all predictors of intentions. The current research has identified beliefs associated with attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioral control, moral norms, past behavior, and the Christian way of life that offer non-profit organizations educational opportunities to intervene with donors to improve charitable behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{organizing}} principle of American succession law — testamentary freedom — gives decedents a nearly unrestricted right {{to dispose of}} property. After surveying the justifications for testamentary freedom, I examine {{the circumstances in which}} it may be socially beneficial for courts to alter wills, trusts, and other gratuitous transfers at death: imperfect information, negative externalities, and intergenerational equity. These justifications correspond with many existing limitations on the freedom of testation. Yet, disregarding donor intent to maximize the donees’ ex post interests, an increasingly common justification for intervention, is socially undesirable. Doing so ignores important ex ante considerations, including a donor’s happiness, a donor’s incentive to work, save, and invest, and the structure and timing of a donor’s gifts. If donors believe courts may not facilitate their intent, donors may be less happy, accumulate less property, and alter gifts during life. Moreover, because the law often affects donor behavior, ignoring <b>donative</b> <b>intent</b> to benefit particular donees may harm not only the donors but also donees as a class. Thus, the living may themselves benefit if the law allows a certain degree of “dead hand” control...|$|E
40|$|Innovation in the {{computer}} software industry over the past 15 years increased at a frantic pace {{thanks in part to}} the Open Source Software movement. This community of software developers uses legal methodologies to enforce rights and induce others to follow their lead and with openness has come more innovation. The Free Software Foundation’s General Public License (GPL) in particular embodies this spirit and uses a kind of recursive philanthropy or an Open Source-only sandbox, which requires other developers to create their software under licenses with compatible philosophies. How the propagation of these licenses effects innovation in the software industry is the subject of this paper. This inquiry will examine methods used in other industries that embody similar propagation devices from which subsequent Open Source licenses could benefit, proposing that Open Source must balance the risk Open Source companies face with the basic <b>donative</b> <b>intent</b> of the community to continue to offer a cohesive doctrine other developers will continue to follow. In light of the most recent version of the GPL, this paper examines the drafting and revision process the community undertook and will examine what compromises resulted. This process, while a groundbreaking step for the community, necessarily creates new issues to be resolved and may be more reactionary to current events than necessary to support the community’s goals of greater innovation...|$|E
40|$|In the December 2008 {{issue of}} the Boston University Law Review, Jeffrey Cooper {{published}} an article in which he criticized both the benefit-thebeneficiaries standard and an article of mine, published in 2004, discussing that standard. My article suggested that the clarification of the rule against capricious purposes found in the Restatement and the UTC would have a salutary effect {{in one corner of}} trust investment law, by limiting the power of a trust settlor to insist that the trustee follow investment practices that are demonstrably harmful to the interests of the beneficiaries. Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s article sounds a contrary theme of extreme deference to settlor power. He contends that trust law has allowed the settlor 2 ̆ 2 nearly unfettered latitude 2 ̆ 2 over the terms of the trust, and that trust law should 2 ̆ 2 provide no aid in cases where a settlor intentionally and thoughtfully impaired beneficiaries 2 ̆ 7 economic rights. 2 ̆ 2 The present Essay responds to Cooper. Part I examines the balance that trust law strikes between implementing the settlor 2 ̆ 7 s <b>donative</b> <b>intent</b> and protecting the interests of trust beneficiaries in the transferred property.

40|$|A {{consensus}} {{has begun}} to develop in the case law, the academic commentary, and the statutory reform movement that a testator’s provision in her will mandating arbitration of any challenge to the will should not be enforceable against a beneficiary who has not agreed to the arbitration provision, at least where the will contestant, by her contest, seeks to increase her inheritance outside the will. Grounding this consensus is the widespread understanding that a will is not a contract. This Article seeks to challenge both the understanding that the will is not a contract and the opposition to enforcement of testator-compelled arbitration provisions that arises from that understanding. This Article argues that the will {{is part of an}} implied unilateral contract between the testator and the state in which the state offers to honor the testator’s <b>donative</b> <b>intent</b> and the testator accepts and provides consideration for the offer by creating and preserving wealth. Importantly, the greater contract respecting donative freedom of which the will is a part also includes a provision providing for the distribution of an individual’s intestate property in line with that individual’s imputed intent should the individual fail to execute an effective estate plan. Similar to the testator, the property owner who has failed to make an effective estate plan accepts this offer of intestate distribution through her industry and thrift. This Article’s theory borrows from the law respecting implied unilateral contracts arising from employee handbooks in concluding that it should be of no moment that the property owner is unfamiliar with the specifics of the state probate code. Rather, the critical factor should be that the state has, through its offer to respect <b>donative</b> <b>intent,</b> created an atmosphere that is “instinct with an obligation” and that encourages diligence and the prudent management of wealth. The conclusion that the will is a contract between the testator and the state grounds this Article’s additional argument that the Federal Arbitration Act and state arbitration statutes require enforcement of a testator-compelled arbitration provision contained in a will even against a beneficiary who has not agreed to the arbitration provision. Settled arbitration law in conjunction with third-party beneficiary theory or direct benefits estoppel theory supports binding the beneficiary to the will’s arbitration contract. A virtue of this Article’s theory that the will and the intestacy statute are both clauses in a greater donative freedom contract is that the analysis escapes the limitations inherent in the dominant understanding that a will’s arbitration clause, if enforceable at all, can be enforced only against a beneficiary who seeks by her will contest to increase her inheritance under the will as opposed to circumstances in which the donee seeks to increase her intestate inheritance. According to the conventional wisdom, even if arbitration clauses are enforceable in some testamentary instruments, they govern only a narrow range of claims. This Article’s implied unilateral contract theory goes further and expands the universe of arbitrable contests. Specifically, this Article’s theory is the first theory that encompasses even a will contest that seeks to render the will a complete nullity...|$|E
