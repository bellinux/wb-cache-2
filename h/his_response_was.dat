5|$|In May 2015, a New York Times exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on {{the working}} {{conditions}} of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere {{and the health}} hazards {{to which they are}} exposed attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, in the New York Review of Books. Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that <b>his</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> industry advocacy. The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound.|$|E
5|$|Robert Urie {{completed}} his H15class mixed-traffic 4-6-0 design in 1913 and the prototype {{was built in}} August 1914. It showed a marked improvement in performance over Dugald Drummond’s LSWR T14 class 4-6-0 when tested on local and express passenger trains. The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, which prevented construction of further class members. Despite the interruption caused by the conflict, Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from London to the south-west of England. Passenger loadings on the heavy boat trains to the London and South Western Railway’s (LSWR) ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton had been increasing prior to the war, and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR’s passenger locomotive fleet. <b>His</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> to produce a modern, standard express passenger design similar to the H15.|$|E

25|$|In {{his youth}} Claudel was heavily {{influenced}} by the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud and the Symbolists. Like them, he was horrified by modern materialist views of life. Unlike most of them , <b>his</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> to embrace Catholicism. All his writings are passionate rejections {{of the idea of}} a mechanical or random universe, instead proclaiming the deep spiritual meaning of human life founded on God's all-governing grace and love.|$|E

Barbour's response was characterized by a concerted effort at evacuation, tough-minded talk on looters and an unwillingness to blame the federal government. <b>His</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> likened, favorably, to that of Rudy Giuliani {{in the wake of}} the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} <b>his</b> beliefs <b>his</b> <b>response</b> <b>is</b> clear: [...] "Simply put, I {{have never seen}} any {{evidence}} of 'God's work' in action. I've seen what people think is God's work, but which actually has perfectly natural explanations. I believe {{that most people are}} good, even when nobody's looking.

Chizmar was asked whether or not Richard Farris's initials signified that he was another manifestation of Randall Flagg; <b>his</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> “Maayyybee...

If the material is great, it will stand out on its own and find its audience. The small format that we're publishing these books in is frankly stunning, and it will definitely attract fans who may not have heard of the property otherwise." ...|$|E

In 1978, Paul Werbos wrote for the L-5 newsletter, [...] "no one expects Congress to commit us to O'Neill's concept of large-scale space habitats; people in NASA are almost paranoid about the public relations aspects of the idea". When it became clear that a government funded colonization effort was politically impossible, popular support for O'Neill's ideas started to evaporate.|$|E

You can still hear her clearly." [...] Overall, the reviewer felt it was a great debut track for the North American audience.

500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I on 28July 1914, The Oceanides languished. Wartime politics being what they were, Sibelius's music was seldom played outside the Nordic countries and the United States: in Germany, there was little demand for the music of an [...] "enemy national", while in Russia, Finns were viewed as being [...] "less than loyal subjects of the Tsar". In any case, many of Sibelius's works had been printed by German publishing houses, a detail that harmed Sibelius's reputation not only in Russia, but also Britain and the United States. According to Tawaststjerna, the war plunged Sibelius {{into a state of}} melancholy and creative struggle (the Fifth and Sixth symphonies {{were in the process of}} simultaneous gestation at this time). <b>His</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> to retreat into near solitude: he abstained from attending and giving concerts and neglected his circle of friends, and he imagined himself [...] "forgotten and ignored, a lonely beacon of light in a deepening winter darkness".|$|E

Houlding would only agree to this {{on the basis of}} a rent at a level unacceptable to the club. Negotiations having failed, the directors decided to leave Anfield and find another ground, leaving Houlding with an empty stadium. <b>His</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> to form a new football club to occupy the stadium. He attempted to retain the team name [...] "Everton" [...] by registering the name [...] "Everton Football Club and Athletic Grounds Company, Limited" [...] with Companies House, but the Football League decided that the name belonged to the departed Everton club, which acquired new premises at Goodison Park.
