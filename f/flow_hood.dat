In non-sterile compounding, a powder containment hood is required when any hazardous material (e.g. hormones) are prepared or when there is a risk of cross-contamination of the compounded product. Pharmacists preparing compounded products must comply with these requirements and others published in the Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary & Handbook.|$|E

Davis invented a new type of plant tissue culture vessel based on millipore filters for respiration, and that invention was published in Orchid Review, where it received international attention.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to Isolators, {{there are also}} extensive barriers that provide sub-isolation protection, but {{have a very good}} track record of reducing hazards to sterile drugs during processing when they are designed and operated properly. This extensive barrier is known as a restricted access barrier system, or RABS. A barrier cabinet using RABS design and control, is below the isolator in its ability to assure sterility assurance and containment, but far better than the traditional laminar air <b>flow</b> <b>hood</b> or [...] "open process" [...] designs that are progressively being phased-out by the industries. In particular, a RABS that operates only in closed-door mode after the equipment setup and sporadic disinfection is performed, is commonly used now and provides substantial risk mitigation. These [...] "closed RABS" [...] require all processing interventions to be done using gauntlet gloves attached to the RABS walls. In contrast, RABS designs that require door openings during processing would lead to more microbial contamination hazards than a RABS that is kept closed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} other devices, which can offer some helpful separation. These devices {{are known as}} Gloveboxes. Gloveboxes do not offer the separative control {{provisions}} of an isolator or RABS. Gloveboxes were originally designed for non-sterile product applications, such as weighing or manipulating a toxic drug and have a long track record for such non-sterile applications. Such gloveboxes can be very effective in preventing exposure of an operator to a toxic drug. In limited cases, {{they can also be}} used to protect a sterile product, when supplied with ISO 5 unidirectional air. However, in some notable cases, gloveboxes used for aseptic processing have provided no more sterile product protection than the traditional laminar air <b>flow</b> <b>hood</b> (LAF) design of the 1960s. In these cases, the glove boxes were problematic due to inappropriate design or controls (e.g., insufficient disinfection, transfer of contaminated materials, ingress of lower quality air into glovebox, poor design/integrity, poor transfers). However, if gloveboxes are very meticulously designed, thoroughly disinfected (e.g., using a sporadic) and carefully operated by well-trained aseptic processing personnel to prevent introduction of microbial contamination, it is possible to obtain some degree of increased sterile product protection versus the simple traditional LAF hood.|$|E

50|$|Ventilation {{systems can}} be local or general. Local exhaust {{ventilation}} operates {{at or near the}} source of contamination, often in conjunction with an enclosure. Examples of local exhaust systems include fume hoods, gloveboxes, biosafety cabinets, and vented balance enclosures. Exhaust hoods lacking an enclosure are less preferable, and laminar <b>flow</b> <b>hoods</b> are not recommended because they direct air outwards towards the worker. General exhaust ventilation operates on an entire room through a building's HVAC system. It is inefficient and costly as compared to local exhaust ventilation, and should not be relied upon for controlling exposure, although it can provide negative room pressure to prevent contaminants from exiting the room. Several control verification techniques can be used with ventilation systems, including pitot tubes, hot-wire anemometers, smoke generators, tracer-gas leak testing, and standardized testing and certification procedures.|$|R

25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air <b>flow</b> filters and <b>hoods</b> to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air <b>flow</b> <b>hoods</b> and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction.

Sample size: 60 individual IV preparations, 20 {{for the control group}} and 20 per test group. METHODS: Sixty agar plates were made. The IV preparations for the control group were compounded with aseptic technique: washing hands with soap and water, wearing gloves, cleaning all ports with alcohol, and working in a laminar <b>flow</b> <b>hood.</b> A syringe was used to inject the water from the vial into the IV bag. This procedure was repeated in the same manner for Group A (no use of laminar <b>flow</b> <b>hood)</b> and Group B (no swiping of the injection ports with an alcohol swab), minus the aseptic technique in question. Once all 60 IV preparations were completed, a sterile inoculation tool was used to obtain a sample from the port of the IV bag. The plates were then inoculated. RESULTS: When compared to the control group, microbial growth in Group A was not significant (p= 0. 14). The contamination rate for Group B was also not significant (p= 0. 07).

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the computational modelling of low pressure (LP) steam turbine exhaust <b>hood</b> <b>flows.</b> A test case for LP last stage blades (LSBs) {{with a full}} aerodynamic definition and an accompanying exhaust hood was developed which is representative of current industrial practice. The test case geometry is freely available allowing other researchers to build on this work and {{is the first of}} its kind. Studies on this Durham Stage and Exhaust Hood Test Case showed the geometry produces a representative flow pattern and performance metrics comparable to other published research. Using the test case, the effect of condenser cooling water pressure gradient on the <b>hood</b> <b>flow</b> was computed for the first time. A generic boundary condition was developed to represent the transverse condenser cooling water flow and, when applied to the test case, was shown to have a larger influence on the flow asymmetry within the hood than the tip leakage jet. This thesis describes the first application of the non-linear harmonic (NLH) method to couple the LSBs to the exhaust hood. This method enabled the circumferential non-uniformity which develops in the exhaust hood to be transferred across the interface to the stage, in half the computational demand of the full annulus frozen rotor approach. The first review of the influence of inlet circumferential asymmetry on the <b>hood</b> <b>flow</b> field highlighted that modelling its effect is not as crucial as indicated in the literature, unless the diffuser axial length is very compact or if off-design flows are to be studied.

In 2012 burns hospitalized 40, 000 people and over 17, 000 people received organ transplants. Sadly, the number of organ donors greatly lags {{the number of people}} on the transplant waiting list and the gap has widened over the decades. While preventative health care is extremely important, researching tissue engineering (TE) to treat patients in fatal condition provides alternatives for replacing or repairing a variety of damaged tissue. These alternative treatments can considerably reduce the supply-demand gap for transplant organs and hopefully reduce the cost of such procedures in the future. Breakthroughs in TE such as tracheal transplants, porcine heart valves, dermal tissue, and others show substantial potential in the medical field.

40|$|To {{assess whether}} houses can meet {{performance}} expectations, the new practice of residential commissioning will likely use flow hoods to measure supply and return grille airflows in HVAC systems. Depending on hood accuracy, these measurements {{can be used}} to determine if individual rooms receive adequate airflow for heating and cooling, to determine flow imbalances between different building spaces, to estimate total air handler flow and supply/return imbalances, and to assess duct air leakage. This paper discusses these <b>flow</b> <b>hood</b> applications and the accuracy requirements in each case. Laboratory tests of several residential flow hoods showed that these hoods can be inadequate to measure flows in residential systems. Potential errors are about 20 % to 30 % of measured flow, due to poor calibrations, sensitivity to grille flow non-uniformities, and flow changes from added flow resistance. Active flow hoods equipped with measurement devices that are insensitive to grille airflow patterns have an order of magnitude less error, and are more reliable and consistent in most cases. Our tests also show that current calibration procedures for flow hoods do not account for field application problems. As a result, a new standard for <b>flow</b> <b>hood</b> calibration needs to be developed, along with a new measurement standard to address field use of flow hoods.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} for some decades that {{it is essential to}} accurately represent the strong coupling between the last stage blades (LSB) and the diffuser inlet, in order to correctly capture the flow through the exhaust hoods of steam turbine low pressure cylinders. This applies to any form of simulation of the flow, i. e., numerical or experimental. The exhaust <b>hood</b> <b>flow</b> structure is highly three-dimensional and appropriate coupling will enable the important influence of this asymmetry to be transferred to the rotor. This, however, presents challenges as the calculation size grows rapidly when the full annulus is calculated. The size of the simulation means researchers are constantly searching for methods to reduce the computational effort without compromising solution accuracy. However, this can result in excessive computational demands in numerical simulations. Unsteady full-annulus CFD calculation will remain infeasible for routine design calculations for the foreseeable future. More computationally efficient methods for coupling the unsteady rotor <b>flow</b> to the <b>hood</b> <b>flow</b> are required that bring computational expense within realizable limits while still maintaining sufficient accuracy for meaningful design calculations. Research activity in this area is focused on developing new methods and techniques to improve accuracy and reduce computational expense. A novel approach for coupling the turbine last stage to the exhaust hood employing the nonlinear harmonic (NLH) method is presented in this paper. The generic, IP free, exhaust hood and last stage blade geometries from Burton et al. (2012. “A Generic Low Pressure Exhaust Diffuser for Steam Turbine Research,”Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo, Copenhagen, Denmark, Paper No. GT 2012 - 68485) that are representative of modern designs, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. This is achieved by comparing results obtained with the NLH to those obtained with a more conventional mixing-plane approach. The results show that the circumferential asymmetry can be successfully transferred in both directions between the exhaust <b>hood</b> <b>flow</b> and that through the LSB, by using the NLH. This paper also suggests that for exhaust hoods of generous axial length, little change in Cp is observed when the circumferential asymmetry is captured. However, the predicted flow structure is significantly different, which will influence the design and placement of the exhaust hood internal “furniture. ...|$|R
