Rapid discolouration of leaf, stem and root tissue after injury and strong pigmentation of tissue extracts indicate that PPO and phenolic compounds are ubiquitous in vegetative tissue of banana as well. They hamper biochemical and molecular studies in banana, as cumbersome adaptations of extraction protocols are required. On the other hand, PPO and phenolic compounds could be {{an important part of}} the plant's defence system against pests and diseases, including root parasitic nematodes. To facilitate future studies in this area, extraction and assay conditions for PPO from roots of banana (Musa acuminata AAA, Grande naine) were optimized. Highest enzyme activities were obtained in a 0. 2 M phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0 with 5 % <b>insoluble</b> <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> and 0. 25 % Triton X- 100. The lowest Km values were obtained for dopamine and D-catechin. Monophenolase activity was shown with p-cresol. Banana root PPO was strongly inhibited by dithiothreitol and sodium metabisulfite. In root sections, oxidation of dopamine strongly co-localized with aerenchyma in the cortex.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Chemically defined {{liquid media}} were devised which {{supported}} excellent growth of Taphrina cerasi and T. deformans. When grown in fermentation culture vessels, T. cerasi and T. deformans released cytokinins into the liquid media.

Paper chromatography in four solvent systems revealed that T. cerasi produced compounds which have migration patterns similar to zeatin, zeatin riboside, N⁶-(Δ²-isopentenyl) adenine (2 iP), and N⁶-(Δ²-isopentenyl) adenosine (2 iPA) in each of the solvent systems. T. deformans produced a zeatin-like compound, a cytokinin with chromatographic properties similar to 2 iP, and a third cytokinin whose migration pattern did not correspond to any of the common cytokinin standards. The soybean tissue assay was used to calculate the concentration of cytokinin released by the fungi into the culture media. The amount of cytokinin produced by T. cerasi was calculated to be approximately 45 μ. g KE/liter of medium, while the amount released by T. deformans was found to be about 75 μg KE/liter. <b>Insoluble</b> <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> was effective in the partial purification of cytokinin-like substances in extracts of the fungal liquid culture medium.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years we have been confronted with the need to use {{herbarium}} specimens in the molecular phylogeny studies, since it is generally difficult to obtain living material of some rare species. Ancient DNA has been sequenced, and there are also reports on successful DNA amplification from herbarium specimens. However, {{it is not easy to}} obtain amplified DNA from the first herbarium sample tested. In this paper, experiments are described about trials of DNA amplification from two to 151 -year-old herbarium specimens of plant species we needed for our projects. Of the 17 herbarium samples tested only two allowed DNA amplification under standard DNA isolation conditions. Different types of PCR inhibiting activities were demonstrated in DNA extracts. In some of the extracts there was extremely low concentration of template with satisfactory quality. In some instances, PCR inhibiting activities were successfully removed by treating them either with <b>insoluble</b> <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> or by adding bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the amplification mixture. However, some PCR-inhibiting activities were resistant to the treatments described above. When the concentration of template was very low, a second PCR amplification with internal primers was necessary to increase the amount of DNA for sequencing. Nevertheless, contamination of either DNA extract or amplification mixture were sometimes observed, and consequently precautions were taken to minimize them. Finally, successful amplification was obtained in eight samples out of the 17 examined...|$|E

Mixing the mature root extract with that of the root tip promoted the inactivation of nitrate reductase in the latter. The inactivating factor in the mature root was separated from nitrate reductase by (NH 4) 2 SO 4 precipitation. Nitrate reductase was found in the 40 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 precipitate, while the inactivating factor was largely precipitated by 40 to 55 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The latter fraction of the mature root inactivated the nitrate reductase isolated from the root tip, mature root, and scutellum. The inactivating factor, which has a Q 10 15 to 25 C of 2. 2, was heat labile, and hence has been designated as a nitrate reductase inactivating enzyme. The reduced flavin mononucleotide nitrate reductase was also inactivated, while an NADH cytochrome c reductase in nitrate-grown seedlings was inactivated but at a slower rate. The inactivating enzyme had no influence on the activity of nitrite reductase, glutamate dehydrogenase, xanthine oxidase, and isocitrate lyase.

The pyrophosphate was used to determine the activity of extracellular-humic-bound proteins, while the phosphate buffer and potassium sulphate were used to extract dissolved extracellular proteins. The latter extractant, after chloroform fumigation, was also used to measure total proteins in soil. A preliminary screening, using SDS-PAGE in one dimension, was also carried out in order to optimize the separation condition of soil proteins extracted with different buffers. To remove the interfering co-extracted substances (humic acid) a purification step using a column packed with <b>insoluble</b> <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> was performed. The highest beta-glucosidase activity was recovered in the pyrophosphate extract, thus confirming its capability of extracting humic-bound beta-glucosidase enzyme in a stable and active form. The extractants performed differently with the two soil types and band patterns obtained with SDS-PAGE were extractant-specific, demonstrating that each was selective for a particular class of proteins. Surprisingly, protein bands were also obtained using pyrophosphate, in spite of the very dark extract colour due to the presence of humic substances. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Olive oil {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} known {{vegetable}} oils. It is a product with major importance for the diet and the economy of Greece. One of its most important quality problems is oxidative rancidity due the oxidation of compounds and formation of new compounds. In this thesis a study of oxidative enzyme, peroxidase, of virgin olive oil and mature olive fruits, from which the oil is produced, is presented. Oxidative enzyme activities be transferred in virgin olive oil during the olive extraction process and thus they could affect the quality of the oil during storage. In this respect a partial characterization of peroxidase (POD) activity in greek oil producing olives (Olea europea, koroneiki variety) has been undertaken and the presence of this enzyme activity in virgin olive oil samples was confirmed. Active POD extracts were obtained using <b>insoluble</b> <b>poly(vinylpyrrolidone)</b> in 50 mM phosphate, pH 6. 0 and further purified by ammonium sulphate fractionation and Sephacryl gel permeation chromatography. Olive fruit POD showed a molecular mass of 44 ± 1. 4 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis of the gel filtration peaks showing POD activity under reducing conditions revealed that the low MW POD activity peak shows a major protein band of 43. 7 kDa suggesting that POD studied in the present thesis is composed by a single polypeptide chain. POD of olives expressed catalytic activity with ABTS (2, 2 ΄-azino-bis (3 -ethylbenz-thiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid)), DMPD (N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine) and some phenolic substrates of olives and olive oils (protocatechuic, gallic and caffeic acid). However the enzyme was found ineffective with oleuropein, the major polyphenol of olives, as well as with coumaric, ferulic, ascorbic p-hydroxy benzoic acid (monophenolic substarates). pH optimum of the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation was depended on the substrate used and it was varied from 4. 0 to 6. 0. The enzyme retained full activity when stored for 1 - 2 months at - 18 oC in presence of glycerol 50 % (v/v). For each substrate examined, Km and Vmax values have been determined. Accordingly, we observed that the efficiency of olives POD catalysis depends strongly on the chemical nature of the substrate oxidized. From the Arrhenius plot, the activation energy was estimated 37. 9 kJ / mol. Activity assays at different temperature, 30 - 60 oC, indicated a significant catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Olive peroxidase shows significant thermal stability. The addition of SDS decreased the peroxidase activity of olives, therefore olive peroxidase is probably present in a soluble form. Moreover, we found that oleuropein, 4 -methyl catechol and SDS drastically inhibited ABTS peroxidation by the olives POD preparation with an IC 50 value of 47 μM 22 and 218 μM, respectively. Oleuropein is the bitter secoiridoid polyphenolic glucoside acts as free radical scavenger and inhibits free radical production. Sample of virgin olive oils have been also examined for the presence of proteins and peroxidase activity. The peroxidase activity corresponds to molecules with protein nature, as releaved by experiments of thermal inactivation and proteolysis. [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Procedures were {{developed}} for assaying the biosynthesis of (-) - kaurene-¹⁴C and other intermediates in gibberellin (GA) synthesis from mevalonic acid-¹⁴C in cell-free enzyme extracts of immature pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Alaska) seeds. This system was utilized to investigate three aspects of GA biosynthesis: (1) apparent capacities for (-) -kaurene biosynthesis in extracts of pea seeds {{at various stages}} of development; (2) localization of the enzymes which catalyze (-) - kaurene biosynthesis in immature pea seeds; and (3) further metabolism of (-) -kaurene in extracts of immature pea seeds. It was readily demonstrated that mevalonic acid was incorporated into (-) -kaurene and also into squalene (identification tentative) in extracts of immature seeds. The synthesis of (-) -kaurene was shown to be approximately linear with time through 75 minutes at 30 °C, to vary directly with enzyme concentration, and {{to be dependent on}} ATP. Both Mg² ⁺and Mn²⁺ stimulated the reaction, but Mn²⁺ was a much better activator than Mg²⁺. The optimum pH was 7. 1. The capacity to convert mevalonic acid to (-) -kaurene, as measured in cell-free extracts, was found to vary markedly with the stage of seed development. Using enzyme extracts prepared from seeds at different stages of development, it was observed that the activity increased from a very low initial level to a maximum at about 13 days after anthesis, or when the seeds had attained about halfmaximum fresh weight. Comparative assays of (-) -kaurene biosynthesis and accumulation in cell-free extracts of excised seed coats, cotyledons and embryonic shoot-root axes revealed that the enzymes responsible for (-) -kaurene biosynthesis apparently are localized exclusively in the cotyledons. The rates of (-) -kaurene biosynthesis in extracts of isolated cotyledons were higher than those observed in extracts of whole seeds. The enzymes responsible for the synthesis of squalene were present in both the seed coats and the cotyledons. The enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of (-) -kaurene from meva- Ionic acid were present in the soluble fraction of these extracts, whereas one preliminary experiment indicated that the enzymes catalyzing (-) -kaurene oxidation were localized in a microsomal fraction. The rates of (-) -kaurene synthesis and accumulation were greater in the 100, 000 x g supernatant fraction than in the 40, 000 x g supernatant fraction of extracts of excised cotyledons, whereas the opposite relationship was observed with extracts of whole seeds. Repeated efforts to demonstrate cell-free metabolism of exogenous (-) -kaurene resulted in uniformly negative results. However, when (-) -kaurene was formed in situ from mevalonic acid in cell-free mixtures containing 10, 000 x g supernatant from cotyledon extracts, its oxidation was observed. The metabolism of (-) -kaurene formed in situ was enzymic, or at least heat labile, and was markedly sensitive to inhibition by carbon monoxide. The difference in (-) -kaurene accumulation between carbon monoxide-inhibited preparations and noninhibited preparations was greater in extracts which were prepared by homogenizing the tissues in the presence of <b>insoluble</b> <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> (PVP) than in extracts prepared without PVP. Although these results are not considered to provide direct evidence, they are interpreted to mean that (-) -kaurene metabolism in these extracts is protected from inhibition by insoluble PVP. The inability of the enzyme extracts to metabolize exogenous (-) -kaurene remains incompletely understood. Two possible reasons for this failure are: (a) binding of the (-) -kaurene to non-catalytic protein; and (b) a possible requirement in this system for some intimate functional association between the enzyme systems catalyzing (-) -kaurene biosynthesis and the enzyme systems catalyzing (-) - kaurene oxidation. Particular significance is ascribed to the latter possibility on the basis of limited indirect evidence. The products formed from mevalonic acid in the experiments designed to investigate the metabolism of (-) -kaurene formed in situ were isolated and tentatively identified as geranylgeraniol, (-) -kaurenol, (-) -kaurenal, and (-) -kaurenoic acid. The identifity of (-) - kaurenol was confirmed by co-crystallization of the radioactive product with authentic kaurenol to constant specific radioactivity. While (-) -kaurenol, (-) -kaurenal, and (-) -kaurenoic acid were synthesized from mevalonic acid-¹⁴C as the exogenous substrate, it is assumed, of course, that (-) -kaurene was a direct precursor of all three products...|$|E
40|$|The {{wide variety}} of {{phenolic}} compounds found in higher plants originate from cinnamic acid. Derivatives of this molecule are formed by two types of conversion: hydroxylation of the benzene ring, and activation of the side-chain. The first hydroxylation is para to the side-chain and gives rise to p -coumaric acid. The necessity of a carboxylic activation step prior to side-chain conversions which lead to complex phenolic compounds by reduction, esterification, andbeta;-oxidation or condensation, is suggested by thermodynamic considerations, and by analogy with simpler reactions which occur in higher plants. In this thesis the extraction of two enzymes from higher plants is described: one catalysed the para -hydroxylation of cinnamic acid, and the other the activation of cinnamic acid. Damage to the enzymes by the high concentrations of phenols and oxidising enzymes released during extraction was reduced {{by the use of}} acetone powders, the inclusion of antioxidants such as ascorbate in the extraction buffers, and the use of <b>insoluble</b> <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> as a phenolic adsorbent. The activating enzyme The work on the activating enzyme was concerned with the extraction, measurement, and characterization of an enzyme capable of catalysing the activation of cinnamic acid, distinct from the enzyme catalysing the activation of acetate. Four assays for the activating enzyme, based on the characteristics of a CoA-dependent activation proceeding through an acyl-adenylate intermediate, were developed: the hydroxamate test for activated carboxylic groups in which hydroxylamine reacts with an activated intermediate to give the hydroxamic acid, detectable either spectrophotometrically by its ability to form a purple complex with ferric ions under acidic conditions, or chromatographically, using [2 - 14 C] cinnamic acid as substrate; the measurement of the appearance of cinnamyl-CoA, which has a specific absorption maximum at 311 nm.; the measurement of cinnamate-dependent pyrophosphate exchange, which may occur when [32 P] pyrophosphate is added to the reaction system in the absence of CoA; and an estimation of the disappearance of the sulphydryl group of CoA, measured spectrophotometrically by the nitroprusside reaction. Aqueous extracts of acetone powders, and preparations made by extraction of plant material in buffers containing ascorbate, when assayed by the spectrophotometric hydroxamate assay, showed very high activity towards acetate and other aliphatic acids, but little or no activity towards cinnamate. There was some indication that ammonium sulphate fractionation gave partial separation of acetate- and cinnamate-activating systems. The two activities also displayed a different pH-dependence and a different stability. They were widely distributed in plant tissues. With enzyme preparations from leaves of spinach beet plants grown outside in a hot and dry summer, and extracted in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone, exceptionally high levels of cinnamate-activating enzyme were measured by the spectrophotometric hydroxamate assay. The activation was very sensitive to the presence of air, and to the presence and type of thiol reagents. Maximum activation occurred ion the presence of mercaptoethanol and under an atmosphere of nitrogen. In contrast, the activation of acetate was unaffected by air and by thiol reagents. After this successful series of experiments it was found impossible to repeat the extraction of high levels of cinnamate-activating enzyme from leaves of plants grown under a variety of conditions. The two sensitive radiochemical assays, and the assay for cinnamyl-CoA were therefore developed, and all plant material was grown under controlled conditions, in order to define its physiological state more exactly. Extracts low in mitochondrial content were prepared in the presence of sucrose to reduce the level of ATP-ase contamination. The pyrophosphate exchange method measured cinnamate-dependent exchange catalysed by extracts of spinach beet leaves in a few cases. This exchange was completely inhibited by Co, as in reports of other substrate-dependent exchanges catalysed by CoA-dependent enzymes. The formation of [14 C] cinnamyl-hydroxamate was catalysed by extracts prepared from a variety of plant leaves (spinach beet, Beta vulgaris; spinach, Spinacia oleracea; Runner bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, and pea, Pisum sativum). The reaction appeared to be partially inhibited by p -coumaric acid, but not by other phenolic acids. There was a clear relationship between the age of a spinach beet seedling, and the activity extracted from its leaves. The development of the cinnamate-activating enzyme was inversely related to the level of betalain pigment in the leaf, and it was greater when the plant was grown under conditions of high illumination, containing a relatively high proportion of red light. The cinnamyl-CoA assay showed activation with many of the extracts active with the [14 C] cinnamyl-hydroxamate method. It also demonstrated that the activating enzyme was not reactive towards the substituted cinnamic acids tested, that the reaction had a broad pH optimum between 7. 5 and 8. 0, and that the Km value for cinnamate was 4. 25 andtimes; 10 andminus; 3 M. This assay measured the greatest activity in enzyme preparations. Comparison between the results obtained with the different assays is difficult because they measured the time-course and extent of activation differently. Nevertheless certain conclusions can be drawn. The preliminary studies showed clearly that the cinnamate-activating system is distinct from the acetate-activating system. The more sensitive assays showed that the cinnamate-activating system is dependent on CoA, and may be specific for cinnamic acid, although p -coumaric acid also may be activated. The enzyme probably enjoys a wide distribution in higher plants but its presence is dependent on the physiological state of the plant, and may be under light control. Different assay methods measured maximum activation at different pH values, and measured different affinities of the enzyme for cinnamic acid. The pH optimum and the Km values measured by the cinnamyl-CoA assay are expected to give the true values of these parameters, since this assay measures the overall reaction in the absence of hydroxylamine, or excessive concentrations of pyrophosphate, and in the presence of CoA, which may be necessary for the full activity of the enzyme. It is also the only assay which measures an initial rate. The hydroxylating enzyme The initial studies on cinnamic acid hydroxylase were leaf disc experiments, in which formation of labelled p -coumaric acid from exogenous [2 - 14 C] cinnamic avid was demonstrated in material from spinach and spinach beet. Preliminary studies on crude extracts of cinnamic hydroxylase from the leaves of plants in which the hydroxylation has already been established by leaf disc studies, showed that little activity was measured by two different spectrophotometric assays for phenols. A method using [2 - 14 C] cinnamic acid as substrate estimated [14 C] p -coumaric acid after chromatographic separation from the substrate. The formation of p -coumaric acid was dependent on NADPH or NADH and tetrahydrofolic acid. The preference for NADPH or NADH was dependent on the type of plant extract, but no absolute specificity was found. Control values obtained with boiled extracts always gave greater radioactivity in p -coumaric acid than test values with untreated enzyme, even under optimum conditions of incubation. No completely adequate explanation for this can be offered, although some artifact in the experimental procedure is suspected, since a non-enzymic hydroxylation is unlikely. The activity which may be present, considering this limitation, is similar to the cinnamic hydroxylase activity described in several other tissues. </p...|$|E
