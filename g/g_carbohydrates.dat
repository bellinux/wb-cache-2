40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} if an insulin dose calculated {{for a meal}} containing 60 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> maintains postprandial glycaemic control for meals containing 40, 50, 70 or 80 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b> Methods: Thirty-four young people (age range 8. 5 – 17. 7 years) using intensive insulin therapy consumed five test breakfasts with equivalent fat, protein and fibre contents but differing carbohydrate quantities (40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 <b>g</b> of <b>carbohydrate).</b> The preprandial insulin dose was the same for each meal, based on the subject’s usual insulin:carbohydrate ratio for 60 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b> Continuous glucose monitoring was used to monitor postprandial glucose over 180 min. Results: The 40 -g carbohydrate meal resulted in significantly more hypoglycaemia than the other meals (P = 0. 003). There was a one in three chance of hypoglycaemia between 120 and 180 min if an insulin dose for 60 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> was given for 40 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b> The glucose levels of subjects on the 80 -g meal {{were significantly higher than}} the 60 - and 70 -g carbohydrate meals at all time points between 150 and 180 min (P < 0. 01). Subjects consuming the 80 -g meal {{were more likely to have}} significant hyperglycaemia (blood glucose levels ≥ 12 mmol/l) compared with the other meals (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: In patients using intensive insulin therapy, an individually calculated insulin dose for 60 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> results in postprandial hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia for meals containing 40 and 80 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b> To calculate mealtime insulin in order to maintain postprandial control, carbohydrate estimations should be within 10 g of the actual meal carbohydrate...|$|R

40|$|Ingesting {{carbohydrate}} plus protein following prolonged exercise may restore exercise capacity {{more effectively}} than ingestion of carbohydrate alone. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine whether this potential benefit is a consequence of the protein fraction per se or simply due to the additional energy it provides. Six active males participated in three trials, each involving a 90 -min treadmill run at 70 % maximal oxygen uptake (run 1) followed by a 4 -h recovery. At 30 -min intervals during recovery, participants ingested solutions containing: (1) 0. 8 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b> kg body mass (BM) (- 1). h(- 1) plus 0. 3 g. kg(- 1). h(- 1) of whey protein isolate (CHO- PRO); (2) 0. 8 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b> kg BM- 1. h(- 1) (CHO); or (3) 1. 1 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b> kg BM- 1. h(- 1) (CHO-CHO).

50|$|The GI {{was invented}} in 1981 by Dr Thomas Wolever and Dr David Jenkins at the University of Toronto and {{is a measure of}} how quickly a food {{containing}} 25 or 50 grams of carbohydrate raises blood-glucose levels. Because some foods typically have a low carbohydrate content, Harvard researchers created the GL, which takes into account the amount of carbohydrates in a given serving of a food and so provides a more useful measure. Liu et al. were the first to show that based on their calculation, the glycemic load of a specific food—calculated as the product of that food's carbohydrate content and its glycemic index value—has direct physiologic meaning in that each unit can be interpreted as the equivalent of 1 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> from white bread (or glucose depending on the reference used in determining the glycemic index). It became immediately apparent that such direct physiological quantification of glycemic load would allow patients with diabetes to do “glycemic load” counting as opposed to the conventional “carbohydrate counting” for monitoring the glycemic effect of foods. The concept of glycemic load addresses the concern about rating foods as good or bad {{solely on the basis of}} their glycemic index. For example, although the glycemic index for carrots is reported to be as high as 131, the glycemic load for one serving of carrots is small because the amount of carbohydrate in one serving of carrots is minimal (≈7 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate).</b> Indeed, ≈700 <b>g</b> carrots (which provides 50 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate)</b> must be consumed to produce an incremental glucose response 1.31 times that of 100 g white bread containing 50 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b>|$|R

However, these factors could also negatively affect renal function. We investigated changes in renal function after a 12 -wk resistance exercise program combined with protein supplementation in community dwelling older adults. Patients (N = 237, 73. 7 ± 5. 7 y, 58. 2 % female) participated in a 12 -wk resistance exercise program (3 times/wk) designed to increase strength and muscle mass of major muscle groups. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three dietary supplements consumed directly after training: whey protein drink (20 g whey protein, 20 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrates),</b> milk protein drink (20 g milk protein, 20 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrates),</b> or carbohydrate drink (40 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrates).</b> Renal function was estimated as glomerular filtration rate (GFR, Cockcroft-Gault formula), and dietary intake was measured as 3 -d-weighed food record at baseline and endpoint.

Carbohydrate intake increased in the carbohydrate group and protein intake increased in the milk group, both approximately in accordance with the supplementation. In the whey group, protein intake did not increase, but carbohydrate intake did. GFR increased after the intervention (+ 4. 4 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2; P < 0. 001), and the changes were similar in men and women or in the age quartiles.
