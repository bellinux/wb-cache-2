Within this confined space a certain number of creatures, mostly types which have passed away in the world below, have lived together for innumerable years. Now, it is very clear to me that in so long a period one would have expected that the carnivorous creatures, multiplying unchecked, would have exhausted their food supply and have been compelled to either modify their flesh-eating habits or die of hunger. This we see has not been so. We can only imagine, therefore, that the balance of Nature is preserved by some check which limits the numbers of these ferocious creatures. One of the many interesting problems, therefore, which await our solution is to discover what that check may be and how it operates. I venture to trust that we may have some future opportunity for the closer study of the carnivorous dinosaurs." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{case of a}} <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> {{surface in}} contact with air, {{buoyancy}} and surface tension effects will {{also play a role}} in how the convection patterns develop. Liquids flow from places of lower surface tension to places of higher surface tension. This is called the Marangoni effect. When applying heat from below, the temperature at the top layer will show temperature fluctuations. With increasing temperature, surface tension decreases. Thus a lateral flow of liquid at the surface will take place, from warmer areas to cooler areas. In order to preserve a horizontal (or nearly horizontal) liquid surface, cooler surface liquid will descend. This down-welling of cooler liquid contributes to the driving force of the convection cells. The specific case of temperature gradient-driven surface tension variations is known as thermo-capillary convection, or Bénard-Marangoni convection.|$|E

These show the characteristic features known for a real free gas including the critical point and the two phase region bound by the coexistence curve. Furthermore, the diffusion constant of dissolved hydrogen exceeds the common value for solid state systems at room temperatures by 10 orders of magnitude and therefore is comparable with that in <b>free</b> <b>liquids.</b> Thus as a first approximation hydrogen in metals can be considered to be an example for the theoretically well investigated latticegas with its phase transition to a liquid.
