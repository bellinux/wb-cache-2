40|$|Abstract. The {{iterative}} {{approach is}} important for computed tomography (CT) and attracting more and more attention with the rapid evolution of computer technology. In this paper, classic results and recent advances on iterative algorithms for image reconstruction are reviewed, {{with an emphasis on}} the ART-like and EM-like algorithms in both of their simultaneous and ordered-subset formats. The following issues are discussed: what the computational structures are, under what conditions the algorithms converge, what the <b>final</b> <b>limits</b> are, what the relaxation strategies we have, how the <b>final</b> <b>limits</b> depend on the initial guesses, and so on. In addition, heuristic arguments are given for the SART and EM algorithms for understanding the algorithms. Finally, future research directions are discussed, along with guidelines for practical applications of iterative algorithms. 1...|$|R

50|$|During {{interphase}} (G1, S, G2), Cdr2 is localized {{in a wide}} medial {{band that}} is centered on the nucleus. The C-terminus is required for correct localization; cleavage of any number of residues close to the carboxy terminus results in abnormal distribution. Pom1 phosphorylates Cdr2 on the C-terminus, and prevents it from spreading beyond the medial band. The width of the cortical band increases proportionately with {{the length of the}} growing cell; the <b>final</b> <b>limit</b> is at approximately 30% of the total cell length before the cell enters mitosis. When the cell enters mitosis, Cdr2 is distributed diffusely through the cytoplasm; there is no detectable cortical band in metaphase in anaphase.

5000|$|On 16 May, Churchill flew to Paris, with Sir John Dill, Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Hastings Ismay, {{his deputy}} as Defence Minister, and Air Marshal Joubert de la Ferté, Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. The {{delegation}} arrived in Paris {{during the afternoon}} and found the French in a state verging on paralysis. General Maurice Gamelin explained that the Germans had broken through on a 50 km front and had already advanced 60 km inward from Sedan. When Churchill asked about the strategic reserve, Gamelin replied that there was none. Churchill then inquired when and where Gamelin proposed to attack the flanks of the bulge. Gamelin replied with a hopeless shrug and the famous words: [...] "Inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority of method." [...] Six more squadrons were requested for France, above the four additional RAF squadrons which had already that morning been authorised. If the French request were heeded, it would leave just 25 squadrons for home defence, the <b>final</b> <b>limit.</b> Churchill explained that a minimum of 39 fighter squadrons was needed to defend British war industries. Bomber aircraft, he argued, would be better employed attacking the Ruhr; they were unsuitable against tanks. However, the same evening, Churchill warned his War Cabinet that more aircraft should be committed for fear that French resistance would crumble as swiftly {{as that of the}} Poles. French morale was accordingly raised, but matters were not as they seemed. The six extra squadrons were to be based in Kent and would operate from French airfields only during daylight hours. Moreover, three would fly in the mornings and three in the afternoons, and three had already been committed to France as part of Lord Gort's air power. Over the coming three to four days, the strength of the British Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) would be further reduced.|$|E

Until the MTO has been achieved, all states {{are obliged to}} adhere to an adjustment path towards this country-specific target, where the structural balance must improve at least 0.5% points per year. The MTO depicts the most adverse structural balance per year the country can afford, when targeting that debt-to-GDP ratios first decline to below 60% and subsequently remain stable below this level for the next 50 years while adjusting for the forecast change of aging related costs. Beside existence of the debt dependent minimum limits for the MTO dictated by the Fiscal Compact, there is also existence of two other calculated minimum limits for the MTO determined by a formula ensuring respectively [...] "a safety margin to respect the nominal 3%-limit during economic downturns" [...] and [...] "long-term sustainability of public finances {{taking into account the}} forecast for future adverse aging related costs". The final country-specific MTO minimum limit will be determined as the one respecting all of the three determined minimum limits (note: those non-eurozone states neither having entered ERM-II nor ratified a submission to Title III of the Fiscal Compact, are only required to respect the first two calculated minimum limits), and this <b>final</b> <b>limit</b> will be recalculated by the European Commission once every third year (most recently in October 2012).
