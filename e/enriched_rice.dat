30|$|Micronutrient {{deficiency}} or hidden hunger, is {{a global}} health problem caused by inadequate intake of essential vitamins and minerals from the diet. One in three {{people of all ages}} in the world is affected by this nutritional challenge with Fe and Zn deficiencies being the most serious (WHO 2002); however, micronutrient deficiency is more widespread in developing countries where plant-based diets are widely consumed (IFPRI 2016). Among the cereals, rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{is one of the most}} important staple foods for nearly one-half of the global population and the most important crop in Asia (FAO 2013). Although rice is the major source of energy, protein and minerals for mankind, the grain does not provide sufficient amounts of essential micronutrients to fulfill the daily human nutritional requirements compared to other cereals, especially for rice eating populations (Juliano 1993). Hence, <b>enriching</b> <b>rice</b> with essential micronutrients, i.e., Fe and Zn biofortification, is identified as a major strategy to overcome micronutrient malnutrition especially in developing countries (Bouis and Saltzman 2017).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Plant small non-coding RNAs {{including}} microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and trans-acting siRNAs, play {{important roles}} in modulating gene expression in cells. Here we isolated 21 novel endogenous small RNA molecules, ranging from 18 to 24 nucleotides, in Oryza sativa that can be mapped to 111 hairpin precursors. Further analysis indicated {{that most of these}} hairpin sequences originated from putative miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements, a major type of DNA transposon. Considering that miRNA is characteristic of hairpin-like precursor and plant endogenous siRNAs are often located at transposon regions, we hypothesized that our cloned small RNAs might represent the intermediate product in the evolutionary process between siRNAs and miRNAs. Northern blot analysis indicated that five of them were much more abundantly expressed in flower compared to other tissues, implying their potential function in inflorescence. In conclusion, our results <b>enrich</b> <b>rice</b> small RNA data and provide a meaningful perspective for small RNA annotation in plants...|$|R
30|$|In Arabidopsis pollen, the {{development}} of starch grains begins at the vacuolated microspore stage, and grains are highly accumulated at the bi-cellular stage. At pollen maturity, only a few starch grains remain in the Arabidopsis plastid (Kuang and Musgrave, 1996; Tang et al. 2009). This contrasts with the features of rice pollen, where starch granules are abundant at the mature stage (Zhang et al. 2010). The higher starch content in mature rice pollen might explain why genes related to major carbohydrate metabolism are <b>enriched</b> in <b>rice.</b> Among the genes with MapMan terms related to carbohydrate metabolism that occur only in rice divergent genes, two {{are involved in the}} starch synthesis pathway while five genes are part of the pathway for starch degradation. We found one starch synthase and one ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) in the starch synthesis pathway (Additional file 1 : Table S 5). Among them, OsAGPL 4 encodes AGPase and is involved in starch accumulation during pollen development. The osagl 4 mutant pollen exhibits a starch deficiency in pollen grains that causes defects in gene-transfer through the male gametophyte (Lee et al. 2016). Three amylase and two invertase genes participate in the starch degradation pathway. Because rapid growth by pollen tubes is a highly energy-consuming process, storage materials within pollen grains are mobilized for fuel (Goetz et al. 2017). Amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch into sugar and invertase participates in the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose. Regarding these genes, one starch degradation-defective mutant, tomato alpha-Glucan water dikinase (LeGWD)/legwd, interrupts gene-transfer through the male gametophyte (Nashilevitz et al. 2009). These differences between rice and Arabidopsis in their storage reserves for late pollen might explain why genes related to the metabolism of major carbohydrates are <b>enriched</b> in <b>rice</b> divergent genes, as coupled with late pollen development.|$|R

30|$|Immediately {{flanking}} CENP-A-bound centromeric core is the peri-centromeric heterochromatin. This condensed and transcriptionally silent {{region is}} essential for gene regulation, genome stability and chromosome segregation. Peri-centromeric heterochromatin displays a protein binding profile and epigenetic environment that is clearly {{different from that of}} centromeric cores. The heterochromatic region is enriched in histone 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) methylation and devoid of H 3 K 4 methylation. In fact, H 3 K 9 methylation is considered an epigenetic hallmark of heterochromatin, conserved from fission yeast to humans (Fig.  1) (Rice and Allis, 2001; Carroll and Straight, 2006). This modification serves as the binding site for the highly conserved chromodomain protein, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1). HP 1 is a classic epigenetic “reader” protein, which can recognize specific epigenetic marks (Rice and Allis, 2001; Taverna et al., 2007). Histones in heterochromatin are also hypo-acetylated. This contrasts with active chromatin (euchromatin) in which H 3 K 4 methylation and hyper-acetylation are <b>enriched</b> (<b>Rice</b> and Allis, 2001).|$|E

However, fluctuations in the counts of coliforms were observed in both groups during the 6 -week intervention. In conclusion, the intestinal microbiota balance was improved after daily consumption of 150 [*]g of rice porridge containing XOS for 6 weeks, demonstrating the prebiotic potential of XOS incorporated into foods.

30|$|The {{present study}} {{revealed}} that the primary response of roots to M. oryzae in wild rice is more complex and diverse than in cultivated rice. WRKY TFs, chitinase activity, JA, ET, lignin, as well as phenylpropanoid and diterpenoid synthesis, were all associated with the resistance responses displayed by the roots of wild rice to M. oryzae. The resistance responses in roots of cultivated rice, however, only involved genes associated with phenylpropanoid, flavones and wax. Modulation of primary metabolism (starch, soluble sugars, proline and chitinase activity), and phenylpropanoid synthesis were common responses that were shared between both cultivated and wild rice. The modulation of secondary metabolism, {{and the production of}} phenylpropanoid, were directed towards lignin synthesis in wild rice and flavone synthesis in cultivated rice, respectively. In addition, the analysis of genes associated with nutrient metabolism indicated that fatty acid and starch metabolism was modulated in both wild and cultivated rice in response to the pathogen. In this regard, however, lipid acid synthesis was specifically <b>enriched</b> in cultivated <b>rice,</b> while lipid acid degradation was specifically <b>enriched</b> in wild <b>rice</b> in response to M. oryzae. The results of the study may have practical implications for controlling M. oryzae in rice plantings and can provide useful information for incorporating and assessing disease resistance to M. oryzae in rice breeding programs.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: As folate {{deficiency}} {{is mainly}} caused by the dependency on folate-poor staple crops, such as rice, the implementation of rice {{with a high level}} of natural folate could be a successful pro-rural and pro-poor intervention strategy to reduce folate deficiencies in China, where about 260 million people are considered to be folate deficient. Consuming folate biofortified rice instead of conventional rice could prevent someone from negative health outcomes of folate deficiency, such as megaloblastic aneamia and neural-tube defects. Especially for poor Chinese women of childbearing age, folate biofortification could be important to prevent them from having a baby with a neural-tube defect, the main adverse health outcome. As Northern and Southern China differ significantly in terms of rice consumption and production, and folate intake, a regional comparison of the potential health benefits of folate biofortified rice could further underpin the introduction of this strategy in China. Objective: The aim is to measure the potential regional health impact of folate biofortified rice (12 μg per 1 gram of rice) in China. Method: Based on the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) approach, the health impact of folate <b>enriched</b> <b>rice</b> in China is evaluated as the numbers of DALYs lost that can be reduced. As there is only data available on contribution of folate deficiency to its main adverse health outcome of folate deficiency, i. e. neural-tube defects, the health impact refers to the neural-tube defects that are caused by folate deficiency. Furthermore, two coverage rate of the introduction of folate <b>enriched</b> <b>rice</b> are included based on previous research. Results: Based on the efficacy of folate biofortified rice, the total daily folate intake for Chinese women of childbearing age after biofortification amounts to 1 120 μg, which is significantly higher than the required folate intake. The application of the DALY method shows that the implementation of folate biofortified rice could save 116 090 DALYs (low impact scenario) and 257 345 DALYs (high impact scenario) per year. Although rice consumption is significantly lower in Northern China, the folate intake after biofortication is still high enough to alleviate the burden of neural-tube defects caused by folate deficiency. Furthermore, a rough estimation of the costs of folate biofortification indicates that this policy intervention could be a cost-effective method as well. Conclusions: Although these results underpin folate biofortification of rice as a valuable policy intervention to tackle folate deficiency in different regions of China, further research is required to compare the benefits and costs with other interventions or folate biofortified products.

40|$|Acid soil is {{commonly}} grown with cassava, which in general, tolerate low soil fertility and aluminum (Al) toxicity. However, without any improvement efforts such soil will become worse. Intercropping cassava with Brachiaria decumbens (BD) which adapts to acid soil and tolerates low fertility soils {{as well as}} application of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and organic matters are among the important efforts to rehabilitate this soil. The experiment was conducted to {{examine the impact of}} BD, AM, and potassium (K) <b>enriched</b> <b>rice</b> straw compost on exchangeable Al, available K, and stability of soil aggregates. Experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with three factors and three replications. The first factor was BD as cassava intercropping, the second factor was AM, and the third factor was 2 t ha- 1 rice straw compost enriched with 0 kg, 50 kg, 100 kg, and 200 kg KCl ha- 1. Brick pots (1 m length x 1 m width x 0. 45 m depth) filled with Kanhapludult soil was used for growing cassava in which row of BD was planted at 60 cm from cassava stem. K-enriched rice straw compost and AM (10 g per stem) were applied around cassava stem at 2 and 12 days after planting, respectively. BD was cut every 30 days and the cutting was returned to the soil. Soil exchangeable Al was analyzed at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months after planting (MAP), while Al and K contents as well as aggregate stability were measured at 6 MAP. The results showed that planting BD decreased 33 % exchangeable Al, which means that the root exudates of this grass was effective in detoxifying Al 3 +. Treatment of BD and/or in combination with AM was effective in preserving K added to the soil, increasing total polysaccharides, and improving soil aggregate stability. This indicated that planting BD and applying AM and Kenriched rice straw compost improved acid soil fertility, and therefore can be recommended in cassava cultivation...|$|E
40|$|More than 2 {{billion people}} suffer from {{micronutrient}} malnutrition worldwide. Vitamin A, iron, iodine, and zinc deficiencies {{are among the}} leading public health concerns for developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and many parts of Asia. Strict vegetarian diets, lack of diversity in the diet, high rates of infection, and unfavorable socio-economic conditions are risk factors for these deficiency conditions. In India alone, approximately 75 % of {{children under the age}} of five suffer from iron deficiency, and 57 % of {{children under the age of}} six suffer from sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency. Micronutrient deficiencies bring adverse consequences to their victims and the economies of the countries in which they live. Fortification has proven to be an effective long-term nutrition intervention strategy, and rice has emerged as a staple food with much potential as a food fortification vehicle. Rice provides 50 % of calories for more than half of the world population. However, a lack of micronutrients in white rice has become a problem for countries with high consumption rates of rice. Low intakes of iron, vitamin A, and iodine are a major concern, while low zinc intake is also a problem. An experimental product, extruded rice kernels manufactured from rice flour fortified with vitamins and minerals, has been proposed as an effective vehicle for delivering a variety of micronutrients to low income populations. The aims of this study were 1) to select and adapt analytical methods and conduct analyses for vitamin A and vitamin C in the experimental product, as well as measure mineral retention, and 2) to conduct sensory studies to evaluate the acceptability of the experimental product by consumers and compare acceptability by South Asian consumers to that of non-South Asian consumers. Extruded rice samples fortified with vitamins A and C and iron and zinc were evaluated for their micronutrient retention following extrusion and cooking. The average vitamin A retention in the experimental product after extrusion was 48 % for dried kernels and 37 % for cooked rice. The average vitamin C retention in the experimental product after extrusion was 52 % for dried kernels and 48 % for cooked rice. Iron and zinc retentions both averaged 84 % for rice kernels after extrusion (cooked and non-cooked data combined). The vitamin retentions are consistent with studies on vitamin retention in extruded products. However, mineral retention is lower than expected. Larger sample sizes, consistency in analysis methods, and more research are needed to draw further conclusions. The experimental product was also evaluated for its consumer appeal using consumer acceptance tests. For the acceptability evaluation, two extruded samples of rice (fortified and unfortified extruded rice), and two commercial samples of <b>enriched</b> <b>rice</b> (long-grain white rice) were cooked in a rice cooker and presented to taste panelists. Acceptability of the product was based on a 9 -point hedonics test, a just-about-right (JAR) test, and a ranking test. Results suggested greater acceptability by the consumer panel for commercial rice samples. The most sizable difference was seen in the appearance attributes, followed by overall acceptance, and aroma. The addition of vitamins and minerals to extruded rice did not appear to have a large effect on sensory acceptability, with the exception of several appearance attributes. Group differences and group interactions were observed. The South Asian panelist group gave lower scores in several attributes, and the group was generally more critical of (gave lower ratings to) the unfortified extruded rice sample and the parboiled commercial sample than the non-South Asian group. Rice with extruded fortified kernels has potential to be an effective vehicle for fortification in developing countries; however, the challenges in micronutrient retention and acceptability need to be met for optimized utilization...|$|E
30|$|Among the 16 genes {{related to}} cell wall modifications, six encode expansin {{proteins}} {{that are known}} to have cell-wall loosening activity. Although three expansin genes show a pattern of late pollen-preferred expression in Arabidopsis (Mollet et al. 2013), the six in rice are not homologous to those in Arabidopsis. Research with maize has indicated that pollen extracts have expansin-like activity that is unique to the cell walls of grass species but not eudicots (Cosgrove et al. 1997). Expansin facilitates pollen tube penetration through the stigma and style (Tabuchi et al. 2011). Maize pollen β-expansin preferentially binds to xylans and also solubilizes feruloylated arabinoxylan from cell walls in grasses (Tabuchi et al. 2011). Arabinoxylan is enriched in those grass cell walls (Sampedro et al. 2015). Thus, the arabinoxylan–cellulose interaction might be a target of grass pollen β-expansins (Sampedro et al. 2015). These distinct differences in structure between grass and dicot pollen cell walls can explain why MapMan terms related to cell wall modifications are more <b>enriched</b> in <b>rice</b> divergent genes than in those of Arabidopsis (Cho and Kende, 1997; Sampedro et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|Background: Jiangsu Province is an {{economically}} booming area in East China, where soil zinc concentrations are low. Nutrition {{transition to a}} dietary pattern with more animal source foods may have improved zinc intake in this area. However, such a transition may also have increased the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as hypertension and obesity. Investigation of dietary patterns in relation to undernutrition and overnutrition could help to better address both problems. Objectives: The first aim of this thesis was to assess zinc status in Jiangsu Province using dietary zinc intake, serum zinc and stunting as indicators, as well to investigate the potential of biofortified rice to improve zinc intake. The second aim {{was to investigate the}} association between dietary patterns and high blood pressure, taking obesity into account. Methods: Data from the 2002 National Nutrition and Health Survey in Jiangsu Province were used to assess zinc intake in the population aged 4 - 89 years (n= 3, 867). Primary school children (n= 2, 268) were selected from three counties in the Province with relatively low soil zinc for assessment of stunting. Serum zinc was measured among children in the county where stunting was highest (n= 297).   Thirteen women were recruited in the same county for three test rounds with rice meals (zinc biofortified rice, zinc extruded fortified rice and control rice). Fractional zinc absorption (FAZ) was measured {{with the use of the}} double isotope tracer ratio method. Effect of biofortified rice with zinc, at a level of 2. 7 and 3. 8 mg/ 100 g, on zinc intake was simulated in adults (n= 2. 819). For adults, four distinct dietary patterns were identified, named “traditional”, “Macho”, “sweet tooth” and “healthy” pattern. Associations were assessed between the four dietary patterns and blood pressure in adults (n= 2, 518) by using Poisson regression analysis. Results: The overall prevalence of insufficient intake of zinc was 22. 9 %, with a higher prevalence in children (64. 6 %) and adolescents (64. 9 %), and in those with low socio-economic status (27. 3 %). Around 4 % of the primary school children were stunted, and the prevalence of zinc deficiency measured by serum and hair zinc was 0. 7 %, and 15. 2 %, respectively. Biofortified 70 Zn <b>enriched</b> <b>rice</b> with an intrinsic label was found to have higher fractional zinc absorption (FAZ) than extrinsically labeled fortified extruded rice. However, FAZ could not be accurately quantified because we could not determine the exact amount of isotope infused to subjects due to adhesion of zinc to the vial. When simulating zinc intake by replacing normal rice with zinc biofortified rice with either 2. 7 and 3. 8 mg/ 100 g of zinc, the prevalence of insufficient zinc intake decreased from 15. 4 % to 6. 5 % and 4. 4 %, respectively. The “traditional” dietary pattern in Jiangsu Province was most strongly associated with high blood pressure (P for trend = 0. 005). This pattern is characterized primarily by consumption of rice and fresh vegetable; secondary of pork and fish; and lastly of root vegetable and wheat flour, but also by high salt intake. Subjects with overweight and obesity were more likely to have high blood pressure than those with normal weight. Conclusion: Children and adolescents had low dietary zinc intake, in Jiangsu Province, where the soil is also deficient in zinc. However, these findings did not match with the low prevalence of stunting and zinc deficiency based on serum zinc concentrations in primary school children from three rural areas of the Province. Zinc appears to be better absorbed from biofortified rice than from control rice or from extruded fortified rice, which needs further investigation. Simulated zinc intake from biofortified rice with zinc at a level of 2. 7 mg/kg has the potential to significantly improve zinc intake, especially in the “traditional” dietary pattern. However, this pattern is also related to high blood pressure, which may be due to high salt intake. High blood pressure is also positively and independently related to obesity. Nutrition education is required to improve knowledge and awareness of healthy diets in Jiangsu Province.  ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the myceliation rate, mycelial vigor and "estimated biomass" of Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Pegler, grown on a {{sugarcane}} bagasse substrate <b>enriched</b> with <b>rice</b> bran and sugarcane molasses for spawn production. The proportions of rice bran used were 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40 % (dry weight/dry weight of bagasse) and the sugarcane molasses concentrations tested were 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 g/kg (dry weight/dry weight of bagasse plus rice bran). The myceliation rate was decreased by the addition of the higher quantities of rice bran. The 25 and 30 % rice bran proportions induced the highest stimulation of mycelial vigor. The addition of sugarcane molasses did not change myceliation rate or mycelial vigor. The "estimated biomass" values were similar when intermediate rice bran proportions were used and for all sugarcane molasses concentrations. Based on response surface obtained for the "estimated biomass" data, higher values were obtained with substrates containing 20 to 25 % rice bran combined with 10 to 30 g sugarcane molasses, although the latter supplement was not considered to stimulate L. edodes growth...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} evaluate the biological efficiency (BE), mean mushroom weight (MMW), mean number of mushroom (MNM) and mushroom quality of Shiitake [Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Pegler] when grown on a sterilized substrate composed by sugarcane bagasse <b>enriched</b> with <b>rice</b> bran and sugarcane molasses. The proportions of rice bran were 0, 15, 20, 25 and 30 % (dry weight/dry weight of bagasse); and the concentrations of sugarcane molasses were 0, 30 and 60 g/kg (dry weight/dry weight of bagasse plus rice bran). Four flushes were obtained during the production cycle, providing 3 accumulated productions which were used for production analysis. The substrate supplemented with 25 and 30 % rice bran yielded the highest BE (98. 42 and 99. 84 %, respectively, about 230 days after spawning) and MNM and initially produced a lower MMW than the substrates supplemented with 15 and 20 % rice bran. Any amount of rice bran added to the sugarcane bagasse improved mushroom quality, with the best production of marketable mushrooms obtained {{by the addition of}} 15 % rice bran. The largest amount of sugarcane molasses (60 g/kg) increased BE (90. 3 and 23. 6 %, on first and second accumulated productions, respectively) and MNM and no quantity affected mushroom quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{centromere}} is {{the most}} characteristic landmark of eukaryotic chromosomes. Centromeres function as the site for kinetochore assembly and spindle attachment, allowing for the faithful pairing and segregation of sister chromatids during cell division. Characterization of centromeric DNA is not only essential to understand the structure and organization of plant genomes, {{but it is also}} a critical step in the development of plant artificial chromosomes. The centromeres of most model eukaryotic species, consist predominantly of long arrays of satellite DNA. Determining the precise DNA boundary of a centromere has proven to be a difficult task in multicellular eukaryotes. We have successfully cloned and sequenced the centromere of rice chromosome 8 (Cen 8), representing the first fully sequenced centromere from any multicellular eukaryotes. The functional core of Cen 8 spans ~ 800 kb of DNA, which was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an antibody against the rice centromere-specific H 3 histone. We discovered 16 actively transcribed genes distributed throughout the Cen 8 region. In addition to Cen 8, we have characterized eight additional rice centromeres using the next generation sequencing technology. We discovered four subfamilies of the CRR retrotransposon that is highly <b>enriched</b> in <b>rice</b> centromeres. CRR elements are constitutively transcribed and different CRR subfamilies are differentially processed by RNAi. These results suggest that different CRR subfamilies may play different roles in the RNAi-mediated pathway for formation and maintenance of centromeric chromatin...|$|R

In the next report the mutagenicity of the cooked white rice warmed for 24 or 36 hrs are weak, using TA 98. However in this investigation the revertant colonies per 1. 2 g of the cooked rice, warmed for 36 or 48 hrs was less than 71 in TA 100 and the dose-response curves of the mutagenicity were not obtained. Even these scorched rices had little mutagenic action in TA 100. Vitamin B_ 1 retentions of the cooked white rices, warmed for 12 hrs were 76 ～ 83 % in a 1. 5 l cooker, 70 % in a 2 l cooker, and these retentions, warmed for 36 hrs were 42 ～ 72 % in the 1. 5 l cooker, 49 % in the 2 l cooker. On the B_ 1 contents of the warming cooked rices, these rices sampled from near the wall of the cooker were less than ones sampled {{from the center of the}} cooker. The B_ 1 retentions of brown rice, half-milled rice and undermilled rice, cooked and warmed for 12 hrs were 94 %, 73 ～ 86 % and 77 % respectively. However, these B_ 1 contents were much higher than the cooked white rices, warmed for the same hrs. The B_ 1 retentions of the <b>enriched</b> <b>rices</b> using polyrice were 66 ～ 92 % when these cooked rices warmed for 12 hrs, but the B_ 1 contents were 121 ～ 186 μg%. Throughout all the experiments the B_ 2 contents in these rices during warming reduced little. From the facts described above, the results were as follows: the limiting time of warming of cooked rice was 12 hrs because of the loss of palatability and the retention of B_ 1. These B_ 1 contents were varied with the cooking and warming conditions and also different from the descriptions of these cookers. The B_ 2 contents did not reduce during warming in order to its thermostability. Judging from the bioassay for B_ 1,using common finches, the negative correlation between birds' ages and warming time of the cooked white rices was statistically significant at the level of 1 % (N= 45 r= 0. 463). No bird did die by the addition of B_ 1 ・HCl solution to even the cooked rice, warmed for 36 hrs. No other harmful substance which kill even one bird was produced during warming, except the loss of B_ 1.

40|$|Sugarcane {{is one of}} {{the most}} genetically complex species. It is both {{aneuploid}} and polyploid with a large number of chromosomes. Consequently, simply inherited traits are rare; only five have been identified to date of which four are disease-related (including rust resistance) and one is a morphological trait. The genetic complexity and large genome size of sugarcane, together with the Jack of a close diploid relative, make map-based gene cloning in sugarcane a challenge. This chapter outlines the strategies developed to overcome these difficulties and describes progress towards the cloning of a durable rust resistance gene. Using syntenic relationships with model crops (sorghum and <b>rice),</b> <b>enriched</b> BAC libraries and haplotypespecific chromosome walking, a high-density genetic map and a partial physical map of the region surrounding the rust resistance gene has been developed. A comparison with other homo(eo) logous chromosomes at this region reveals the presence of a large insertioncurrent efforts are focusd on characterizing and walking through the insertion.

40|$|Biochar has the {{potential}} to improve soil fertility and crop productivity. A field experiment was carried out at the experimental field of Bangladesh Sericulture Research and Training Institute (BSRTI), Rajshahi, Bangladesh. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of biochar on soil properties, growth, yield and foliar disease incidence of mulberry plant. The study consisted of 6 treatments: control, basal dose of NPK, rice husk biochar, mineral enriched biochar, basal dose + rice husk biochar and basal dose + mineral enriched biochar. Growth parameters such as node/meter, total branch number/plant, total leaf yield/hectare/year were significantly increased in basal dose + mineral enriched biochar treated plot in second year compared with the other fertilizer treatments. In second year, the total leaf yield/hectare/year were also 142. 1 % and 115. 9 % higher in combined application of basal dose + mineral enriched biochar and basal dose + rice husk biochar, respectively, than the control treatment. The soil properties such as organic matter, phosphorus, sulphur and zinc percentage were significantly increased with both the (mineral <b>enriched</b> and <b>rice</b> husk) biochar treated soil applied with or without recommended basal dose of NPK than the control and only the recommended basal dose of NPK, respectively. Further, the lowest incidences of tukra (6. 4 %), powdery mildew (10. 4 %) and leaf spot (7. 6 %) disease were observed in second year under mineral enriched biochar treated plot than the others. The findings revealed that utilization of biochar has positive effect on the improvement of soil fertility and productivity as well as disease suppression of mulberry plant...|$|R
40|$|Plastid casein kinase II is an {{important}} regulator of transcription, posttranscriptional processes, and, most likely, different metabolic functions in dicotyledonous species. Here we report the identification and characterization of pCKII from the monocotyledonous species Oryza sativa. OspCKII activity was <b>enriched</b> from isolated <b>rice</b> chloroplasts using heparin-Sepharose chromatography, in which it co-elutes with the transcriptionally active chromosome (TAC) and several ribosomal proteins. Inclusion mass scanning of the kinase-active fraction identified the gene model for OspCKII. Transient expression of GFP fused to the 184 N-terminal amino acids of the OspCKII sequence in rice confirmed the chloroplastic localization of the kinase. OspCKII activity shows the characteristic features of casein kinase II, such as the utilization of GTP as phosphate donor, inhibition by low concentrations of heparin and poly-lysine, and utilization of the canonical pCKII motif E-S-E-G-E in the model substrate RNP 29. Phosphoproteome analysis of a protein extract from rice leaves combined with a meta-analysis with published phosphoproteomics data revealed differences in the target protein spectrum between rice and Arabidopsis. Consistently, several pCKII phosphorylation sites in dicotyledonous plants are not conserved in monocots and algae, suggesting that details of pCKII regulation in plastids have changed during evolutio...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{regarding}} the use of living microorganisms as supplement have been done {{in the last two decades}} to improve digestion process in the rumen. Many factors affect the use of the supplement, such as ration composition and physiological status of the animals. Materials used in this experiment are Aspergillus oryzae (AO) derived from ‘tauco’ (salty fermented soybean) and soybean sauce processing factories located in Bogor, Cianjur, and Sukabumi districts (15 sources), and also AO culture collections of the Indonesian Res. Inst. for Anim. Prod. (2 strains) and one strain from Indonesian Res. Inst. for Vet. Sci. in Bogor. The fungus was first isolated in potato dextrose agar (PDA), incubated at room temp.

30|$|GO {{analysis}} indicated that the total DEGs identified in W[*]+[*]F vs W were enriched in the GO terms ‘cell’, ‘cell part’, ‘membrane part’, ‘organelle’ and ‘organelle part’ (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the term ‘cell wall thickening’ was more highly <b>enriched</b> in wild <b>rice</b> than in cultivated rice in response to inoculation with the pathogen (Fig. 5, Table 2); potentially indicating that cell walls might thicken {{as part of the}} defense response in wild rice compared with the cultivated one. In addition, in wild rice, the enrichment of up-regulated genes in the terms ‘integral component of mitochondrial inner membrane and mitochondria’ (Fig. 5, Table 2) suggests that energy production and consumption increased in response to the presence of the pathogen (Berkowitz et al. 2016). Within the category biological process, the term ‘transmembrane transporter activity’ was enriched (Table 2) with up-regulated genes, suggesting that macro- or micro-molecules were more highly transported through membranes in response to the pathogen in wild rice. However, these GO enrichments were not found in cultivated rice, demonstrating differential responses of wild and cultivated varieties to M. oryzae infection. The term ‘biological adhesion’ was enriched in the C[*]+[*]F vs C comparison (Table 3), but not in the W[*]+[*]F vs W comparison, which might be due to the immune response of cultivated rice to the invading fungal hyphae of the pathogen (Hong et al. 2016). In addition, Os 11 g 0207600, which encodes a Myb-like protein and was classified into GO terms of ‘regulation of secondary cell wall biogenesis’, was also enriched in the C[*]+[*]F vs C comparison but not in the W[*]+[*]F vs W comparison; suggesting that M. oryzae might activate the function related to secondary cell wall synthesis in cultivated rice in response to the infection.|$|R
3000|$|The {{information}} {{gained by}} deep sequencing of small RNA populations revealed dynamic alterations in {{the expression of}} an important number of rice miRNAs in response to infection by the rice blast fungus M. oryzae or treatment with elicitors prepared from this fungus (Campo et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013; Baldrich et al. 2015). Because miRNAs provide the quantitative regulation of target gene expression, rather than on-off regulations, the observed dynamic responses on miRNA accumulation during pathogen infection would provide the fine-tuning of gene expression in physiological processes contributing to disease resistance. Deep sequencing of the sRNA transcriptomes also allowed the confident identification of previously unknown miRNAs whose expression is regulated by treatment with M. oryzae elicitors in rice (Campo et al. 2013; Baldrich et al. 2015). Combined sRNA and degradome analysis revealed the existence of regulatory networks <b>enriched</b> in elicitor-responsive <b>rice</b> miRNAs supported by the identification of their corresponding target genes, such as those associated with hormone signalling and crosstalk between defence-related hormones (ET, SA, JA, auxin) and polyamine biosynthesis. An important number of miRNAs that are regulated by M. oryzae elicitors {{are known to be}} involved in small RNA pathways, including miRNA and heterochromatic pathways. Among them are miR 162 and miR 168 (targeting DCL 1 and AGO 1 transcripts, respectively), this observation pointing to a pathogen-regulation of the miRNA machinery itself (Baldrich et al. 2015). Moreover, silencing of dcl 1 has been shown to {{have a positive impact on}} resistance to M. oryzae infection through the activation of basal defence mechanisms (Zhang et al. 2015). In Arabidopsis, however, a phenotype of susceptibility to infection by P. syringae is observed in dcl 1 mutants (Navarro et al. 2008). Thus, differences in the outcome of the interaction in loss-of-function mutants of dcl 1 might be dependent on the host (rice, Arabidopsis) and/or the type of pathogen (fungi, bacteria) [...].|$|R
