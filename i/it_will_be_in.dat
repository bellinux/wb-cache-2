5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is mycorrhizal. It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (chalky) soil, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters {{with two or three}} joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown product of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E

25|$|Haiman {{describes}} iconic {{expression and}} conceptual distance and how two concepts are conceptually close if they share semantic properties, affect {{each other and}} cannot be separated from one another. Joseph Greenberg hypothesizes that {{the distance between the}} possessor and possessee in a sentence with alienable possession will be greater than <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> sentences inalienable constructions. Because the possessor and the possessee have a close conceptual relationship, their relative positions with a sentence reflect this and {{there will not be a}} lot of distance between them. Increasing the distance between the two would in turn increase their conceptual independence.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in {{the characteristics of the}} nests within the Vespula vulgaris species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close {{to the surface of the}} ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. Because heat is less well insulated above the ground, the wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32°C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.|$|E

In 1914, he published a gossipy, three-volume memoir of his time there under the collective title Hail and Farewell, which entertained its readers but infuriated former friends.

500|$|Meade {{made his}} {{decision}} {{late that night}} in a council of war that included his senior staff officers and corps commanders. The assembled officers agreed that, despite the beating the army took, it was advisable for the army to remain in its present position and to await attack by the enemy, although there was some disagreement about how long to wait if Lee chose not to attack. There {{is some evidence that}} Meade had already decided this issue and was using the meeting not as a formal council of war, but as a way to achieve consensus among officers he had commanded for less than a week. As the meeting broke up, Meade took aside Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, in command of the II Corps, and predicted, [...] "If Lee attacks tomorrow, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> your front. ... he has made attacks on both our flanks and failed and if he concludes to try it again, it will be on our centre." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E
