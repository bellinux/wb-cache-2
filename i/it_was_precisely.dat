With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a {{geological}} formation known as the Blue Lias. This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210–195million years ago). It {{is one of the}} richest fossil locations in Britain. The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.|$|E

Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed that he could get unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they were given a strong voice in the negotiation process.|$|E

25|$|Deeply {{affected}} by his dismissal from the Academy, Eakins' later career focused on portraiture, {{such as his}} 1905 Portrait of Professor William S. Forbes. His steadfast insistence on his own vision of realism, {{in addition to his}} notoriety from his school scandals, combined to hurt his income in later years. Even as he approached these portraits with the skill of a highly trained anatomist, what is most noteworthy is the intense psychological presence of his sitters. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> for this reason that his portraits were often rejected by the sitters or their families. As a result, Eakins came to rely on his friends and family members to model for portraits. His portrait of Walt Whitman (1887–1888) was the poet's favorite.|$|E
25|$|The philosopher C. T. K. Chari of Madras Christian College in Chennai, a {{specialist}} in parapsychology, argued that Stevenson was naive and that the case studies were undermined by his lack of local knowledge. Chari wrote {{that many of the}} cases had come from societies, such as that of India, where people believed in reincarnation, and that the stories were simply cultural artifacts; he argued that, for children in many Asian countries, the recall of a past life is the equivalent of an imaginary playmate. The philosopher Keith Augustine made a similar argument. Stevenson responded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> those societies that listened to children's claims about past lives, which in Europe or North America would normally be dismissed without investigation. To address the cultural concern, he wrote European Cases of the Reincarnation Type (2003), which presented forty cases he had examined in Europe.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't by {{accident}} that the world's second and third grain elevators were built in Toledo, Ohio and Brooklyn, New York, in 1847. Fledgling American cities, they were connected through an emerging international grain trade of unprecedented proportions. Grain shipments from farms in Ohio were loaded onto ships by elevators at Toledo; these ships were unloaded by elevators at Buffalo that transshipped their grain to canal boats (and, later, rail cars), which were unloaded by elevators in Brooklyn, where the grain was either distributed to East Coast flour mills or loaded for further transshipment to England, the Netherlands, or Germany. But this eastern flow of grain was matched by an equally important flow of people and capital in the opposite direction, that is, from East to West. Because {{of the money to}} be made in grain production and, of course, because of the very existence of an all-water route to get there, increasing numbers of immigrants in Brooklyn came to Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to become farmers. More farmers meant more prairies turned into farmlands, which in turn meant increased grain production, which of course meant that more grain elevators would have to be built in places like Toledo, Buffalo, and Brooklyn (and Cleveland, Chicago, and Duluth). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> through this feedback loop of productivity — set in motion by the invention of the grain elevator — that America itself became an agricultural and economic colossus on the world stage: the planet's single largest producer of wheat, corn, oats, and rice, a distinction it claims to this day.|$|E

25|$|The {{theological}} core of {{the work}} and its content have been much discussed since the pre-Christian age, especially the problem of human misfortune and in particular the misfortune of the righteous in relation to the prevailing concept of divine justice. In that it uses as departure point the literary framework of the story of Job, a devout, wealthy and respected man, who, with God’s permission, was struck by Satan with the greatest misfortunes. Being a king, according to the Septuagint, Job was the model of the God-fearing, wise and philanthropic ruler who was also enjoying a peaceful life in the bosom of his large family and among his friends. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> this deep piety and the divine favour which incited the envy of Satan who - not without much effort - eventually succeeded in obtaining God’s consent to put Job to the test. Thus, in a rapid sequence of calamities, Job is robbed of all his possessions, his herds, his servants, his house and all his ten children. At the very last, smitten himself with the horrible disease of leprosy and abandoned by all, including his wife, he leaves the city and dwells on a dunghill. In spite of all these reversals of fate Job remains steadfast not only to his faith in God, but also to the conviction that this sudden reversal of the divine will cannot be the consequence of his own sins, since he does not believe that such exist. Finally, after many years of trial, God again reverses the just man’s fate, restoring to him twofold all his worldly goods and giving him a new family.|$|E
