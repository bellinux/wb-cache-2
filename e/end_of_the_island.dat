5|$|A {{group of}} statues {{stands at the}} western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> honoring those closely {{associated}} with the Statue of Liberty. Two Americans—Pulitzer and Lazarus—and three Frenchmen—Bartholdi, Eiffel, and Laboulaye—are depicted. They are the work of Maryland sculptor Phillip Ratner.|$|E
5|$|Vashon Island is only {{connected}} {{to the rest of}} the region via three different WSF ferries departing from the Vashon dock, the other route departing from the Tahlequah dock on the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> SR339 was the only passenger-only ferry that served the island; the other three ferries are auto ferries.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day Erica paralleled the coast of New Caledonia before making {{landfall}} on the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> at L'Île-des-Pins. However, {{at the same time}} the cyclone also entered an area with strong wind shear and thus began to weaken. After passing the island, an extratropical transition begun, weakening the cyclone as it moved towards the southeast. On 15 March, Erica completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone and later fully dissipated the next day.|$|E
30|$|The BEs and EV {{integrations}} discharge {{completely by}} <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islanding</b> period, and <b>the</b> discharging power {{is considered to}} be constant.|$|R
2500|$|The Jamaican {{system now}} had a total of [...] of railway lines {{stretching}} from the south-eastern to the north-western and north-eastern <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island's</b> heyday came in 1904, {{when the}} Starin steamship, General Slocum, burned in Hellgate {{with a loss}} of 1,000 lives.|$|R
5|$|The Great Fire of New York was {{a devastating}} fire that burned {{through the night}} of September 20, 1776, and into the morning of September 21, on the West Side of what then {{constituted}} New York City at the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Manhattan. It {{broke out in the}} early days of the military occupation of the city by British forces during the American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Illustrious was delayed {{two months to}} fit her with a Type 79Z early-warning radar; {{she was the first}} aircraft carrier in the world to be fitted with radar before completion. This version of the radar had separate transmitting and receiving antennas which required a new mainmast {{to be added to the}} aft <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> to mount the transmitter.|$|E
5|$|Coddington {{and several}} others left the colony, {{establishing}} the settlement of Newport at the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> The freemen of Pocasset changed {{the name of their}} town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation of church and state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.|$|E
50|$|Boyardville {{has long}} been an {{important}} port of entry for cargo passing in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Once goods unloaded at the docks, they were transferred to a steam railway that served the villages on both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> <b>The</b> old rail terminal is still visible on Sauzelle Road.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} fully {{accessible}} for handicapped persons, because the highest step is 5 cm. It has exits on both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> platform and a flat roof.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> North <b>Island</b> has {{a larger}} {{population}} than <b>the</b> South <b>Island</b> with both <b>the</b> country's largest city, Auckland {{as well as}} the capital, Wellington at either <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{the course}} of the {{fighting}} around the Hongorai, the Australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded, while the Japanese lost at least 275 men killed. Following the battle, the Australians continued their advance towards Buin at the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Throughout the remainder of the month and into June, the 15th Brigade advanced along the Buin Road, crossing the Hari on 10 June. Beyond the river, the Japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply, and they consequently occupied a series of deep entrenchments. These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery, and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed Mobiai River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson's 29th Brigade in early July.|$|E
5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two halves of the island.|$|E
5|$|Hood's {{withdrawal}} to Barbados {{had left}} St Lucia exposed, and on 10May, the whole French fleet, less two ships-of-the-line landed 1200 troops at Gros Islet, a village {{at the northern}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> On the same day, the remaining two ships from the French fleet and 1300 troops sailed for Tobago. The British were able to repel the attacks on St Lucia so deGrasse decided to reinforce his attack on Tobago, diverting his fleet there on 25May and sending 3000 more troops from Martinique.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> also {{featured}} paddleboats, a service began in 1973 by the Niagara Parks Commission. The paddleboats were removed {{in the early}} 1990s, presumably out of safety as well.|$|R
50|$|Iluileq has rugged cliffs, {{its highest}} point {{reaching}} 829 m. Off <b>the</b> eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island's</b> coast lies Cape Discord (Kangeq) and off its southern shore lies <b>the</b> small cluster <b>of</b> islets named Ivingmiut.|$|R
50|$|This {{sequence}} is of Lutetian to Priabonian (uppermost Eocene) in age. It comprises {{a mixture of}} clays, fine sands, sandy clays and clayey sands. The stratigraphy exposed at <b>the</b> two <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> are somewhat different.|$|R
5|$|On Grand Bahama Island, Wilma {{produced}} sustained {{winds of}} 155km/h (95mph) and {{a gust of}} 178km/h (111mph). The hurricane also produced a storm surge of over 3.7m (12ft), reportedly as high as 6.1m (20ft) along the southwestern portion of the island. The surge, which moved about 305m (1,000ft) inland, caused large-scale flooding that washed away or destroyed about 800homes. Damage was estimated at $100million (2005USD) on the western portion of the island. Excluding the southwestern region of Grand Bahama, {{the majority of the}} island reported minor wind damage, and the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> reported little, or no, damage. Over 7,000people on the island were directly affected by the hurricane, many of whom had not fully recovered from hurricanes Frances and Jeanne during the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Loop Parkway {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with Lido Boulevard {{on the eastern}} end of Long Beach Barrier Island in the neighborhood of Point Lookout. It proceeds north as a four-lane divided highway, crossing over Reynolds Channel to reach Alder Island, one of several islands comprising Jones Beach State Park. Here, the road slowly bends eastward as it runs across the marshy island. Two U-turn ramps are built into the median near the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> serving as the only intersections or interchanges of any kind on Alder Island. The Loop Parkway heads east from Alder Island, traversing Long Creek on a drawbridge leading to Meadow Island. The road quickly continues northeast across the island with no connections via interchanges or intersections.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{occupy the}} former sound between Barry Island and the mainland. The {{contractors}} built dams to connect each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> to the mainland, drained or pumped {{the water from}} the site and excavated it. They used the material to level the area round the docks and for the core of breakwaters to protect the entrance. The works included a basin with gates at each end which served as a lock between the sea entrance and the docks, the dock walls and quays, coal loading equipment and railways to deliver coal from the mines to the docks. A second dock and second entrance lock were added in 1898. Barry Dock Offices were built in 1897-1900 by the architect Arthur E. Bell.|$|E
25|$|Canada, {{which had}} {{operated}} a war-time naval base, HMCS Somers Isles, {{on the old}} Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in <b>the</b> West <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> during this time.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Governor-General also {{placed a}} strong {{emphasis}} on modernization of Taiwan's transportation systems, especially railways, and to a lesser extent, highways. As a result, reliable transit links were established between the northern and southern <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> supporting <b>the</b> increasing population.|$|R
5000|$|More {{evidence}} of ancient habitation {{in the area}} comes from burial grounds, such as those around St Gregory's Church, Tal-Barrani, Tal-Ħotba and Bulebel. The excavation site at the villa confirms <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a thriving olive oil industry on <b>the</b> southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{plan called}} for a {{battalion}} of army infantry to land by destroyer on Guadalcanal around 14 January {{to act as a}} rear guard during the evacuation. The 17th Army was to begin withdrawing to the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> about 25 or 26 January. An air superiority campaign around the southern Solomons would begin on 28 January. The 17th Army would be picked up in three lifts by destroyers the first week of February with a target completion date of 10 February. At the same time, Japanese air and naval forces would conduct conspicuous maneuvers and minor attacks around New Guinea and the Marshall Islands along with deceptive radio traffic to try to confuse the Allies as to their intentions.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangulation}} {{survey was}} conducted by the U.S. Coast Survey with men detailed from the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. Approximately forty men were based at Cape Florida working on the survey when Alexander Dallas Bache, Superintendent of the U.S. Coast Survey, went to Key Biscayne in 1855 {{to take charge of}} it. The survey eventually covered Key Biscayne, Biscayne Bay, the Florida Keys from south of Key Biscayne to the Marquesas Keys, and Florida Bay from the Keys to Cape Sable. The survey base marker at Cape Florida ended up under water, as the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> eroded. It could be seen at low tide as late as 1913.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{activities}} {{were taken in}} hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a runway, {{and some of the}} buildings at the PT boat base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cape St. George Island {{is covered}} by several plant communities. Scrub and sea oats {{can be found on}} the newer dunes, Slash pine flatwoods are found in the low swales and savannahs. Scattered cabbage {{palmetto}} are found on overwash portions at the east and west <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|R
50|$|Farms and {{orchards}} {{were located}} on the northeast, south, central, northwest and southwest <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Since abandoned, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmed lands have been re-forested. There are some reminders <b>of</b> habitation on <b>the</b> south side. A pier still exists for boaters to <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Permit is needed for camping.|$|R
50|$|Other notable {{landmarks}} are the old British and American Camps {{at opposite}} <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> which together comprise <b>the</b> San Juan <b>Island</b> National Historical Park, which commemorates the 1859 Pig War. Interpretive centers and reconstructed buildings, formal gardens, etc. recall <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> early European {{settlement in the}} area.|$|R
5|$|In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt {{ordered the}} statue to be {{transferred}} to the National Park Service (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island. With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal. The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October, Task Force 38 {{provided}} {{air cover}} for {{the invasion of the}} Treasury Islands, part of the preliminary operations for the invasion of Bougainville Island scheduled a few days later. On the morning of 1 November, Saratogas aircraft neutralized Japanese airfields at the northern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> and on Buka Island. They destroyed 15 Japanese aircraft while losing three Hellcats, one Dauntless, and two Avengers to all causes. While the task force was refuelling on 3–4 November, reconnaissance aircraft discovered Japanese cruisers massing at Rabaul and Admiral Halsey ordered Task Force 38 to attack them with maximal force before they could engage the transports at Bougainville. This translated into an attack group of 23 Avengers and 22 Dauntlesses, escorted by every available fighter on board the two carriers on 5 November; CAP over the carriers was provided by fighters flying from New Georgia. The attack caught the Japanese by surprise and badly damaged four heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and a destroyer for the loss of only nine aircraft to all causes.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Erica was a {{powerful}} cyclone considered the worst to affect New Caledonia since Cyclone Beti. It developed from a monsoonal trough on March 4 just off Queensland in the Australian cyclone region. Once it entered the South Pacific cyclone region on March 12, Erica steadily intensified in a favourable environment, reaching peak intensity on March 13 as a Category5 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. On that day Erica paralleled the coast of New Caledonia, before making landfall on the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> at L'Île-des-Pins. At {{the same time the}} cyclone entered an area with strong wind shear and thus began to weaken. After passing the island, an extratropical transition began, weakening the cyclone as it moved southeast. On March 15, Erica completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone and fully dissipated the next day.|$|E
50|$|Innetalling Island is an {{uninhabited}} {{island in}} Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada. Located in Hudson Bay's Omarolluk Sound, it {{is a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belcher <b>Islands</b> group. It runs from Fairweather Sound at its northern end to Ridge Passage at its southern one. Fairweather Harbour is located on <b>the</b> north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island's</b> east side.|$|R
50|$|The {{east and}} west <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> {{terminate}} in comparatively low points. Ras al Hallaniyah, the summit and northern headland <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> is a bold projecting bluff, 501 m high. <b>The</b> coast <b>of</b> a length of one mile {{on either side of}} this bluff consists of a Muschelkalk cliff descending almost vertically to the sea.|$|R
