5|$|Regarding public housing, Tufaro {{called for}} renovations rather than {{demolishing}} vacant buildings, which drew criticism, as Housing Commissioner <b>Daniel</b> <b>P.</b> Henson III {{pointed out that}} renovating was more expensive than demolishing. O'Malley promised to enforce provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which require banks to invest in poor neighborhoods. Tufaro further proposed a plan for school vouchers and to drug test students, which drew opposition from the Baltimore Teachers Union and from O'Malley, who favored expanding pre-kindergarten and after-school programs, while making summer school mandatory. When discussing the problem of HIV/AIDS in Baltimore, which disproportionately affects African Americans, both O'Malley and Tufaro promised to continue the city's needle exchange program.|$|E
5|$|The Fox and the Hound is a 1967 novel {{written by}} American novelist <b>Daniel</b> <b>P.</b> Mannix and {{illustrated}} by John Schoenherr. It follows the lives of Tod, a red fox raised by a human {{for the first year}} of his life, and Copper, a half-bloodhound dog owned by a local hunter, referred to as the Master. After Tod causes the death of the man's favorite hound, man and dog relentlessly hunt the fox, against the dual backdrops of a changing human world and Tod's normal life in hunting for food, seeking a mate, and defending his territory. As preparation for writing the novel, Mannix studied foxes, both tame and wild, a wide variety of hunting techniques, and the ways hounds appear to track foxes, seeking to ensure his characters acted realistically.|$|E
5|$|Though quite altered {{from its}} {{original}} state in the mid 19th century George's Block {{remains one of the}} more eye catching structures in the Historic District. The George's Block was constructed in 1857 and was then known as the James Block, after the owner <b>Daniel</b> <b>P.</b> James. James, a prominent citizen, lived in the nearby Jerkin-roofed D. B. James House, another contributing property. By the 1860s the James name was gone but the building was still known as a block. Many buildings of the period were known as blocks, usually multi-story and multi-business, the buildings contained retail and professional space or, in the case of George's Block, lecture halls or auditoriums. In the first year the building existed such famous men as Horace Greeley, Charles Sumner and Bayard Taylor spoke there.|$|E

25|$|Irish immigrants, too, were {{settling}} in the South End. Unlike the Germans, {{they did not}} stay in the area; once they grew prosperous, they moved to those {{areas of the city}} they could then afford to live in. Even after St. Ann's Church was established as the neighborhood's parish church in 1867, many of the Irish continued to worship at either the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception north of the Mansion District or St. John's, in the Pastures. But they retained a sentimental attachment to the South End, and <b>Daniel</b> <b>P.</b> O'Connell, boss of the city's Democratic political machine for most of the 20th century, worked out of his father's tavern at Fourth and South Pearl even though he and his family, too, had moved elsewhere in the city.|$|E

Planned streets for the neighborhood were included in Albany's grid pattern as early as 1818. They were built in the middle of the century, and by the 1870s the district had begun to grow rapidly, fueled by German immigrants, a group still closely associated with the South End and the first of several waves of immigrants to leave their mark on it. Irish Americans would also consider it theirs even as they dispersed to other parts of the city, and one native of the district, <b>Daniel</b> <b>P.</b> O'Connell, grew up to become boss of the city's Democratic political machine well into the 20th century, using a now-demolished building in the district as his headquarters.|$|E
25|$|On the band's {{first three}} albums, vocalist Ville Valo was solely {{featured}} on the cover. According to Valo, Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666 was meant as combination of goth and eroticism, while Razorblade Romance {{was influenced by the}} 1980s, as well as glam and pop music, and Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights took inspiration from Lou Reed, Patti Smith, and late 1970s New York City art circles. Love Metal was the first album to prominently feature the heartagram on its cover, which was repeated on the follow-up Dark Light. For Venus Dooms cover, the band used a painting by David Harouni, that Valo had purchased while on tour in New Orleans. Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice made use of a picture of a late 19th-century nun sculpture, that Valo had purchased in Bavaria. On Tears on Tape, HIM used several paintings by <b>Daniel</b> <b>P.</b> Carter for the artwork, as well as a variation of the heartagram on the cover, also by Carter.
