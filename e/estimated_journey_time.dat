This dissertation presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a tool that is used to generate route profiles for use in the ITS domain. The tool is biased for use on the inter-urban national primary routes in the Republic of Ireland. This ubiquitous computing project allows <b>journey</b> <b>times</b> to be generated using a set of probe vehicles. The probe vehicles are tracked using Global Positioning System (GPS). <b>Journey</b> <b>times</b> are tagged with context data such as the prevailing weather conditions during the time the GPS reading was made. To accomplish the above goals, a Geographic Information System (GIS) application was developed in order to process GPS and weather data to produce contextualised journey records. These historical records are stored in a database and queried by a web server to deliver records to the road management tool or traveller information system. This tool has built route profiles of a road network. These route profiles could be used later to provide an indication of the level of service that is being provided by road management authorities. For example, authorities could use the generated <b>journey</b> <b>times</b> as a measure of adequacy for <b>journey</b> <b>times</b> of roads.

40|$|Introduction: The {{complexity}} of fetal medicine (FM) referrals {{that can be}} managed in a district general hospital (DGH) {{is dependent on the}} availability of specialist ultrasound expertise. Telemedicine can effectively transfer real-time ultrasound images via video-conferencing. Aims and objectives: Our objective was to establish a fetal telemedicine service between the obstetric ultrasound unit of a DGH and a specialist FM unit. In evaluating the service we aimed to: (i) determine the technical success of fetal telemedicine; (ii) test the utility of telemedicine technology for training sonographers (iii) assess women’s experiences and acceptance of tele-ultrasound, including a consideration of family costs; (iv) understand the barriers and enablers of technology adoption from the perspectives of clinical stakeholders. Methods: Women referred for FM consultation from the DGH were seen via a weekly telemedicine service, excluding cases where invasive testing was anticipated. Image and audio quality were rated (using a 5 point scale) following each consultation. The service evaluation employed mixed methods. Referred women were asked to complete a questionnaire following their first consultation, 31 did so and follow-up telephone interviews were undertaken with 16 of them. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were also undertaken with six key clinical stakeholders, two commissioners and two service managers. Results: 80 women received a telemedicine consultation between October 2015 and September 2016. Of these, 37 cases were new referrals because of fetal anomaly (n= 17), including exclusion of abnormal placental invasion (n= 11), small-for-gestational age (n= 7) and prior history of fetal anomaly (n= 2); 43 cases were follow-up consultations. Median gestation was 29 [13 - 36] weeks. Image quality was of sufficient quality to achieve the aims of the consultation in 79 cases with an image score of 4 [3 - 5] and audio score of 5 [3 - 5]. The majority of referred women responded positively to fetal telemedicine; identified benefits included cost savings and less inconvenience from being seen locally. Average journey time to the telemedicine consultation was 20 [4 - 150] minutes in comparison to an <b>estimated</b> <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> of 238 [120 - 450] minutes to the FM centre. Estimated family costs for attendance at the FM centre were £ 95 [20 - 555]. A range of tangible benefits to DGH staff were identified in interviews with clinicians. Sonographers were upskilled; more involved in women’s pregnancies; and had better access to specialist support. Consultants felt better supported and less isolated professionally, resulting in improved management of high risk pregnancies. Potential barriers included: engagement of DGH executive/management; establishing the video-link; interruption of routine practise. Most challenges were overcome within the pilot. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that a fetal telemedicine service, that is acceptable to both patients and staff, can be successfully established and used to provide high quality consultations. The service has reduced travel costs and inconvenience for women and has enhanced maternity provision at the DGH...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for evaluating the distributions of stochastic dynamic link travel <b>time</b> and <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> as well as assessing the <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> reliability. Due to the stochastic nature of the flow profiles, the paper devises a sampling process to estimate the probability mass function (PMF) of the link travel time. This sampling process defines a likelihood concept that measures the probability {{of the difference between}} the cumulative stochastic link inflow and outflow profiles to be {{less than or equal to}} a prescribed bound. Based on this likelihood measure, the probability mass function (PMF) of the link travel time is evaluated over an appropriate sampling interval. The PMF of the <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> is then evaluated by extending the deterministic nested delay operator to a stochastic version which is defined as a series of "nested" conditional probabilities of the link travel time PMFs along the route. This paper also proposes a method to fit the PMF of the <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> to a class of statistical distribution to determine its skewness, which is useful in the analysis of <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> reliability. The paper then analyzes <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> reliability via the properties of dynamic travel time distributions such as confidence intervals and shape parameters. The proposed algorithm is applied to <b>estimate</b> the stochastic <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> on a freeway corridor from the stochastic cumulative inflow and outflow profiles generated from the stochastic cell transmission model.

The transport time from scene to ED for all the highest priority dispatches between 1 October 2009 and 30 September 2010 was compared with predictions made by generic GIS software.

Underprediction was statistically significant at all population densities, but unlikely to be of clinical significance. Ambulances in urban areas were able to exceed general traffic speed, whereas, the opposite effect was seen in suburban and rural road networks.

40|$|Four {{separate}} {{studies of}} 'geometric delays' {{at a range}} of non-signalised intersections {{have been carried out}} during the past six years by the Transportation Research Group at Southampton University, under contract to the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) and the Department of Transport (DTp). The term 'geometric delay' has been used to describe the extra time required by vehicles as they slow to negotiate an intersection. In the early studies at roundabouts and priority junctions, relationships were developed for geometric delay based on category analysis and linear regression techniques. In the later studies, however, more emphasis was put on the development of a synthetic model to simulate the speed profiles of vehicles as they negotiated the intersections. Relationships were developed for parameters such as minimum speeds and acceleration/deceleration rates, these relationships being based on readily measureable dynamic or geometric variables. The synthetic model has been extended so that it is now applicable to all forms of non-signalised intersections giving <b>estimates</b> of <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> as well as delay. The form and application of the model is described in detail in this report.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of {{the general}} {{practitioner}} {{in the management of}} patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction is important and specific. It has been recommended that eligible patients should receive thrombolysis within 90 minutes of alerting medical or ambulance services. The administration of prehospital thrombolysis by general practitioners is controversial. Most research into the management of acute myocardial infarction has been hospital based and has not explored differences between urban and rural general practice. AIM: In 1993 - 94 a one-year prospective survey was undertaken of samples of urban and rural general practitioners to examine their management of cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction and to determine whether differences in management existed between the two settings. METHOD: General practitioners were recruited through the continuing medical education faculty network of the Irish College of General Practitioners. Participating general practitioners completed a report form for cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction. Six-week follow-up forms were also completed. RESULTS: A total of 113 general practitioners (54 urban and 59 rural) participated in the study. A total of 57 general practitioners contributed 195 cases, 49 from urban and 146 from rural areas. The mean number of cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction per participant for urban and rural doctors was 0. 9 and 2. 5, respectively. Median delay time from onset of symptoms to contacting the general practitioner was 90 minutes for both urban and rural patients. Median general practitioner response times for urban and rural doctors were 10 and 15 minutes, respectively. Median <b>estimated</b> <b>journey</b> <b>times</b> from location of the patient to hospital for urban and rural patients were 10 and 40 minutes, respectively (P< 0. 001). Rural doctors were more likely, in comparison with their urban counterparts, to administer aspirin (given to 40 % of patients versus 16 %, P< 0. 01) but less likely to administer intravenous morphine (26 % versus 41 %, P< 0. 05). Twenty one patients (11 %) died at the scene; follow-up forms were received for 94 % of the remaining patients. Of these 163 patients, 99 % were admitted to hospital; 49 % were discharged with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and a further 25 % had final diagnoses consistent with acute coronary heart disease. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the management of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction differs in urban and rural settings. Delay times suggest that in order to meet current guidelines, prehospital thrombolysis must become a reality in rural areas...|$|R
40|$|The world {{energy crisis}} {{and global warming}} call for a {{reduction}} of energy consumption. High speed rail, increasingly viewed as an effective solution to inter-city passenger transportation challenge of the 21 st century, has the significant ability of increasing passenger capacity and reducing <b>journey</b> <b>time.</b> The advent of high speed rail provided many research opportunities. So far studies have been contributed from different perspectives: economical, environmental, and technical. The main research gaps are: addressing {{the problem of the}} effects of route geometry on train energy consumption and quantifying the contributing factors towards differences in energy consumption between different types of high speed trains. In addition, this energy assessment cannot be based solely on the energy consumption in the operation phase. In the life cycle assessment of the whole railway system, the vehicle evaluation is relatively straightforward, but the infrastructure raises many difficult issues. In this thesis, an existing approach for modelling the traction energy of electric trains is developed and extended to simulate the train operation under different driving strategies. Baseline simulation is carried out to <b>estimate</b> the <b>journey</b> <b>time</b> and energy consumption of a High Speed 2 (HS 2) reference train running on the London-Birmingham proposed high speed route. The influence of route geometry and train configuration on energy consumption is investigated, based on the metric of energy consumption per passenger kilometre. Simulations are also carried out of different types of high speed rolling stock running on the proposed HS 2 route, to identify the key areas of vehicle design which help to minimise the energy consumption of high speed rail travel. The life cycle assessment of railway infrastructure is carried out in four stages of a whole life cycle: production, operation, maintenance and disposal, the influence of route parameters on life cycle cost is also investigated. Finally, high speed rail is compared with competing modes of transport, i. e. the aircraft, the automobile and the conventional train, in both operational energy efficiency and whole life cycle analysis. The high speed rail transportation has great advantage over the road and air transport, giving a reduction of carbon emission by roughly 95...|$|R
