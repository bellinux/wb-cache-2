40|$|JEL No. H 2 This paper {{explores the}} effect of {{discretion}} in estate valuation techniques on the effective estate tax burden on different asset classes. For some assets, such as liquid securities, there is relatively little discretion in valuation. For other assets, such as partial <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> closely-held businesses, family <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships,</b> and real assets or collectibles that are traded in thin markets, estate valuations may {{be more difficult to}} establish. Estate tax filers may therefore be able to select valuations that reduce the reported value of the estate assets, and therefore the effective estate tax burden. In 1998, estates that invoked the doctrine of &quot;minority discounts &quot; <b>in</b> valuing non-controlling <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> claimed an average discount of 36 percent for these assets, relative to their estimated market value. More than half of all <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> assets reported on estate tax returns were valued using this doctrine. This suggests that for a given statutory estate tax rate, the effective estate tax burden may be greater on assets that are easily valued than on difficult-to-value assets. A comparison of the mix of assets reported on estate tax returns, and the mix the estate tax returns would be predicted to hold, given data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, i...|$|R

Media reports initially suggested that Bombardier had also asked Ottawa for a repayable loan of $350 million [...] but {{it became clear that}} the province expected the federal government match its $1 billion loan in return for a near 50 percent stake in the CSeries jets project. There would be [...] "unbelievable pressure" [...] on this government to help the company, Ian Lee, an economics professor at Carleton University’s Sprott School of Business, predicted. Aid was definitely essential, because the project has saddled Bombardier with debt, forcing it to into a struggle to raise cash in order to keep it afloat.|$|R

40|$|In a {{decision}} in late June, 2009, the United States Tax Court 1 held that ownership <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> a <b>limited</b> liability company (LLC) or <b>limited</b> liability <b>partnership</b> (LLP) should not be treated as <b>limited</b> partners <b>in</b> a <b>limited</b> <b>partnership.</b> 2 About a month later, the U. S. Court of Federal Claims decided a case 3 that went a notch beyond the holding in the earlier Tax Court case. That provides major support for {{the view that the}} statute which states “... [e]xcept as provided <b>in</b> regulations, no <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> a <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> as a <b>limited</b> partner shall be treated as an interest with respect to which a taxpayer materially participates” 4 does not require members of LLCs and LLPs to be <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> how the material participation test 5 can be met. 6 That at least expands the opportunities to meet the material participation test to the seven tests that are ordinarily available to taxpayers 7 rather than the three tests specified in the temporary regulations for limited partners, 8 thus increasing the chances for meeting the required standard of material participation on a regular, continuous and substantial basis. 9 As noted below, the decision by the U. S. Court of Federal Claims goes a step further in favoring the taxpayer...|$|R

50|$|Asset {{protection}} {{consists of}} methods available to protect assets from liabilities arising elsewhere. It {{should not be}} confused with limiting liability, which concerns the ability to stop or constrain liability to the asset or activity from which it arises. Assets that are shielded from creditors by law are few (common examples include some home equity, certain retirement plans and <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> LLCs and <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> even these are not always unreachable). Assets that are almost always unreachable are those to which one does not hold legal title. In many cases it is possible to vest legal title to personal assets in a trust, an agent or a nominee, while retaining all the control of the assets. The goal of asset protection is similar to bankruptcy, and the two practice areas go hand-in-hand. When a debtor has none to few assets, the bankruptcy route is preferable. When the debtor has significant assets, asset protection may be the solution.|$|R
40|$|In Estate of Nowell v. Commissioner, the Tax Court {{considered}} {{the issue of}} valuation discounts on property for purposes of calculating federal estate and gift tax liability. In its memorandum opinion, {{the court held that}} transferred property is valued without considering other similar property held by either the transferor or transferee for estate and gift tax purposes. The Nowell decision provided two important rules. First, a family may transfer property to various trusts and then claim that the total value of all trusts is worth less than the value of the underlying property because each trust owns only a partial share of the property. This is true even when the family still owns and controls the trusts and, therefore, owns and controls all the property. Second, Nowell provides an additional valuation discount when an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> a <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> is transferred and the transferee is treated as an assignee as opposed to a substitute limited partner. This discount is available even when the transferee owns one hundred percent of the remaining partnership, making the distinction between an assignee and a full partner irrelevant. Part II of this note will discuss the relevant law as it existed at the time Nowell was decided. Parts III and IV will then describe the circumstances surrounding the case and how it came to be heard by the court. Next, Part V will offer an explanation of the Tax Court 2 ̆ 7 s analysis, which will then be critiqued and supported in Part VI. Part VII will conclude this note by discussing a method by which to use the Nowell case to obtain maximum valuation discounts in estate planning...|$|R

However, while the fiduciary is now permitted, even encouraged, to develop greater flexibility in overall portfolio management, speculation and outright risk taking is not sanctioned by the rule either, and they remain subject to criticism and possible liability.|$|R
