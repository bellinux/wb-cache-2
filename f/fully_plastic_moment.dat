40|$|The {{incipient}} dynamic deformation {{mechanisms for}} a rigid-plastic semi-circular cantilever beam subjected to an out-of-plane step-loading applied at its tip {{depend on the}} non-dimensional force f and a structural parameter eta, which is {{the ratio of the}} <b>fully</b> <b>plastic</b> torque and the <b>Fully</b> <b>plastic</b> bending <b>moment</b> of the cross-section of the beam. When eta > 1, mechanisms with a single plastic hinge provide complete solutions for the incipient dynamic response. For semi-circular beams for which eta lies in the range 0. 316 < eta < 1 (solid circular and square cross-sections, and thin-walled circular tubular sections all fall into this range), as the magnitude of the applied load f is increased, the incipient deformation mechanism changes from a single-hinge one to a double-hinge one and finally to a triple-hinge one. The last of these contains an interior combined torsion-bending (T-M) hinge, an interior pure-torsion hinge and a hinge at the root. While the triple-hinge provides a complete solution, the single-hinge mechanism gives a good approximate solution to the problem, provided the load f is sufficiently large. The case when eta < 0. 316 while f is very large remains to be fully analysed although some incipient deformation mechanisms for this case are also studied herein...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{based on the}} rigid, perfectly plastic material idealization is proposed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of two deformable beams colliding with each other. The mid-point of a moving free-free beam is assumed to impinge {{on the tip of}} a cantilever beam with the beam axes perpendicular to each other. Complete solutions are obtained for various deformation mechanisms during the dynamic response process for the two deformed beams, and plastic shear sliding is taken into account. Attention is focused on the partitioning of the input energy between the two deformed beams after impact. A deformation map in a governing parameter plane is constructed to permit the calculation of the energy partitioning for a range of the beams' parameters. This consists of nine regions corresponding to various deformation mechanisms. Typical numerical results are presented to demonstrate the influence of structural and geometrical parameters such as the ratios of the <b>fully</b> <b>plastic</b> bending <b>moments</b> of the two beams, of their <b>fully</b> <b>plastic</b> shear forces, of their masses per unit length and their length, on the energy partitioning after impact. Finally, the severance limit is given for the case of both beams having rectangular cross-sections. This indicates that shear sliding failure may happen in either of the beams if the initial kinetic energy is sufficiently large. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{collapse}} {{analysis of}} plane framed structures {{there are many}} methods allowing the collapse mechanism to be determined but {{the position of the}} last plastic hinge always remains unknown, although its location is essential for the analysis of deformation. The ma- ximum displacement theorem could lead to an incorrect result when some plastic hinges are subsequently unloaded. The aim is to formulate an original method, making it easier to identify the final hinge and consequently providing a more thorough understanding of the deformation. The basic idea arises from a simple consideration: giving a framed structure any method of limit analysis allows the collapse mechanism and the moment distribution to be determined. However the last plastic hinge remains unknown.

40|$|AbstractA new {{formulation}} for elastic-perfectly plastic {{contact in}} the normal direction between two round surfaces that is solely based on material properties and contact geometries is developed. The problem is formulated as three separate domains: the elastic regime, mixed elastic–plastic behavior, and unconstrained (<b>fully</b> <b>plastic)</b> flow. Solutions for the force–displacement relationship in the elastic regime follow from Hertz’s classical solution. In the <b>fully</b> <b>plastic</b> regime, two well supported assumptions are made: {{that there is a}} uniform pressure distribution and there is a linear force–deflection relationship. The force–displacement relationship in the intermediate, mixed elastic–plastic regime is approximated by enforcing continuity between the elastic and <b>fully</b> <b>plastic</b> regimes. Transitions between the three regimes are determined based on empirical quantities: the von Mises yield criterion is used to determine the initiation of mixed elastic–plastic deformation, and Brinell’s hardness for the onset of unconstrained flow. Unloading from each of these three regimes is modeled as an elastic process with different radii of curvature based on the regime in which the maximum force occurred. Simulation results explore the relationship between the impact velocity and coefficient of restitution. Further comparisons are made between the model, experimental results found in the literature, and other existing elastic–plastic models. The new model is well supported by the experimental measurements of compliance curves for elastic–plastic materials and of coefficients of restitution from impact studies, and in elastic-perfectly plastic regimes is demonstrated to be more accurate than existing models found in the literature...|$|R
