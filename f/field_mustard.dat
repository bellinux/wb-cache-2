Surprisingly, Fast Plant extracts reduced germination probability and delayed germination more than both controls and Alliaria extract-treated seeds.

40|$|Oregon {{is home to}} {{many members}} of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), native and {{non-native}} species of Cruci-fers, annual and perennial, common and rare. During the summer of 2009, while employed at the Burns District, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Harney County, I had the privilege of collecting seeds from some of Oregon’s most sensitive native mustard species. These seeds were needed for ongoing research in Switzerland, a project dedicated to finding biological control agents for use on non-native mustards classified as noxious in the Pacific Northwest. This article is the result of my independent research, prompted by my concern for one of these sensitive native species and its continued survival in Oregon. Most of Oregon’s non-native mustard species are common an-nuals we all know: yellow alyssum (Alyssum alyssoides), shepherd’s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), <b>field</b> <b>mustard</b> (Brassica rapa), and tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum). Others are perennials that are so invasive that the Oregon Department of Agriculture classifies them as noxious weeds: perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium), and hoary cress/white top (Lepidium draba). Biological control agents for these species must be tested {{to make sure that they}} will not damage rare native species, several of which grow in Oregon.

40|$|This is the {{beginning}} of a long-term venture to tell the histories and the diaspora of a group of families that share the same family name – Coolsaet. This surname almost certainly popped up simultaneously at different locations. But the diaspora of the surname probably started in the plains of Flanders, the northwestern part of what is now Belgium. This project aims at tracing the life stories of the Coolsaet individuals and families involved, to feel the pulse of their journey and to project their personal voyage into the wider background of the events of their times. A family’s journey in the stream of time, so to speak. As is often the case with family names, the origin of the name Coolsaet disappears into the mist of time and certainty is relative. But according to etymologists, the name Coolsaet goes back to the Old High German word kolsaat and its later modifications kôlsât and kôlsâme. Around the year 1000, when the use of surnames became standard practice in Flemish cities, the word was probably introduced to refer to a trader in grains and seeds, in particular of coleseed (the seed of the common rape or cole) but also more specifically to a producer or supplier of koolzaad or rapeseed, a bright yellow flower, used to produce oil (hence it is sometimes referred to as <b>field</b> <b>mustard).</b> The French word colza derives from its Dutch equivalent. The oldest mention of an actual individual with this name dates back to 1285. A document of the City of Bruges mentions a Coelsaed’s farmstead in nearby Dudzele, possibly belonging to a person called Boudin (Baldwin) Coelsaet. From that moment onwards, references to this name in documents start to increase, in particular in the County of Flanders, but also in Brussels, Liège and Zeeland (the westernmost part of the Netherlands). Hence it is unlikely that all Coolsaet families have sprung from the same geographical location. At different locations people must have started to use the name simultaneously. In addition, varying spellings of the name can be found: Coelsaet, Coolzaet, Koolzaed, Colsaet, Colzaerts, Kohlsaat. However, when turning to the diaspora of families with the specific surname of Coolsaet, available historical evidence seems to suggest that the roots of all of them reach back to the same region: the plains of Flanders, the northwestern part of what is now Belgium. The Coolsaet diaspora appears to have started around the mid- 1800 s, first to nearby France. Migration to the United States followed in the early 20 th century. The numbers involved are very small, compared to more widely disseminated surnames. This makes the project at hand all the more achievable – but no less fascinating as to what it learns us on the pains, pitfalls and successes of people migrating since time immemorial. oOo Genealogical research is fraught with uncertainties and unknowns. Information is often scarce, sometimes circumstantial and seldom complete. This also goes for the life stories presented in these Chronicles. Time and attentive readers will without doubt contribute to correcting errors that might have slipped in the text and to connect some dots. The story of the Coolsaet voyage to America is the first step in what ultimately might become the Chronicles of the Coolsaet families. This first stage was made possible thanks to the gracious support of a number of people. I would like to express my gratitude to the volunteers of ‘Dadingisila’, the very dynamic local history group in Dadizele, in West Flanders. They will also be mentioned later on in the Chronicles. I thank in particular: Daisy Decoene, Noël Devos, Xavier Monteyne and Alma Samyn. Peter Van Ammel of the Kortrijk (Courtrai) city archives has been of great help in digging into the archives of Kortrijk and its vicinity. Dominique Verhaeghe of the city archives of Wevelgem helped to clarify the Gullegem scene, also in West Flanders. Cheryl Heckla of the Genealogical Society of Flemish Americans in Detroit has been very helpful with information contained in the databases of the GSFA and in the pages of the Gazette van Detroit. Finally, a last word of gratitude goes to Dr. Jennifer Holvoet, for the precious details about the life stories of the Coolsaet and Holvoet families in Colorado. The migration to France will come next. This part will be written in French. Research on the Coolsaet nebula in Belgium is ongoing.
