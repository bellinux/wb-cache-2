40|$|Problem statement: Over {{the last}} few decades, the oil {{industry}} has shown a growing interest in the new risk analysis methodologies aimed at the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> associated with reservoir exploitation. In particular, the effort is made to take all possible sources of uncertainties into account so that not only the strengths but also the potential weaknesses of each possible technical and economic exploitation strategy are highlighted. Approach: The main parameters used to calculate strategic information, such as the Hydrocarbon Originally In Place (HOIP) and to define proper field development plans, are porosity, fluid saturations and Net To Gross (NTG). These quantities are typically obtained through the log interpretation process, which is an inverse problem where the main petrophysical characteristics are calculated as the acceptable minimum of a cost function. The cost function describes the discrepancy between measured and simulated logs with the latter being reproduced {{on the basis of}} an assumed formation model. Results: The results of the calculation process can be affected by several uncertainties related to the physics and calibration of the measuring tools, the identification of the proper formation model and the quantification of the formation model coefficients. An effective and robust methodology able to provide a reliable evaluation of petrophysical properties and the assessment of the associated uncertainties is presented and discussed in this study. The log interpretation process was approached as a linearly constrained optimization problem, solved by coupling a Lagrange-Newton method with a primal active set algorithm. Conclusion: The <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> was obtained by coupling the optimization algorithm with the Monte Carlo approach. The results obtained by the application of the methodology to a real case, where the interpretation was complicated by a poor characterization of the reservoir fluids, are also presented the stud...|$|E

In the present contribution we explore both factors. Regarding the first aspect we use a re-normalization for χ 2, similar to the one proposed by R. T. Birge.

40|$|Abstract: A data {{reconciliation}} module, {{based on the}} measurements from the hydraulic network, has been recently developed and implemented in the supervisory system of the Société du Canal de Provence SCP. The software has initially been used daily to check the measured flow on the main canal. The {{data reconciliation}} occurs just after the measurement process. The measurement network on the hydraulic system includes many sensors subject to failure or deviation and is spread over a huge area. In addition, discharge and volume measurements in open-channel hydraulic networks are characterized by large uncertainties. The objective of the data reconciliation is {{to take advantage of}} information redundancy on a system to make a cross-check of real-time measurements. By using this information redundancy, a data reconciliation module allows detection of inconsistent measurements and measurement deviations and provides corrected values whether the initial measurements are valid, biased, or invalid. A derived consequence is better scheduling of the maintenance of sensors. The results are corrected values for measured variables and proposed values for nonmeasured quantities. A statistical analysis of the results is performed. This analysis allows <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> attached to the estimated flows and volume values. It allows also detecting invalid measurements and drift of sensors and making decesions about which maintenance operations to perform. DOI: XXX...|$|E
