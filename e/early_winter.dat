5|$|The fruit bodies grow in {{clusters}} or {{scattered on the}} decomposing leaves and acorns of oak trees, such as Coast Live Oak, Valley Oak and Black Oak. It is common in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it appears from late autumn to <b>early</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E
5|$|A similar {{situation}} occurred in New Zealand, where the song hit {{number one in}} the <b>early</b> <b>winter</b> of 2007 as the country was experiencing some of the worst storms in its history. During the weather conditions, Taranaki, Tauranga, and Auckland had experienced tornadoes and flooding in the Far North of the country. Once the single was replaced on the top spot, weather conditions throughout New Zealand pacified, although Hawke's Bay was still stormy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It has sometimes been viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important <b>early</b> <b>winter</b> period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.|$|E
5000|$|After {{learning}} about the product, Nicolai, Edwards, and Zimmerman requested sample material for experimentation, and in Winter 1975, they produced a prototype tent that they subjected to testing in extreme outdoor conditions. [...] After success with the prototype tent, <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> became the first commercial company {{to place an order}} for Gore-Tex fabric. [...] <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> introduced The Light Dimension tent in May 1976. [...] This tent, along with other items made with GORE-TEX fabric, debuted in the first official <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> catalogue.|$|R
50|$|<b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> {{approached}} $20 million (USD) {{in annual}} sales, mostly through catalogs, before being {{sold to the}} Orvis company in 1984. It was later purchased by the Norm Thompson group in Portland, Oregon. In 2004 Norm Thompson renamed the company Sahalie who still sells <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> branded clothing.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, Gore {{salesman}} Joe Tanner introduced <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> to {{the fabric}} product, which {{at that time}} was still without a name. Over a two-year period, Tanner had made numerous sales calls and had been turned down by companies such as REI, Eddie Bauer, and The North Face. <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> was the first company to realize the significance of Gore-Tex fabrics for outdoor applications. In fact, the timing of Tanner's visit was fortuitous since <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> had a lightweight, single-walled tent design for which they were seeking a waterproof and breathable fabric solution.|$|R
5|$|Entoloma austroprunicolor is a {{commonly}} occurring mushroom of wet sclerophyll forests in Tasmania. Fruiting occurs from late spring to <b>early</b> <b>winter,</b> with most fruit bodies recorded between {{the months of}} January to March. In {{a study of the}} distribution of mushroom species in this area, it was found to occur only in mature or uncut forests.|$|E
5|$|In {{late fall}} and <b>early</b> <b>winter,</b> the mansion is host to several {{theatrical}} performances. From {{the end of}} October to mid-November, Poe Evermore, a storytelling event based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe is held. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, Victorian Christmas or A Dickens of a Christmas, the telling {{of the story of}} A Christmas Carol, is performed.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} H.olivaceoalbus {{stretches}} across {{the northern and}} western North America as well as across Europe (except the Mediterranean region) and Russia. The fungus typically fruits between late summer and <b>early</b> <b>winter,</b> and occasionally (depending on the geographical location and climate) as early as June or right through December. The population is currently not endangered, except in France, where it is almost extinct.|$|E
50|$|Liberty Bell Mountain {{is located}} in the North Cascades, {{approximately}} one mile south of Washington Pass on the North Cascades Highway.

5|$|The section between London and Woodstock {{generally}} {{parallels the}} former Highway2 but {{lies on the}} south side of the Thames River. This area is not as flat but the highway is generally straight. This part of Highway401 often experiences heavy snowsqualls in <b>early</b> <b>winter,</b> sometimes extending as far east as Toronto. To the south of Woodstock, Highway401 curves northeast and encounters the western terminus of Highway403. The highway heads towards Kitchener and Cambridge, where it encounters Highway8 and returns to its eastward orientation.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found at low {{elevations}} in semi-arid to humid areas in habitats ranging from scrubland and abandoned farmland to wood edge. It prefers areas with dense thickets, scrub or understory, and is uncommon in taller forest where the vegetation beneath the canopy is more open. Although {{it is largely}} sedentary, {{there may be some}} localized seasonal movements away from the drier northern parts of the Yucatán Peninsula in late summer to <b>early</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus in {{the wide}} sense, i.e. {{including}} probably several species, is found in Europe, the Black sea region in northeastern Turkey, and eastern and central North America east of Minnesota. It has been accidentally introduced into Australasia, where it is found under introduced and native trees. It is found {{on the floor in}} deciduous woodland, particularly under beech (Betula), and can be found throughout summer and autumn and into <b>early</b> <b>winter.</b> It is relatively common, though not as common as the similar species L. vellereus. L. piperatus is found solitarily or in scattered groups. It is sometimes found growing together with Russula cyanoxantha.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Early</b> <b>Winters,</b> Ltd. of Seattle, Washington, United States {{was founded}} in 1972 by William S. Nicolai, who formed the company after {{creating}} a tent called the Omnipotent. [...] <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> was the first company to create and sell a consumer product made with Gore-Tex laminates produced by W. L. Gore & Associates in Elkton, Maryland. The first product made with Gore-Tex fabric debuted in 1976 and was a streamlined, two-person tent called The Light Dimension. The tent was created by Nicolai and William H. Edwards and was marketed by Ron Zimmerman.|$|R
5|$|Like all Phallaceae species, C.columnatus is saprobic, {{and uses}} {{extracellular}} digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter, like wood. As {{a consequence of}} its predilection for dead wood, the fungus {{is often associated with}} disturbed habitats. It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of mulch, wood chips or other cellulose-rich materials. The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots, stumps, and other woody material. The species grows in sandy soil, near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil. Fruit bodies appear singly, or scattered, and can arise in the summer, autumn, and <b>early</b> <b>winter,</b> especially after wet weather.|$|E
5|$|On occasion, {{groups of}} {{unrelated}} juveniles are observed. River otters living in groups hunt and travel together, {{use the same}} dens, resting sites, and latrines, and perform allogrooming. In freshwater systems, groups occur most often in autumn and during <b>early</b> <b>winter.</b> From mid-winter through the breeding season, adult females move and den alone. River otters are not territorial, but individual otters of different groups portray mutual avoidance. Home ranges of males are larger than those of females, and both sexes exhibit intra- and intersexual overlap of their domains.|$|E
5|$|Over 190 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} near the bay, some of which {{use it as a}} feeding ground during their migrations. Waders and wildfowl often over-winter on the reserve. The populations of whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) and black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) are internationally important. Significant populations of dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope) also frequent the bay. In <b>early</b> <b>winter</b> the wigeon select Puccinellia maritima in preference to Agrostis stolonifera and Festuca rubra. Avocets have become regular autumn and winter visitors to the area in recent years, favouring the lower reaches of the River Parrett, and, {{for the first time in}} over 50 years, bred on the reserve in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|When Tanner showed <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> {{the product}} sample, the <b>Early</b> <b>Winters</b> staff tried it out {{by using a}} rubber band to secure {{a sample of the}} fabric over a coffee cup filled with boiling water. This allowed visible steam to pass through the Gore-Tex fabric, but when the cup was turned over, no liquid was claimed to come through. This {{consumer}} demonstration became known at W.L. Gore & Associates as the [...] "Z Square" [...] test, named after Zimmerman. This [...] "coffee cup" [...] demonstration has become well known in the outdoor industry because it is an effective way to convey the concept of fabric that is waterproof, yet breathable.|$|R

5000|$|O’Neill {{has stated}} that he deeply resented John Kerry's 1971 {{testimony}} before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which, among other things, related controversial testimony about American atrocities given by Vietnam veterans at the <b>earlier</b> <b>Winter</b> Soldier Investigation in Detroit.|$|R
5|$|Previously, {{portions}} of the Great Lakes were hit by a significant lake effect snow event which dumped incredible amounts of snow over {{portions of}} central New York. Several areas received over 115inches (over 2.5m) of snow in a ten-day period just before the large winter storm as northwesterly winds and unfrozen lake surfaces due to the <b>early</b> <b>winter</b> warm weather favored the heavy snowfall. Several areas across Michigan and Ontario also received significant amounts of snow with locally 1meter (3.3ft) of snow east of Georgian Bay in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in late fall, <b>early</b> <b>winter,</b> and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City {{can be attributed to the}} lake effect.|$|E
5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In <b>early</b> <b>winter,</b> the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves in a strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E
50|$|By 1 June 1941, the Red Army possessed 1,070 USVs. Many {{were lost}} in combat, but some {{remained}} in service {{until the end of}} the German-Soviet War. It's not clear whether the gun saw combat in the <b>earlier</b> <b>Winter</b> War.|$|R
50|$|The {{first report}} of using Gore-Tex to make waterproof, {{breathable}} garments {{appeared in a}} market report, April 13, 1972. The manufacturing process was patented in 1972. The first commercial sales of Gore-Tex were made in 1976 when <b>Early</b> <b>Winters,</b> Ltd., began making and selling Gore-Tex tents. The next year Early sold Gore-Tex rainwear.|$|R
5|$|The <b>earliest</b> <b>winter</b> service {{vehicles}} were snow rollers, designed {{to maintain a}} smooth, even road surface for sleds, although horse-drawn snowplows and gritting vehicles are recorded in use as early as 1862.

5|$|There is no {{recorded}} {{information on the}} Lānai hookbill's breeding behavior. However, the other Hawaiian honeycreepers are remarkably uniform in their breeding behavior, and it is therefore likely that the hookbills also bred from <b>early</b> <b>winter</b> {{through the end of}} summer in August, with pair bonding being completed by January or February. The males likely defended a territory that moved along with his bonded female and became a centered around the nest after the female constructed it. It is hypothesized that the hookbill laid two to three eggs and that its young were altricial.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria is a {{cosmopolitan}} mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the temperate and boreal {{regions of the}} Northern Hemisphere, including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as Hindu Kush, the Mediterranean and also Central America. A recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the Siberian–Beringian region in the Tertiary period, before radiating outwards across Asia, Europe and North America. The season for fruiting varies in different climates: fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of North America, but later in autumn and <b>early</b> <b>winter</b> on the Pacific coast. This species is often found in similar locations to Boletus edulis, and may appear in fairy rings. Conveyed with pine seedlings, it has been widely transported into the southern hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, {{where it can be}} found in the southern Brazilian states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into <b>early</b> <b>winter.</b> A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.|$|E
