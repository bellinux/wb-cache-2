5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began.

The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout.

The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws.

5|$|In 1603 Dudley {{initiated}} {{moves to}} prove that he was the legitimate son of his parents and thus the heir to the earldoms of Warwick and Leicester. If successful, this claim would not only have implied that Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester had been bigamous, but would also have nullified her jointure rights. Consequently, in February 1604, she <b>filed</b> <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> against Dudley in the Star Chamber, accusing him of defamation. She was backed by Sir Robert Sidney, who considered himself the only legitimate heir of his uncles Leicester and Warwick. During the Star Chamber proceedings 56 former servants and friends of the Earl of Leicester testified that he had always regarded Dudley as his illegitimate son. The other side was unable to cite clear evidence and the King's chief minister, Robert Cecil, thought it unwise to rake up the existing property settlement, so the outcome was in favour of Lady Leicester. All the evidence was impounded to preclude a resumption of the case.|$|E

Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh, Grewal, and Murphy. Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering the tapes to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet.
