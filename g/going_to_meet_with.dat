25|$|She {{served as}} the United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia (August 23, 1989 – July 12, 1992), having been {{appointed}} by President George H. W. Bush. She {{was the first and}} only female US ambassador to the former Czechoslovakia. Temple was a witness to two crucial moments in the history of Czechoslovakia's fight against communism. She was in Prague in August 1968, {{as a representative of the}} International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>with</b> Czechoslovakian party leader Alexander Dubček on the very day that Soviet-backed forces invaded the country. Dubček fell out of favor with the Soviets after a series of reforms known as the Prague Spring. Temple, who was stranded at a hotel as the tanks rolled in, sought refuge on the roof of the hotel. She later reported that it was from here she saw an unarmed woman on the street gunned down by Soviet forces, a sight that stayed with her for the rest of her life. Later, after she became ambassador to Czechoslovakia, she was present in the Velvet Revolution, which brought about the end of communism in Czechoslovakia. Temple played a critical role in hastening the end of the communist regime by openly sympathizing with anti-communist dissidents and later establishing formal diplomatic relations with the newly elected government led by Václav Havel. She took the unusual step of personally accompanying Havel on his first official visit to Washington, travelling on the same plane.|$|E

In September, Simpson said that, although it would be [...] "a dream" [...] to work with Smith, it had never happened and she had been embarrassed by the rumor.|$|E
