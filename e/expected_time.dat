5|$|Linear probing {{can provide}} high {{performance}} {{because of its}} good locality of reference, but is {{more sensitive to the}} quality of its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes. It takes constant <b>expected</b> <b>time</b> per search, insertion, or deletion when implemented using a random hash function, a 5-independent hash function, or tabulation hashing. However, good results can be achieved in practice with other hash functions such as MurmurHash.|$|E

30|$|Accordingly, various routing metrics {{are used}} by these routing protocols. For instance, MR-LQSR (multi-radio link-quality source routing—utilizing ETT/WCETT {{weighted}} cumulative <b>expected</b> transmission <b>time</b> metric) [49] is another link-state routing protocol. In MR-LQSR [49], <b>expected</b> transmission <b>time</b> (ETT) of a packet over the link {{is a function of}} the loss rate and bandwidth of the link. The authors consider the combination of the MTM [23] and the expected transmission count metric (ETX) [44] as the <b>expected</b> transmission <b>time</b> metric (ETT) and furthermore added a weighted factor for channel diversity which is referred as weighted cumulative <b>expected</b> transmission <b>time</b> metric (WCETT).|$|R
5|$|Using linear probing, {{dictionary}} operations can {{be implemented}} in constant <b>expected</b> <b>time.</b> In other words, insert, remove and search operations {{can be implemented}} in O(1), {{as long as the}} load factor of the hash table is a constant strictly less than one.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key {{is computed by}} using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant <b>expected</b> <b>time</b> per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.|$|E
25|$|Because {{tabulation}} hashing is {{a universal}} hashing scheme, {{it can be used}} in any hashing-based algorithm in which universality is sufficient. For instance, in hash chaining, the <b>expected</b> <b>time</b> per operation is proportional to the sum of collision probabilities, which is the same for any universal scheme as it would be for truly random hash functions, and is constant whenever the load factor of the hash table is constant. Therefore, tabulation hashing can be used to compute hash functions for hash chaining with a theoretical guarantee of constant <b>expected</b> <b>time</b> per operation.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} approach to approximate the <b>expected</b> waiting <b>times</b> for loads {{arriving at the}} loading stations in discrete-space, fixed-window, closed-loop conveyors. The <b>expected</b> waiting <b>times</b> are important for estimating the expected work-in-process (WIP) levels at individual loading stations (which {{can be used to}} facilitate buffer sizing) and to measure the overall performance of the conveyor loop. Derivation of the <b>expected</b> waiting <b>times</b> is complicated by our observation that the contents of adjacent windows on the conveyor is correlated under a range of conveyor speeds, and the <b>expected</b> waiting <b>times</b> are affected by this correlation. In fact, using analytical results and a numerical example based on simulation, we show that the above correlation has a significant impact on <b>expected</b> waiting <b>times.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier B.

25|$|Cuckoo hashing, another {{technique}} for implementing hash tables, guarantees constant time per lookup (regardless of the hash function). Insertions into a cuckoo hash table may fail, causing the entire table to be rebuilt, but such failures are sufficiently {{unlikely that the}} <b>expected</b> <b>time</b> per insertion (using either a truly random hash function or a hash function with logarithmic independence) is constant. With tabulation hashing, on the other hand, the best bound known on the failure probability is higher, high enough that insertions cannot be guaranteed to take constant <b>expected</b> <b>time.</b> Nevertheless, tabulation hashing is adequate to ensure the linear-expected-time construction of a cuckoo hash table for a static set of keys that does not change as the table is used.|$|E

25|$|In Norden's {{version of}} the system, the bombardier first looked up the <b>expected</b> <b>time</b> {{it would take for}} the bombs to fall from the current altitude. This time was set into a {{countdown}} stopwatch, and the bombardier waited for the target to line up with a set of iron sights {{at the front of the}} bombsight. When the target passed through the sights, the timer was started, and the bombardier then rotated the telescope around its vertical axis to track the target as they approached it. This movement was linked to a second sight through a gearing system that caused the second to move twice as fast as the first. The bombardier continued moving the telescope until the timer ran out. The second sight was now at the correct aiming angle, or range angle; the bombardier moved his eyes to look through this second set of sights to time the drop.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this feature {{is that the}} computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an attack vector. This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking {{that at least two}} different nodes report the same answer for a given work unit. Discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, {{due to the lack of}} central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or dial-up Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units (thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity) and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in <b>expected</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
