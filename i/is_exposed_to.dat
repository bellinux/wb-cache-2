5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E
5|$|Mercury(II) oxide, {{the main}} oxide of mercury, arises when the metal <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> air {{for long periods}} at {{elevated}} temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400°C, as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone {{levels in}} males {{have been shown}} to vary {{according}} to the ovulating state of females. Males who <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> scents of ovulating women recorded a higher testosterone level than males who <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> scents of nonovulating women. <b>Being</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> female ovulating cues may increase testosterone, which in turn may increase males' motivation to engage in, and initiate, sexual behaviour. Ultimately, these higher levels of testosterone may increase the reproductive success of males <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> female ovulation cues.|$|R

5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
50|$|Sixty-two {{percent of}} the {{children}} in hazardous labor were working in the agriculture sector, 30.1 percent were in the services sector, and the rest (7.6%) worked in the industry sector. Among the boys, 67.9 percent were in agriculture; while among the girls, 51.2 percent. For every five children in hazardous labor, two <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> physical hazards only (39.9%) and one <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> both chemical and physical hazards (Table 7). The rest <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> other types of hazards.|$|R
40|$|To {{prove the}} utility of antibiotic-removal beads in {{separating}} antibiotics from bacterial samples, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> five separate quinolones before and after each <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> antibiotic-removal beads. Plates treated with antibiotic solutions that <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> beads demonstrated antibiotic removal, and plates treated with antibiotic solutions that <b>were</b> not <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> beads demonstrated antibiotic carryover. After exposure to beads, fluoroquinolone concentrations decreased from 5 micrograms/ml to 0. 14 micrograms/ml (ciprofloxacin), 0. 04 micrograms/ml (temafloxacin), < 0. 01 microgram/ml (ofloxacin), < 0. 01 microgram/ml (sparfloxacin), and 0. 02 micrograms/ml (clinafloxacin). These data indicate that antibiotic carryover can be successfully circumvented {{through the use of}} antibiotic-removal beads...|$|R
5000|$|The {{participants}} in this experiment were 36 boys and 36 girls from the Stanford University nursery school, all {{between the ages of}} 37 months and 69 months {{with a mean age of}} 52 months (here and following, [...] ). The children were organized into 4 groups and a control group. The 4 groups <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the aggressive model and non-aggressive model belonged to the experimental group. 24 children <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> an aggressive model and 24 children <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a non-aggressive model. The two groups were then divided into males and females, which ensured that half of the children <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> models of their own sex and the other half <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> models of the opposite sex. The remaining 24 children were part of a control group.|$|R
5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the acute effects, radiation exposure (both internal and external) carries a long-term risk of death from cancer of 5–10% per Sv. The general population <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> small amounts of polonium as a radon daughter in indoor air; the isotopes 214Po and 218Po are thought to cause {{the majority of the}} estimated 15,000–22,000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that have been attributed to indoor radon. Tobacco smoking causes additional exposure to polonium.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Canadian Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine {{developed}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial decompression model. This differs from Haldanian models which are parallel models {{and assume that}} all compartments are exposed to ambient partial pressures and no gas interchange occurs between compartments. A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place {{through a series of}} compartments, and only one <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the ambient partial pressures and is in effect a compartmentalised version of the Hempelman bulk diffusion slab model.|$|E

50|$|Speakers of Turkish and Azerbaijani can {{communicate}} with each other but both languages have substantial variation and mutual intelligibility is enhanced when Azerbaijani speakers have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Turkish television (e.g. Turkish soap operas) or when Turkish speakers have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Azerbaijani pop music. Most Azerbaijanis, however, <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Turkish television, and, therefore, they tend to be better able to understand Turkish than vice versa. There are also numerous Turkish schools in the Republic of Azerbaijan that give students more exposure to Turkish than the average Turkish-speaker has to Azerbaijani.|$|R
5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> flies {{known as}} cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the}} family Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional methods.|$|E

50|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2000 used geographic census data and outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration data {{to examine the}} disparities of NO2 air pollution across the United States. The study found that there is disproportional disparities {{in terms of both}} race and socioeconomic groups. The people of color <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 4.6 ppb more than average NO2 concentrations than white people. Those who live in below poverty level <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 1.2 ppb more. Lower-income Caucasians <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 3.4 ppb higher NO2 concentrations than the higher-income Caucasians. The study also reports disproportional disparities of NO2 concentration exposure by education level; those who without high school education are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> higher concentrations. Association between NO2 exposure and cancer development has been found in many studies.|$|R
