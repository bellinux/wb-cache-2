5|$|In 2003, Boeing {{introduced}} overhead crew rests as {{an option}} on the 777. Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the <b>forward</b> <b>flight</b> crew rest contains two seats and two bunks, while the aft cabin crew rest features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during <b>forward</b> <b>flight</b> mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during <b>forward</b> <b>flight.</b> The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E

5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its {{attacks on the}} airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second {{in command of the}} BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were {{able to take advantage of}} the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the <b>forward</b> <b>flight</b> deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.|$|E
25|$|When in <b>forward</b> <b>flight,</b> the Aeroscraft is {{controlled}} by the aerodynamic control surfaces (vertical stabilizers, empennages and canards); however, the low speed control system aids the pilot in lower wind conditions such as during VTOL and hover. The LSC system acts as a rear thruster to propel the vehicle in <b>forward</b> <b>flight,</b> and permits the thrust to be redirected while in hover to help the vehicle maintain desired positioning and orientation.|$|E

2500|$|Although de Bothezat's {{invention}} {{was hailed}} by Thomas Edison as [...] "the first successful helicopter", {{full control of}} the aircraft in flight remained elusive; in addition, the aircraft required a favorable wind to achieve <b>forwards</b> <b>flight.</b> However, despite its faults, the de Bothezat helicopter did prove to be remarkably stable. De Bothezat wanted to build an improved version of the craft, but in 1924, the Army Air Service decided to terminate further work on the project, canceling the contract and ordering the helicopter to be scrapped. However, the aircraft's control column has survived, and is {{on display in the}} Smithsonian Institution's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.|$|R
40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} a shaft-fixed bearingless rotor is analyzed in wind-tunnel tests {{for a wide}} range of operating conditions in order to determine whether such a system could be made aeroelastically stable without incorporating auxiliary dampers. The model rotor and blade properties are determined and used as an input to a bearingless-rotor analysis. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results in hover and <b>forward</b> <b>flights.</b> The analysis predicts the lag mode damping satisfactorily for collective pitch between 5 deg and 10 deg; however, the quasi-steady linear aerodynamic modeling overpredicts the damping values for higher collective pitch settings. It is noted that soft blade pitch links improve aeroelastic stability in hover and at low advance ratio...|$|R

A simulated generic ice shape was attached to the rotor blades and performance data were obtained for both hover and <b>forward</b> <b>flights.</b> Significant degradation in helicopter performance with respect to torque and thrust coefficient was observed; the rotor tip region was especially sensitive. Two-dimensional wind tunnel tests were conducted over a Reynolds number range 0. 7 - 3 x 10 to the 6 th in order to investigate the effect of Reynolds number on the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil in both clean and iced configurations. Only minimal dependence of the aerodynamic data on Reynolds number was observed...|$|R

25|$|The Aeroscraft is {{equipped}} with vectored thrust engines that rotate and allow maneuverability.

5|$|In its design, the XR-1 bore {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, a helicopter developed by Henrich Focke in Germany that, flown by Hanna Reitsch, had impressed Platt-LePage co-founder Wynn LePage during a tour of Europe. The XR-1 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial engine, mounted in a buried installation within the fuselage. The aircraft had two, three-bladed rotors, mounted in a side-by-side arrangement on wing-like pylons. The pylons were aerodynamically designed to produce some lift when in <b>forwards</b> <b>flight,</b> slightly unloading the rotors. The construction of the XR-1 was conventional {{by the standards of}} the time, with the aircraft's frame consisting of a steel-tube framework, which was covered with fabric. The XR-1 had tail surfaces similar to those of a conventional aircraft, and was equipped with a fixed, taildragger landing gear. The aircraft's wheels freely castered for easier maneuvering on the ground.|$|R
50|$|No. 4 <b>Forward</b> Air Control <b>Flight</b> was a Royal Australian Air Force forward {{air control}} {{training}} unit. The Flight was formed on 1 April 1970 at RAAF Base Williamtown and {{was equipped with}} four CAC Winjeel aircraft. The Flight was responsible for training RAAF, Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army pilots and participated in most Australian military exercises. No. 4 <b>Forward</b> Air Control <b>Flight</b> was disbanded on 1 January 1989 and became 'C' Flight of the newly reformed No. 76 Squadron. No. 4 Squadron is the RAAF's current forward air control unit.|$|R
25|$|Testing quickly {{demonstrated}} {{that the idea of}} using a single engine to provide air for both the lift curtain and <b>forward</b> <b>flight</b> required too many trade-offs. A Blackburn Marboré for forward thrust and two large vertical rudders for directional control were added, producing the SR.N1 Mk II. A further upgrade with the Armstrong Siddeley Viper produced the Mk III. Further modifications, especially the addition of pointed nose and stern areas, produced the Mk IV.|$|E
25|$|The {{convertiplane}} {{featured a}} single Continental-built R-975 radial piston engine that powered twin air compressors. The compressors pumped air via ducts {{to the main}} rotor for vertical flight, while the engine drove the two-bladed pusher propeller for horizontal flight. During <b>forward</b> <b>flight</b> the wing provided 80% of the lift with the remainder generated by the main rotor autorotating at about 50% of normal rpm. When in hover mode, the rotor turned at 410 RPM but slowed to 180 RPM for high-speed flight above 125 knots.|$|E
25|$|The de Bothezat helicopter, {{also known}} as the Jerome-de Bothezat Flying Octopus, was an {{experimental}} quadrotor helicopter built for the United States Army Air Service by George de Bothezat in the early 1920s, and was said at the time to be the first successful helicopter. Although its four massive six-bladed rotors allowed the craft to successfully fly, it suffered from complexity, control difficulties, and high pilot workload, and was reportedly only capable of <b>forward</b> <b>flight</b> in a favorable wind. The Army canceled the program in 1924, and the aircraft was scrapped.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to present}} {{the design of a}} {{stability}} augmentation system (SAS) in the longitudinal and lateral axes for an unstable helicopter. Design/methodology/approach – The feedback controller is designed using linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control with full state feedback and LQR with output feedback approaches. SAS is designed to meet the handling qualities specification known as Aeronautical Design Standard (ADS- 33 E-PRF). A helicopter having a soft inplane four-bladed hingeless main rotor and a four-bladed tail rotor with conventional mechanical controls is used for the simulation studies. In the simulation studies, the helicopter is trimmed at hover, low speeds and <b>forward</b> speeds <b>flight</b> conditions. The performance of the helicopter SAS schemes are assessed with respect to the requirements of ADS- 33 E-PRF. Findings – The SAS in the longitudinal axis meets the requirement of the Level 1 handling quality specifications in hover and low speed as well as for <b>forward</b> speed <b>flight</b> conditions. The SAS in the lateral axis meets the requirement of the Level 2 handling quality specifications in both hover and low speed as well as for <b>forward</b> speed <b>flight</b> conditions. The requirements of the inter axis coupling is also met and shown for the coupled dynamics case. The SAS in lateral axis may require an additional control augmentation system or adaptive control to meet the Level 1 requirements. Originality/value – The study shows that the design of a SAS using LQR control algorithm with full state and output feedbacks can be used to meet ADS- 33 handling quality specifications...|$|R

25|$|The second {{aircraft}} was modified {{from the original}} XV-1 {{in an attempt to}} reduce parasitic drag during high-speed <b>forward</b> <b>flight.</b> To achieve this end, the rotor pylon was reduced and the undercarriage was streamlined as well as strengthened. The second XV-1 also featured two small tail rotors mounted on the outboard side {{at the end of each}} tailboom. These were a result of the hover test flights by Noll who remarked on the lack of yaw authority when using rudders only. The original XV-1 would later be modified with the tail rotors.|$|E
25|$|The {{suggested}} minimum noise take-off {{technique for}} the HS.141 {{was to use}} full power from the lift engines in a vertical climb to 250ft(76m) then reducing power to 83% to continue this climb to 1,000ft (300m). At this height the aircraft would transition into <b>forward</b> <b>flight</b> using vectored thrust from the lift engines and then accelerate and climb to 2,000ft (600m) using increasing thrust from the cruise engines. By this stage the aircraft would have reached an airspeed of 168knots (310km/h) and would be fully supported by its wings alone, the lift engines being shut down and covered by hinged doors.|$|E
25|$|The second Type 173 was {{designated}} Type 173 Mk 2 and allocated military serial XH379, {{and had a}} revised landing gear, with castoring front wheels and fixed rear wheels. It was also fitted with small stub wings at {{the front and rear}} to improve the cruise speed, the stub wings being removed after a few flights when the helicopter was used for Naval trials, and an unswept tailplane was added. As a result of the trials the Royal Navy showed an interest in ordering the type for carrier duties. In August 1956 the second prototype was leased to British European Airways for evaluation. The Mk 2 aircraft was destroyed in an accident during an air show at Filton in September 1956. The helicopter crashed into the ground nose first while making the transition from hover to <b>forward</b> <b>flight.</b> The crew escaped unharmed but the aircraft was written off. After the crash the tailplane was salvaged from the Mk 2 and fitted to the Mk 1 to investigate the best configuration for stability.|$|E

25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in <b>forward</b> <b>flight</b> is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E
500|$|Rotating the {{vectored}} thrust nozzles into a forward-facing position during normal flight is called vectoring in <b>forward</b> <b>flight,</b> or [...] "VIFFing".
