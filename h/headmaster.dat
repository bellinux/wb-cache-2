The point of departure of analysis and discussion will be our primary qualitative and quantitative analysis. This consists of two interviews with administrative heads of the school area in Herning and Faaborg-Midtfyn and six interviews with three <b>headmasters</b> from each municipality. Our theoretical point of conjecture, on the other hand, is the new institutional-organizational view; focusing on the interaction of the surrounding environment and the organizational challenges the <b>headmasters</b> are faced with. By way of identification and explanation of these challenges influencing the area and the effects on the <b>headmasters</b> we will supply supplemental theories on New Public Management tendencies, Structural, Motivational and Acknowledgement Theories...|$|R
