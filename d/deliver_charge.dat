40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} Wiegand {{magnetic}} sensors {{as energy}} harvesters for low-power electronic equipments. When subject to an external, time-varying magnetic field, a Wiegand device releases a triangular voltage pulse several volts wide and of the duration of a few tens of microseconds. Due to the sharpness of the magnetic transition, pulse generation occurs regardless of how slowly the magnetic field variation occurs, an attractive feature which enables its use as an energy harvester even {{in the presence of}} low-frequency sources. In this paper, commercial Wiegand sensors are first experimentally characterized, with the purpose of devising a simple electrical model and derive the conditions for maximum energy extraction. Next, the use of Wiegand devices is discussed in the context of two modes of operation, namely, one-shot and battery-charging. In the former, the energy delivered by the Wiegand pulse is entirely utilized by the load circuitry in a one-shot fashion. In the latter, the Wiegand device is periodically excited so as to continuously <b>deliver</b> <b>charge</b> to an on-board rechargeable battery. Harvesting circuits are presented for both cases, and simulations and experimental results are provided supporting the developed theory and the effectiveness of the proposed implementations. With proof-of-concept harvesting prototypes based on discrete components, experimental figures of the extracted energy per pulse amount to 24 nJ/pulse in one-shot operation and 30 nJ/pulse in the battery-charging case. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Boosted IC engine development, both diesel and gasoline, {{is driving}} the need for better charge air {{temperature}} control. Charge air temperature directly and indirectly influences engine performance, fuel economy & emissions. To date charge air temperature control has, in the main, been passive; aiming only to reduce temperatures towards, but still above, ambient temperature. Driven by increasing specific output, the opportunities for sub-ambient charge cooling need to be investigated. For some real world driving conditions it is also desirable to raise the charge temperature. Air Cycle Technology ltd (ACT), working with the University of Huddersfield (UoH) are developing a controllable charge air cooling system, which will <b>deliver</b> <b>charge</b> air at sub-ambient temperature over a wide engine operating range. The system uses a turbo-expander to deliver air-cycle cooling in a simple and practical way. The system can be enhanced by combination with a charge air heating process. Accurate charge temperature control over as wide an engine operating range as possible is also addressed. The system is fully compatible with the operational, packaging and cost needs of vehicle OEMs. The paper presents the principle, process and application of a controllable charge air cooling/heating system. It covers the design and operation of the turbo-expander which delivers sub-ambient charge temperatures, the option of charge air heating and possible control methods.

40|$|Photodiode {{circuits}} show {{promise for}} the development of high-resolution retinal prostheses. While several of these systems have been constructed and some even implanted in humans, existing descriptions of the complex optoelectronic interaction between light, photodiode, and the electrode/electrolyte load are limited. This study examines this interaction in depth with theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Actively biased photoconductive and passive photovoltaic circuits are investigated, with the photovoltaic circuits consisting of one or more diodes connected in series, and the photoconductive circuits consisting of a single diode in series with a pulsed bias voltage. Circuit behavior and charge injection levels were markedly different for platinum and sputtered iridium-oxide film (SIROF) electrodes. Photovoltaic circuits were able to deliver 0. 038 mC/cm 2 (0. 75 nC/phase) per photodiode with 50 - μm platinum electrodes, and 0. 54 -mC/cm 2 (11 nC/phase) per photodiode with 50 -μ m SIROF electrodes driven with 0. 5 -ms pulses of light at 25 Hz. The same pulses applied to photoconductive circuits with the same electrodes were able to <b>deliver</b> <b>charge</b> injections as high as 0. 38 and 7. 6 mC/cm 2 (7. 5 and 150 nC/phase), respectively. We demonstrate photovoltaic stimulation of rabbit retina in-vitro, with 0. 5 -ms pulses of 905 -nm light using peak irradiance of 1 mW/mm 2. Based on the experimental data, we derive electrochemical and optical safety limits for pixel density and charge injection in various circuits. While photoconductive circuits offer smaller pixels, photovoltaic systems do not require an external bias voltage.

40|$|Stimulating neural {{electrodes}} {{are required}} to <b>deliver</b> <b>charge</b> to an environment that presents itself as hostile. The electrodes need to maintain their electrical characteristics (charge and impedance) in vivo for a proper functioning of neural prostheses. Here we design implantable multi-walled carbon nanotubes coating for stainless steel substrate electrodes, targeted at wide frequency stimulation of deep brain structures. In well-controlled, low-frequency stimulation acute experiments, we show that multi-walled carbon nanotube electrodes maintain their charge storage capacity (CSC) and impedance in vivo. The difference in average CSCs (n = 4) between the in vivo (1. 111 mC cm(- 2)) and in vitro (1. 008 mC cm(- 2)) model was statistically insignificant (p > 0. 05 or P-value = 0. 715, two tailed). We also report on the transcription levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 1 beta and TLR 2 receptor as an immediate response to low-frequency stimulation using RT-PCR. We show here that the IL- 1 beta {{is part of the}} inflammatory response to low-frequency stimulation, but TLR 2 is not significantly increased in stimulated tissue when compared to controls. The early stages of neuroinflammation due to mechanical and electrical trauma induced by implants can be better understood by detection of pro-inflammatory molecules rather than by histological studies. Tracking of such quantitative response profits from better analysis methods over several temporal and spatial scales. Our results concerning the evaluation of such inflammatory molecules revealed that transcripts for the cytokine IL- 1 beta are upregulated in response to low-frequency stimulation, whereas no modulation was observed for TLR 2. This result indicates that the early response of the brain to mechanical trauma and low-frequency stimulation activates the IL- 1 beta signaling cascade but not that of TLR 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis was to study the {{possibility}} of storing the energy obtained from the rectification of a low-level alternating current (AC) signal used as the input. This divided the research in two main parts: the rectifying circuit, which obtained a direct current (DC) signal from the AC signal available at the input, and the energy storage circuitry, which manipulated {{the output of the}} rectifying circuit to obtain a signal that was suitable to <b>deliver</b> <b>charge</b> to an energy storage component, {{and at the same time}} provided a way to retrieve the energy stored in said component. Much of the research done so far has dealt with high input powers, over 10 dBm, and a load resistance below 1 kΩ, achieving very high conversion efficiencies, up to 80 - 90 %. In this work, however, the research was done with lower input power levels, below 0 dBm, and load impedance in the order of tenths of kΩ. The efficiencies obtained under these conditions were much lower, under 10 %, but the goal of the research was achieved. The work was focused in two frequency bands, 868 MHz and 2. 4 GHz. Thus, different rectifying circuits were designed and manufactured for both bands in order to obtain the optimal performance for the given conditions. The energy storage circuitry, on the other hand, remained the same for both bands, since its behaviour did not depend on the frequency. Two patch antennas, designed by the supervisor of this thesis and manufactured by the author, were used for the final measurements carried out in an anechoic chamber, and the possibility of storing energy from an electromagnetic wave radiated by a transmitting antenna was demonstrated. This research may be further extended to obtain self-sustainable devices that would harvest energy radiated by nearby equipment operating at those frequencies, eliminating the need of an external power source. Moreover, studies might be carried out to harvest energy from the whole frequency spectrum...|$|E

40|$|Intracortical neuroprostheses {{offer the}} {{prospect}} of bi-directional communication interfaces for treatment and scientific understanding of physical and mental neurological disorders; however, their long-term functionality is limited by our inability {{to compensate for the}} dynamics of the neural interface. The neural interface refers to the electrode-tissue interface formed by placing an electrode into neural tissue. The brain 2 ̆ 7 s reactive tissue response electrically and mechanically isolates the device from healthy tissue, reducing recording quality as well as stimulation performance. Additionally, current intracortical microstimulation materials are either unable to safely <b>deliver</b> <b>charge,</b> or materials degrade during applied electrical stimulation. ^ The objectives of the presented research were to enhance the long-term reliability of the intracortical neural interface by 1) improving the reliability and performance of micro-neural interface materials for electrical stimulation, and 2) forming an integrated neural interface after device implantation beyond the region of tissue affected by the reactive tissue response. Here we report the achievement of these objectives through the use of the conductive polymer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The techniques presented here offer unique neural interfacing approaches to improve the long term functionality of intracortical neuroprostheses. ^ In the first study, we evaluated the in vitro stability and in vivo performance of PEDOT coatings for microstimulation. Microelectrodes coated with PEDOT exhibited electrochemical properties superior to iridium oxide and remained stable after short-term repetitive pulsing at current densities damaging to iridium oxide. Further, chronically implanted PEDOT coated microelectrodes subjected to daily microstimulation displayed a more reliable, low-impedance interface which corresponded to safer, lower-amplitude voltage excursions. However, both electrode materials were equally effective in regards to behavioral thresholds suggesting similar amounts of tissue damage likely occurred with all implanted devices. ^ In the second study, we evaluated in vivo PEDOT polymerization as a technique to grow the neural interface after implantation to interface with healthy tissue beyond the region influenced by the reactive tissue response and potentially improve the safety of stimulation levels. In vivo PEDOT polymerization in the rat cerebral cortex resulted in lower impedance and improved recording quality. Histological analysis by optical microscopy confirmed successful integration of a dense PEDOT network within the tissue extending approximately 100 - 200 µm adjacent to the electrode. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how changes in fueling strategy in the second cycle of engine operation influence the <b>delivered</b> <b>charge</b> fuel mass and engine out hydrocarbon (EOHC) emissions in that and subsequent cycles. Close attention will be paid to cycle-to-cycle interaction of the fueling strategy. It is our intent to see if residual fuel from each cycle has a predicable influence on subsequent cycle's charge mass and EOHC emissions. The fast flame ionization detector is employed to measure both in-cylinder and engine out hydrocarbon concentrations for various cold start strategies. The manufacturer's original fueling strategy is used as a starting point and is compared to a "in-cylinder fuel air ratio (Phi) [approx. ] 1 " case (a fueling strategy that results in an in-cylinder concentration of approximately stoichiometric for each of the first five cycles) and to a number of cases that are chosen to illustrate cycle-to-cycle mixture preparation dependence on second cycle fueling. Significant cycle-to-cycle dependence is observed with the change in second cycle.
