5|$|Not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> {{part of the}} Wars of Scottish Independence, {{the battle}} is {{significant}} for its employment of tactics learned in the Scottish wars in a domestic, English conflict. Both the extensive use of foot soldiers rather than cavalry, and the heavy impact caused by the longbow, represented significant steps in military developments.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the hotel's {{management}} {{sought to}} create more elaborate features {{to compete with the}} other modern Las Vegas developments. The Forum Shops at Caesars opened in 1992; {{it was one of the}} first venues in the city where shopping, particularly at high-end fashion house stores, was an attraction <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> <b>A</b> new redevelopment opened on October 22, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Tracing in English {{law is a}} {{procedure}} to identify property (such as money) that has been taken from the claimant involuntarily. It is not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> way to recover the property, but rather to identify {{it so that the}} courts can decide what remedy to apply. The procedure is used in several situations, broadly demarcated by whether the property has been transferred because of theft, breach of trust, or mistake.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to the {{continent}} from England, Henry sought to secure his French lands and quash any potential rebellion. As a result, in 1154 Henry and Louis agreed a peace treaty, under which Henry bought back the Vernon and the Neuf-Marché from Louis. The treaty appeared shaky, however, and tensions remained—in particular, Henry had not given homage to Louis for his French possessions. In an attempt to improve relations, Henry met with Louis at Paris and Mont-Saint-Michel in 1158, agreeing to betroth Henry's eldest living son, the Young Henry, to Louis's daughter Margaret. The marriage deal would have involved Louis granting the disputed territory of the Vexin to Margaret on her marriage to the Young Henry: while this would ultimately give Henry the lands that he claimed, it also cunningly implied that the Vexin was Louis's to give away in the first place, <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> political concession. For a short while, a permanent peace between Henry and Louis looked plausible.|$|E
25|$|A hairpin loom {{is often}} used to create lacy and long stitches, known as hairpin lace. While this is not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> hook, it is a device used in {{conjunction}} with a crochet hook to produce stitches.|$|E
25|$|This {{letter is}} <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> {{reflection}} of {{the very nature of}} Jardine as a businessman and itself an explanation why the man was considered as the most powerful trader in the South China coast.|$|E

30|$|The {{realization}} of this phenomenology {{is the process}} valued <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> <b>As</b> <b>in</b> the carnival: the creation occurs dynamically today being an industry that requires professionals with an exceptional ability for intuition and improvisation.|$|R
5000|$|Newton further {{believed}} that the preservation of nature was <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> act of God, stating that [...] "a continual miracle is needed to prevent the Sun and fixed stars from rushing together through Gravity".|$|R
25|$|Launders tracked U-864 by {{hydrophone}} (<b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> difficult feat), {{hoping it}} would surface and allow a clear shot. However, U-864 detected {{the presence of the}} British submarine and remained submerged and started to zig-zag. This made U-864 quite safe according to the assumptions of the time.|$|E
25|$|Theistic evolution, theistic evolutionism, or {{evolutionary}} creationism are {{views that}} regard religious teachings about God as compatible with modern scientific understanding about biological evolution. Theistic evolution is not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> scientific theory, but {{a range of}} views about how the science of general evolution relates to religious beliefs in contrast to special creation views.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Locke (2005) {{claims that}} the concept of EI is <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> {{misinterpretation}} of the intelligence construct, and he offers an alternative interpretation: it is not another form or type of intelligence, but intelligence—the ability to grasp abstractions—applied to a particular life domain: emotions. He suggests the concept should be re-labeled and referred to as a skill.|$|E
50|$|Working at {{community}} level {{is often not}} sufficient <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> <b>As</b> national, regional and international action can be very effective in cases of major housing rights violations, COHRE also formed partnerships with organisations working at these broader levels.|$|R
50|$|Substitution {{failure is}} not an error (SFINAE) refers to a {{situation}} in C++ where an invalid substitution of template parameters is not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> error. David Vandevoorde first introduced the acronym SFINAE to describe related programming techniques.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{following}} is a corollary to the above theorem, it is <b>a</b> new result <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> <b>As</b> already mentioned, the iterative process (1.5) is independent but faster than several iterative processes, therefore this corollary has its own standing.|$|R
25|$|The {{case was}} met with a flood of {{nationalist}} and anti-Albanian statements in the Serbian press. This was, <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> <b>a</b> significant development. The Communist Yugoslav state had for many years made open nationalism a taboo subject, and the Yugoslav media had previously systematically downplayed nationalism. The collapse of this taboo in {{the coverage of the}} Martinović case heralded the growth of nationalism that was to lead to the country's collapse in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Constitutional Irish {{nationalism}} was seemingly triumphant in 1912, then apparently {{destroyed in}} 1916, but it revived and remarkably—was consolidated {{under the leadership}} of former republican rebels, who had rejected moderate political approaches a few years earlier. The Home Rule bill of 1912 was not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> dead end. It formed part of the democratic tradition that was adopted a decade later and which has dominated Irish politics to the present day.|$|E
25|$|However, as daily {{transport}} {{his father}} favoured the sporting Riley brand, {{and it was}} with a Riley Nine that Bob Gerard made his first foray into motorsport in the 1933 MCC Land's End trial. Success came immediately, and in this first event Gerard not only completed the demanding course (<b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> significant achievement) but did so in sufficient style to earn himself a Premier Award. This despite him being severely near-sighted.|$|E

6000|$|Yes, certainly, Morris's {{self-control}} was laudable. [...] "Even admitting I attach an undue {{importance to}} Miss Sloper's fortune," [...] he went on, [...] "would not that be <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> assurance that I should take much care of it?" ...|$|R
25|$|Plagiarism is not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> crime, but can {{constitute}} copyright infringement. In {{academia and}} industry, it {{is a serious}} ethical offense. Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts. Plagiarism is not defined or punished by law, but rather by institutions (including professional associations, educational institutions, and commercial entities, such as publishing companies).|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the statements relating to prosecutions of persons because of their sexual orientation, {{the head of the}} delegation said that homosexuality is a purely private matter, with a long history in Senegal, and is not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> cause for prosecution. The prosecutions referred to occurred only when the homosexual relations took place in public and were of an obtrusive nature, therefore placing them in conflict with morality and religion. Concerning decriminalization, it is necessary to take account of the culture, and avoid exacerbating the rejection of homosexuals and endangering their lives.|$|E
25|$|A visa {{generally}} gives non-citizens clearance {{to enter}} a country and to remain there within specified constraints, such as a time frame for entry, a limit on the {{time spent in the}} country, and a prohibition against employment. Many countries do not require a visa in some situations; this {{may be the result of}} treaties specifying reciprocal arrangements. The possession of a visa is not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> guarantee of entry into the country that issued it, and a visa can be revoked at any time.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{asserted}} that the name Meriadoc could be <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> allusion to the British nobleman Conan Meriadoc, legendary founder of the House of Rohan in Brittany, since the character Meriadoc is closely associated with Tolkien's kingdom of Rohan.|$|R
5000|$|... § 52a. This {{conflict}} between thesis and antithesis cannot be resolved dogmatically. Both {{are supported by}} proofs.

50|$|Developmental disabilities such as autism {{can include}} {{varying degrees of}} pain {{insensitivity}} as a sign. However, since these disorders are characterized by dysfunction of the sensory system in general, this specific condition is not <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> indicator {{of any of these}} conditions.|$|R
25|$|The {{release of}} methane from the Arctic is <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> major {{contributor}} to global warming {{as a result of}} polar amplification. Recent observations in the Siberian arctic show increased rates of methane release from the Arctic seabed. Land-based permafrost, also in the Siberian arctic, was estimated in 2013 to release 17 million tonnes of methane per year – a significant increase on the 3.8 million tons estimated in 2006, and estimates before then of just 0.5 million tonnes. This compares to around 500 million tonnes released into the atmosphere annually from all sources.|$|E
25|$|The City of Ottawa is a single-tier municipality, {{meaning it}} is <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> census {{division}} {{and has no}} county or regional municipality government above it. As a single tier municipality, Ottawa has responsibility for all municipal services, including fire, emergency medical services, police, parks, roads, sidewalks, public transit, drinking water, storm water, sanitary sewage and solid waste. Ottawa is governed by the 24-member Ottawa City Council consisting of 23 councillors each representing one ward and the mayor, currently Jim Watson, elected in a citywide vote.|$|E
25|$|Raffles {{returned}} to British Bencoolen (Sumatra) {{the day after}} the signing of the treaty, leaving Major William Farquhar as the Resident and Commandant of the new settlement, supported initially consisted of some artillery and a single regiment of Indian soldiers. Establishing a trading port from scratch was <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> daunting prospect, but Farquhar's administration was, in addition, practically unfunded, as Raffles did not wish his superiors to view Singapore as a liability. In addition, it was forbidden from earning revenue by imposing port duties, Raffles having decided from the outset that Singapore would be a free port.|$|E
5000|$|Ecke’s final book, Chinese Painting in Hawai’i, {{written with}} his wife, said one scholar, {{was far more}} than a catalog of the museums holdings, but what another {{reviewer}} called a “monumental work” and <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> “introduction to the study of Chinese painting.” ...|$|R
