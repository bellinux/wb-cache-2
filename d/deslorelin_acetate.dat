50|$|<b>Deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> is an {{injectable}} gonadotropin {{releasing hormone}} super-agonist (GnRH agonist) {{also known as}} an LHRH agonist. Via its indirect action, following an initial surge the production of sex hormones (Androgen and Estrogen) tapers off.|$|E
50|$|One {{commercial}} form of <b>Deslorelin</b> <b>Acetate</b> is marketed by Peptech with {{the brand name}} Ovuplant. Another form {{is available in the}} USA, Sucromate Equine, which was FDA-approved for use in horses in November 2010. This is manufactured by Thorne BioScience LLC and was introduced to the USA market following the withdrawal of Ovuplant. The Deslorelin products are currently approved for use in veterinary medicine and to promote ovulation in mares as part of the artificial insemination process. It is also used to stabilize high-risk pregnancies, mainly of livestock. Unlike other GnRH agonists, which are mainly used to inhibit luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone by their ultimate downregulation of the pituitary gland, Deslorelin is primarily used for the initial flare effect upon the pituitary, and its associated surge of LH secretion. Suprelorin is a slowly releasing deslorelin implant used for chemical castration of dogs and ferrets. It is marketed by Virbac. Deslorelin is also used to treat benign prostate hyperplasia in dogs.|$|E
40|$|This {{case report}} {{describes}} {{the use of}} a subcutaneously applied 4. 7 -mg <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implant in a three-year-old Arabian crossbred stallion showing unwanted strong male behaviour. Following <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implantation the stallion showed a short transitional increase in male behaviour. A ‘gelding-like’ behaviour was noted 15 days (D 15) after treatment. The horse was surgically castrated at the owners request at D 52 after treatment. Serum testosterone, oestradiol- 17 β and oestrone sulphate values decreased after <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implantation, but serum LH and FSH levels remained unchanged. Histopathological analysis of both testes and sperm analysis revealed a reduced spermatogenesis at D 52. The testicular volume decreased after treatment. The use of a subcutaneously applied <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implant might be a promising tool to change the behaviour of aggressive stallions...|$|E
40|$|In Europe, the yellow-bellied slider (Trachemys scripta sp.) is a {{non-native}} {{species in}} competition with native freshwater turtles. Research on contraception could be useful to control the captive population. Identifying a method of contraception in chelonians would potentially help to control aggression in other chelonian species. The objective {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the effects of a single 4. 7 -mg <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implant on plasma testosterone concentrations in yellow-bellied sliders (Trachemys scripta sp.). Eleven adult male yellow-bellied sliders were used for the study. Males from the treatment group (n = 6) received a 4. 7 -mg <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implant, whereas males from the control group (n = 5) did not receive any treatment. All individuals were housed under the same environmental conditions. Testosterone plasma concentrations of the control group and the treatment group were measured at six time points (T 0 –T 6) between April and September. No difference between the control group and the deslorelin treatment group was observed at T 0, T 2, T 3, T 4, T 5 or T 6. However, mean plasma testosterone concentration was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group at T 1. This suggests that treatment with a 4. 7 -mg <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implant has a transient stimulatory effect on the anterior pituitary in yellowbellied sliders without a negative feedback on testosterone production. Further studies with a higher dosage of <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> are needed to draw conclusions on its contraceptive effect...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} was to evaluate ovarian activity reversibility in domestic queens after short-term contraceptive treatment with <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate.</b> Ten mature queens were used. In all queens, the estrous cycle was evaluated every 72 h by vaginal cytology (VC) and behavior assessments. When queens had VC characteristic of interestrus or diestrus, one <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implant (4. 7 mg) {{was placed in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the interscapular region (day of insertion = Day 0). Thereafter, VC was performed every 48 h and on Day 90, implants were removed. At Day 100, estrus and ovulation were induced with 100 IU eCG (im), followed by 100 IU hCG (im), 84 h later (Day 103. 5). Queens were ovariohysterectomized on Day 106. Corpora lutea (CL) were counted, oviducts were flushed, and oocytes were identified, isolated and stained to assess viability. In all queens, blood samples for plasma progesterone concentrations were collected once a week, from Days − 21 to 106. After <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> application, four queens had VC and behavior typical of estrus, and one ovulated. Furthermore, ovulation occurred in three queens that did not have VC or behavior consistent with estrus. After the initial ovarian stimulation, all females had anestrous VC during the deslorelin treatment period. Implants were readily removed. Following implant removal, all females responded to treatments to induce estrus and ovulation. There were (mean ± SEM) 13. 1 ± 5. 5 CL and 8. 1 ± 5. 5 oocytes per queen; the oocyte recovery rate was 56. 8 ± 25. 4 % and all recovered oocytes were viable.

40|$|<b>Deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implants, {{recently}} licensed in Ireland and the UK for ovulation induction in mares, {{have been}} associated with prolonged interovulatory intervals in USA studies, leading to the practice of removing implants postovulation. Trial data in Australia indicate a less pronounced effect on interovulatory intervals, suggesting possible geographical variation. Objectives of the current study were to assess the effect of deslorelin implants, with and without removal on oestrous cycle length in Irish- and UK-based Thoroughbred broodmares. Data were collected retrospectively from 88 oestrous cycles. A statistically significant difference (P= 0. 02) was found between interovulatory intervals in mares in which the deslorelin implant was not removed, compared with administration and removal of the implant or the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin. The results suggest that implant removal when possible is advisable. The delay in subsequent ovulations was less marked than that reported in some studies from the USA. This information is useful in deciding when to schedule subsequent breeding for mares which received a deslorelin implant during the previous oestrous period and provides evidence to counter-concerns that mares treated with deslorelin implants may experience a long delay in return to oestrus if the implant is not removed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study estrus {{synchronization}} and fixed time artificial insemination (FTAI) in dairy buffaloes during season anestrus. One hundred thirty-nine dairy buffaloes in seasonal anestrus were divided in two groups as G 1 (n= 66) and G 2 (n= 73). The protocols for both the groups were the same until day (D) 14 :D 0 administration of 2. 0 mg estradiol benzoate and implantation of progesterone device (P 4) for 14 days; D 14 removal of P 4 plus 150 mg of cloprostenol and 400 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin. On D 16, G 1 received 10 mg of buserelin and G 2 100 mg <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate.</b> On D 17, both the groups were submitted to FTAI. Ultrasonographic examinations of ovaries were performed on D 0, D 14, D 16 and D 17. Results showed that pregnancy rates in G 1 and G 2 were 20 and 41 % (p 0. 05). Thirty-five percent of the animals in G 1 and 54. 1 % in G 2 showed a diameter DF greater than 8. 0 mm on D 16 (p> 0. 05). Thus, it could be concluded that the protocols synchronized the estrus, leading the concentration of the parturitions {{in the period of}} low milk production. Deslorelin was more efficient than buserelin due the higher percentage of DF ovulation and higher pregnancy rates...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTHigh milk production, heat, {{physiological}} {{status and}} management impair reproduction in Holstein cows. The use of in vivo-produced embryos {{has been reported}} {{as an alternative to}} enhance pregnancy outcome in the tropics; however there are several limitations for its production, especially from variations in superovulatory responses. The in vitro production of embryos would avoid such variations, but few studies have been reported. This study aims to verify the effects of variables related to recipients under a program of routine in vitro embryo transfer on a commercial dairy farm in southeastern Brazil. It was hypothesized that pregnancy rates after transfer of ovum pick up or OPUderived embryos (ET) to lactating Holstein recipients may be influenced by recipient GnRH-treatment at ET, parity, milk production and body condition score. Recipients (267) were allocated to one of three i. m. treatments given at ET: Control (92) - 2. 5 ml saline; Buserelin (86) - 10 &# 956;g Buserelin acetate; Deslorelin (89) - 750 &# 956;g <b>Deslorelin</b> <b>acetate.</b> Ultrasound images and blood samples were taken at ET and seven days later. The first pregnancy diagnosis was performed between 30 - 40 days and the second between 60 - 80 days post ET. Data were analyzed by GENMOD (SAS(r)). The proportion of pregnant cows was greater (P< 0. 05) in Buserelin-treated recipients (38. 3 %) at the first pregnancy diagnosis than Controls (24. 1 %), but similar to Deslorelin and control cows at the second diagnosis (13. 0, 20. 9 and 14. 6 % in Control, Buserelin and Deslorelin, respectively). In conclusion, Buserelin improved pregnancy rate only transitorily, under the present conditions...|$|E
40|$|Deslorelin is a {{synthetic}} GnRH analogue, {{which is being}} used as a contraceptive in animals by acting as a gonadal suppressant.   The product Suprelorin (Virbac, Australia) contains deslorelin as a biocompatible, slow release subcutaneous implant. The continuous release of deslorelin provokes a down-regulation of GnRH receptors, and subsequently, inhibition of the synthesis and release of the gonadotropins FSH and LH, necessary for gonadal activities.   The intention {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of a subcutaneous <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate</b> implant (2, 35 mg) in suppressing ovarian cyclic activity and inhibiting ovulation in captive Common Marmoset Callithrix jacchus, and investigate the reversibility of the treatment.   Two experimental groups were formed, group deslorelin (D) with three couples and control group (C) with two couples.   To monitor the effect of the implants, hormones indicating ovarian cyclic activity were monitored non-invasively by enzyme immunoassay (fecal monoclonal antibody anti-progesterone CL 425).   Fecal samples were collected three times a week from all females during three trial phases (phase I: month 1, 2, 3 and 4; phase II: month: 5, 6 and 7 and phase III: month 8, 9 and 10).   In contrast to expectations the results of this trial indicated that there was no suppression of the ovarian cyclic activity, nor inhibition of the ovulation after the application of the implants.   The outcome of our trial can possibly be explained by the fact that the dosage of 2. 35 mg of deslorelin is not effective in C. jacchus.   We confirmed significant changes (p< 0. 05) of P 4 metabolites from phase I to phase II due to the treatment after the implantation of the GnRH analogue Deslorelin.   The employed non-invasive fecal progesterone monitoring could be biologically validated and proved to be efficient in the detection of ovarian cyclic activity in this neotropical primate species, C. jacchus.  </div...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Hyperoestrogenism causing {{progressive}} alopecia in neutered ferrets may {{be induced}} by ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS) and nodular hyperplasia of the adrenocortex (hyperadrenocorticism, NHA). The objec-tive {{of the study}} was to determine whether a slow-release implant of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue, deslorelin, has any value in therapy of hyperoestrogenism of adrenocortical origin (NHA). Three sup-posed cases of NHA with alopecia and other clinical signs of hyperoestrogenism (n = 2 spayed females in oestrous and n = 1 castrated male) were treated with a subcutaneous implant of 4. 7 mg <b>deslorelin</b> <b>acetate.</b> Blood samples were collected, and plasma levels of estradiol (E 2) were determined just before, and some weeks after treatment. For realistic monitoring, blood samples for E 2 determination were also taken from intact, healthy (untreated control) females after the beginning of heat (n = 5), or 9 – 21 days after, with hCG induced ovulation (n = 6), or out of breeding season (n = 3). Before treatment, all three alopecic ferrets showed elevated E 2 concentrations (99. 45 – 139. 9 pmol/l) similar to the untreated control females in oestrous (61. 6 – 123. 02 pmol/l) (P = 0. 229). Some weeks after the deslorelin administration, the hair of these ferrets began to grow again and the elevated E 2 con-centrations significantly decreased compared to the pre-treatment values (P = 0. 035). E 2 concentrations reached the basal level (12. 89 – 16. 08 pmol/l) typical for that of the untreated control females in anoestrus or in luteal phase (12. 0 – 30. 58 pmol/l) (P = 0. 137). All treated ferrets were examined again 19 – 21 months after implant insertion (the implant still being present) and all of them had normal hair and were clinically healthy. These observations prove that deslorelin can suppress the E 2 production of NHA, and is therefore a useful tool in the therapy of hormonal alopecia neutered ferrets...|$|E
