According to the Chinese National Standard {{has been}} {{completed}} the "Provisions for design code of emergency shelter", the paper proposed designs of <b>emergency</b> <b>lodging</b> field according to refuge capacity, lodging site, fire control, evacuation and emergency supplementary facilities. The calculation of refuge capacity uses indexes of effective refuge area and per capita effective refuge area. <b>Emergency</b> <b>lodging</b> fields are divided into teams, groups, units, districts according to refuge number and residential scale, and the hierarchical control indices are issued by taking the most densely refuge tents layout as calculating. It proposes hierarchical requirements of fire compartment, fire protection distance, evacuation distance and supplementary facilities for emergency response...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is The Plan of Evacuation of the Local Population Focused on Floods. This issue was elaborated for specific {{conditions of the}} administrative district of the municipality with extended powers of the town Soběslav. At the present time, {{there is a lack}} of legal framework for elaborating evacuation plans from witch single bodies of local administration could proceed when elaborating evacuation plans of local population on specific conditions of single municipalities. At the beginning of my bachelor thesis, I summarized the theoretical basis for elaboration of evacuation plans of local population focused on floods. In doing so, I drew on legal orders regulating the area of protection of population in case of extraordinary accidents and critical situations. Particular findings for proposal to an evacuation plan of local population were obtained partly from information on the course of floods in 2002 and 2006 in the area of the administrative district of the municipality with extended powers of the town Soběslav and partly from experience of single bodies involved, particularly from flood commission. On the basis of the analysis of these sources, I connected information on the course of flood situation with demands on material and technical provision following from the structure and number of population living in the flood area of the town Soběslav. The result of this procedure is a proposal to increase of efficiency of evacuation process which, in my opinion, could by achieved by placing evacuating and receiving centres in one building. I also believed that by thus an uncoordinated process of evacuation could be prevented and time dwells in its course could by minimized. The proposal involves particular information and data on information, order, medical, and transport provision of the evacuation and on option for <b>emergency</b> <b>lodging</b> and boarding. I particularly tried to propose a plan of evacuation of population that would by clear and well arranged, and fully meet local condition of the town Soběslav. I also suppose its possible use by the Department of Environment of the municipal office of Soběslav as one part of the basis when specifying and updating the current plan of local population or the town Soběslav during flood. Besides I attempted to deduce some generally true rules for elaborating evacuation plans that could be a guide for elaboration of evacuation plans of local population of all municipalities in danger of floods...|$|E

The share of families that own the dwelling they live in is almost eight times as high for the non-movers {{than it is for}} the displaced. Displaced families mostly rent the place they live in, but a share of almost 16 % live in a place without paying for it (either on loan from friends or families, as illegal occupants in abandoned houses, or in <b>emergency</b> <b>lodges).</b> These differences are prime candidates to explain the large reduction in education expenditure found earlier.|$|R
