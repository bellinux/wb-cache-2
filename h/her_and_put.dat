25|$|However, in {{the wake}} of the {{newspaper}} stories regarding the murder, the Viscount was reminded of the theft and demanded a search for the jewels in Marie's room in Le Glandier. When the jewels turned up during the search, some newspapers believed <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> all the blame on the Viscountess. However, when she was put on trial for theft, the court was not so persuaded. Marie was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the nearby town of Tulle.|$|E
25|$|Byrne {{had heard}} {{movement}} in the bedroom, and asked who was in there. Sherritt's widow told the outlaws {{it was a man}} looking for work named Duross and that he was staying the night. Ellen Barry went in to tell the police to come out but beckoned her to go outside while they found their firearms. Byrne called for the man to come out, threatening to burn the place down if they did not. Byrne sent in Sherritt's widow and when she entered the bedroom the police grabbed <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> her underneath the bed with them.|$|E
25|$|Polly and Digory grab <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> {{on their}} rings {{to take her}} out of their world, {{dragging}} with them Uncle Andrew, Frank the cab-driver, and Frank's horse, since all were touching one another when the children grabbed their rings. In the Wood between the Worlds they jump into a pool, hoping it leads back to Charn. Instead they stumble into a dark void that Jadis recognises as a world not yet created. They then all witness {{the creation of a}} new world by the lion Aslan, who brings stars, plants, and animals into existence as he sings. Jadis, as terrified by his singing as the others are attracted to it, tries to kill Aslan with the iron rod; but it rebounds harmlessly off him, and in the creative soil of the new world it sprouts into a growing lamp-post. Jadis flees.|$|E

25|$|The Challenger 1 {{accelerated}} {{its course}} {{in an attempt}} to allow journalists on board to broadcast their photos of the ongoing raid. The ship was intercepted by two Israeli speedboats and a helicopter, and carried out evasion tactics, forcing the Israelis to pursue it for a considerable distance. According to passengers, at least one stun grenade was launched at the Challenger 1 before it was boarded. Passengers on the decks formed a human chain to block the path of the troops. Soldiers opened fire with paintball guns and rubber and plastic bullets as they boarded the vessel, lightly injuring two female demonstrators. Once on board, the Israelis moved towards the fly bridge. The soldiers encountered verbal abuse, and attempts were made to shove soldiers. Some activists barricaded themselves in cabins. Activist Huwaida Arraf reported that Israeli soldiers attacked those who tried to block them with kicks, tasers, and concussion grenades, and that some people were beaten so severely that they had to be hospitalized. Arraf said that the Israelis smashed her face against the ground and stepped on it, and that they later handcuffed <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> a bag over her head. Another woman similarly had a bag placed over her head. First mate Shane Dillon reported that Israeli troops broke the nose of a Belgian woman and beat another passenger. Australian photojournalist Kate Geraghty was tasered while attempting to photograph the raid. Upon entering the bridge, the troops were met with no resistance.|$|E

500|$|Marquess {{deemed the}} storyline {{as a whole}} one which could only be {{depicted}} {{the way it was}} in Hollyoaks, aiming to tell a [...] "tragic story" [...] with a [...] "sweet and humorous tone"." [...] A comedy element of the storyline had Steph use her cancer as a sob story to enter a talent show, recruiting orphan Tom to take to the stage with her, giving her story further emotional impact. Stenson commented, [...] "Deep down she knows she's not a fantastic singer, but she thought the judges would feel sorry for <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> her through." [...] According to Quinlan, viewer feedback on the storyline was [...] "brilliant". He stated that viewers were upset by Steph's illness, and that it had even brought his own mother to tears.|$|E

500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to put her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} the series, Paramount {{donated the}} Galileo prop to a school for the blind. It {{subsequently}} passed through the hands of several owners, before being stored in Ohio for some twenty years and falling into disrepair. It was auctioned on June 28, 2012, with the price holding at around $20,000 until the final 90 seconds, when three bidders jumped in. The prop sold for $70,150 to Alec Peters and Adam Schneider. Schneider released a statement on TrekBBS, commenting that the pair was [...] "very, very happy {{to have the opportunity to}} acquire and renovate Galileo" [...] and planned to [...] "restore <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> her on display for the fans." ...|$|E

[...] Our traveller paid a dime and descended to the museum, which he found to be the Hearst living quarters, faithfully preserved in their elegance: two of the rooms, usually occupied by Mr. Hearst and his secretary in the old days, fitted with mahogany furnishings, dark-red damask hangings, and notably soft and deep bedding accessories; and the third room, Mrs. Hearst's, in ivory and gilt with a bath which even now has gold-plated fittings. The curator of the museum is a young lady who chats interestingly about the Hearsts, dealing in both fact and surmise, and sells souvenir postals of the interior for ten cents each.|$|E
