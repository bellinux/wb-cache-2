5|$|Johnson: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{report on}} the team as a whole, and that is my opinion.|$|E
5|$|Last year I decided I'm {{not doing}} music until I'm excited again, then this {{came along and}} also I did end up making another record which I'll release at some point. It's just being mastered, it's a lovely album; I didn't write this one, this is old songs and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sort out my situation- I don't want the same problem as before.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> admit that the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of}} the performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5000|$|Everything <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{happen for}} me <b>to</b> learn ... Dad <b>had</b> <b>to</b> die, Ben <b>had</b> <b>to</b> die, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lose my kids. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be humbled. <b>I</b> was too angry and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be {{crippled}} {{and put on}} my knees to finally realise I'm not in charge.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{make some}} of them saints. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make Enraghty Saint Paul, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make Hingston Saint Peter. You think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lie to them, to deceive them, to bewitch them. <b>I</b> didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do {{anything}} of the kind. They did the lying and deceiving and bewitching themselves, and when they done it, they {{and all the rest}} of the believers, they had me fast, faster than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> them." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{said that}} if I wanted <b>to</b> see change, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be active and that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a voice in Parliament if I wanted to improve the status of women.|$|R
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing {{all these}} little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I did,' he said, nonchalant, 'harder than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever beat {{anything}} in my life. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to.</b> It {{was the only way}} I got the work done.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shore. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say thet. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make it strong before thet gang. I reckon it was presumin' of me, an' I shore apologize." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "That is finished. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> see you. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> talk to you. Go away, please. I cannot bear {{to see you}} any more. It is too terrible--too terrible!" ...|$|R
25|$|At {{this moment}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell Germany, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{report to the}} Fuehrer in particular, that the {{thoughts}} of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Fuehrer and his faithful people were thinking of me. This thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colors.|$|E
25|$|You {{will not}} be seeing me for three years because to have a visit <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wear uniform. If {{they want me to}} wear a uniform they'll have to nail it to my back.|$|E
25|$|I used {{to write}} things praising 'The Captain' and now I write {{pretty much the same}} thing, but praising Ceaușescu. I'm not a Marxist, you understand, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> admit that I like what he's doing.|$|E
5000|$|... ” <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{face the}} police one day, and the {{soldiers}} the next, but on Saturday night <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> face the old woman, {{and that was the}} worst of all!” ...|$|R
5000|$|Initially Eldritch {{worked with}} an unknown {{producer}}: [...] "I had a producer but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fire him. That's why <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{do it all}} by myself which was quite demanding." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In fact, I {{will be seen}} in 96 {{different}} outfits. Also, I {{was asked}} to lose and then put on weight for this film. For the first look of the film, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lose 10-11 kilos and soon after, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> gain more than what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lose," [...] Raai Laxmi about her costumes and weight losing and gaining process for the film.|$|R
25|$|Everyone who meets me {{wants to}} talk about the culture of fear and I {{understand}} that, fine, but what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be talking about or I won’t be effective in this role, is {{what we can do to}} move forward.|$|E
25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remind myself to keep my ribs open. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
25|$|Professor Meitner {{stated that}} the success could be {{attributed}} to chemistry. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make a slight correction. Chemistry merely isolated the individual substances, it did not precisely identify them. It took Professor Hahn's method to do this. This is where his achievement lies.|$|E
5000|$|... "It {{was hard}} work. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{go to the}} local butcher and get pork. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to a doll factory and find the dolls. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to an eye factory and find the eyes. False teeth. There's a lot in that photograph. I think John's almost-last written words were about that {{particular}} cover; that was {{pointed out to me}} by Martin Harrison, who wrote the text to my book. I didn't even know that, but I'm learning a lot.|$|R
60|$|That {{finished}} Shaphambury. The question <b>I</b> now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{debate was}} {{which of the}} remaining couples <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pursue.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, in an {{interview}} with Brian Sherwin for Myartspace, Vito discussed Seedbed at length. Vito discussed the title Seedbed and the connection it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> the performance, stating, [...] "I knew what my goal <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> produce seed, the space I was in should become a bed of seed, a field of seed - in order <b>to</b> produce seed, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> masturbate - in order <b>to</b> masturbate, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> excite myself." ...|$|R
25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.|$|E
25|$|None of this, apparently, was enough. Sage {{wrote in}} a journal in August 1961, “I have said all that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say. There is nothing left {{for me to do}} but scream.” On January 8, 1963, she put a fatal bullet through her heart. Following {{instructions}} in her will, Pierre Matisse buried urns containing Sage’s and Tanguy’s ashes in the water off the coast of Tanguy’s native Brittany in 1964.|$|E
25|$|His {{work has}} become valued {{not only for}} its {{information}} but also as works of art. Although Diego Rivera called him an excellent artist, Garcia did not like the title, considering himself a photojournalist. What I've done practically all my life is to be a witness and to make graphic testimonies of the movements and struggles of the social classes in Mexico. This continues {{to be the most important}} motive <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do photography.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come back. I'm {{going to}} Europe next week, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come {{to look after}} my boat, here; and I wanted to say good-by to Maynard. I {{was just going to}} speak to Maynard, and then sail my boat over to Leyden." ...|$|R
60|$|Times were hard. Work of {{any sort}} was {{difficult}} to get. And work {{of any sort}} was what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take, for <b>I</b> was still an unskilled labourer. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no thought of career. That was over and done with. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> find food for two mouths beside my own and keep a roof over our heads--yes, and buy a winter suit, my one suit being decidedly summery. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{get some sort of}} work immediately. After that, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> caught my breath, I might think about my future.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> no time <b>to</b> {{assemble}} my company; instead <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> act quickly, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{assume that}} the enemy had already spotted me and would destroy me where I stood. I set off with one tank and passed the order to the others not to retreat a single step but to hold their ground.|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> notify {{you that}} the lands and {{buildings}} lately belonging to and occupied by you at Argentia, for which said lands and buildings payment has been awarded, are required for occupation by the Government of Newfoundland not later than ________. Take notice, therefore, that the said premises must be completely vacated by you and peaceably yielded up to the Government of Newfoundland, its servants, agents, on or before the date mentioned.|$|E
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E
25|$|I {{know there}} are some who {{disagree}} and I respect their point of view but I believe that life begins at conception. The only exception <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have an abortion is in that case {{of the life of the}} mother. I just struggled with it myself for a long time but I came to realize: Life is that gift from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely. It {{would have}} been a misfortune if you had visited my chateau and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been unable <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a word with you. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with many German soldiers, but never with an officer before. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> much <b>to</b> talk to you about." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{use every}} bit of {{knowledge}} and experience and wisdom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come up with game plans to attack this defense. It's really the most singular innovation in defensive football in the last twenty years. [...] Bill Walsh ...|$|R
5000|$|Looking back, I {{enjoyed the}} album, 7-13 but after I {{finished}} it I knew that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make a fresh start. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go somewhere completely different. Metamorphoses {{is like a}} blank page for me, a new beginning.|$|R
