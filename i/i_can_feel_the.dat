25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E
500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing to leave my family but the money I can make from films. Nothing is beneath me if it pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I've got left." ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{the revival}} was short lived, and {{in light of}} the {{continuing}} prevalence for private equity, Kirkham took the chain private again, leveraging his family's own 9.46% stake with £150 million of family funds in an eventual £496 million deal. Kirkham told the Yorkshire Post: [...] "It's something that's caused me fitful sleep in the time I've been thinking about it. [...] I've no hobby, this is my hobby – it's what I do. I'm an entrepreneur. It's almost as if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> adrenaline running through my veins." ...|$|E

[...] "I've tried my best, but {{he always}} said: 'I've thought so long about it all that I can't think any longer. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> braver course is the best.

"I don't {{remember}} {{well what}} happened then for what seemed a long, long time. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> how <b>the</b> place looked, but not so clear {{as it is now}} in my dreams.

6000|$|... "No, sir. There was a ram in this room--in the closet. I heard him, {{and opened}} the door--I--oh! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> blow yet. He was a--a terror!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh! {{the horror}} of that agonizing thrill! (<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> place in frosty weather still). For a week from ten to four I was {{fastened}} to the floor, While a mercenary wopped me with a will ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{the great}} conception, dad," [...] added Lenore, earnestly. [...] "We are tragically awakened. We've been surprised--terribly {{struck in the}} dark.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "there is {{no doubt}} that it is broken; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> ends grate, and it hurts me every time I breathe. This is where it is, just where the cut begins; the wound itself is nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|But my critic {{dropped by}} chance into {{something}} better, {{when he went}} on to ask, [...] "Why shouldn't the heaven's blue make us love flowers?

6000|$|... "They are charlatans, {{and stand}} in the way of progress," [...] Saton declared, fiercely. [...] "They have not the faintest glimmering of the truth, and they turn what should be the {{greatest}} of the sciences into buffoonery. To the real student it is never possible to answer questions to foretell specific things. On the other hand, it is as sure as the coming of night itself that there are times when a person who has studied these matters even so slightly as <b>I</b> myself, <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> coming of events." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{yet there}} is {{something}} fascinating about it. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> call of it myself," [...] replied Upton. [...] "I suppose when one gets used to it it isn't so bad. It's--it's--well, I suppose it's {{what you would call}} elemental, and there is something heroic about this battling with the very hills and elements to wrest a living from them. Hello! Pat's calling us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{get away}} from it at Redmond, Rilla. The whole college is aflame over the war. A {{perfectly}} fit fellow, of military age, who doesn't join up is looked upon as a shirker and treated accordingly.

60|$|One {{afternoon}} of warm {{shadows in the}} wood near the red-lacquered Chinese bridge, we two were alone together and we fell silent. I was trembling and full of a wild courage. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> now <b>the</b> exquisite surmise, the doubt of that moment. Our eyes met.

60|$|I {{can see it}} without, and I {{can feel}} it within.

So I should, only that Charles Sadler would rush upstairs {{to know what was}} the matter. Besides, I must remember that I am Professor Gilroy. An old professor may afford to be natural, but when fortune has given one of the first chairs in the university to a man of four-and-thirty he must try and act the part consistently.|$|E
60|$|Dear brother, {{would you}} know the life, Please God, that I would lead? On the first wheels that quit this weary town Over yon western bridges I would ride And with a cheerful benison forsake Each street and spire and roof, incontinent. Then would I seek where God might guide my steps, Deep in a {{woodland}} tract, a sunny farm, Amid the mountain counties, Hants, Franklin, Berks, Where down the rock ravine a river roars, Even from a brook, and where old woods Not tamed and cleared cumber the ground With their centennial wrecks. Find me a slope where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> sun And mark the rising of the early stars. There will I bring my books,--my household gods, The reliquaries of my dead saint, and dwell In the sweet odor of her memory. Then in the uncouth solitude unlock My stock of art, plant dials in the grass, Hang in the air a bright thermometer And aim a telescope at the inviolate sun.|$|E

40|$|Ricoeur’s phenomenological hermeneutics can be {{understood}} as an anthropological hermeneutics of l’homme capable: As the human person <b>I</b> <b>can</b> speak, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> narrate, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> act, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> responsible. <b>The</b> fundamental capabilities/incapabilities of the human person are linked to their corresponding vulnerabilities. As existing and inhabiting the world, the human person is also l’homme faillible by virtue of the very nature of being a human being. The fallibility, weakness, and suffering describe the inabilities of the capable person. Ricoeur’s anthropology develops as the transition from is the phenomenology of a suffering human being toward the phenomenological hermeneutics of the capable person. Any account of the human person will be always provisional, partial, and incomplete because we are finite human beings...|$|R
25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out.

Sometimes <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|R
