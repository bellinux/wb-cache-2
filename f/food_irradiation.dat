25|$|Irradiation {{has been}} {{approved}} by many countries, for example in the US the FDA has approved <b>food</b> <b>irradiation</b> for over 50 years. However, {{in the past decade}} the major growth area is for fruits and vegetables that are irradiated {{to prevent the spread of}} pests. In the early 2000s in the US, irradiated meat was common at some grocery stores, but because of lack of consumer demand it is no longer common. Because consumer demand for irradiated food is low, reducing the spoilage between manufacture and consumer purchase and reducing the risk of food borne illness is currently not sufficient incentive for most manufactures to supplement their process with irradiation. Nevertheless, <b>food</b> <b>irradiation</b> does take place commercially and volumes are in general increasing at a slow rate, even in the European Union where all member countries allow the irradiation of dried herbs spices and vegetable seasonings but only a few allow other foods to be sold as irradiated.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Codex Alimentarius removed any upper {{dose limit}} for <b>food</b> <b>irradiation</b> {{as well as}} {{clearances}} for specific foods, declaring that all are safe to irradiate. Countries such as Pakistan and Brazil have adopted the Codex without any reservation or restriction. Other countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, India, and Mexico, have permitted the irradiation of fresh fruits for fruit fly quarantine purposes, amongst others.|$|E
25|$|Although {{consumer}} {{perception of}} <b>foods</b> treated with <b>irradiation</b> is more negative than those processed by other means, {{a large amount}} of independent research has confirmed irradiation to be safe. One family of chemicals (2ACB's) are uniquely formed by irradiation (unique radiolytic products), and this product is nontoxic. When irradiating food, all other chemicals occur in a lower or comparable frequency to other food processing techniques.|$|R
25|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} {{can change}} food quality {{but in general}} very high levels of radiation treatment (many thousands of gray) are necessary to adversely change nutritional content, {{as well as the}} sensory qualities (taste, appearance, and texture). Irradiation to the doses used commercially to treat food have very little negative impact on the sensory qualities and nutrient content in <b>foods.</b> When <b>irradiation</b> is used to maintain food quality {{for a longer period of}} time (improve the shelf stability of some sensory qualities and nutrients) the improvement means that more consumers have access to the original taste, texture, appearance, and nutrients. The changes in quality and nutrition depend on the degree of treatment and may vary greatly from food to food.|$|R
30|$|Gamma {{irradiation}} {{has long}} been employed for decontamination and/or sterilization of dehydrated vegetables, fruits (Fu et al. 2000), seasonings (Dorozhkin 2009), and animal foods (Yang et al. 1993) and then to prolong the storage period of the irradiated food. Many {{countries in the world}} are engaged in the commercialization of <b>irradiation</b> <b>food</b> according to the Bulletin of the Meeting of Combined Expert Committee of FAO, IAEA and WHO. The merit of radiation-induced crosslinking by γ-rays is that no residual chemical reagent, such as toxic crosslinkers, remains in the irradiated gelatin {{that can be used in}} biomedical and <b>food</b> applications. <b>Irradiation</b> caused irreversible changes at the molecular level by breakage of the covalent bonds of the polypeptide chains of gelatin at solution stage. The protein fragmentation in aqueous solutions is affected by the local conformation of an amino acid in the protein, its accessibility to the water radiolysis products, and the primary amino acid sequence (Filali-Mouhim et al. 1997). The application of solid gelatin in food and pharmaceuticals is extensive; however, the effect of the γ-radiation on the variation of different functional and bioactive properties of solid gelatin has not investigated. Furthermore, another novelty of this work is that it demonstrated effect of γ-radiation on the physico-mechanical and bioactive properties of the scaffold film produced from irradiated gelatin to that of the scaffold prepared from non-irradiated gelatin.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the first}} steps toward {{sterilization}} was made by Nicolas Appert who discovered that thorough application of heat over a suitable period slowed the decay of foods and various liquids, preserving them for safe consumption for a longer time than was typical.

Other methods of sterilizing foods include <b>food</b> <b>irradiation</b> and high pressure (pascalization).|$|E

25|$|<b>Food</b> <b>irradiation</b> is {{the process}} of exposing {{foodstuffs}} to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is energy that can be transmitted without direct contact to the source of the energy (radiation) capable of freeing electrons from their atomic bonds (ionization) in the targeted food. This treatment is used to preserve food, reduce the risk of food borne illness, prevent the spread of invasive pests, and delay or eliminate sprouting or ripening. Irradiated food does not become radioactive. The radiation can be emitted by a radioactive substance or generated electrically.|$|E
25|$|The cost of <b>food</b> <b>irradiation</b> is {{influenced}} by dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation. Irradiation is a capital-intensive technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1million to $5million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source, hardware (irradiator, totes and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5acres), radiation shield, and warehouse. Operating costs include salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs. Perishable food items, like fruits, vegetables and meats would still require to be handled in the cold chain, so all other supply chain costs remain the same.|$|E

25|$|Irradiation {{reduces the}} risk of {{infection}} and spoilage, does not make food radioactive, and the food is shown to be safe, but it does cause chemical reactions that alter the food and therefore alters the chemical makeup, nutritional content, and the sensory qualities of the food.

25|$|Gamma {{irradiation}} involves {{packets of}} light (photons) that originate from radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. Gamma rays {{are used for}} products that are too thick for treatment with electron beams. Every radioactive element gives rise to Gamma rays with specific energies characteristic of the source element, these rays have zero mass and no electrical charge. The ones used for <b>food</b> <b>irradiation</b> are able to penetrate through food products. The radioactive isotope radioisotope cobalt-60 is used as the source in all commercial scale gamma irradiation facilities. Gamma irradiation is most widely used technology because the deeper penetration of the gamma rays enables administering treatment to entire industrial pallets or totes (reducing the need for material handling) and it is significantly less expensive than using an X-ray source. Cobalt-60 is bred from cobalt-59 using neutron irradiation in specifically designed nuclear reactors. In limited applications caesium-137, a less costly alternative recovered during the processing of spent nuclear fuel, {{is used as a}} radioactive source. Insufficient quantities are available for large scale commercial use. An incident where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool requiring NRC intervention has led to near elimination of this radioisotope.|$|E

The synergistic effect of the dose, the packaging under vacuum and the storage/irradiation temperature resulted in a direct effect on the microbial load, spoilage and shelf life. After the irradiation, small variations in the intensity of some NMR resonances due to aromatic compounds and other unassigned compounds were observed.
