5|$|In 1926, Parker Brothers Inc. republished The Mansion of Happiness in its {{original}} form, with minor modification to game spaces. The game included the circular end space introduced by J. Bufford in the third edition. This sixth edition used a folding game board with a fabric and cardboard pocket on the back edge of the game board. The teetotum was made using a wood <b>dowel</b> and cardboard hexagon.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in the United States by W. & S.B. Ives in Salem, Massachusetts on November 25, 1843. Their game was a folding game board with a cloth and cardboard pocket attached {{to the bottom of the}} game board along its edge. In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory <b>dowel</b> sharpened to a point at the bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate. This type of teetotum was referred to as a pin and plate teetotum.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dowel</b> {{reinforced}} {{butt joint}} or simply <b>dowel</b> joint {{has been a}} very common method of reinforcing butt joints in furniture for years. They are common in both frame and carcase construction. <b>Dowel</b> joints are popular in chairs, cabinets, panels and tabletops. They are also used to assist with alignment during glue up.|$|E
50|$|Wooden <b>dowels</b> {{have been}} used in {{manufacturing}} and woodworking for many centuries. One of the earliest documented uses of wooden <b>dowels</b> was in Japanese shrines in AD 690, which were constructed using only wood, wooden <b>dowels</b> and pegs, and interlocking joints. Around AD 1000, Leif Erikson sailed across the North Atlantic in a ship that was largely constructed of overlapping planks held together by wooden <b>dowels</b> and iron nails. The wooden <b>dowels</b> did not rust and thus were more reliable than iron for long expeditions.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} bending moment resistance of <b>doweled</b> joint with plywood members. Joint members were out of 11 -ply hardwood plywood (Hornbeam, Beech and Alder) that were 19 mm in thickness. <b>Dowels</b> were fabricated out of Beech and Hornbeam species. Their diameters (6, 8 and 10 mm) and depths of penetration (9, 13 and 17 mm) in joint members were chosen variables in this experiment. Results have shown that bending moment resistance, increases with increase of <b>dowel’s</b> diameter and its penetration depth. Joints made with <b>dowels</b> of Beech had higher resistance than <b>dowels</b> of Beech ones. Highest bending moment resistance (44. 29 N. m) were observed in joint made with <b>dowels</b> of Beech which were 10 mm in diameter and their depth of penetration was 17 mm. Lowest bending moment resistance (12. 08 N. m) was observed in joints having Hornbeam <b>dowels</b> with 6 mm diameter and 9 mm penetration...|$|R
50|$|The tool {{allows the}} {{placement}} of five <b>dowels</b> in one pass. A distance gauge bar provided with the jig allows accurate spacing between sets of <b>dowels.</b>|$|R
25|$|Maintenance for {{the older}} {{concrete}} pavements that develop faults includes the technique called <b>dowel</b> bar retrofit. This involves cutting slots in the pavement at each joint, placing <b>dowel</b> bars in the slots, then filling them with concrete patching material. This method can {{extend the life of}} the concrete pavement for another 15 years.|$|E
25|$|When skeining from wheel spun yarn, the bobbin {{can either}} {{be removed from the}} wheel and placed on a kate, or skeined {{directly}} from the wheel. If the bobbin is left on the wheel the tension on the drive band must be lessened in order to allow the bobbin to turn freely. Yarn spun on spindles {{can either be}} left on the spindle, or slipped onto a <b>dowel</b> for plying. The spindle or <b>dowel</b> is either placed in a lazy kate, or even a bowl to keep the spindle in one place while winding off the yarn.|$|E
25|$|Vibraphone mallets usually {{consist of}} a rubber ball core wrapped in yarn or cord and {{attached}} to a narrow <b>dowel,</b> most commonly made of rattan or birch and sometimes of fiberglass or nylon. Mallets suitable for the vibraphone are also generally suitable for the marimba.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dowels</b> and rivets are {{physical}} ways {{in which}} ceramics can be reinforced and strengthen beneath the surface. <b>Dowels</b> are cylindrical rods that consist of wood, metal, or plastic. They are drilled into the ceramic piece and usually are set in the hole with an adhesive {{that is used to}} repair the ceramic piece. Removing <b>dowels</b> can be hard because they lie under the surface and are usually hidden. Conservators will cut through <b>dowels</b> with a piercing saw and soften the area with a solvent, like acetone to remove two pieces of ceramic from one another.|$|R
30|$|This study {{examined}} the mechanics and pyrolysis analyses of rotation welding with treated <b>dowels.</b> Test results indicated that welding specimens with <b>dowels</b> immersed in CuCl 2 solution exhibited higher pullout resistance than untreated specimens. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe and analyze the welding interface. Wood <b>dowels</b> immersed in CuCl 2 solution provided more flowing molten polymer to obtain better connection than untreated wood <b>dowels.</b> Based on the chemical analyses of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses, the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose was detected after immersion of the <b>dowels</b> in a CuCl 2 solution. Pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin occurred during the welding process. The hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose may promote the pyrolysis and efficient connection of wood components during the welding process.|$|R
50|$|Inkle looms are {{constructed}} in both floor and table-top models. Either model {{is characterized by}} a wooden framework upon which <b>dowels</b> have been fastened. These <b>dowels</b> will hold the warp threads when the loom has been dressed. One of the <b>dowels,</b> or a paddle, is constructed so that its position can be adjusted. This tensioning device will be taken in as weaving commences and the warp threads become shorter.|$|R
25|$|Similar to pea {{whistles}}, samba whistles {{have a small}} ball or <b>dowel</b> {{to create}} {{the same sort of}} sound, but often also have two extensions either side of the chamber. None, one or both of these can be blocked to create a 'tri-tone' effect. The apito de samba is a traditional Portuguese example of a samba whistle.|$|E
25|$|In solid timber work it {{is common}} to {{counterbore}} a hole in the frame or carcase member to conceal the head of the screw. This also allows more of the body of the screw to penetrate the adjacent member for greater traction. After the screw has been driven into the joint, the counterbore can be filled with an appropriately sized piece of <b>dowel</b> or a wooden plug cut from an offcut of the same timber using a plug cutter.|$|E
25|$|This {{produces}} a joint {{which is much}} stronger than a butt joint without reinforcement. The dowels offer some holding strength even after the glue has deteriorated. Over time, dowels may shrink and become loose. They take on an oval shape in section owing to the different rate at which wood moves with different orientations of the grain. Loose dowels allow the joint to flex, although it may not fall apart. This phenomenon is evident in creaking chairs and wobbling book cases. For this reason, <b>dowel</b> joints are not preferred for high-quality furniture.|$|E
50|$|Brettstapel {{works by}} using {{hardwood}} <b>dowels</b> with a moisture content {{lower than that}} of softwood posts. Over time the <b>dowels</b> expand to achieve moisture equilibrium thus 'locking' the posts together and creating a structural load-bearing system.|$|R
30|$|According {{to several}} studies, welding {{properties}} could be significantly improved using smaller pre-drilled holes, dry wood <b>dowels</b> {{and increasing the}} contact area with non-vertical insertion methods. The smaller pre-drilled holes may increase the lateral pressure between the wood <b>dowels</b> and the pre-drilled holes. The wood <b>dowels</b> may provide more materials for the interface. Dry wood <b>dowels</b> after welding may absorb water from the environment. Wood <b>dowels</b> {{in a state of}} inflation may increase the bonding strength [11, 14 – 17]. It was found that native extractives of some special wood species could improve the water resistance [18 – 20]. Placencia and Pizzi compared welded joints with and without additives and found that welded joints with natural additives (rosin and lignin) showed improved water resistance [21, 22]. Water extracts of welded beech and welded spruce were analyzed after hydrolysis of welded materials and amounts of lignin, mono-oligosaccharides, acetic acid, vanillin, furfural, 5 hydroxymethylfurfural, and syringaldehyde were measured [23].|$|R
50|$|Metal <b>dowels</b> are {{hot-rolled}} and cold-rolled.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of concrete pavements is they are typically stronger and more durable than asphalt roadways. They also can be grooved to provide a durable skid-resistant surface. A notable disadvantage is that they typically can have a higher initial cost, and can be more time-consuming to construct. This cost can typically be offset through the long life cycle of the pavement. Concrete pavement can be maintained over time utilizing a series of methods known as concrete pavement restoration which include diamond grinding, <b>dowel</b> bar retrofits, joint and crack sealing, cross-stitching, etc. Diamond grinding is also useful in reducing noise and restoring skid resistance in older concrete pavement.|$|E
25|$|Documents {{released}} by the British Museum under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that a series of minor accidents, thefts and acts of vandalism by visitors have inflicted further damage to the sculptures. This includes an incident in 1961 when two schoolboys knocked off {{a part of a}} centaur's leg. In June 1981, a west pediment figure was slightly chipped by a falling glass skylight, and in 1966 four shallow lines were scratched on the back of one of the figures by vandals. In 1970 letters were scratched on to the upper right thigh of another figure. Four years later, the <b>dowel</b> hole in a centaur's hoof was damaged by thieves trying to extract pieces of lead.|$|E
25|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} is when {{two or more}} holes are too close for independent standard bushings. In this case one large renewable bushing {{can be made with}} two (or more) holes in the proper location (the first example in the image). Another possibility is to make a custom bushing with an eccentric hole and then notches {{on the outside of the}} head are used to locate the proper position of the bushing for each location (the middle example in the image). Another common need for a custom bushing is when the hole needed is perpendicular jig plate; in this case a bracket bushing is used. It is a hardened piece of right angle steel that bolts to the jig plate and is located with <b>dowel</b> pins.|$|E
50|$|Prior to use, {{the chain}} was soaked in vinegar {{so that the}} {{electrolyte}} was absorbed into the wooden <b>dowels.</b> The wood of which the <b>dowels</b> were made was chosen {{to be a very}} porous type so that the amount of electrolyte absorbed was maximised. The chain would continue to produce a voltage until the <b>dowels</b> dried out, then the chain would have to be resoaked. Typically, the chain would be charged by slowly drawing it through a bowl of vinegar as shown in figure 4.|$|R
3000|$|... 30 {{replicate}} welding specimens {{were tested}} for each group. The pullout resistance results {{are summarized in}} Table  1.

50|$|The giant cypress wood beams, {{trimmed with}} black walnut, are all hand joined and <b>doweled</b> with wood <b>dowels.</b> In fact, {{there are no}} metal nails used inside the structure.

25|$|The Stockmen's Bar and Grill is a brick {{structure}} with a saw-tooth roof in three bays which run {{at right angles}} to the street. The facade has been painted and the roof is concealed at the front by a very plain stepped brick parapet. In the centre of the front elevation is a large roller door flanked by two similar smaller doors on the left hand side and a standard sized door and a pair of triple projecting windows on the right hand side. These are supported on small brackets and are shaded by sun hoods. A timber veranda has been added {{to the rear of the}} building on the upper section and has a wheelchair access ramp. The veranda roof is supported on timber posts and has a timber handrail and <b>dowel</b> balustrade. The wall to the rear of the veranda is clad with weatherboards.|$|E
25|$|Almost all of {{the heads}} show some form of damage or {{mutilation}} {{that may or may}} not have been deliberately inflicted upon them before they were placed in the tomb. One of the most common features is for their ears to be broken off or seemingly chiseled away At least one scholar disputes that the damage to the ears was deliberate, pointing out cases where detached ears have been found in perfect condition, and that the damage may be due more to rough handling by tomb robbers. Of the many reserve heads only one has wholly intact ears; in others they have been scraped off close to the surface, whereas other or more crudely hacked or broken away. One example contained <b>dowel</b> holes for the attachment of external ears which were not found with the head, and another, smaller group of reserve heads were not made with any ears at all.|$|E
25|$|On {{the uneven}} bars, the gymnast {{performs}} a timed routine on two parallel horizontal bars set at different heights. These bars {{are made of}} fiberglass covered in wood laminate, {{to prevent them from}} breaking. In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The width and height of the bars may be adjusted to the size needed by individual gymnasts. In the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. The bars have been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the Elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the uneven bars using a springboard or a small mat. Chalk (MgCO3) and grips (a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance) may be used by gymnasts performing this event. The chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnasts' hands to decrease friction and prevent rips (tears to the skin of the hands); <b>dowel</b> grips help gymnasts grip the bar.|$|E

500|$|Each cell {{consisted}} of a wooden <b>dowel</b> with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc wires.

500|$|During {{the second}} phase, after {{determining}} {{that the proposed}} weight of the monument was too great for the old foundation to safely bear, {{the thickness of the}} walls atop the unfinished stump was reduced and the foundation was strengthened by adding a large unreinforced concrete slab below the perimeter of the old foundation to increase the monument's load bearing area two and one half times. The slab was [...] thick, with an outer perimeter [...] square, an inner perimeter [...] square, with undisturbed loam inside the inner perimeter except for the water well. The area {{at the base of the}} second phase foundation is [...] The strengthened foundation (old foundation and concrete slab) has a total depth of [...] below the bottom of the lowest course of marble blocks (now below ground), and [...] below the entry lobby floor. Casey reported that nowhere did the load exceed [...] and did not exceed [...] near the outer perimeter. To properly distribute the load from the shaft to slab, about half by volume of the outer periphery of the old rubble foundation below its top step was removed. A continuous sloping unreinforced concrete buttress encircles what remains. The buttress is [...] square at its base, [...] square at its top, and [...] high. The perimeter of the original top step of the old rubble foundation rests on the larger top of the concrete buttress. Its slope (lower external angle from the vertical) is 49°. This buttress rests in a depression (triangular cross-section) on the top surface of the concrete slab. The slab was constructed by digging pairs of [...] wide drifts on opposite sides of the monument's center line to keep the monument properly balanced. The drifts were filled with unreinforced concrete with depressions or <b>dowel</b> stones on their sides to interlock the sections. An earthen terrace [...] wide with its top at the base of the walls and steep sides was constructed in 1880–81 over the reinforced foundation while the rest of the monument was being constructed. During 1887–88, a knoll was constructed around the terrace tapering out roughly [...] onto the surrounding terrain. This earthen terrace and knoll serves as an additional buttress for the foundation. The weight of the foundation is , including earth and gneiss rubble above the concrete foundation that is within its outer perimeter.|$|E

40|$|The {{thorough}} experimental {{characterization of}} a dowel-type connection under various combinations of bending moments and normal forces {{is presented in}} this study. Double-shear steel-to-timber connections with 12 and 20 mm steel <b>dowels</b> were tested in a 4 -point bending test set-up. The load, between the connected steel and wood beams, was transferred by the <b>dowels</b> themselves and also via an additional (passive) contact device, which introduced an eccentric normal force in the timber beam. The behavior of the connections was studied at the global scale of the connection and at the local scale of the individual <b>dowels.</b> A non-contact deformation measurement system {{was used to assess}} the changes of the location of the center of relative rotation over the entire loading. At the same time, the head deformations of the individual <b>dowels</b> could be measured, giving a direct indication about the force distribution among the <b>dowels.</b> Due to reinforcement, connections behaved distinctly ductile with a global relative rotation of up to 3 °. Pre-stressing of the contact device by a force of 40 kN yielded an even stiffer behavior. For the particular configurations tested herein, the center of rotation was found to be close to the vertical axis of symmetry of the joint and close to the top row of the <b>dowels.</b> Moreover, the superimposed vertical shift of the center of relative rotation in case of a delayed normal force could be quantified...|$|R
