Howe suffered from severe asthma attacks throughout the convention, but remained in telephone contact with Rooseveltwho was not present, per the custom of the dayand continued to meet with delegates who were brought to visit him. Roosevelt was nominated by the convention after agreeing to make another rival, John Nance Garner, his vice presidential candidate, and after some of Smith's Tammany Hall supporters, led by William Gibbs McAdoo, began to defect.|$|E
5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to {{run by the}} Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support <b>from</b> <b>Democrats</b> after he switched parties. Major political figures like President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell later tried to sway Sestak from continuing the race, fearing he would damage Specter's chances in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such individuals as Joe Biden and Harry Reid, and organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bradley carried {{the vote of}} many Gold Democrats. He also drew a number of votes from those who sympathized with {{the views of the}} American Protective Association, an anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic organization. Some {{estimates}} placed the organization's membership at 14,000 in Louisville alone; it also had strength in the urban centers of Paducah, Lexington, Ashland, Covington, and Frankfort. Democrats were also hurt by economic factors, including the national economic problems and a severe drought in the state. Bradley was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky, defeating Hardin by a vote of 172,436 to 163,524. Pettit, the Populist candidate, drew 16,911 votes, most of them <b>from</b> <b>Democrats</b> in western Kentucky. Turnout in the election was 85%. More votes than potential voters were registered in 18 counties, nine of which went for Bradley and nine for Hardin.|$|E
5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} tight {{race for the}} November general election. Negative ads from both sides dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands <b>from</b> <b>Democrats</b> to release additional years of his tax returns, an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being adamant {{that he would not}} do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E
5|$|Bevin {{was sworn}} into a {{four-year}} term as Kentucky Governor on December 8, 2015. Observers {{from both parties}} praised Bevin's selection of experienced, relatively moderate individuals for his cabinet, including his former rival, Hal Heiner, as Secretary of the Education and Workforce Cabinet and former University of Kentucky football standout Derrick Ramsey as his Secretary of Labor. The appointments of two Democratic state representatives– John Tilley as Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and Tanya Pullin to a state judgeship– reduced the party's majority in the House and set up special elections that gave Republicans {{a chance to win}} their seats <b>from</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Bevin set the dates of the special elections to fill the seats of Tilley and Pullin, as well as those formerly held by newly elected Auditor Mike Harmon and newly elected Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, for March 8, 2016. Democratic representatives Denver Butler and Jim Gooch also switched their party affiliation to Republican in December, reducing the Democratic majority to 50–46 for the beginning of the first General Assembly of Bevin's governorship, and giving Republicans a chance to evenly split the chamber's 100 seats by sweeping the special elections. Republicans held only Harmon's seat, giving Democrats a 53–47 advantage in the House {{for the remainder of the}} session.|$|E

Self-styled taxpayer watchdog and former legislative aide C.B.

25|$|Elections {{were held}} for all 435 seats of the House of Representatives, {{representing}} the 50 states. Elections were also {{held for the}} non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and {{four of the five}} territories. The winners of these elections served in the 114th United States Congress, with seats apportioned among the states based on the 2010 United States Census. The Republicans won 16 seats <b>from</b> <b>Democrats,</b> while three Republican-held seats turned Democratic. The Republicans achieved their largest majority in the House since 1928. Combined with the Republican gains made in 2010, the total number of Democratic-held House seats lost under Barack Obama's presidency in midterm elections rose to 77 with these elections. This marked the highest number of House seats lost under a two-term president of the same party since Harry S. Truman. With 36.4% of eligible voters voting, the voter turnout was the lowest since 1942.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party is {{supportive}} of LGBT rights. Most support for same-sex {{marriage in the}} United States has come <b>from</b> <b>Democrats,</b> although some favor civil unions instead or oppose same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased {{in the past decade}} according to ABC News. An April 2009 ABC News/Washington Post public opinion poll put support among Democrats at 62%, while a June 2008 Newsweek poll found that 42% of Democrats support same-sex marriage while 23% support civil unions or domestic partnership laws and 28% oppose any legal recognition at all. A broad majority of Democrats have supported other LGBT-related laws such as extending hate crime statutes, legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the workforce, and repealing Don't ask, don't tell. A 2006 Pew Research Center poll of Democrats found that 55% supported gays adopting children with 40% opposed while 70% support gays in the military with only 23% opposed. Gallup polling from May 2009 stated that 82% of Democrats support open enlistment.|$|E

25|$|Publicly, Craig {{announced}} {{he intended to}} leave public life and work as {{a lawyer for the}} rest of his career. Secretly, however, he began making arrangement to run for the governorship of Indiana. He was an outsider to the Republican Party leadership, and owed his rise in The American Legion largely to patronage <b>from</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Craig was considerably less conservative than the party leadership, of whom William Jenner was chief, and knew that any attempt to run would be opposed by them. Knowing that most state convention delegates were reelected to each convention, he launched an unprecedented campaign, by personally meeting with hundreds of potential convention delegates before the May election in 1951. He was able to gain enough support to ensure he would be a contender at the convention, and then announced his intention to run. Jenner and the party chairman attempted to unite support in favor of one of the other five more conservative candidates, but after three rounds of balloting Craig won the nomination. He later credited the popularity of The American Legion for his victory. Harold W. Handley, of the opposing faction, was nominated to run for lieutenant governor.|$|E
500|$|Hastert was key to {{the passage}} in November 2003 of key Medicare {{legislation}} which created Medicare Part D, a prescription-drug benefit. Hastert's push to pass the legislationculminating in a three-hour House vote in which the Speaker, [...] "an imposing former wrestling coach, was literally leaning on recalcitrant lawmakers to win their support"raised the Speaker's profile and contributed to a shift of his image from amiable and low-key to more forceful. The extension of the vote for hours and the arm-twisting of members brought condemnation of Hastert <b>from</b> <b>Democrats,</b> with House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer saying: [...] "They are corrupting the practices of the House." [...] The bill passed on a narrow vote of 220 to 215.|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In my {{hope to find}} {{appropriate}} child care for my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was described {{to me as a}} technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement that her husband had handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher <b>from</b> <b>Democrats</b> on the committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation still seemed quite possible.|$|E

[...] Foraker was a major proponent of the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee and was the only committee member to speak in the debate. [...] Opposition was mostly <b>from</b> <b>Democrats,</b> who objected to the revolution by which American interests had taken control of the islands in 1893, a seizure defended by Foraker. [...] In early July, proponents were able to get the resolution through both houses of Congress, and President McKinley signed it on July 8.|$|E
500|$|The {{battles between}} Tyler and the Whigs in Congress {{resulted}} {{in a number of}} his cabinet nominees being rejected. He received little support <b>from</b> <b>Democrats</b> and, without much support from either major party in Congress, a number of his nominations were rejected without regard for the qualifications of the nominee. It was then unprecedented to reject a president's nominees for his Cabinet, though in 1809 James Madison withheld the nomination of Albert Gallatin as Secretary of State because of opposition in the Senate. Four of Tyler's Cabinet nominees were rejected, the most of any president. These were Caleb Cushing (Treasury), David Henshaw (Navy) James Porter (War), and James S. Green (Treasury). Henshaw and Porter served as recess appointees before their rejections. Tyler [...] repeatedly renominated Cushing, who was rejected three times in one day, March 3, 1843, {{the last day of the}} 27th Congress. No cabinet nomination failed after Tyler's term until Henry Stanbery's nomination as Attorney General was rejected by the Senate in 1868.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, {{the video}} for Branch's fourth single [...] "I Am America" [...] was {{released}} on YouTube. Her husband, Michael Branch, wrote the song partly in response to criticism of the Tea Party protests <b>from</b> <b>Democrats,</b> while also drawing on his own difficulties in life. In an interview for Billy Kelly of the Washington Times' Tea Party Report, Branch told how soon after her husband wrote the song he had her quickly learn the lyrics and then recorded her performing the song. She originally felt the song was too confrontational for her, but decided the message was so important that she should record the song. In the music video, footage of Tea Party rallies is interspersed with scenes of Branch singing on a sound stage and kids holding signs containing political messages and scripture. [...] "I Am America" [...] was played on the July 7, 2010, broadcast of Glenn Beck's radio show and a week later Fox News host Bill O'Reilly devoted {{a portion of his}} “Pinheads and Patriots” segment to the song, saying that [...] "for honoring legitimate protest" [...] Branch was a patriot. About 21 days after being uploaded the video had nearly 475,000 views. [...] "I Am America" [...] soon became a popular song with the Tea Party movement and has been described as the movement's anthem.
