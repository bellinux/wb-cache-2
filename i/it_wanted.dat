However, the Air Force determined it had no capable replacement who could command Davis' squadron.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{building}}, several large tenants leased space in the Chrysler Building. The Chrysler Corporation moved into the building in 1930 and used the tower as its division headquarters until the 1950s. The mapmaking company Texaco and the magazine magnate Henry Luce were also two of the original tenants. Texaco moved out in 1977 because <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> a more suburban workplace in Purchase, New York, for its employees. Luce's company Time Inc. was headquartered in the building until 1937, when it moved to the Rockefeller Center due to the latter containing more office space.|$|E

He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from {{the purchase of the}} club.|$|E
5|$|After the Six-Day War in 1967, the PLO {{moved their}} bases to Jordan and stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel, taking the border town of Karameh as their headquarters. The IDF {{claimed that the}} purpose was to destroy the PLO militant camps at Karameh and capture Yasser Arafat as reprisal, however, it is also {{believed}} that <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> to punish Jordan for its perceived support to Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers). Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not get involved in the battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire. The Israelis withdrew, or were repulsed, after a day-long battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner. The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, which unanimously condemned Israel for violating the cease-fire line and its disproportionate use of force.|$|E

5|$|In 1987 the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) {{indicated}} <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to consolidate}} its offices {{spread out across}} Philadelphia into one office building. In May 1988, Conrail solicited proposals from developers for a building to house its corporate headquarters. On March 30, 1990, after being sought after by numerous developers in Philadelphia and its suburbs, Conrail {{announced that it would}} be leasing 27 floors of Two Commerce Square. With a lead tenant secured, construction of the identical tower commenced in July 1990. Two Commerce Square was completed in July 1992 and Conrail began moving in approximately 3,000 employees in September of that year. Two Commerce Square marked the end of the skyscraper boom of the 1980s, being the last office skyscraper to be built in Philadelphia until the Cira Centre in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|It's About Games {{bought and}} sold used PC games, video games, and board games. Winmark spent roughly $6.8 million to acquire Video Game Exchange Inc. in 1997 and renamed it to It's About Games. It's About Games {{locations}} were largely in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Georgia and Maryland. It made money for Winmark until 1998. During its last year under Winmark management, It's About Games lost $3.4 million because of excessive inventory, a buggy computer system, poorly chosen products, and poorly trained employees. Winmark owned 60 of the 64 It's About Games stores in the franchise {{and would have been}} profitable without It's About Games. Winmark sold or closed all its It's About Games stores in 1999 to reduce losses.

5|$|Nevertheless, the Polish leader, Colonel Józef Beck, {{believed}} that Warsaw should act rapidly to forestall the German {{occupation of the}} city. At noon on 30 September, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czechoslovak troops and police and gave Prague time until noon the following day. At 11:45a.m. on 1 October the Czechoslovak foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague {{and told him that}} Poland could have what <b>it</b> <b>wanted.</b> The Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed an area of 801.5km² with a population of 227,399 people.

5|$|The General Aircraft Limited GAL. 49 Hamilcar or Hamilcar Mark I {{was a large}} British {{military}} glider {{produced during}} the Second World War, {{which was designed to}} carry heavy cargo, such as the Tetrarch or M22 Locust light tank. When the British airborne establishment was formed in 1940 by the order of Prime Minister Winston Churchill it was decided to develop a large glider which would be able to transport heavy equipment in support of airborne troops. General Aircraft Limited were chosen in January 1941 to develop this glider, which they designated the GAL. 49 'Hamilcar'. It was designed to transport a single light tank or two Universal Carriers. A number of problems, which included vacillation by the War Office on the number of gliders that <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> and poor management by GAL, led to delays in the production of the Hamilcar, and the first production glider was only assembled in mid-1943. These problems were only partially solved, and production of the glider continued to be slow, hampered by difficulties in finding suitable locations to store and construct the Hamilcars once their parts were produced. A total of 344 Hamilcars had been built when production ended in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Menzies {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} choose as interim replacement the A-5 or the F-4, {{which could not be}} deployed until 1966 and would cost A$120–180 million. Waiting for the TSR-2 or TFX in 1969 or 1970 seemed to pose great risk, but when considering Hancock's findings in September 1963 <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> to be able to offer a substantial response to the Labor party's criticism of its defence strategy. The British and American governments competed on behalf of their nations' unbuilt bombers, as both believed that export sales would increase domestic support for the aircraft. The Menzies government viewed the British promise to deploy a squadron of V bombers in Australia for interim defense until the TSR-2 was ready as unacceptable for both technical and political reasons. Beyond its cost, the Royal Air Force had not ordered the TSR-2; the Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Louis Mountbatten, who opposed it, advised the Australians against buying the aircraft and the RAAF feared being the only customer.|$|E

5|$|The {{court also}} created the plenary power doctrine, holding {{that the federal}} court did not have {{jurisdiction}} because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away {{the rights of the}} tribe. Crow Dog was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with Cherokee Nation; the next major case, United States v. Kagama, (1886), upheld the plenary power of Congress to enact the Major Crimes Act. The plenary power doctrine allowed Congress to enact any law that <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> to pass, over the opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. Congress subsequently used this power to breach the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the Kiowa by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent. The use of this power led to complaints of being subject to a lawmaking body without representation, especially prior to being granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} draft law {{was scheduled}} to conclude {{at the end of}} June 1971, and the Senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the Vietnam War continued. The Nixon administration announced in February 1971 that <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> a two-year extension to June 1973, after which the draft would end; Army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a two-year extension, after which an all-volunteer force would be in place. Skeptics such as Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John Stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a four-year extension, but the two-year proposal is what went forward in Congress. By early May 1971, Gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation, halting conscription and thereby bringing U.S. involvement in the war to a rapid end.|$|E
5|$|Troika {{wanted to}} make a 3D game, but was {{uncertain}} whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first- or third-person. At that time, the Source game engine was being built by Valve Corporation. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached Troika about using the engine, {{and it was the first}} external team to use it. Troika chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> players to speak to the characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with Bloodlines and Valve's own Half-Life 2, Troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, and with only a single source for technical support. Troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for the nighttime setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later artificial intelligence (AI) coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.|$|E

5|$|While the ON had {{competed in}} some local {{elections}} since 1970, at its second congress in June 1972 {{it decided to}} establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections. The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity (Front national pour l'unité française), or Front National. In order to create a broad movement, the ON sought to model the new party (as it earlier had sought to model itself) on the more established Italian Social Movement (MSI), which at the time appeared to establish a broad coalition for the Italian right. The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo. <b>It</b> <b>wanted</b> to unite the various French far-right currents, and brought together Le Pen's nationalist group, Roger Holeindre's Party of French Unity, Georges Bidault's Justice and Liberty movement, former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists, among others. Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure on the far-right.|$|E
5|$|With {{political}} and geographic division came religious division. One {{part of the}} Armenian Church claimed <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> to be separate from the head, whose seat was in Echmiadzin, Armenian SSR. Some Armenians in the US thought Moscow tried to use the Armenian Church to promote Communists' ideas outside the country. The Armenian Church thus separated into two branches, Echmiadzin and Cilician, and started to operate separately. In the US, Echmiadzin branch churches of the Armenian Apostolic Church would not admit members of the ARF. This {{was one of the}} reasons why the ARF discouraged people from attending these churches and brought the representatives from a different wing of the church, the Armenian Catholicate of Cilicia, from Lebanon to the US. In 1933, members of ARF were convicted in the assassination of Armenian archbishop Levon Tourian in New York City. Prior to his murder, the archbishop had been accused of being exclusively pro-Soviet by the ARF. The ARF was legally exonerated from any direct complicity in the assassination.|$|E
5|$|After John Myers' {{recommendations}} of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published, and the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national DAB was passed, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi-national station, and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to compete with}} BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on DAB to the whole of England and Wales, and Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. Regional content would be kept; split news, travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional DAB stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the rules governing its broadcast licence, but networked content would be broadcast {{the rest of the}} time. The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended. The new Smooth Radio was launched on 4 October 2010 with most of the output originating from Salford Quays, and other programming coming from London.|$|E
