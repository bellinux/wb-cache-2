5|$|An {{assessment}} of his record as the Byzantine Empire's first minister is difficult. Of the few available sources on his career, the Vita Euthymii, compiled years after Zaoutzes's death, is extremely hostile, seeking to pin {{the responsibility for}} several of the reign's failures or unpopular decisions on him, and thus preserve Leo from blame. The account of the Vita is further colored by the fierce rivalry between Zaoutzes and Euthymios, then a synkellos and Leo's spiritual father, over influence on the Byzantine emperor. Thus the Vita accuses Zaoutzes of being responsible for the sacking of the successful general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder from the army, {{as well as for}} the outbreak of hostilities with Bulgaria in 893: allegedly, two of his protégés moved the main market for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessalonica and then proceeded to extract exorbitant fees from the Bulgarian merchants. When Leo, at the behest of Zaoutzes, rejected the merchants' protests, the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> pretext to attack Byzantium. It has, however, been recently suggested by the scholar Paul Magdalino that the transfer was in fact Leo's initiative, aiming to enrich Thessalonica, whose patron saint, Saint Demetrius, he showed special favor to.|$|E
25|$|In Delhi <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> Jain temple {{which was}} wholly unknown to Europeans {{well acquainted with}} the city; and on prosecuting inquiry, I got its priest to open to me a {{concealed}} chamber containing large statues {{of several of the}} Tirthankaras richly ornamented.|$|E
500|$|In this monastery <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> {{great number}} of {{parchment}} codices ... there are some {{which seemed to be}} written before the seventh century, and especially a Bible (made) of beautiful vellum, very large, thin and square parchments, written in round and very beautiful letters; moreover there are also in the church a Greek Evangelistarium in gold and round letters, it should be very old.|$|E

50|$|The {{area has}} been {{inhabited}} since ancient times. Before the Hungarian tribes conquered the area, it was inhabited by Slavs and Avars. Stephen <b>I</b> <b>founded</b> <b>an</b> episcopal seat here.|$|R

500|$|The {{first known}} botanical {{collection}} of B.lemanniana {{was made by}} James Drummond in early 1847, during a voyage of botanical exploration through the Stirling Ranges to Cape Riche, in company with George Maxwell. This expedition would result in much of Drummond's renowned [...] "Fourth Collection", including the celebrated Hakea victoria. On returning home, Drummond sent a report of his explorations to The Inquirer, which published it on 14 April. In it, Drummond states [...] "On Mount Barren <b>I</b> <b>found...</b> <b>a</b> remarkable nodding yellow-flowered Banksia, with leaves and a habit so like B. Caleyii, that {{it can only be}} distinguished by the cones and flowers, which are widely different." [...] This is now recognised as a reference to B.lemanniana.|$|E
500|$|In the hospice's {{founding}} charter, {{signed in}} August 1443, Rolin wrote that [...] "disregarding all human concerns {{and in the}} interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> hospital." [...] In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily. [...] Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, {{played a major role in}} the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.|$|E
500|$|Numerous reviewers {{commented on}} the action {{sequences}} and violence with several noting they were better suited to a theatrical version rather than literature. While reviewers variously called it a [...] "high-octane, stomach-churning terror ride" [...] and [...] "turbo-injected with moral ambiguity", others noted that the action eventually grows tiresome. Reviewers {{also noted that the}} [...] "action sequences [...] keep the critique from becoming preachy" [...] or otherwise too serious. In The San Diego Union-Tribune, the reviewer wrote [...] "As a motorhead, I liked a lot of elements in this novel. On the other hand, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> lot of the corporate and corp-rat behavior ranged from disturbing to disgusting." [...] The reviewer in The Mercury concluded, [...] "This is not comfortable or enjoyable bedtime reading. The inventive language, punk dialogue and feverish action create sustained tension throughout...It's hell-on-wheels fiction—entertainment that will appeal to many, particularly those who are hot car enthusiasts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Later in life, Chad Varah became {{disillusioned with}} the Samaritans organisation. He {{announced}} in 2004 that, [...] "It's no longer what <b>I</b> <b>founded.</b> <b>I</b> <b>founded</b> <b>an</b> organisation to offer help to suicidal or equally desperate people. The last elected chairman re-branded the organisation. It {{was no longer}} to be an emergency service. It was to be an emotional support".|$|R

6000|$|... "The plant {{itself of}} course has long disappeared: but in {{following}} up [...] the rill through the copse, above the cottages, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> unusually [...] large Eglantine, growing {{by the side}} of the stream." ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Randall Larson on May 23, 2008 Snow {{said that he would}} not be returning to Smallville, citing the joint workload of Smallville and Ghost Whisperer, but would return for Ghost Whisperer. Reminiscing about his work on the show, Snow said that much of the music had not changed during the series and agreed with Larson that it was [...] "more [...] maintaining the heroic concept and the mythology than progressing through specific changes". Louis Febre, who worked closely with Snow from the beginning, became the sole composer for Smallville in season seven. Febre said that since he began composing for Smallville there was a shift to [...] "thematic development" [...] in the score, paralleling the characters' growth: [...] "As Clark grew emotionally and intellectually more complex, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> need to comment musically on his growth, and as he drew closer to his Superman persona, it became obvious that a 'Superman' theme would be required." ...|$|E
500|$|Wallace {{described}} himself as being at first reluctant to try {{it because of the}} aroma, [...] "but in Borneo <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater." [...] He cited one traveller from 1599: [...] "it is of such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all other fruits of the world, according to those who have tasted it." [...] He cites another writer: [...] "To those not used to it, it seems at first to smell like rotten onions, but immediately after they have tasted it they prefer it to all other food. The natives give it honourable titles, exalt it, and make verses on it." [...] Despite having tried many foods that are arguably more eccentric, Andrew Zimmern, host of Bizarre Foods, was unable to finish a durian upon sampling it, due to his intolerance of its strong taste.|$|E
500|$|... "Fool in Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Ester Dean, Dr. Luke, and Cirkut. As noted by Katherine St Asaph of Popdust and Amy Sciarretto of Popcrush, the opening lyrics of [...] "Fool in Love" [...] feature close similarities {{to that of}} Queen [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] (A Night at the Opera, 1975), {{with regard to the}} opening lyric [...] "Mama, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> man." [...] Amy Sciaretto from PopCrush, as well as St Asaph, compared the song's composition to Britney Spears' [...] "Criminal" [...] (Femme Fatale, 2011), with regard to how [...] "Fool in Loves instrumental begins with [...] "panning synths" [...] and acoustic guitar, with Sciaretto agreeing that [...] "only Ri could make that juxtaposition work." [...] "Fool in Love" [...] also features a single and double guitar sequence {{toward the end of the}} song, which begins with one electric guitar being played and begins to incorporate a second, creating a [...] "twinned" [...] effect, before the song descends into a prolonged fade at the end.|$|E
6000|$|... "In the Preface to the Trials <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> allusion, {{in terms}} of praise, to a work of the same kind, {{published}} in the French language. I wrote to London at once, and ordered the book." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the seventh}} {{year of my}} stay on the island, in the very same month of March, {{occurred}} a similar storm of great violence. Following upon it, to my astonishment, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> enormous dead whale, quite fresh, which had been cast up high and dry by the waves. Conceive my gratification when {{in the bowels of}} the great fish <b>I</b> <b>found</b> deeply imbedded <b>a</b> harpoon of the common sort with a few fathoms of new line attached thereto.|$|R
500|$|Harvick {{was only}} quick enough for 19th position. In {{the third and}} final practice, Burton was quickest with a time of 31.850 seconds. Kahne {{followed}} in second, ahead of Martin Truex, Jr. and Hamlin. Jamie McMurray was fifth quickest, with a time of 31.916 seconds. Edwards, Gordon, Ragan, Biffle, and Aric Almirola rounded out the first ten positions. Johnson, who was eleventh in the second session, could only manage 22nd. Following the third practice session, Harvick stated, [...] "We didn't put up a fast lap but it never slows down. I'm really excited." [...] Afterward, Johnson commented [...] "We struggled a little bit maybe in the first practice. But <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> good direction and started making some good gains there at the end. I feel really good about our car. It's very comfortable. I can run the top, run the bottom. I think we're in good shape." [...] "I think we've got the balance real close," [...] Johnson continued. [...] "My motor's running great. Maybe some overall grip but I think there I'm one of 43 guys that are saying that. This hot sun out here [...] the track awful slick." ...|$|E
500|$|Warren {{noted that}} Washington, D.C. had many memorials, {{but that this}} area, with the forest as a [...] "living memorial," [...] would have [...] "greatly pleased" [...] Kennedy for two reasons. First, Kennedy himself had spoken of the {{importance}} of planting trees in Israel, when he had addressed a 1958 Jewish National Fund meeting while serving as a junior Senator from Massachusetts, saying, [...] "What work could be more heartwarming or more enduring than the great forest at Jerusalem. Your children and grandchildren when they visit Israel will find your monument". [...] Second, Warren recalled that Kennedy had visited Israel twice, the first time in 1939 when it was still part of the British Mandate, and the second time in 1951. Speaking in 1951 {{of the differences between the}} people he witnessed during those two visits, he said that [...] "Perhaps the greatest change of all I found in the hearts and minds of the people, For unlike the discouraged settlers of 1939 they looked to the future with hope. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> revival of an ancient spirit". Warren concluded his remarks by saying he would use the same word that President Kennedy would have used: [...] "Shalom." ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{the console}} {{versions}} include {{some form of}} dynamic musical score during gameplay, {{and in the case}} of the Mega Drive conversion, use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions. This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by Charles Deenen. They also wanted to exchange Jean-François Freitas's music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music. The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by Rebecca Heineman, who said: [...] "Since Interplay wouldn't pay for a Super FX chip, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> way to do it with static RAM on the cart and DMA which got me a great frame rate. Interplay wouldn't pay for the static RAM either, so I ended up using Fast ROM instruction. Interplay wouldn't pay for a 3.6 MHz ROM either. So, frustrated, I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 MHz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow cartridges and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering." [...] Another World is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS, which has the same 65C816 microprocessor.|$|E

60|$|On {{the front}} piazza <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> elderly woman, with a broom. She knew me, {{for she had}} {{frequently}} seen me {{during the time that}} I was encamped upon the island. She was now greatly surprised at my appearance on the scene.|$|R

500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E
2500|$|A {{quotation}} from Bradstreet {{can be found}} on a plaque at the Bradstreet Gate in Harvard Yard: [...] "I came into this Country, where <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> new World and new manners at which my heart rose." [...] Unfortunately the plaque seems to be based on a misinterpretation; the following sentence is [...] "But after I was convinced it was the way of God, I submitted to it and joined to the church at Boston." [...] This suggests her heart rose up in protest rather than in joy.|$|E
2500|$|Critics also {{identified}} problems with Bellesiles's methods of citation. [...] Cramer noted that Bellesiles had misrepresented a passage by George Washington {{about the quality}} of three poorly prepared militia units as if his criticism applied to the militia in general. (Washington had noted that the three units were exceptions to the rule.) Cramer wrote, [...] "It took me twelve hours of hunting before <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> citation that was completely correct. In the intervening two years, I have spent thousands of hours chasing down Bellesiles’s citations, and I have found many hundreds of shockingly gross falsifications." ...|$|E
6000|$|This had {{a fearful}} {{effect on his}} other friend. [...] "Haven't I looked into it, I should like to know, and haven't <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> abyss? It's too inconceivable--your cruelty to me!" [...] she wildly broke out. She had hot tears in her eyes.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Varah {{announced}} that he had become disillusioned with Samaritans.

The last elected chairman re-branded the organisation. It was no longer to be an emergency service, it was to be emotional support". One in five calls to Samaritans are from someone with suicidal feelings. Samaritans' vision is that fewer people will die by suicide.|$|R

2500|$|... "I {{really feel}} like I haven’t fully {{articulated}} it till now and really spoke candidly till now… When I heard the news about Prince {{and the fact that}} it might have been prescription drug-related, I really had a moment of, like, ‘That’s awful and that’s sad — and I can relate.’ And, unfortunately, 90 percent of the entertainment community can relate. I remember being on the road at, like, 25, touring with theater and doing my own cocktail of Tylenol PM and Xanax. It's like, ‘Oh, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> way to make the Xanax last longer with the Tylenol PM. I mean, it’s as simple as that, and that is how performers get in so much trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1977, California assemblyman Willie Brown {{served as}} {{master of ceremonies}} at a large {{testimonial}} dinner for Jones attended by Governor Jerry Brown and Lieutenant Governor Mervyn Dymally. At that dinner, Brown touted Jones as [...] "what you should see every day when {{you look in the}} mirror in the early morning hours... a combination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Angela Davis, Albert Einstein... Chairman Mao". Harvey Milk, who spoke at political rallies at the Temple, wrote to Jones after one such visit: [...] "Rev Jim, It may take me many a day to come back down from the high that I reach today. I found something dear today. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> sense of being that makes up for all the hours and energy placed in a fight. I found what you wanted me to find. I shall be back. For I can never leave." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having enjoyed {{moderate}} success, {{his work}} began to draw more attention, especially among student audiences, with 1963's Youth of the Beast {{which is considered}} his [...] "breakthrough" [...] by film scholars. Suzuki himself calls it his [...] "first truly original film." [...] His style increasingly shirked genre conventions, favouring visual excess and visceral excitement over a coherent plot and injecting madcap humour into a normally solemn genre, developing into a distinctive [...] "voice". Tony Rayns explained, [...] "In his own eyes, the visual and structural qualities of his '60s genre films sprang from a mixture of boredom ('All company scripts were so similar; if <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> single line that was original, I could see room {{to do something with}} it') and self-preservation ('Since all of us contract directors were working from identical scripts, it was important to find a way of standing out from the crowd')." ...|$|E
