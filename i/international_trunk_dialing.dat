50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling,</b> most Group Switching Centres housed operators in an Auto Manual Centre (AMC) who were able to place any calls for subscribers in the local area that could not be directly dialled. Operators continued to be used after {{the introduction}} of Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> albeit on a reducing basis as direct dialled routings became increasingly available until universal direct dialling between U.K subscribers became available in 1979 via the Trunk Transit Network.|$|R

50|$|Subscriber <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> (STD, {{also known}} as {{subscriber}} toll dialling) is a telephone system allowing subscribers to <b>dial</b> <b>trunk</b> calls without operator assistance. The term was introduced when it first became possible for long-distance calls to be dialled directly, and is now rarely used where calls to any destination can be dialled.|$|R
25|$|Most of the United Kingdom had no {{lettered}} telephone dials {{until the}} introduction of Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialing</b> (STD) in 1958. Until then, only the director areas (Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester) and the adjacent non-director areas had the lettered dials; the director exchanges used the three-letter, four-number format. With {{the introduction of}} <b>trunk</b> <b>dialing,</b> the need for all callers {{to be able to}} dial numbers with letters in them led to the much more widespread use of lettered dials. The need for dials with letters ceased with the conversion to all-digit numbering in 1968.|$|R

50|$|The term {{subscriber}} <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> {{is used in}} the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, India and South East Asia. The corresponding term in the North American Numbering Plan, e.g. in the United States and Canada, {{is direct}} distance dialing.|$|R

50|$|Before STD (Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling)</b> codes were {{introduced}} in Northern Ireland, during the 1960s and 1970s, an operator based system was in operation. Each subscriber had short (usually 3 or 4 digit) number within the local exchange. For example, the post office in Dromore was Dromore 201.|$|R

50|$|Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> (STD) was {{introduced}} in 1958 to allow a caller to call another telephone directly instead of via a manual telephone exchange operator. Uniform exchange codes, usually called STD codes, were allocated for every exchange in the country, progressively as STD was rolled out. This process was not completed until 1979.|$|R

50|$|The {{change to}} all-figure {{dialling}} was controversial and was debated in both Houses of Parliament. Among the {{criticisms of the}} new system was the perceived difficulty in remembering telephone numbers, the inability to easily recognise where a telephone number was located and the need for a change so soon after the implementation of subscriber <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rt Hon Ernest Marples was Postmaster General {{while running}} the {{telephone}} network {{run by the}} General Post Office, Marples introduced subscriber <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling,</b> which eliminated the compulsory use of operators on national phone calls. On 2 June 1957, Marples brought in British postcodes and made the first draw for the new Premium Bonds. Marples was Minister of Transport (1959-1964).|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of subscriber <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> each city with a Director system was assigned a 3-digit code, in which the second digit corresponded to the first letter of the city name on the telephone dial, {{with the exception of}} London which had the two-digit code 01. Codes were later changed (e.g., London became 020, and Manchester 0161).|$|R
50|$|In {{industry}} jargon, these area {{codes and}} prefixes {{are referred to}} as NDC codes (National Dialing Codes). This is the term used by ComReg and technical documents, as they include non-geographic codes. Historically, like the UK, the term STD code (Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling)</b> was used.However, the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, Harold Macmillan {{appointed}} Marples Postmaster General. At {{that time}} the telephone network was controlled by the General Post Office, and Marples introduced subscriber <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> (STD), which eliminated the use of operators on national phone calls. On 2 June 1957, Marples started the first draw for the new Premium Bond scheme. He also introduced the first postcodes to the UK.|$|R
5000|$|The General Post Office issued {{subscriber}} <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> (STD) {{codes for}} most areas {{during the late}} 1950s and early 1960s. The codes allowed subscribers to call other exchanges directly and without the assistance of an operator. To help the public remember the new codes they were represented by a recognisable combination of two letters and a number. The letters and numbers corresponded as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|At this time, the {{majority}} of lines in rural, and regional areas (particularly in Scotland and Wales) were still manually switched. This inhibited growth, and caused bottlenecks in the network, {{as well as being}} labour and cost-intensive. The Post Office began to introduce automatic switching, and replaced all of its 6,000 exchanges. Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> (STD) was also added from 1958, which allowed subscribers to dial their own long-distance calls.|$|R
50|$|As step offices became rarer, Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialing</b> Codes {{no longer}} {{followed}} the original rules, and were significantly revised in the mid-1990s, with further changes as wider use of mobile phones and non-BT competition {{came into the}} UK market. There are now some 70000 local exchange codes in use in the UK. The largest trunk carrier, British Telecom, connects the local network through some 60 transit (tandem) switches.|$|R

5000|$|Merton Abbey's {{original}} {{telephone exchange}} code in the London director area was [...] "542" [...] (now [...] "(020) 8542"). Before {{the advent of}} subscriber <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling,</b> the area's alpha-numeric code was [...] "LIB", named after the local mill and written as, for example, [...] "LIBerty 1234". On the old Post Office telephone dials, the letters [...] "LIB" [...] corresponded to the numbers [...] "542", hence the modern exchange code.|$|R
50|$|American {{message unit}} {{counters}} generally had four digits, which sufficed {{because they were}} only used on local calls and most residential lines did not pay for local calls. Despite the arrival of subscriber <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> (automatic long-distance dialing) in Europe, central offices there continued making and using message registers in the 1970s, designing ones that could register more than one click per second on a trunk call and display five or six digits.|$|R

50|$|Until 1995, {{calls to}} Malaysia from Singapore were direct, {{with only the}} area code and number being required, hence 03 for Kuala Lumpur instead of +60 3. In 1995, owing to the {{divergence}} of the two countries' numbering plans, the Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> prefix 020 was adopted. For example, in order to call a number in Kuala Lumpur, 020 is dialled first, followed by the area code 3 (excluding the leading zero), then the subscriber number.|$|R
50|$|When {{telephone}} {{systems were}} first introduced, subscribers called a telephone exchange and asked a human operator {{to connect the}} call to another subscriber on the same exchange; calls to other exchanges were originally not possible. Later it became possible to dial numbers on the same exchange; calls to other exchanges (trunk calls) were possible, but had to be connected by an operator. When subscribers in one area became able to dial non-local subscribers, the term used for the innovation was subscriber <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
