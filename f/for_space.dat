5|$|Approximately 270petajoules(PJ) of {{geothermal}} heating {{was used in}} 2004. More than half went <b>for</b> <b>space</b> heating, and another third for heated pools. The remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications. Global installed capacity was 28GW, but capacity factors tend to be low (30% on average) since heat is mostly needed in winter.

5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator <b>for</b> <b>Space</b> Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator <b>for</b> <b>Space</b> Transportation Operations.|$|E

5|$|Although NASA was {{supporting}} {{his work with}} grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University. SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed <b>for</b> <b>space</b> manufacturing and settlement.|$|E

30|$|The {{following}} {{approach to}} generating continuous fractured features is recommended. To generate fractures that extend through multiple grid cells, fracture spacing is correlated {{in the direction}} of strike and dip. The strike, dip, and aperture can either use the same correlated field as the spacing or a random number generator to assign the value for each cell. The probability distribution function for strike and dip should be aligned with the spatial correlation <b>for</b> <b>spacing.</b> <b>For</b> example, if the spatial correlation <b>for</b> <b>spacing</b> has a strike of 45 ° and a dip of 0 °, the mean value for strike should be 45 ° and the mean value for dip should be 0 °. In this way, fractures extend through multiple grid cells with similar properties. The correlation length used <b>for</b> <b>spacing</b> controls the length of that fracture set.|$|R
