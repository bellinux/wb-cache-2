25|$|Besides {{leading to}} {{discontinuation}} of the GNE project, Wikipedia {{also led to}} the gradual demise of Nupedia. Due {{to the collapse of}} the <b>internet</b> <b>economy</b> at that time, Jimmy Wales decided to discontinue funding for a salaried editor-in-chief in December 2001, and Sanger resigned from both projects soon thereafter. After Sanger's departure, Nupedia increasingly became an afterthought to Wikipedia; of the Nupedia articles that completed the review process, only two did so after 2001. As Nupedia dwindled into inactivity, the idea of converting it into a stable version of approved Wikipedia articles was occasionally broached, but never implemented. The Nupedia website at nupedia.com was shut down on September 26, 2003. Nupedia's encyclopedic content, which was often described as limited, has since been assimilated into Wikipedia.|$|E

40|$|Marx’s {{concept of}} alienation, {{particularly}} as articulated in Dallas Smythe’s audience-commodity thesis, {{is central to}} critical studies of {{the political economy of}} digital media and its exploitation of user labour. However, in its application within critical studies of <b>Internet</b> <b>economies,</b> the concept often becomes limited to alienation from ‘species-being’ or autonomous self-actualisation. Drawing on mostly queer, but also some feminist, critiques this paper seeks to challenge this application of the alienation concept. It uses examples of the mediation of gay and queer sexualities through online hook-up apps to illustrate its position, concluding with some suggestions for how queering the subject of the alienation thesis may shape further analysis...|$|R

40|$|If <b>Internet</b> <b>economies</b> {{drive the}} growth of service science, then service hyper-networks may {{facilitate}} the understanding of {{the growth of}} <b>Internet</b> <b>economies,</b> such as the convergence of e-commerce and social networking. This new model analyzes the unprecedented promises of a digitally connected world for scaling: up (reaching the population), down (personalization), and transformational (new business designs). It reveals the principle of designing multiple simultaneous layers of connections of persons and organizations on the same basic networks to inflate value propositions (business spaces) and enable massive, simultaneous value cocreations across the life cycles of persons and organizations. This is a new topic in networks science and a new method for service scaling design – e. g., the identification of leaders/hubs (“value worm holes”) to expand business models. We provide a mathematical analysis and an agent-based simulation study to show the effects of inter-relating a person’s multiple roles in his/her life cycle, where each role sparks a particular network. These results confirm that multi-layered networking (e. g., simultaneous multiple social networks) decreases exponentially the degrees of separation between any two nodes in the community (the hyper-network); and thereby increases the possibility for value proposition and cocreation. 1. A BRIEF CASE FOR A NEW SERVICE SCIENCE The Cambridge Papers 2008 by Ifm and IBM [5] consummated the recent industry-led call for a new science of service. Many new studies have responded to this challenge. From the perspective of this paper, we further focus our analysis on a particular defining concept of service that the field generally recognizes: the cocreation of value by the customer and the provider. In other words, we consider any economic activity that cocreates value to be service, or, at the least, to have {{the potential to be a}} service. To be certain, the field has recognized some othe...|$|R
