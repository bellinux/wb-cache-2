50|$|Diffusion flames can be laminar {{diffusion}} flames (e.g. Candles and matches {{burning in}} the air etc.) and turbulent diffusion flames (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and internal combustion engines) depending {{on the nature of}} mixed gas flow. Further, the <b>flame</b> <b>shapes</b> of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich diffusion flames and oxygen-deficient. <b>Flame</b> <b>shapes</b> also depend on the discharging velocity of fuel and air. Eddies inside the air flow {{plays an important role in}} deciding the <b>flame</b> <b>shapes.</b> With increase in discharging velocity of fuel into the air laminar diffusion flames tends to become turbulent diffusion flames. This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of turbulent flame. The position where laminar flame is changing into turbulent flame is termed as “break-up point”. Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change. Studies by Hawthorne et al. prove that the chemical reaction rates in turbulent diffusion flames and in laminar diffusion flames are almost similar.|$|R

40|$|Laminar {{diffusion}} flames are {{of interest}} as model flame systems that are more tractable for analysis and experiments than practical turbulent diffusion flames. Certainly understanding laminar flames must precede understanding more complex turbulent flames while man'y laminar diffusion flame properties are directly relevant to turbulent diffusion flames using laminar flamelet concepts. Laminar diffusion <b>flame</b> <b>shapes</b> have been of interest since the classical study of Burke and Schumann because they involve a simple nonintrusive measurement that is convenient for evaluating flame structure predictions. Motivated by these observations, the <b>shapes</b> of laminar <b>flames</b> were considered during the present investigation. The present {{study was limited to}} nonbuoyant flames because most practical flames are not buoyant. Effects of buoyancy were minimized by observing flames having large flow velocities at small pressures.

40|$|Acoustically excited lean {{premixed}} low-swirl flames were experimentally investigated to gain {{a better}} understanding of detrimental thermoacoustic couplings which can occur in applications like low-NOx gas turbines. Propane-air flames were imaged and analyzed at equivalence ratios of 0. 6 to 0. 8, mean flow velocities of 3. 5 to 5. 5 m/s and excitation frequencies of 135 Hz to 555 Hz. It was observed that with increasing excitation frequency, mean <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> gradually became wider up to a Strouhal number of about 2. 5 and then slowly reverted back to the unexcited <b>flame</b> <b>shape.</b> Such large changes in mean <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> and possibly flow field under acoustic excitations can significantly affect flame dynamics. Increased heat release fluctuations were observed in the flame shear layer at Strouhal numbers from 1 to 2. Rolling up of the flame by vortices was suggested as a driving mechanism for these fluctuations which may lead to combustion instabilities...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{numerical}} studies through unsteady simulations {{with detailed}} hydrogen chemistry {{have been reported}} for premixed H- 2 -air flames in straight microtubes to understand the role of flame-wall coupling {{and its effect on}} flame dynamics for a range of wall heat transfer conditions.

These flame modes are represented with <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> angles and corresponding <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> is correlated to wall heat transfer conditions. It has been observed that an increase in wall heat transfer coefficient, h, though it increases the heat loss from a propagating flame, does not necessarily lead to a monotonic decrease in flame propagation speed. A transition regime, where the propagating flame changes its shape, has been identified. The variation of mass flux {{in the vicinity of the}} propagating flame has been used to gain a better understanding of flow-redirection and its impact on <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> and flame propagation speed for premixed H- 2 -air mixtures...|$|E
