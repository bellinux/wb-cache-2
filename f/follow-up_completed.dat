40|$|This report {{describes}} the 3 year outcomes {{of three different}} variants of the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program, a behavioural family intervention. Families {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three intervention conditions or to a waitlist condition. At 1 year follow-up there were similar improvements on observational and self-report measures of preschooler disruptive behaviour for Enhanced, Standard and Self Directed variants of Triple P. At 3 year <b>follow-up</b> (<b>completed</b> by 139 families), each condition showed a similar level of maintenance of intervention effects. Approximately 2 / 3 of preschoolers who were clinically elevated on measures of disruptive behaviour at pre-intervention moved from the clinical to the non-clinical range. Across conditions, there was a comparable preventive effect for each intervention for these high risk children. The implications of the findings for the development of brief, cost effective parenting interventions within a public health framework are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{studies are}} {{reported}} that tested the fear-avoidance (FA) model using path analytic techniques. In Study 1, 429 employees with back pain at baseline and back pain at 18 months <b>follow-up</b> <b>completed</b> questionnaires assessing sociodemographic information, pain severity, negative affect, pain-related fear, and disability. Results indicated that pain severity at baseline predicted pain related fear and disability at follow-up, and that pain-related fear is rather a consequence than an antecedent of pain severity. Results further {{revealed that the}} disposition to experience negative affect has a low impact upon pain severity and disability, and is best viewed as a precursor of pain-related fear. Study 2 included 238 employees without back pain at baseline, but who developed back pain at one year follow-up. A similar model as in Study 1 was tested. Overall, results {{are in line with}} those of Study 1. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical relevance and clinical implications...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines {{the relationship between}} rumination and attentional bias. Additionally, the study aims to determine, within a diathesis-stress framework, whether rumination or attentional bias (or both) can prospectively predict psychological distress. Eighty-one participants completed selected measures of rumination and psychological distress at time one, in addition to experimental manipulations of rumination and mood and measures of mood and attentional bias at time two. Seventy-three participants (90 % <b>follow-up)</b> <b>completed</b> final measures of stress and psychological distress approximately three weeks later. In combination with negative mood, inducing rumination decreased positive attentional bias, whilst inducing distraction increased positive attentional bias. Rumination and stress interacted to predict change in psychological distress. Negative attentional bias showed a trend towards interacting with rumination and stress to predict dysphoria. The findings supported the proposed diathesis-stress models. In addition, a causal relationship between rumination and positive attentional bias has been empirically established for the first time...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES Buruli ulcer (BU) is a {{tropical}} skin disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans, {{which is currently}} treated with 8 weeks of streptomycin and rifampicin. The evidence to treat BU for a duration of 8 weeks is limited; a recent retrospective study from Australia suggested that a shorter course of antimicrobial therapy might be equally effective. We studied the outcomes of BU in a cohort of Ghanaian patients who defaulted from treatment and as such received less than 8 weeks of antimicrobial therapy. METHODS A number of days of antimicrobial therapy and patient and lesion characteristics were recorded from charts from a cohort of BU patients treated at Nkawie-Toase hospital between 2008 and 2012. Patients who defaulted from treatment were retrieved, and lesion characteristics and functional limitations were recorded. RESULTS About 54 % of patients defaulted from therapy or wound care.

Objective: To present 2 IRB-related issues that have not appeared in the literature but occurred dur-ing the course of a large 5 -year PBRN study involving 32 sites dispersed around the United States. Results: Our study required IRB approval from a total of 19 local, hospital, academic center, and professional organization-based IRBs that reviewed a protocol of postpartum depression screening and <b>follow-up</b> <b>completed</b> in English or Spanish. Initial approval of the protocol and consent forms proceeded with only the usual barriers of submitting 19 different forms, and no protocol amend-ments were required.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with microspheres (HepaSphere) loaded with doxorubicin in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and methodsFrom April to December 2013, 50 patients with HCC were treated by selective TACE using HepaSphere microspheres loaded with doxorubicin. The size of the lesions was from 2 to 9 cm (mean 5. 2). ResultsAll of the procedures were technically successful, {{and there were no}} major complications. At 1 -month <b>follow-up,</b> there was <b>complete</b> tumor response in 48 %, partial response in 42 %, stable disease in 10 %, and there were no cases of disease progression. At 3 -month <b>follow-up,</b> <b>complete</b> tumor response was observed in 42 %, partial response in 38 %, stable disease in 16 %, and progressive disease in 4 %.

We conducted a simulated activation of a hibernating pandemic influenza clinical trial in order to test trial processes and to determine the value of such simulation in maintaining trial readiness. Methods: The simulation involved the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, one participating hospital, one manufacturing unit and the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) supplier. During the exercise, from 15 September 2015 to 2 December 2015, clinical staff at the participating site completed the trial training package, a volunteer acting as a patient was recruited to the study, ‘dummy’ IMP was prescribed and <b>follow-up</b> <b>completed.</b> Results: Successful activation of the hibernating trial with patient recruitment within 4 weeks of ‘arousal’ as planned was demonstrated. A need for greater resilience in anticipation of staff absenteeism was identified, particularly in relation to key trial procedures where the potential for delay is high. A specific issue relating to the IMP Stock Control System was highlighted as a potential source of error that could compromise the randomisation sequence.

40|$|Purpose. Our aim is {{to verify}} the {{feasibility}} and effectiveness of endovascular treatment for symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in urgencies and emergencies. Materials and methods. Over the past 51 months, we treated 38 symptomatic AAAs with endovascular exclusion. In 23 haemodynamically stable patients, computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed before treatment, and AAA exclusion was carried out as an urgent procedure; 15 patients with haemorrhagic shock were examined by ultrasound (US) only {{in the emergency room}} whereas the procedure was carried out in emergency and planned using angiography. Time from presentation to treatment was 100 min on average (range: 50 - 150 min). We used 27 Excluder (Gore) and 11 Zenith (Cook) stent-grafts. The follow-up was performed with CT angiography after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Results. The immediate technical success rate was 100 %, and the perioperative mortality rate was 10. 5 %. At <b>follow-up</b> <b>completed</b> in 34 patients (range: 1 - 48 months, mean: 19. 2), we observed five endoleaks (14 %) (four type 2 : two thrombosed spontaneously and two were under observation at the time of writing; one type 3, treated with stent-graft extension) and one occlusion of a stent-graft leg (treated by femorofemoral bypass).

40|$|Background-—We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether sepsis is associated with neurocognitive outcomes 4. 5 years after congenital heart disease surgery in early infancy. Methods and Results-—A secondary analysis from a prospective inception cohort included all children having congenital heart disease surgery done at ≤ 6 weeks of age with cardiopulmonary bypass at the Western Canadian referral center from 1996 to 2009. Follow-up at the referral center determined the primary outcomes at 4. 5 years with full-scale, performance, and verbal intelligence quotients on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Perioperative variables were collected prospectively, and confirmation of blood culture–positive sepsis was done retrospectively. Multiple linear regression models for neurocognitive outcomes and multiple Cox proportional hazards regression for mortality were determined. Sepsis occurred in 97 of 502 patients (19 %) overall and in 76 of 396 survivors (19 %) with 4. 5 -year follow-up. By 4. 5 years, there were 91 (18 %) deaths, and 396 of 411 survivors (96 %) had <b>follow-up</b> <b>completed.</b> Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was associated with worse scores on all neurocognitive outcomes on multivariable regression; the association between extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and full-scale intelligence quotient had a regression coefficient of 13. 6 (95 % CI 21. 3 to 5. 9; P= 0. 001). Sepsis perioperatively was associated with performance and verbal intelligence quotients, with a trend for full-scale intelligence quotient (P= 0. 058) on multivariable regression.

40|$|Language {{therapy for}} word-finding {{difficulties}} in aphasia usually involves picture naming of single words {{with the support}} of cues. Most studies have addressed nouns in isolation, even though in connected speech nouns are more frequently produced with determiners. We hypothesised that improved word finding in connected speech would be most likely if intervention treated nouns in usual syntactic contexts. Six speakers with aphasia underwent language therapy using a software program developed for the purpose, which provided lexical and syntactic (determiner) cues. Exposure to determiners with nouns would potentially lead to improved picture naming of both treated and untreated nouns, and increased production of determiner plus noun combinations in connected speech. After intervention, picture naming of treated words improved for five of the six speakers, but naming of untreated words was unchanged. The number of determiner plus noun combinations in connected speech increased for four speakers. These findings attest to the close relationship between frequently co-occurring content and function words, and indicate that intervention for word-finding deficits can profitably proceed beyond single word naming, to retrieval in appropriate syntactic contexts. We also examined the relationship between effects of therapy, and amount and intensity of therapy. We found no relationship between immediate effects and amount or intensity of therapy. However, those participants whose naming maintained at <b>follow-up</b> <b>completed</b> the therapy regime in fewer sessions, of relatively longer duration.

Overweight female adults participating in a 12 -week treatment phase with 6 -month <b>follow-up</b> <b>completed</b> the Beck Depression Inventory, Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. A repeated measures analysis of variance with completers revealed significant improvements in depression in both ASPIRE II, F(2, 40) = 5. 52, p =. 008, [eta subscript]p[superscript] 2 = 0. 22; and ASPIRE III, F(2, 50) = 9. 43, p <. 001, [eta subscript]p[superscript] 2 = 0. 27; as well as body satisfaction in ASPIRE II, F(2, 40) = 3. 78, p =. 031, [eta subscript]p[superscript] 2 = 0. 16; and ASPIRE III, F(2, 50) = 9. 92, p <. 001, [eta subscript]p[superscript] 2 = 0. 28. Improvements in life satisfaction were limited to the initial treatment phase of ASPIRE II, t(20) = 3. 30, p =. 004. Findings suggest that a small changes approach to weight management may be a viable option for promoting and maintaining significant weight loss as well as improvements in psychological function.

40|$|BackgroundAlthough the {{frequency}} of biological valve use in treating aortic valve disease is increasing, the critical limiting factor, “structural deterioration,” remains unresolved. Analysis of long-term outcomes after implantation of cryopreserved aortic allografts will yield further information related to the durability of the aortic allograft, possibly suggesting mechanisms underlying or strategies to prevent or treat the structural deterioration of biological valve substitutes. MethodsA total of 840 cryopreserved aortic allografts implanted in the last 35 years were reviewed with clinical <b>follow-up</b> <b>completed</b> in 99 % of the consecutive series. By June 2010, 285 implanted allografts had been surgically explanted, 288 patients died before allograft removal, and 267 patients are under continued follow-up. ResultsCryopreserved aortic allografts were durable for more than 15 years in the middle-aged and older patient population. The estimated median time until structural deterioration was 20 years post-implantation, and 2 allografts have been functioning well for more than 30 years. Structural deterioration was independently related to the young age of the recipient, elderly age of the donor, severe obesity in the recipient, history of blood transfusion in the recipient, and full-root implantation technique. Infection of the implanted allograft necessitating reintervention rarely occurred. Reintervention for the allograft demonstrated 2 % in-hospital mortality. ConclusionsCryopreserved aortic allografts were durable for more than 15 years. Structural deterioration of aortic allografts was related to multiple factors.

Forty percent of the patients had symptoms or medical problems related to their disease. In 18 % there was a positive finding on clinical examination. In 28 % investigations were undertaken part of departmental routine practice. Ten percent of the investigations showed an abnormal result. Ninety nine percent of physicians and 85 % of the patients expressed satisfaction. Using the short toxicity scale rates of recording toxicity could be increased from 28 to 93 %. Conclusions There is wide variation in follow-up practices among European centres. There was a low incidence of positive findings clinically or with routine investigations. A simple scale for recording morbidity has proved easy to use by departments, which have not routinely used one of the standard measures. Further work will attempt to produce an European guideline for effective routine follow-up after radiotherapy. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedThe {{no reflow}} {{phenomenon}} {{is reported to}} occur in > 2 % of all percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) and portends a poor prognosis. We analyzed data from 5, 286 consecutive patients who underwent PCI from the Melbourne Interventional Group (MIG) registry from April 2004 through January 2008 who had 30 -day <b>follow-up</b> <b>completed.</b> Patients without no reflow (normal reflow, n = 5, 031) were compared to 255 (4. 8 %) with no reflow (n = 217 for transient no reflow, n = 38 for persistent no reflow). Patients with transient or persistent no reflow {{were more likely to}} present with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiogenic shock (p < 0. 0001 for the 2 comparisons). They {{were also more likely to}} have complex lesions (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association type B 2 /C), have lesions within a bypass graft, require an intra-aortic balloon pump, receive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition, and have a longer mean stent length (p < 0. 0001 for all comparisons). In-hospital outcomes were significantly worse in those patients with transient or persistent no reflow, with increased death, periprocedural MI, renal impairment, and major adverse cardiac events (p < 0. 0001 for all comparisons). Similarly, transient and persistent no reflow portended worse 30 -day clinical outcomes, with a progressive increase in mortality (normal reflow 1. 7 % vs transient no reflow 5. 5 % vs persistent no reflow 13. 2 %, p < 0. 0001), MI, target vessel revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events (p < 0. 0001 for all comparisons) compared to patients with normal flow. In conclusion, transient or persistent no reflow complicates approximately 1 in 20 PCIs and results in stepwise increases in in-hospital and 30 -day adverse outcomes.

NELS: 88 is a nationally representative sample of approximately 25, 000 eighth graders who were enrolled in public or private school in 1988. About 21, 000 students were resurveyed in 1990, a second <b>follow-up</b> was <b>completed</b> in 1992, a third <b>follow-up</b> was <b>completed</b> in 1994, and one more additional follow-up interview is planned for 1998. NELS: 88 provides a wealth of information on students as they progress through the school system, including information collected from their parents, teachers, and school principals. This study examined the characteristics of students who switched between school sectors (public to private, or private to public) as they moved from 8 th to 10 th grade.
