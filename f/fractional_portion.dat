No good whatever would have come from entering into negotiation; there remained but the two alternatives. It {{would have been far}} better had Parliament, instead of deciding on coercion, withdrawn altogether from the colonies, for although hitherto the Americans had shown no great fighting qualities, it was clear that so small an army as England could spare could not permanently keep down so vast a country if the people were determined upon independence. They might win every battle,--might overpower every considerable force gathered against them,--but they could only enforce the king's authority over a mere <b>fractional</b> <b>portion</b> of so great an area. England, however, was unaccustomed to defeat; her spirit in those days was proud and high; and by a large majority Parliament voted for the continuance of the war. The next step taken was one unworthy of the country. It tended still further to embitter the war, and it added to the strength of the party in favor of the colonists at home. Attempts were made by the government to obtain the services of large numbers of foreign troops. Negotiations were entered into with Russia, Holland, Hesse, and other countries. Most of these proved ineffectual, but a considerable number of troops was obtained from Hesse.|$|E

50|$|Several {{characters}} in Unicode {{can serve as}} a decimal separator depending on the locale. Decimal fractions are represented in text as a sequence of decimal digit numerals with a decimal separator separating the whole-number portion from the <b>fractional</b> <b>portion.</b> For example, the decimal fraction for “¼” is expressed as zero-point-two-five (“0.25”). Unicode has no dedicated general decimal separator but unifies the decimal separator function with other punctuation characters. So the “.” used in “0.25” is the same period character used to end the sentence. However, cultures vary in the glyph or grapheme used for a decimal separator. So in some locales, the comma may be used instead ”0,25”. Still other locales use a space for “0 25”. The Arabic writing system includes a dedicated character for a decimal separator that looks much like a comma ”٫” (U+066B) which when combined with the Arabic graphemes for the Arabic-Indic decimal digits to express one-quarter appears as: “٠٫٢٥”.|$|E

30|$|For {{the purpose}} of communications, the DTV {{receivers}} are required to extract the timing measurements and recover the frequency offset from the received signals, which result in a synchronization problem. For reliable communications, the OFDM systems have stringent requirements on the timing and frequency synchronization. However, for {{the purpose of}} high accuracy positioning and navigation, an even finer synchronization is required. To achieve a finer time delay estimation, methods to determine the time of arrival (TOA) of the OFDM DTV signals include the coarse timing acquisition with a sliding correlator, which detects the start of an OFDM symbol by using the property of OFDM cyclic prefix (CP) [34], and the fine timing tracking with a delay-locked loop (DLL) [29], which achieves the accuracy within <b>fractional</b> <b>portion</b> of chip duration.|$|E
40|$|Aggregate {{planning}} and master scheduling are two important levels of a hierarchical production planning process. They {{serve as the}} front end of production and operations {{planning and}} control systems. It is imperative to have the front end well planned and coordinated. In this study, we demonstrate that a rolling horizon feedback procedure can be an effective coordination mechanism for interfacing aggregate planning and master scheduling. Each time the schedule is rolled ahead, the feedback of performance results from master scheduling provides the aggregate planning subsystem useful information for improving its planning activities. Our experiments show that {{there are at least three}} factors that make a rolling horizon procedure attractive: (i) the use of a horizon with a <b>fractional</b> <b>portion</b> of a seasonal cycle, (ii) high smoothing costs, and (iii) high setup costs. Using rolling horizons reduces the total aggregate costs in these situations relative to not using rolling horizons. The potential impacts of the rolling-horizon strategy are greater under some circumstances than others. ...|$|E
30|$|Bali and Hite (1998) {{predicted}} that a next-day stock price drop (∆P) {{would be less}} than the dividend (D), but greater than equal to the dividend minus one tick. They found that the ratio ΔP/D was significantly less than 1, where prices were constrained to the multiples of the tick. They ran the regression of ΔP on D and observed that the slope coefficient was significantly less than 1 (0.9786), where the intercept was less than zero (− 5.3753). This finding implied that exday prices dropped by less than the amount of dividends. They also regressed ΔP on {{two parts of the}} dividend: the integer tick portion (tick below dividend) and the <b>fractional</b> <b>portion.</b> They observed that the slope coefficient was insignificantly different from 1, the estimated intercept was less than zero (− 2.5208), and the estimated coefficient on discreteness was significantly positive (0.4531). These observations suggested that the expected price drop was about one quarter of a tick, which was below the dividend. The price drop increased by about a half-tick as the dividend approached the next higher tick multiples.|$|E
40|$|An axially {{symmetric}} galactic {{gravitational model}} {{composed of a}} dense, massive and spherical nucleus with an additional dark matter halo component was used, {{to distinguish between the}} regular and chaotic character of orbits of stars that move in the meridional plane (R,z). We investigated two different cases: (i) a flat-disk galaxy (ii) an elliptical galaxy. It is of particular interest to reveal how the portion of the dark matter inside {{the main body of the}} galaxy influences the ordered or chaotic nature of motion. Varying the ratio of dark matter to stellar mass, we monitored the evolution not only of the percentage of chaotic orbits, but also of the percentages of orbits that compose the main regular resonant families, by classifying regular orbits into different families. Moreover we tried, to reveal how the starting position of the parent periodic orbits of each regular family changes with respect to the <b>fractional</b> <b>portion</b> of dark matter. We compared our results with previous similar work. Comment: Published in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A) journal. arXiv admin note: previous paper with related context: arXiv: 1309. 560...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the regular or chaotic nature of orbits of stars {{moving in the}} meridional plane (R, z) of an axially symmetric galactic model with a dense, massive spherical nucleus and a dark matter halo component. In particular, we study {{the influence of the}} <b>fractional</b> <b>portion</b> of the dark matter, by computing in each case the percentage of chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of orbits of the main regular resonant families. In an attempt to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion, we use the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) method to extensive samples of orbits obtained by integrating numerically the equations of motion as well as the variational equations. Furthermore, a technique which is based mainly on the field of spectral dynamics that utilizes the Fourier transform of the time series of each coordinate is used for identifying the various families of regular orbits and also to recognize the secondary resonances that bifurcate from them. Two cases are studied in our work: (i) the case where we have a disk galaxy model (ii) the case where our model represents an elliptical galaxy.
