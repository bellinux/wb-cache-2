25|$|A {{medium is}} the {{substance}} in which meaning is realized and through which it becomes available to others. Mediums include video, image, text, audio, etc. Socially, medium includes semiotic, sociocultural, and technological {{practices such as}} film, newspaper, a billboard, radio, television, theater, a classroom, etc. Multimodality makes use of the <b>electronic</b> <b>medium</b> by creating digital modes with the interlacing of image, writing, layout, speech, and video. Mediums have become modes of delivery that take the current and future contexts into consideration.|$|E
25|$|Paranormal {{claims for}} {{the origin of}} EVP include living humans {{imprinting}} thoughts directly on an <b>electronic</b> <b>medium</b> through psychokinesis and communication by discarnate entities such as spirits, nature energies, beings from other dimensions, or extraterrestrials. Paranormal explanations for EVP generally assume production of EVP by a communicating intelligence through means other than the typical functioning of communication technologies. Natural explanations for reported instances of EVP tend to dispute this assumption explicitly and provide explanations which do not require novel mechanisms that are not based on recognized scientific phenomena.|$|E
25|$|A {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (commonly {{referred to as}} role-playing game or RPG, as well as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls {{the actions of a}} character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games (Including Dungeons & Dragons) and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The <b>electronic</b> <b>medium</b> removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences.|$|E

500|$|In the 1940s, {{radio was}} the <b>electronic</b> <b>medium</b> for family {{entertainment}} and information. In the 1950s, it was television {{that was the}} new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world. By the 1970s, games could be played electronically, then hand-held devices provided mobile entertainment, and by {{the last decade of}} the 20th century, via networked play. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The [...] "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" [...] together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films. One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid obsolescence of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded. One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a Wii console, [...] "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953". Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called [...] "digital revolution" [...] has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up. Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing [...] "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available." [...] Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as [...] "professional engagers" [...] shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.|$|E

Violations of the ordinance are treated as misdemeanors, with fines of up to $500 and up to 90 days imprisonment.

50|$|Media naturalness theory {{builds on}} this {{evolutionary}} handicap conclusion {{to predict that}} {{the degree to which}} an <b>electronic</b> communication <b>medium</b> supports an individual's ability to convey and listen to speech is particularly significant in defining its naturalness. Media naturalness theory predicts, through its speech imperative proposition, that speech enablement influences naturalness significantly more than a medium's degree of support for the use of facial expressions and body language. This prediction is consistent with past research showing that removing speech from an <b>electronic</b> communication <b>medium</b> significantly increases the perceived mental effort associated with using the medium to perform knowledge-intensive tasks. According to this prediction, a medium such as audio conferencing is relatively close to the face-to-face medium in terms of naturalness (see Figure 2).|$|R

The use of <b>electronic</b> <b>mediums</b> to conduct tasks done by floor traders has increased throughout the years, however there are many exchanges in the United States such as the NYSE that prefer to use the open outcry method that involves verbal communication. The benefits of using this system are that traders can read people and results with surprisingly lower error rates in comparison to computers that cannot pick up verbal signals.|$|R

40|$|Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) {{evaluate}} the practical skills of students {{training in the}} health professions. OSCEs have several limitations, including a large administrative burden, potential inaccuracies when transferring student scores from paper to <b>electronic</b> <b>mediums,</b> and difficulties providing individualised student feedback. The “eOSCE,” an electronic version of the traditional paper-based OSCE, potentially addresses these issues. In the eOSCE, examiners use electronic means (e. g. computer, personal digital assistant) to record student scores and comments about their performance, and the system provides students with individualised feedback. The literature from 12 databases was searched to identify articles discussing the use of electronic methods for practical skills assessment, focussing on health professions. Thirteen articles described the evaluation of health students’ practical skills using electronic means.

50|$|Media naturalness theory {{predicts that}} any <b>electronic</b> {{communication}} <b>medium</b> {{allowing for the}} exchange of significantly less or more communicative stimuli per unit of time than the face-to-face medium will pose cognitive obstacles to communication.

Among those effects, the <b>electronic</b> <b>medium</b> increased perceived cognitive effort by approximately 40% and perceived communication ambiguity by approximately 80% - as predicted by media naturalness theory.

40|$|Note: Readers {{who are not}} {{theoretically}} inclined may skip Section III {{without loss}} of continuity. Critics have muddled the public debate over offshore outsourcing by using the term interchangeably to refer to altogether different phenomena such as on-line purchase of services, direct foreign investment and, sometimes, all imports. We argue that clarity requires distinguishing among these various phenomena and define outsourcing explicitly as the services trade at arm's length that does not require geographical proximity of the buyer and the seller—the so-called Mode 1 services in the WTO terminology— conducted principally via the <b>electronic</b> <b>mediums</b> such as the telephone, fax and Internet. The definition is appropriate {{because this is the}} phenomenon that is relatively new and scary in public consciousness and has fueled the recent “outsourcing ” debate. Under this definition, the total number of the U.
