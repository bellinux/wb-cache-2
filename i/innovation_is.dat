5|$|A notable {{innovation}} {{initiated by}} a city or a region {{is the creation}} of mixed public-private enterprises for urban water supply that has begun in 1995 in Cartagena, followed by Barranquilla and other Northern and Central cities and towns. Another <b>innovation</b> <b>is</b> an association of community-based organizations (CBOs) providing water supply in rural and peri-urban areas in the departments of El Valle, Cauca and Risaralda in Southwestern Colombia. It began in the late 1990s {{with the assistance of the}} Universidad del Valle in Cali in order to protect and recover source watersheds and to strengthen the CBOs' capacity to administrate, operate and maintain their water systems.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humanity}} and the Overlords have peaceful relations, some believe human <b>innovation</b> <b>is</b> being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant. One {{of these groups}} establishes New Athens, an island colony {{in the middle of}} the Pacific Ocean devoted to the creative arts, which George and Jean Greggson join. The Overlords conceal a special interest in the Greggsons' children, Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne, and intervene to save Jeffrey's life when a tsunami strikes the island. The Overlords have been watching them since the incident with the Ouija board, which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean.|$|E
5|$|The machine's most {{significant}} <b>innovation</b> <b>is</b> {{generally considered to}} be its incorporation of index registers, commonplace on modern computers. The SSEM had included two registers, implemented as Williams tubes: the accumulator (A) and the program counter (C). As A and C had already been assigned, the tube holding the two index registers, originally known as B-lines, was given the name B. The contents of the registers could be used to modify program instructions, allowing convenient iteration through an array of numbers stored in memory. The Mark 1 also had a fourth tube, (M), to hold the multiplicand and multiplier for a multiplication operation.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{individual}} roles of monetary and productivity shocks in real {{exchange rate fluctuations}} under the current float.

Both transitory and common-trend <b>innovations</b> <b>are</b> found to explain {{a significant portion of}} real exchange rate fluctuations, albeit their relative importance can vary across major currencies. Further analysis suggests that common-trend <b>innovations</b> <b>are</b> ascribed mostly to productivity shocks, whereas transitory <b>innovations</b> <b>are</b> governed by monetary shocks. The allowance for productivity shocks, however, appears insufficient to fully explain the high persistence of real exchange rates.

30|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that {{organizational}} <b>innovations</b> have <b>been</b> found to be important for organizations’ long-term competitive advantages, the creation and diffusion of organizational <b>innovations</b> have <b>been</b> subject to less research focus compared to technical innovations (Edquist 1992; Birkinshaw et al. 2008; Ganter and Hecker 2013). Further, the question of how to sustain an organizational innovation once implemented has received even less research attention, so that there is currently no established research tradition in this area (Buchanan et al. 2005). In order to better understand how organizational <b>innovations</b> <b>are</b> created, diffused, and sustained, this literature review consists of three main parts.

25|$|A recent <b>innovation</b> <b>is</b> the {{silicone}} seal, {{which is}} {{claimed to be}} as supple as latex, more flexible, yet far more durable. These are now available as original equipment on some makes of dry suit. Silicone seals are hypoallergenic, but can not be glued to the suit, and must be attached using clip-on rings. The silicone seals are similar in mechanical strength to latex seals but do not deteriorate as rapidly from oxidation and chemical attack. They are initially relatively expensive, but can be replaced without tools by the user which reduces cost of replacement.|$|E
25|$|Measuring <b>innovation</b> <b>is</b> {{inherently}} {{difficult as}} it implies commensurability so that comparisons {{can be made in}} quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service. Nevertheless, Edison et al. in their review of literature on innovation management found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.|$|E

For example, Bostrom has written extensively on existential risks to humanity's future welfare, including ones that could be created by emerging technologies.|$|E
