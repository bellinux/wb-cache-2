40|$|Friction {{processes}} of rubber <b>on</b> <b>ice,</b> steel <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> and <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> {{have been investigated}} by measuring contact forces in controlled laboratory experiments. A carefully prepared ice plate was rotated at a constant speed and brought into contact with a ring on which torque and normal load was measured. Replicas of {{the different types of}} standardized ice surfaces were studied in microscope. Friction of rubber <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> reached a maximum value at a sliding speed of abt. 100 mm/min. At a temperature of- 10 °C this maximum friction coefficient decreased with increasing ice surface roughness. Friction of steel <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> increased with decreasing speed and no maximum value was obtained. <b>Ice</b> sliding <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> at low speed resulted in high friction forces when sintering took place...|$|R
