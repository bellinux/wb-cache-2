All dimensions are illustrated with selected examples of studies on the professional identity development process. On the basis of theories combined with research outcomes, the following types of learning are distinguished: learning by practising, learning in a critical dialogue, learning as becoming, learning in the societal structure, learning from life history and learning as a dialectical process. All these learning types could be useful in professional learning or professional development, especially the within human services sector, including teaching, social work, career guidance and <b>educational</b> <b>counsellor...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} <b>educational</b> <b>counsellor</b> {{in schools}} has {{undergone}} modification in response to recent changes in social, familial and pupil characteristics. The traditional, one-on-one approach has gradually been replaced with collaborative methods that are more {{in keeping with the}} times, more comprehensive and more proactive. One method of collaborative teaming that has increasingly found its way into schools is consultation. This is an indirect intervention process based on interaction between counsellors (“consultants”) and teachers (“consultees”) where the former provide professional advice, within their fields of specialization, for dealing with specific problems encountered by teachers in their day-to-day work. It is meant to support teachers in dealing with the demanding school environment by primarily working directly with them rather than with pupils and by providing important professional resources and problem-solving skills. My research examined this method from the perspective of teachers in Israeli schools in Nazareth, where the student population and the teachers are Arab. Data were collected using in-depth interviews. Among other things, the results indicated a willingness on the part of teachers to adjust to new methods but pointed to systemic obstacles to effective implementation. 4042143422 Studia Edukacyjn...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} from a study that investigated the effects of providing online counselling for undergraduate students with long‐term health problems. Issues associated with learning at a distance for such students include fatigue, manual dexterity, academic and social isolation, together with a need for better interactive communication with support agencies (Debenham, 1996 a). The results of a feasibility study undertaken in 1996 suggested that for {{students with special needs}} personal rapport with their <b>educational</b> <b>counsellor</b> is considered important for problems to be aired and addressed (Debenham, 1998 a). This raises interesting questions relating to how such rapport can be developed using computer‐mediated communication (CMC). Participants in the study reported appreciation of a small amount of informal contact with the counsellor in a closed peer‐group conference; this conference is described in Debenham (1996 b). Building on this finding, a main study was undertaken which was modified by the addition of a counselling topic ‐ a ‘Virtual Study’ for the counsellor ‐ within this conference area (Debenham, 1998 b). The counsellor was encouraged to participate informally in the other student‐led topics. This added a group dimension to the study. The results are encouraging: increased levels of motivation and enjoyment of the study process were reported by more than three‐quarters of the sample and in the degree of autonomy by more than half the sample. These findings throw light on the support of students with special needs and also {{contribute to the development of}} knowledge in the wider fields of academic advising and the use of CMC in distance education...|$|E
40|$|This work explores {{barriers}} to study encountered by undergraduate distance learners with long-term health problems. It considers {{ways in which}} problems identified in an Exploratory Study might be addressed. These include fatigue, difficulties with handwriting, academic and social isolation, together with a need for better interactive communication with support agencies. The student perspective is explored in depth. The essential finding is that the adoption of an Autonomy approach when using CMC for access to services on a 'Virtual Campus' can have beneficial effects and begin {{to break down the}} {{barriers to}} study that the Exploratory Study identified. Two intervention studies sought to address these problems using a computer conferencing system as the medium of contact with support staff and other students in a 'Virtual Campus' environment. A novel mode of access to educational counselling provision was designed, introducing a group dimension into the process. In addition to one-to-one email, participants could now consult the advisor in a counselling topic within a confidential peer group environment, DOORway. The findings suggest that informal contact with the counsellor in this conference had helped to build rapport and develop confidence for these students to approach her by e-mail when more private advice or help was needed. Given a choice of options, {{at the close of the}} studies more than three quarters of the sample said they would prefer access to a counsellor on-line rather than by traditional routes. The role of the peer group conference is considered to have been pivotal to the reported benefits in a number of ways. Firstly, it provided an empathic on-line community for mutual support. Secondly, it provided an environment in which sensitive questions could be raised with an <b>educational</b> <b>counsellor.</b> Thirdly, it provided a gentle introduction to participation in the wider world of open conferences on a 'Virtual Campus'. The findings suggest that it was the combination of this raft of measures, a holistic package readily available when using CMC in a 'Virtual Campus' environment, that was most effective in addressing the identified barriers to study for this group of students with long-term health problems...|$|E

Con el apoyo económico del departamento MIDE de la UNEDSe presenta el proceso de validación de un instrumento de diagnóstico compuesto por dos elementos: ontología de la orientación psicopedagógica y cuestionario para indagar sobre el modelo común de orientación entre los orientadores educativos de Galicia. En el artículo se muestran las especificaciones técnicas del cuestionario, cuyo índice de consistencia interna es de un Alpha de 0, 947. Mediante análisis factorial, de conglomerados y ecuaciones estructurales se identifican dos modelos, uno teórico y otro empírico. La gran afinidad entre ambos da cuenta de la validez de constructo del instrumento. Las conclusiones y la prospectiva del trabajo constituyen la parte final del artículo. The aim of {{this work}} claims the {{validation}} of an instrument of diagnosis composed by two elements: ontology of the psycho-pedagogical guidance and a questionnaire to investigate {{the existence of a}} common model of psycho-pedagogical guidancee among the <b>educational</b> <b>counsellors</b> of Galicia. The ontology has been elaborated on the basis of 22 bibliographical and 5 legislative sources, whereas the questionnaire has been validated with a sample of 105 <b>educational</b> <b>counsellors</b> of public centers of primary and secondary. Along the article there are studied the technical specifications of the question-naire. The internal reliability level (Cronbach's alpha) was 0, 947. On the other hand, by means of factor analysis and cluster analysis, several factors are established, as well as its relations, which there form two models, the theoretical and different empirical one. Using structural equations there is verified the adjustment of both models for, finally, to establish the degree of similarity (correlation) between them. The above mentioned contrast concludes in the great affinity between the theoretical model and the empirical model, which realizes of its high construct validity. Finally the conclusions appear, the prospective of the work and of the instrument used.

The goal of the thesis is to map the awareness of parents about possible forms of cyber bullying and about the risks associated with the use of modern information technology by their children. The introduction of the theoretical part of the thesis deals with the explanation of basic terms which are associated with the issue of new media, such as: media, new media and cyberspace. Then there is a section which is dedicated to the issue of cyber bullying and its comparison with the traditional bullying. The section deals with forms of cyber bullying and with perpetrators of cyber bullying, and with the forms of prevention, intervention and possible impacts of cyber bullying. The practical part of the thesis contains the description of the used methodology and the description of the research sample. It also includes the results of research and the discussion, which is focused on comparing the results of the research with opinions of experts working in the field of cyber bullying. The strategy of quantitative research, through the questionnaire survey of parents of children and adolescents, was used to verify the hypotheses. The field collection of data was carried out from May 2014 to December 2014. The results of the research show that the parents of children and adolescents are aware of the risks associated with using the modern information technologies. The research proved that the parents know about the forms of cyber bullying as well as about the risks associated with cyber bullying and that they have awareness of what materials are published on social networks by their children. Results of the thesis can be offered to the managements of elementary schools in Písek District.

40|$|A major {{criterion}} for evaluating a society {{is how it}} treats its citizens with special needs [...] especially children. Since 1988 all mainstream schools in Israel are obligated by law to include {{children with special needs}} and provide them with all the aid they are entitled to [...] within a mainstream environment. All the involved bodies (governmental, educational, municipal, legal, parental, etc.) have sought the best way to this. Stemming from human rights- it was obvious that this law was right [...] but in the absence of field experience, most conclusions have been the result of trial and error inside the classrooms. The need for research in inclusion practice is therefore vital. The purposes of this study were: 1. To analyze the legal requirements published by the Ministry of Education for mainstream schools. 2. To determine whether and how the law is implemented differently in different mainstream middle schools in one city. 3. To determine possible reasons for such differences, relating to the two variables already known to influence inclusiveness of schools: leadership style of the headteacher and the organizational culture of the school. The study was two-phased: in the survey phase, questionnaires were given to the <b>educational</b> <b>counsellors</b> of all 15 middle schools in the city, examining the different aspects of "shiluv" (Hebrew word for 'inclusion'). The three schools found to be most different from each other in implementing the policy went into the second case study phase. Here in-depth semi structured and specialized interviews were conducted with different role holders in the same school in order to determine why some schools manage to implement inclusion better than others? Differences were found between the 15 schools in the city in the four investigated aspects of "shiluv". The key for the differences was found to be the professionalism of all of the teaching staff: a broad knowledge, an ability to translate the aims of the school to daily work, and to conceptualize educational dilemmas. The main conclusion of this thesis is that such professionalism was shown to result from the organizational culture of the school, as a consequence of strategic management that stresses an 'integrative' type of organizational culture. ...|$|R
40|$|Even in preschools we {{can find}} {{inappropriate}} conduct adults uses when educating {{and taking care of}} children. Although our educational work is based on a child and should be placed {{high on the list of}} our priorities, it is true that the power of our subjective theories is reflected through a hidden curriculum. Since we are aware of the problems inappropriate conduct brings to preschools, the introduction part emphasizes some concepts which can aid in understanding this problem, whereas the following parts deal with occurence of various types of violence in Slovenian public preschools. In other words, attention is given to the conduct which is in today's social context unacceptable. We wanted to find out whether preschool teachers are aware of violence against children and maybe even take part in it. The descriptive method was used in the research and the qualitative research as the research approach where some examples were added in order to get diverse information. The research interview was used as a technique to gather information because the theme of the research is very sensitive, unpleasant and still a taboo. Our decision was to use a systematic approach of sampling – an occasional sample. We wanted to get different opinions so our sample included professional, <b>educational</b> <b>counsellors</b> and managers from various Slovenian public preschools. The analysis of the examples dealt with shows that inappropriate conduct in preschools is present, some preschools teachers use different types of violence, psychic violence is more often than physical one which is noticed as well. The victims are children of the first and second age categories as well as children with special needs in development sections of preschools. There are rare occasions when colleagues report inappropriate conduct they experience at work. They often face various hesistations and the report is often followed by an unsuitable response or the case discussion. On the basis of findings of this as well as the previous researches, published in local and foreign educational area, the final part gives the proposal of a prevention and violence treatment model of a preschool. At the same time the analysis serves as a starting point for deliberation, discussion, formation of guidelines and team work at implementation of proper strategies of disciplinary methods in practice...|$|R

40|$|M. Ed. The {{society we}} live in is ever-changing. The youth have to orientate and direct {{themselves}} {{in the face of}} these changes. It appears that schools and school career counselling do not adequately equip the learner for the transition from school to the work environment. This and the shortage of opportunities cause feelings of uncertainty and hopelessness about the future. The <b>educational</b> psychologist career <b>counsellor,</b> with the task of guiding learners in making career choices, is also influenced by the changes in society and the work environment. This study is an exploration of the changing world of work in order to define the demands made on the <b>educational</b> psychologist career <b>counsellor.</b> The information explosion and the consequent development of information technology, globalisation and the liberalisation of society, cause significant changes in the world of work. The industrial world of work is now characterised by several changes, additions and adjustments. The move towards a changing world of work implies that workers have to change their conception that organisations ensure security and long-term positions. Work is no longer perceived as permanent and standardised. The world of work can't be seen as stable, constant and predictable any more. It should rather be viewed as entrepreneurial, competitive, urgent, fragmented, diverse, unpredictable and short-term-directed. Even the concepts work and career have undergone a change in meaning. The changing conception of work demands more from workers than that of the industrial conception. It becomes increasingly difficult for workers to establish an individual identity. The workers' self-worth can no longer be measured according to a specific job or a specific position within the hierarchy of an organisation. The demands on the workers' personal, interpersonal and career management skills are also increasing. These demands require that workers be directed towards life-long learning and training. A critical evaluation of the exclusive use of the trait-factor approach to career counselling in the changing world of work proves that it is no longer deemed an adequate approach for the responsible career counsellor. This requires that educational psychologists have to make changes in their approach to career counselling. Guidelines for the move from vocational guidance towards a facilitative career counselling approach are presented. This implies a move from an industrial conception of work towards a changed conception of work; from objectivity towards perspectivity; from experts towards co-workers; from work identity towards a more complex identity; from fitting towards empowerment and from individual interventions towards group interventions. The task of the <b>educational</b> psychologist career <b>counsellor</b> thus becomes more comprehensive and demanding...|$|R

The study further aimed at finding out how their vocational aspirations are influenced. An exploratory case study design was used and it comprised of two sub studies. Sub study 1 was quantitative in nature and it constituted of a survey. Questionnaires were used in the survey to collect information from the participants. Sub study 2 was qualitative in nature and it employed individual interviews. A purposively selected sample was drawn from five schools across four provinces of Kenya. Altogether a total of 79 male and female learners with visual impairments participated in the survey. 12 learners with visual impairments were purposively selected for individual interviews. The interviewees were also drawn from the five schools across the four provinces. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics; frequencies and percentages. Qualitative data was analysed in terms of categories and subcategories. Some variation was noted based on gender and degree of vision among the participants. Findings of the study indicate that learners with visual impairments have relatively high educational and vocational aspirations. Many aspire for higher education and high status professional jobs. Their aspirations are influenced by individual as well as environmental factors. Individual factors include, gender, impairment and personal motivation, inter alia. Environmental factors include expectations from significant others and other external factors. Based on the findings recommendations were made for the benefit of vocational counselling needs of the population studied.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the influence of single-parenting on the psychological well-being and academic performance of adolescents in Lagos, Nigeria. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the growing phenomenon of single parenting and its impact on the psychological and academic well-being of adolescents. A sample of 100 participants randomly selected from 5 secondary schools was used. Questionnaire and achievement test were employed to generate data for the study. Two research hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. The hypotheses were tested using descriptive statistical technique and t-test. The study revealed that children appeared to profit psychologically and academically when both parents provide aspects of an orderly and nurturing home life. Teachers, <b>counsellors,</b> <b>educational</b> psychologist and administrators need to have knowledge of those factors that affect children from single parent homes to better understand the behaviours and attitudes of the children they are teaching. While many children in single parent homes grow up into successful, mature adults, many children being raised in single parent homes may not reach their full potential due to inadequate family resources. School personnel also need to provide support to the mother or father who is parenting solo. Having a teacher, counsellor or psychologist to consult and collaborate with, can be an immeasurable help in raising well-adjusted and successful children...|$|R
40|$|PART I Programs for Teacher {{training}} Authors from Slovakia {{underline the}} commonness between school and society, claiming how cultural changes and {{new way of}} life has great impact upon the school system. Accordingly we may agree with the Slovakian author Wiegerowa saying that “The transformation of school system is becoming inseparable part of our life”. Pressure of changes in school in general attract {{the role of the}} teachers, from teacher of subjects to development of teacher´s personality, teachers of subjects to teachers who have the will to non-directive, democratic ways of Education, willingness to heuristic problem solving and willingness to flexible educational and training practice. One should note well the Slovakian Sirotova and Smetanova who highlight the role of the teacher as follows: “One of the teacher´s task is to create specific conditions that enable students to acquire long-lasting values (in italic by editors) rather than a large amount of information that may quickly be forgotten (…) ”. One should give great attention to the conception of “long-lasting values”! Obvious – there {{is not a matter of}} values only, accordingly the articles touches what kind of values as well. PART II ICT in use in Educational contexts Four authors from Poland and one from Norway give focus on pupils in pre-school and primary school using ICT. A common perspective is quality in advance of quantity, i. e. the conception of learning and the focus on the process from indefinite sources of information to relevant knowledge. E. Perzycka (Poland) discusses the Computer in use in multimedia education, the computer as a didactic “tool”. She balances the perspective, underlines the positive effect, however making a critical point of view on computer in use. D. Siemieniecki (Poland) introduces a practical based, so-called “example program” for a computer aided lesson for early schooler creative development. Though she presents separate school subjects, she thinks across subject with the creativity as glue. D. Moranska (Poland) focuses how ICT can form childrens motivation and disposition for self-development to improve knowledge-based competence. Her perspective reminds us about the Norwegian motto “responsibility for own learning”, a perspective that gives young users feeling of active participation in their educational process. R. Raska (Poland) introduces a natural pedagogical experiment which was to show an innovative, didactic situation and change in arithmetic knowledge and skills learnt by 1 st grade elementary students using computer. In this context she puts into our mind the concept “constructivism” – “the most significant educational trend nowadays”, she says. H. Nilsen (Norway) gives attention to the new form of exam in Norwegian compulsory school, using ICT to (eventually) receive better marks. In particular he focuses on the heavy process to navigate from a multimodal flood of information to useful, relevant knowledge (“navigating competence”). Part III Educational issues in general A. Watola (Poland) presents – as a background – the relevance of school readiness, and how one can diagnose this precondition for doing well in school. The main part of the article presents Watolas own study in the field of readiness. Readers are encouraged to reflect on the relative notion of readiness, asking for readiness in relation to what? M. Kisiel (Poland) discusses in short form, however very interesting, the term motivation in the educational area, and she raises question among three grade students (9 year old) what is their preferences with respect to music activities and their motivations for studying music in school. A. Stachura presents an experimental research (small scale form) focusing how divergent tasks of maths extends pupils´ divergent (flexible, added by editor) thinking ability. And, the author refers from his study, “even fluence and flexibility of thinking was improved during the experiment”. How should the school take care of pupils with special educational needs, is the question articulated of three academics from Slovakia; G. Porubska, D. Mala and V. Gatial. This question is all over of relevance, and highlighted, we may remind, in the new Norwegian school document Knowledge Promotion 2006. The article lists the most common learning disorders, concentration disorders, speech disorders, low intelligence, and sketch out relief effort recommended by psychologists and <b>educational</b> <b>counsellors.</b> At last from editors: The articles do not go in depth of research, do not represent basic research. However, we suggest, the articles reveal interesting thinking, in basis (we may claim) cross-cultural thinking as we note three European countries are represented. So – dear readers – of interest in this volume of Fredrikke should be to get a brief, brief look into the sphere of individual thinking; 13 different authors, 13 different interests, 13 different brains with a common fram of reference – school, school equipments, learning, students welfare, students preparation to cope with school challenges and with the real life...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{there is}} some {{international}} research regarding multidisciplinary collaboration {{as a means to}} identify and meet the needs of gifted learners with multiple exceptionalities, there is little New Zealand based information, much less research, on this practice. This multiple case study research explored how gifted learners with multiple exceptionalities are supported in New Zealand by interprofessional (IPP) teams of teachers, special needs coordinators, gifted and talented coordinators, <b>educational</b> psychologists, school <b>counsellors,</b> resource teachers and others. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore experiences and understandings around how IPP teams work against core competencies of interprofessional practice. These are shared values, roles and responsibilities, communication, and teamwork. Key findings of this study were that the interprofessional practice team identity is still in its infancy, with core competencies not fully developed. Whilst there were shared values and a willingness towards recognising inclusive practices for gifted learners with multiple exceptionalities, these shared values were hampered by limited knowledge and expertise across the IPP team. Limited understandings of teamwork processes, and limited recognition of the importance of communication within the IPP team were common themes. Parents were seldom considered, and students were never considered part of the IPP team, which by its very name excludes parent and student voice. Whilst not evaluative, these findings show that gifted learners with multiple exceptionalities in New Zealand may not have adequate support at a systems level. Recommendations include the development of interprofessional practice competencies as one way to ensure gifted learners with multiple exceptionalities and their whanau experience full inclusion in our education system, and more research to evaluate whether effective IPP teams translate to more positive student outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{dynamics}} of the triadic therapeutic relationship between interpreters, counsellors and non-English speaking clients in a triangular research design. It comprises three parts: In part one, two focus groups were held with a group of interpreters and of counsellors to explore common issues and general concerns that were pertinent to the relevant fields. In part two, twenty-nine semi-structured individual interviews were carried out with another group of interpreters and counsellors with the aim of exploring the issues that arose in the focus groups. In part three, a group of clients were interviewed to explore their experiences of receiving emotional help through interpreters. Participants were recruited through interpreting agencies and counselling organisations. The data was analysed, using Thematic Analysis. The overarching themes show that all the participants wanted to trust each other and expected to be trusted by the others. Confidentiality came out as a common concern across the data sets. Translation and language issues, cultural matters and organisational restraints were found to be barriers to establishing a working alliance. All participants expected practitioners, including language interpreters, to have relevant knowledge, awareness of their own strength and weaknesses, to be critical and flexible, and to demonstrate certain personal qualities. Overall, the participants were apprehensive about the triadic therapeutic process which they found to be emotional and full of surprises. They also found the process helpful and rewarding. The findings of this triangulated research suggest that mental health interventions and relevant <b>educational</b> programmes for <b>counsellors</b> and interpreters should address the complex needs of a multicultural client group and include an understanding of three-dimensional relationships...|$|R
