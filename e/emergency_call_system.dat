30|$|Automatic <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> <b>systems</b> aim to {{decrease}} road fatalities and injuries {{and to improve}} incident management. Specifically, these systems are designed to detect collisions, dial the emergency response centre, and transmit information such as vehicle position and type and severity of accident. In addition, many systems open a voice connection between the vehicle occupants and the emergency response centre and allow manual dialling.|$|R
30|$|Reinhardt et al. [20] found that, in 70 % of road accidents, the <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> {{was made}} by {{somebody}} {{not involved in the}} accident. When this is the case, substantial delays may be caused, especially on roads with sparse traffic (see also [5, 9]). Moreover, Evanco [9] reported that, in the U.S. in 1990, the notification time covered 46 % of the total time from accident occurrence to the arrival of emergency personnel. This finding suggests {{that there is a lot}} of room for improvement in <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> <b>systems,</b> although the fact that cell-phone density is currently much higher in many countries than in the 1990 s may already have shortened the notification time.|$|R

40|$|A SIP-based {{architecture}} for <b>emergency</b> <b>calling</b> and notification <b>systems</b> {{could increase}} speed, scalability, and functionality in communication services. During emergencies, service agencies rely on telecommunications to achieve quick response times and minimize {{loss of life}} and property. The existing public and government-based telephone systems provide three essential communication services: an <b>emergency</b> <b>calling</b> <b>system,</b> which the public uses to report problems and ask for help; emergency communications, which allow for crisis communications within agencies and between agencies and the public; and emergency alerting, which provides a channel for government agencies to notify the public when disasters occur. As we transition to a packet-switched infrastructure, we must reconsider how to provide these services. Internet-based communications offer new challenges, as old assumptions about trust, operation, and terminal location no longer hold. However, IPbased emergency services will also offer expanded services, more resilient networks, and faster response times. About half a dozen companies are offering commercial voice-over-IP services at this time, for both commercial and residential customers. It appears likely that the transition to an all-IP phone service will be slow, as depreciation intervals for switches are measured in decades. However, third-generation wireless systems (3 G) are scheduled to offer packet voice services by 2005, adding possibly {{hundreds of millions of}} such devices to the network. As the “Emergency Communications” sidebar describes, the existing Internet architecture must be modified in two areas to support coordinated communication services. Here, however, our primary focus is on <b>emergency</b> <b>calling</b> and notification. In this article, we describe the components of the existing <b>emergency</b> <b>calling</b> and notification <b>systems</b> and our proposed IPbased architectures, 1 each of which uses the session initiation protocol (SIP) as the signaling framework. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1878, Holmes {{became the}} {{president}} of the newly established Bell Phone Company. While he sold his interests two years later for US$100,000, he kept his rights to use the company phone lines for his alarm system. The use of electricity for street lights in 1880 changed the market, as people started accepting electrical models. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the Holmes Burglar business in 1905, linking it to <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> <b>systems</b> for contacting police and fire fighting personnel. After World War II, many inventions were introduced into the business of home alarm systems. It became less expensive and more versatile for use in the 1980s and {{by the middle of the}} 1990s the system had become a standard feature.

40|$|An {{accident}} is a {{deviation from}} expected behavior of event that adversely affects the property, living body or persons and the environment. Security in vehicle to vehicle communication or travelling is primary concern for everyone. The work {{presented in this}} article documents the designing of an accident detection system. The accident detection system design informs the police control room or any other <b>emergency</b> <b>calling</b> <b>system</b> about the accident. An accelerometer sensor has been used to detect abrupt change in g-forces in the vehicle due to accident.

40|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> <b>systems</b> in the United States and {{elsewhere}} are undergoing {{a transition from}} the PSTN-based legacy system to a new IP-based system. The new system {{is referred to as}} the Next Generation 9 - 1 - 1 (NG 9 - 1 - 1) or NG 112 system. We have built a prototype NG 9 - 1 - 1 system which features media convergence and data integration that are unavailable in the current <b>emergency</b> <b>calling</b> <b>system.</b> The most important piece of information in the NG 9 - 1 - 1 system is the caller's location. The caller's location is used for routing the call to the appropriate <b>call</b> center. The <b>emergency</b> responders use the caller's location to find the caller. Therefore, it is essential to determine the caller's location as precisely as possible to minimize delays in emergency response. Delays in response may result in loss of lives. When a person makes an <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> outdoors using a mobile phone, the Global Positioning System (GPS) can provide the caller's location accurately. Indoor positioning, however, presents a challenge. GPS does not generally work indoors because satellite signals do not penetrate most buildings. Moreover, there is an important difference between determining location outdoors and indoors. Unlike outdoors, vertical accuracy is very important in indoor positioning because an error of few meters will send emergency responders to a different floor in a building, which may cause a significant delay in reaching the caller. This thesis presents a way to augment our NG 9 - 1 - 1 prototype system with a new indoor positioning system. The indoor positioning system focuses on improving the accuracy of vertical location. Our goal is to provide floor-level accuracy with minimum infrastructure support. Our approach is to use a user's smartphone to trace her vertical movement inside buildings. We utilize multiple sensors available in today's smartphones to enhance positioning accuracy. This thesis makes three contributions. First, we present a hybrid architecture for floor localization with <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> in mind. The architecture combines beacon-based infrastructure and sensor-based dead reckoning, striking a balance between accurately determining a user's location and minimizing the required infrastructure. Second, we present the elevator module for tracking a user's movement in an elevator. The elevator module addresses three core challenges that make it difficult to accurately derive displacement from acceleration. Third, we present the stairway module which determines the number of floors a user has traveled on foot. Unlike previous systems that track users' foot steps, our stairway module uses a novel landing counting technique. Additionally, this thesis presents our work on designing and implementing an NG 9 - 1 - 1 prototype system. We first demonstrate how <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> from various call origination devices are identified, routed to the proper Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the caller's location, and terminated by the call taker software at the PSAP. We then show how text communications such as Instant Messaging and Short Message Service can be integrated into the NG 9 - 1 - 1 architecture. We also present GeoPS-PD, a polygon simplification algorithm designed to improve the performance of location-based routing. GeoPS-PD reduces the size of a polygon, which represents the service boundary of a PSAP in the NG 9 - 1 - 1 system...|$|R

While several hospital nurse <b>call</b> <b>system</b> {{have already been}} developed in the market, we found {{that most of them}} suffer from speed and cost issues.
