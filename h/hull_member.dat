50|$|After {{a failed}} attempt in 1964, the Southeast Convention, {{by a vote}} of only 54 percent, agreed to receive churches from the Congregational Christian (UCC) Convention of the South (African-American) and the southernmost congregations of the South Indiana Evangelical and Reformed Synod (the main portion of which became the Indiana-Kentucky Conference, UCC). This {{occurred}} at the Convention's annual meeting on April 24, 1965 at Central Congregational Church, Atlanta. The agreement brought the conference officially into being on January 1, 1966. On April 23 of that year, meeting at First Evangelical and Reformed (now United) Church, Nashville, annual meeting delegates adopted a constitution, consummating the process. The first officers of the new conference were the Rev. Frederick A. Meyer, pastor, Central Church, Atlanta, moderator; Mr. J. Hubert Richter, member, St. John's (Evangelical Protestant) UCC, Cullman, Alabama, vice-moderator; Miss Ellen <b>Hull,</b> <b>member,</b> Langdale Congregational Christian Church, Valley, Alabama, recording secretary; Mr. Leslie Beall, member, Central Church, Atlanta, treasurer (the Cullman and Langdale churches in Alabama are no longer affiliated with the UCC). The board of directors consisted of association representatives and chairpeople of commissions elected at large; initially, the conference consisted of nine associations, but that number dropped to six by the early 1970s due to several of them merging.|$|E
50|$|A trampoline, {{when used}} {{in the context of}} a sailboat, is a very high {{strength}} material under high tension woven together in strips to provide flat areas in between <b>hull</b> <b>members</b> on Catamarans or Trimarans. This results in a lightweight decking that allows water to pass through, as holes are intentionally left in the weave for this purpose. Most trampolines also serve as tension components of the sailboat superstructure along with the rest of the rigging.|$|R

40|$|Catamaran is a dual hull ship {{which has}} many {{advantages}} then the mono hull ship. Some {{of the advantages}} are excellent stability, Cruise in shallow water, large wide deck areas, large load carrying capacity, faster and Motion comfort etc. In this paper work, design of main or strength deck and <b>hull</b> structural <b>member</b> calculations for Catamaran ship used for transport for the crane (Mantis ® 10010 mx 46 ton tele-boom crawler crane) to its place of work. Ship’s main deck or Strength deck hull structural scantlings or calculations play a very vital role in carrying the deck loads such as crane load safely against the external pressures which are acting on the deck. This can done by designing the suitable deck and hull plate thickness, and its strengthening stiffening. The design of main deck involves determination of scantlings of deck plate, deck plate stiffeners, girders and pillars against the wheel load. Scantlings of deck plates, stiffeners and girders to meet the local strength requirements are to be determined {{in accordance with the}} general principles of the rules. Scantlings of <b>hull</b> <b>members</b> should contribute the longitudinal strength of the ship and to be subjected to compressive stresses. The design calculations are carried out according to Indian Register of shipping (IRS) Rules and Regulations, Construction & Classification of steel ships Feb 2008.

50|$|In 1901 <b>Hull</b> YC <b>member</b> Thomas Lawson single-handedly set out {{to revive}} Boston’s {{participation}} in the America's Cup by funding {{the building of the}} defender Independence. Lawson hired B.B. Crowninshield, a well-known Boston designer of small boats. Crowninshield had been successful in designing some of the fastest small boats on the east coast. His specialty was scow designs. It was his first attempt at building a vessel of this magnitude. Independence was a radical design with a flat scow-like hull and a balanced rudder typically used in small boats. The length was 140’ 10”, draft 20’ and a beam of 24’. The builder was George Lawley of East Boston. The vessel was launched in May 1901.|$|R

5000|$|Dr. Watson narrates a {{heretofore}} unreleased case {{in which}} he and Holmes are called by Inspector Lestrade on an unexpectedly rainy day to investigate {{the murder of the}} sadistic Lord <b>Hull.</b> Each <b>member</b> of <b>Hull's</b> family - his wife and three sons - has reason to murder him; his wife and bowlegged son suffered from constant abuse, while another son was doomed to never receive more than a pittance, due to his placement in the family line. Furthermore, Hull's family endured his treatment in the hopes that he would leave them with his considerable wealth; however, they had recently learned that Hull had rewritten his will so that none of them received a thing. Despite these motives, the family have effectively given each other alibis and the murder itself is effectively a locked room mystery; there's no place in Hull's study for anyone to hide without being seen, and all the doors and windows were locked by the lord himself.|$|R
