25|$|The Sims Bustin' Out is {{the second}} title in The Sims console series. Bustin' Out was {{released}} for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and N-Gage {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2003. As the title suggests, Sims can <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game. It was the second Sims game to not be on the PC; it was a follow up to The Sims, which was very similar to Bustin' Out, except the aims were shifted to getting job promotions and constantly fulfilling goals to get ahead in the game. The PlayStation 2 version also features the option to play online, though EA no longer supports it.|$|E
500|$|After {{her second}} album, Jackson {{terminated}} business affairs with her family, commenting [...] "I {{just wanted to}} <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> {{get out from under}} my father, {{which was one of the}} most difficult things that I had to do." [...] Attempting a third album, Jackson teamed with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They set out to achieve crossover pop appeal, while also creating a strong foundation within the urban market. Within six weeks, Jackson and the duo crafted her third studio album, Control, released in February 1986. The album peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over ten million copies worldwide.|$|E

By 1922, the Fitzgeralds had employed a nurse for their daughter, a couple to clean their house, and a laundress. When Harper & Brothers asked her to contribute to Favorite Recipes of Famous Women she wrote, [...] "See {{if there is any}} bacon, and if there is, ask the cook which pan to fry it in. Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily. Also, in the case of bacon, do not turn the fire too high, or you will have to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> for a week. Serve preferably on china plates, though gold or wood will do if handy." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{subsequently}} fired {{her father}} as her manager and hired John McClain, then A Records' {{senior vice president}} of artists and repertoire and general manager. She also subsequently left the Jackson home in Encino, California and moved into her own apartment around this time.

[...] Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter's career out from under him.

[...] He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting and production duo James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris III and Terry Lewis, former Prince associates and ex-members of The Time.|$|E

500|$|Spoonheim was {{originally}} from Rudyard, Montana, where her family owned an auto supply store. [...] She began {{playing the piano}} at age five, when her mother would drive her on an [...] round [...] trip to Havre to take classical piano lessons. [...] By the age of 12, she was playing with adults in a dance band, earning $10 per night. She began singing as well as playing the piano during a {{time in her life}} when she lived in Billings, Montana. She was a 28-year-old divorced single mother of three when she started working as the Sip 'n Dip's piano player in 1963, taking the position as a second job in order to support her children. [...] She simultaneously worked as a medical transcriptionist for 38 years before retiring from her day job in 2000. [...] She celebrated 50 years of employment at the Sip 'n Dip in December 2013 and at that time she was featured on CBS Sunday Morning.

2500|$|Before closing arguments, Judge Perry {{ruled that}} the defense could argue that a {{drowning}} occurred due to reasonable conclusions aided by witness testimony, but that arguing sexual abuse was not allowed since {{there was nothing to}} support the claim that George Anthony sexually abused Casey Anthony. Baez began by contending that there were holes in the prosecution's forensic evidence, saying it was based on a [...] "fantasy". He told the jury that the prosecution wanted them to see stains and insects that did not really exist, that they had not proven that the stains in Anthony's car trunk were caused by Caylee's decomposing body, rather than from a trash bag found there. He added that the prosecutors tried to make his client look like a promiscuous liar because their evidence was weak. He said the drowning is [...] "the only explanation that makes sense" [...] and showed jurors a photograph of Caylee opening the home's sliding glass door by herself. He stressed that there were no child safety locks in the home and that both of Casey Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, testified that Caylee could <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> easily. Although Cindy Anthony testified that Caylee could not put the ladder {{on the side of the}} pool and climb up, Baez alleged that Cindy Anthony may have left the ladder up the night before. [...] "She didn't admit to doing so in testimony", he said, [...] "but how much guilt would she have knowing it was her that left the ladder up that day?" ...|$|E
