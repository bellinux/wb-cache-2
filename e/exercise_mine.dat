5000|$|The name {{is derived}} from dummen, i.e. [...] "unfruitful" [...] and Kuhle, an old German word for [...] "pit". In 1929, {{district}} judge (Amtsgerichtsrat) Walther Grosse, alternatively suggested that the name gave a clue that the Halberstadt chapter (Domstift) had once <b>exercised</b> <b>mining</b> jurisdiction (Bergrechte) here. This can be confirmed, because the bishop and the cathedral chapter (Domkapitel) of Halberstadt actually appeared in the Middle Ages as the most senior mining and liege lords of Hasserode. From 1343, the liege men were the counts of Wernigerode and so the first record of this pit, as the Dhumkuhlenbergk na den Huppeln, is found in an undated deed by Count Henry of Wernigerode who died in 1429 ...|$|R

Returning on 27 November, she continued operations out of New London ranging from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Havana, Cuba, as she trained prospective submarine personnel and laid <b>exercise</b> <b>mine</b> fields. In 1955, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 6 at Norfolk, Virginia. There, her duties included services to aircraft and surface ships to help them hone their skills in antisubmarine warfare. She made frequent Caribbean voyages and participated in Operation [...] "Springboard."

40|$|Small {{drifting}} objects {{can be a}} big {{threat to}} surface ships, especially when the objects are explosion hazards like sea mines that have become detached from their moorings. Timely detection of such objects is crucial {{in order to be able}} to perform adequate evasive manoeuvres. However, the vertical position of drifting mines is a serious challenge for detection with both above- and underwater sensors, as the surface objects are usually only partly above and under water, and surface effects such as wave occlusion and scattering apply to both sides. On the other hand, above- and underwater sensors may complement each other as poor detection from above may imply good detection from below, and vice versa. This paper reports on sea trial results for the detection of drifting sea mines using a prototype surface-scanning infrared lidar from above and operational mine-hunting sonar systems from below. For the sonar experiments, both a forwardlooking hull-mounted sonar and an upward-looking self-propelled variable-depth sonar have been applied. Spherical <b>exercise</b> <b>mines</b> were used as mine-like objects, painted in a realistic warshot colour for the optical test...|$|R

5000|$|Until 1869, the Mining Office was {{responsible}} for the economic and technical management of all <b>mines,</b> <b>exercising</b> the royal <b>mining</b> rights (Bergregal) as part of the [...] "divisional concept" [...] with the aim of maximising profit for the Saxon electors and kings. It was accompanied by the creation of a geological service (later the Department of State Geognostic Research). Again and again, the Saxon Mining Office and its senior mining officials led the way to important scientific developments. For example, in 1713, Oberberghauptmann, Hans Carl von Carlowitz introduced the concept of sustainability. A few decades later Oberberghauptmann Friedrich Wilhelm von Oppel and Generalbergkommissar Friedrich Anton von Heynitz were instrumental in founding the Freiberg Mining Academy.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{effects of}} alternating exercise vs. acclamation training an {{mean blood pressure}} (BP, Finapres), cardiac output (CO, BoMed) and peripheral resistance (PR, calculated) were evaluated. Six healthy men (33 ±(SD) 6 yr. 178 ± 4 cm, 86 ± 6 kg) underwent exercise training (ET, n= 3) : supine on a cycle ergometer (40 to 90 % Vo_ 2 max) during exposure to constant+ 1 G_z for ∼ 30 min/day for 14 days on NASA's 1. 9 m Human Powered Centrifuge (HPC). They also underwent oscillatory (between + 1 G zand∼ 2. 5 G_z) acceleration training (AT, n= 3) for ∼ 30 min/day for 14 days on the HPC. After four weeks of ambulatory deconditioning, training protocols were switched. AT increased resting CO by 9. MpmS(SE) 3. 2 % (pless than 0. 05) with no effect on BF, and ET decreased BP by 9. 2 ± 4. 6 % (pless than 0. 08) as well as spectral power of PR by 41 ± 9 % (pless than 0. 05). The major effect of acceleration training was to increase resting cardiac output while that of <b>exercise</b> <b>mining</b> was to decrease resting blood pressure...|$|R

50|$|New {{plans were}} {{developed}} in 1751 and major works began in 1753 and lasted until 1776. When these works were under way, engineer Major Albrecht Heinrich Schroeder proposed a branched system of anti-mine tunnels to the High Military Council in early 1764. In March {{of the same year}} the plan was approved, but their construction was delayed for a number of years. During his visit to the Petrovaradin Fortress in May, 1768, Emperor Joseph II observed a military <b>exercise</b> with <b>mine</b> equipment carried out in his honor. The construction of this system of tunnels, having four levels, was completed in 1776 and the total length of the system was 16 km.|$|R
