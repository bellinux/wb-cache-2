30|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the optimal {{consumption}} and portfolio decision with a quadratic utility {{in the presence}} of inflation risk. For a hedging instrument for inflation risk, we introduce an <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond which is directly linked to the price process. Depending on market parameters, the investment in the risk asset and in the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond exhibit quite different patterns. For the life-time financial planning, the inflation risk is easily ignored but it may frustrate an agent which consumes and invests optimally. Therefore, it is worthwhile to look into how an agent manages the inflation risk {{in the presence of}} an <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond through lifetime utility maximization with a quadratic utility function.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{explicit}} expressions for consumption and portfolio rules {{by applying the}} duality approach. Due to the optimal consumption process, we have to separate the wealth into three regions as in Koo et al. [5] and Rho et al. [8]. In the third region, where the wealth level is above the bliss level, the optimal consumption stays constant as its maximum so the value function is also fixed. To make the value function constant, {{there should be no}} risky asset investment. This fact is well-described in Koo et al. [5] and Rho et al. [8]. In the presence of inflation risk, however, even though the value function in the third region is still constant, the optimal investment in an <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond is not fixed. To hedge the inflation risk, all the financial wealth is invested in an <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond and investment in other assets becomes zero in the third region. When the wealth level is below the bliss level, the role of <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond can be different according to market parameters. In particular, for sufficiently large growth rate of the price process, the demand for speculative motive is reflected only on the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond. For a small growth rate of the price process, however, the demand for speculative motive is distributed into both portfolios of <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond and the risky asset.|$|R
30|$|Now we can {{describe}} the optimal portfolios in more details. In region 1, {{the investment in}} the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond consists of two components, which are the demand for hedging inflation risk and an additional investment which is proportion to the total capital. Since n_-< 0, the additional investment is positive if θ_ 2 > 0, which implies the speculative or myopic demand due to the excess return on the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond. Moreover, {{under the condition that}} θ_ 1 -ρθ_ 2 /√(1 -ρ^ 2)> 0, the investment in risky asset also represents myopic demand which is proportion to the total capital. We can verify that the total myopic demand in the risky asset and <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond is borrowed from the bank account.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{considers}} a portfolio selection {{problem with a}} quadratic utility of consumption, which is symmetric {{with respect to a}} bliss point. At bliss point, the utility function has its maximum value and further consumption lowers the utility. In the presence of inflation risk, we introduce an <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond to manage the inflation risk and derive explicit expressions for the optimal consumption and portfolios by applying duality method. Based on quantitative results, we see that <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond {{plays an important role in}} choosing consumption and portfolio rules.|$|R
30|$|In region 3, the {{investment}} in the risky asset and bank account becomes zero and all the financial wealth is invested in the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond. This is a quite different result from the case {{with other types of}} utility function such as CRRA or CARA. Since the quadratic utility has a bliss point and the value function is flat for wealth levels that are larger than bliss level of wealth, there should be no speculative motive, and thus, there is no myopic demand in asset allocation. In particular, we have the myopic demand in both the risky asset and the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond as explained before. They converge to zero in region 3. Moreover, the hedging demand for not falling into the region 1, which is the last term of the portfolio (5.3) in region  2, also converges to zero in region 3. This is because the financial wealth is large enough. Recall that in region 2, except for the inflation risk hedging demand, all the myopic and hedging demand is borrowed from the bank account. Thus, {{the investment}} in the bank account, π_ 0,tX_t, should be also zero and, as a result, an inflation-risk hedging demand exists only in region 3. To sum up, in the presence of inflation risk and the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond, there exists no demand in the risky asset or in the bank account. Instead, only inflation risk hedging demand remains. Neither myopic demand nor other hedging demand is necessary.|$|R
30|$|This {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. In Sect.  2, we provide the financial {{market in the}} presence of inflation risk. We introduce an <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond to hedge the inflation risk. In Sect.  3, we state the optimization problem with a quadratic utility function and seek to derive explicit solutions to the optimization problem by applying the duality approach. In Sect.  4, explicit forms of the optimal consumption and portfolios are given, and we provide some implications of the results in Sect.  5. Finally, Sect.  6 concludes.|$|R
30|$|Under Assumption  1, we have n_+< 2. Thus, {{the second}} term of (5.3) in region 2 is positive. Since the {{coefficient}} D_ 1 {{is determined by the}} boundary condition at x̃, we can describe {{the second term}} as the hedging demand for not falling into region 1. Again, we can verify that, except for the inflation risk hedging demand, the total investment in the risky asset and the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond is borrowed from the bank account as we can see in the portfolio π_ 0,tX_t in (5.2).|$|R
30|$|If {{the time}} horizon is long enough, it is persuasive to {{incorporate}} the inflation risk into consumption and portfolio selection problem. In our continuous-time model, the time horizon is infinite, and thus we expect that the inflation rate would significantly affect the long-term financial planning. To hedge the inflation risk, we introduce the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond. In fact, many developed countries already have inflation-linked securities which are traded in the financial market. Especially, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) which were introduced in 1997 have become the most traded bonds in the US bond market.|$|R
30|$|There {{are large}} strands of {{literature}} on the portfolio selection problem with inflation risk, and most studies consider the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond to manage inflation risk. Fischer [3] investigated the demand for index bond and claimed its introduction. Later, Campbell and Viceira [2] and Brennan and Xia [1] studied the dynamic asset allocation {{in the presence of}} inflation and interest risks. Gong and Li [4] incorporated the subsistence consumption constraint into the model with inflation risk. Recently, Kwak and Lim [6] investigated the effect of inflation risk on life-insurance purchase and provided quantitative analysis of the role of an index bond.|$|R
30|$|Similar to the {{portfolios}} {{in region}} 1, in region 2 the total wealth {{is invested in}} the <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> bond to hedge the inflation risk and there exists an additional investment in that bond. The myopic demand, however, is not proportional to the total capital anymore. We see that the second term in (5.4) represents the myopic demand and it {{is proportional to the}} difference between x̄ and current wealth. Note that x̄ is the wealth level at bliss point. Thus, in region 2, x̄ plays a role of target wealth and a proportion (x̅-X_t) is invested as myopic demand. We can also confirm that the optimal investment in the risky asset given in (5.3) consists of two components, and the first one, which is a myopic demand, is proportional to (x̅-X_t).|$|R
5000|$|The Alemo-Herron {{decision}} of the Court of Appeal would imply that a collective agreement would rank with secondary status compared to other [...] "dynamic" [...] contract terms, such as an <b>inflation-linked</b> <b>index</b> of pay increases. While the Court of Appeal suggested that the facts of Werhof were practically identical to the facts of Alemo-Herron, it did not consider that German domestic law, as interpreted by German courts, was different and at a lower standard than English domestic law, as interpreted by English courts, and operating in a different socio-legal environment that has legally binding collective agreements and promotes works councils as a substitute dynamic element in the employment relationship. Accordingly a floor of rights set by the Court of Justice of the European Union would not logically affect the higher protection offered by UK law. In {{a note on the}} decision, Charles Wynn-Evans suggests an argument against the {{decision of}} the Court of Appeal is that it ‘fails to respect domestic contractual orthodoxy which permits ongoing determination of contractual terms by reference to a third-party body established by collective agreement. The dynamic approach arguably ensures consistency between the protection afforded by the transfer of undertakings legislation to the terms and conditions of employment of the transferring employees and common law orthodoxy which finds nothing controversial in those employees’ terms being determined by a third party.' ...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} model the market smile for inflation-linked derivatives by defining the Quadratic Gaussian Year-on-Year inflation model—the QGY model. We directly define the model in terms of a year-on-year ratio of the inflation index on a discrete tenor structure, which, along with the nominal discount bond, is driven by a log-quadratic function of a multi-factor Gaussian Markov process. We find closed-form expressions for the drift of the inflation <b>index</b> and for <b>inflation-linked</b> swaps. We get a Black-Scholes-type pricing formula for year-on-year inflation caplets in semi-analytical form. The formula contains an integral of a multivariate Gaussian density over a quadratic domain. In a two-dimensional case, we show how this integral reduces to a one-dimensional integration along the boundary of a conic section. In the case where the year-on-year inflation ratio is driven by two factors, we specify a spherical parameterisation. This gives an intuitive control over the curvature and the skew of the year-on-year inflation smile and shows the maximum curvature and skew obtainable with a particular three-factor version of the QGY model. Within this three-factor model, we identify a parameterisation to control the autocorrelation structure of the inflation index. We calibrate the model to year-on-year inflation options on the UK’s Retail Prices Index (RPI) and the eurozone’s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices Excluding Tobacco (HICPxT) and get a good fit to the smile of implied volatilities. We use the calibrated model to price HICPxT zero-coupon inflation options and RPI limited price indices (LPIs). Furthermore, we provide methods to interpolate the process for the inflation index and the year-on-year inflation ratio between dates on the tenor structure.
