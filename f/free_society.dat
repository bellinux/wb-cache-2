5|$|Nixon {{announced}} his candidacy {{in a radio}} broadcast on November 3, painting the race as a choice between a <b>free</b> <b>society</b> and state socialism. Chotiner's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition. Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary. The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful.|$|E

50|$|The Laks are {{reported}} {{to have been the}} first Dagestani people to establish a feudal system. Their feudal society consisted of the khans; the bagtal (beks), who were the khan's family and the nobility; the chankri (children of marriages between beks and women of lower social orders); the uzdental (uzden), who were free peasants (numerically the largest of all classes); the rayat (serfs); and the laghart (slaves). This feudal system coexisted with a system of <b>free</b> <b>societies,</b> which were composed of the more democratic tukhums. These <b>free</b> <b>societies</b> were military and economic arrangements that were fluid in structure and worked on a democratic and voluntary basis. The laws governing the relations of groups within these <b>free</b> <b>societies</b> were codified in adat.|$|R

25|$|When {{it comes}} to the principled defense of freedom, and to {{opposition}} to all forms of totalitarianism, let it be said that to its eternal credit, the organized labor movement in the United States, in contradiction to all other sectors of American life, especially in industry, the academy and the churches, has never faltered, or trimmed its sails. Its dedication to the ideals of a <b>free</b> <b>society</b> has been unsullied. Its leaders have never been Munich-men of the spirit.|$|E

In later years, Acharya's influence on the institute saw it adopts a number of statutes in 1947 and subsequently the institute adopted the name of Libertarian Socialist Institute. His views on economic matters were profound and in 1951, <b>Free</b> <b>Society</b> Group of Chicago published his work How Long Can Capitalism Survive? in 1951.

25|$|Returning to Chicago by November 1897, {{he became}} {{associated}} with the group around the periodical <b>Free</b> <b>Society</b> that included Emma Goldman. He apparently conspired with her to attempt to break Alexander Berkman out of jail by tunneling into the prison, without success. After the assassination of President McKinley {{he was arrested and}} thrown into jail with all the other associates of the periodical, but released soon thereafter.

25|$|Beveridge saw full {{employment}} (defined as unemployment {{of no more}} than 3%) as the pivot of the social welfare programme he expressed in the 1942 report. Full Employment in a <b>Free</b> <b>Society,</b> written in 1944 expressed how this goal might be gained. Alternative measures for achieving it included Keynesian-style fiscal regulation, direct control of manpower, and state control of the means of production. The impetus behind Beveridge's thinking was social justice, and the creation of an ideal new society after the war. He believed that the discovery of objective socio-economic laws could solve the problems of society.|$|E

25|$|Fashionable {{taste in}} 18th-century Britain {{was based on}} {{continental}} and traditional art forms, providing contemporary British artists little opportunity to sell their works. From 1746 the Foundling Hospital, {{through the efforts of}} William Hogarth, provided an early venue for contemporary artists in Britain. The success of this venture {{led to the formation of}} the Society of Artists of Great Britain and the <b>Free</b> <b>Society</b> of Artists. Both these groups were primarily exhibiting societies; their initial success was marred by internal factions among the artists. The combined vision of education and exhibition to establish a national school of art set the Royal Academy apart from the other exhibiting societies. It provided the foundation upon which the Royal Academy came to dominate the art scene of the 18th and 19th centuries, supplanting the earlier art societies.|$|E
25|$|Macquarie {{served as}} the last autocratic Governor of New South Wales, from 1810 to 1821 and had {{a leading role in}} the social and {{economic}} development of Sydney which saw it transition from a penal colony to a budding <b>free</b> <b>society.</b> He established public works, a bank, churches, and charitable institutions and sought good relations with the Aborigines. In 1813 he sent Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson across the Blue Mountains, where they found the great plains of the interior. Central, however to Macquarie's policy was his treatment of the emancipists, whom he decreed should be treated as social equals to free-settlers in the colony. Against opposition, he appointed emancipists to key government positions including Francis Greenway as colonial architect and William Redfern as a magistrate. London judged his public works to be too expensive and society was scandalised by his treatment of emancipists.|$|E
25|$|He is {{best known}} for his 1942 report Social Insurance and Allied Services (known as the Beveridge Report) which served as the basis for the post-World War II welfare state put in place by the Labour {{government}} elected in 1945. He was considered an authority on unemployment insurance from early in his career, served under Winston Churchill on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created labour exchanges and later as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Food. He was Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of University College, Oxford. Beveridge published widely on unemployment and social security, his most notable works being: Unemployment: A Problem of Industry (1909), Planning Under Socialism (1936), Full Employment in a <b>Free</b> <b>Society</b> (1944), Pillars of Security (1943), Power and Influence (1953), and A Defence of Free Learning (1959).|$|E
