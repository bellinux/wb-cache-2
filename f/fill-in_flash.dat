5000|$|The X-700 {{used the}} basic {{body of the}} XG-M with {{electronically}} controlled stepless speeds, but added full program autoexposure {{in addition to the}} XG-M's aperture priority and metered manual modes. This program mode was referred to as [...] "MPS" [...] or Minolta Program System. It also introduced through-the-lens (TTL) flash metering, and added exposure lock and interchangeable focusing screens to the XG-M's features, the X-700 was aimed to appeal to the widest range of photographers as it could, it's easy to use fully automated Program mode could turn it into a point-and-shoot that anybody could use, but it's wide array of advanced features and available accessories and lenses made it appealing to professionals alike. Based on the X-700 chassis, Minolta later launched various other models based on the X-700 : X-300,300S,300N,370,500,570 and 600. The X-500 lacked the X-700's program exposure mode, but featured a <b>fill-in</b> <b>flash</b> mode. The X-300 was the basic model of the late X-series. It lacked TTL flash metering and program exposure mode, it did not show the f-stop-setting of the lens in the viewfinder and it did not have a depth-of-field control button. Basic parts of all three cameras, such as the shutter, viewfinder, mirror system, and light metering system, were identical.|$|E
