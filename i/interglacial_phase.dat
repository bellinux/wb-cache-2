40|$|International audienceThe Upper Valdarno (Italy) Plio-Pleistocene {{continental}} deposits {{record the}} latest uniform subtropical humid {{conditions and the}} successive climatic signature of glacial/interglacial cycling. The palynological and sedimentological analyses on the Poggio Rosso alluvial plain sediments reveal two major climatic fluctuations correlated to a glacial/interglacial cycle just before the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. The glacial phase, indicated by the expansion of herbs {{as well as by}} ephemeral streams associated with calcareous palaeosols, extends {{from the base of the}} succession and culminates close to an impressive mammalian bone accumulation dated at 1. 87 Ma. The associated increasing aridity had severe consequences on the faunal communities, inducing the migration of open plain dwellers and the trapping of other residents around a few residual shrinking water bodies. A cooperative Pachycrocuta brevirostris clan acted as regulator of game populations debilitated by drought. Previous research indicates that hyenas were also the major bone accumulators. The following moister and warmer <b>interglacial</b> <b>phase</b> ca 1. 83 Ma is documented by arboreal taxa and hydromorphic palaeosols in a floodplain crossed by migrating, perennial, sinuous streams. The Climatic Amplitude Method calculated mean annual temperatures around 12. 5 – 14 °C and mean annual precipitation around 800 mm, with a minimum of 400 mm during the glacial phase and 15 / 16 – 19 °C and 750 – 1200 mm during the <b>interglacial</b> <b>phase.</b> The reconstruction reveals higher mean annual temperatures and precipitation during the interglacial as compared to the present-day climate. During the glacial, conditions were similar to today's in all but lower precipitation values were reached during the acme drought phase just above the fossiliferous bed.

The representative depositional units and associated paleosols were characterised by fieldwork, physical, chemical, and mineralogical analyses. Pedogenesis was mostly driven by the time and climate factors. In the proximal fan location, pedogenesis was initially influenced by a warm subtropical-tropical climate of the Late Pliocene and subsequently by warm and humid <b>interglacial</b> <b>phases</b> of the Pleistocene. These phases were also responsible for soil formation in the middle fan. In the distal reaches of the fan, pedogenesis was driven by the different climatic pulses of the Late Pleistocene Tyrrhenian interglacial (MIS 5).

Factor analysis of the planktic foraminifer assemblages suggests that the assemblage was controlled by three factors. The first factor (which explained 49 % of the variance) is dominated by transitional and subpolar species and points to warm and salty surface {{water conditions}} (Atlantic water). The second factor (37 %) is dominated by Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sin and {{has been associated with}} the presence of cold and low saline surface waters (Arctic water). Finally, the third factor (9 %), linked to a significant presence of Turborotalita quinqueloba, reflects the closeness of the Arctic front (the boundary between Atlantic and Arctic water). The position of the Arctic and Polar fronts has been estimated across the glacial-interglacial cycles studied according to planktic foraminifer abundances from Site U 1314 (and their factor analysis) combined with a synthesis of planktic foraminifer and diatom data from other North Atlantic sites. Regarding at the migrations of the Arctic front and the surface water masses distribution across each climatic cycle we determined five phases of development. Furthermore, deep ocean circulation changes observed in glacial-interglacial cycles have been associated with each phase. The high abundance of transitional-subpolar foraminifers (above 65 % at Site U 1314) during the early <b>interglacial</b> <b>phase</b> indicated that the Arctic front position and surface water masses distribution were similar to present conditions. During the late <b>interglacial</b> <b>phase,</b> N. pachyderma sin and T. quinqueloba slightly increased indicating that winter sea ice slightly expanded southwestwards whereas the ice volume remained stable or was still decreasing. N. pachyderma sin increased rapidly (above 65 % at Site U 1314) at the first phase of glacial periods indicating the expansion of the Arctic waters in the western subpolar North Atlantic. During the second phase of glacial periods the transitional-subpolar assemblage throve again in the central subpolar North Atlantic associated with strong warming events that followed ice-rafting events. The third phase of glacial periods corresponds to full glacial conditions in which N. pachyderma sin dominated the assemblage for the whole subpolar North Atlantic. This division in phases may be applied to the last four climatic cycles...|$|E
40|$|Deep subpermafrost {{aquifers}} {{are highly}} climate-dependent, with the permafrost as an aquitard preventing groundwater recharge and discharge. A {{study from the}} high-arctic island of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, shows that during a glacial to <b>interglacial</b> <b>phase,</b> both the permafrost and the glacier regime will respond to climatic changes, and a glacier-fed groundwater flow system will vary accordingly. A full glaciation results in the melting of permafrost, and groundwater can flow through pores and fracture systems in the rocks and sediments below the temperate zones of glaciers. These groundwater flow systems will mainly be localized to fjords and valleys and form low-lying terrestrial springs when the relative sea level drops during deglaciation due to glacio-isostatic rise. During an interglaciation, permafrost develops and thickens and the groundwater recharge and discharge areas will thereby be gradually reduced to a minimum reached at the warmest part of an interglaciation. An already frozen spring system cannot reopen before the permafrost melts. Only groundwater springs related to permanently warm-based glacial ice will persist into the next glaciation. During a new glaciation, flow systems that terminated during the previous interglaciation may become revitalized if overridden by warm-based ice causing permafrost thawing...|$|E

In the present study, we assessed the relative importance of historical and contemporary processes in shaping genetic diversity and differentiation of bank vole (Myodes glareolus) populations at different elevations in the Swiss Alps. By contrast to expectations, we found that genetic variation increased with elevation. Estimates of recent migration rates and a contrasting pattern of genetic differentiation observed at the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and nuclear microsatellites support the hypothesis that higher genetic diversity at high elevation results from contemporary gene flow. Although historical recolonization processes can have marked effects on the genetic structure of populations, the present study provides an example where contemporary processes along an environmental gradient can reverse predicted patterns of genetic variation...|$|R

We carried out a detailed geomorphologic survey on the island, focused on coastal landforms. The rock seaward slope of Palmaria Island has two types of long profiles: 1) a slope over wall profile (plunging cliff) and 2) narrow rock surfaces at sea level or a few meters above it backed by steep slopes (palaeocliff). The first type of slope profile {{is due to the}} presence of faults, linked to NW-SE-striking fault system, responsible for the displacement of the eastern Ligurian continental shelf. Our data indicate the up-throw side of the fault, corresponding to the island coast, is stable, so that an incipient notch can evolve along the cliff face in connection with present day sea level. The second type of slope profile shows at its bottom a narrow, discontinuous rock platform which is currently being demanded, constrained in elevation below 5 m asl.

The lithostratigraphical study allowed reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental conditions during the existence of a palaeo-marsh. Based on tephrostratigraphical analysis, the significant volcanoclastic inputs recorded along the Sessano succession were correlated to the explosive activity of the nearby Roccamonfina volcano and in particular to the high-K series (HKS) period of activity, lasted from 546 to 364 ka. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of 437. 9 1. 9 ka obtained {{at the base of the}} trench section, which stratigraphically overlaps the core succession, confirms the tephrostratigraphical model and indicates that the marsh dried up during the glacial phase of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 12.

The sediment fill reflects latitudinal variations in climate {{as well as}} in the morphology and geology of Chile, but also of sediment transport processes to the trench and within the trench. We try to untangle these signals by calculating the total volume and the latitudinal volume distribution of trench sediments and by relating this distribution to a number of factors that affect this pattern. The volume calculation is based on a model geometry of the top of the subducting oceanic plate that is buried beneath trench sediments and the sea floor as measured by swath bathymetry. We obtain the model geometry of the subducting plate by interpolating between depth-converted seismic reflection profiles that cross the trench. The total volume of the trench fill between 32 and 46 °S is calculated to be 46000 ?±? 500 ?km 3.

In the same period from which appear to start the ground movements, two large explosive events (i. e., 22 ka Pomici di Base and 19 ka Pomici Verdoline) occurred.

A portion of the fine fraction is being carried away by the antarctic coastel current. The sedimentation rate lies between 0 and 3 cm/ 1000 a. The coarse grained deposits of the upper, relatively steep continental slope, were specified as a rest sediment. Current and gravity sediment transport are responsible for the intensive sorting of ice rafted material coming from the shelf. The fine sediment is carried away by currents while sand and silt are deposited as small turbidites on the slope terrace. The morainic facies only appears {{at the base of the}} upper continental slope and defines ice advances, beyond the shelf margin. The facies mainly consists of transported shelf sediments. The interglacial facies, deposited during the interglacial phases on the continental slope, are characterized by high proportions of ice raft, coarse mean grain size, low content of montmorillonite and a carbonate content, which mainly originates from planktonic foraminifera (N. pachyderma). At the central part of the slope the sedimentation rate is at its lowest (2 cm/ 1000 a) and increases to 3 - 4 cm/ 1000 a towards the sea, due to high production of biogenic components and towards the continent due to an increasing input of terrigenous material. Sedimentary conditions during glacial times are depicted in the glacial facies by a low content of ice rafted debris, a lower mean grain size and a high content of montmorillonite. Biogeneous components are absent. The sedimentation rate is generally about 1 cm/ 1000 a. A transition facies is deposited during the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions. Typical for this facies, with a terrigenous composition similar to the interglacial facies, is a high content of radiolaria. The reason for the change of plankton from a siliceous to a carbonacous fauna may have been the changing hydrography caused by the sea ice. The surge facies is deposited at the continental margin under the ice shelf and is a sediment exclusively delivered by currents. With the aid of this facies it was, for the first time possible to prove the existence of Antarctic ice surges, an aspect wh ich has been discussed for the past 20 years...|$|E
40|$|The {{sedimentary}} basins of {{the central}} and southern Apennines are suitable to the conservation of continental palaeoenvironmental archives. The study of those deposits traces the evolution of vegetation and climates in Italy during the Quaternary, at regional and micro-regional scales. Thus, the Boiano Basin (Molise, Italy) recorded an important lacustrine and fluvio-palustrine sedimentation since the Middle Pleistocene. According to the tephrostratigraphy, which forms the chronological framework of the sequence, the basal deposits {{are assumed to be}} older than 440 ka. Three major phases of sedimentation were recognized by means of lithology. Palynology enabled to detail the evolution of the environments synchronous to those sedimentary fillings between the oxygen isotopic stages 13 and 2. The environment dynamics confirms the progressive reduction of the deciduous forest diversity during the Middle Pleistocene, and characteristics of the Boiano basin are enlightened. Quercus, omnipresent element during the Middle Pleistocene of southern Italy, is quite scarce along the whole sequence and systematically associated with Fagus during the <b>interglacial</b> <b>phases.</b> The biotope, characterized by a continuous, atmospheric or edaphic, humidity favoured the persistence of hygrophilous taxa. In fact, Carya is present until the oxygen isotopic stage 9, which represents its latest record in Western Europe. Thus, the Boiano basin could have constituted an ecological refuge for the arboreal flora of the Middle Pleistocene. The physiography of the basin certainly softened the effects of climatic deterioration during glacial episodes...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructing the {{phylogeny}} and biogeography of the Caribbean {{land snail}} Cerion requires a robust stratigraphic and chronological framework. To this end, we have determined the stratigraphic succession on San Salvador, a Bahamian island {{with a rich}} fossil and modern Cerion fauna. A primary {{purpose of this paper}} is to independently verify this succession through whole-rock and Cerion aminostratigraphies and AMS 14 C-based age models. Over 150 individual Cerion shells were age-ranked from 140 ka to modern using stratigraphic position and reverse-phase HPLC (RPC) amino acid racemization, which was sufficiently sensitive to resolve stratigraphic subunits within the Holocene and late Pleistocene. A secondary {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess broad changes in the gross morphology (height, width) of supersets of Cerion from age-ranked lots spanning this ~ 140 kyr chronostratigraphy. Through each of the three interglacial sequences (i. e., marine isotope stages 5 e, 5 a, and 1), between-sample trends in mean gross morphology often greatly exceed within-sample variances (± 1 σ). Live-collected Cerion exhibit a range in gross morphology that nearly encompasses that of the entire fossil sequence. A trend of increasing gross shell size characterizes each of the <b>interglacial</b> <b>phases,</b> with a major step-decrease between marine isotope stages 5 a and 1. While between-unit variation is often great in Cerion from SSI, within-unit variation appears unimodal through the record...|$|R
40|$|A {{new record}} {{combining}} isotopic and palynological results over the interval 133 - 111 ka BP at 100 - 200 year resolution {{from a long}} lacustrine sequence at Ioannina, northwest Greece is presented. The sequence provides an opportunity to examine the nature of climate variability during the Last Interglacial in southern Europe where information has hitherto been relatively limited. The record shows that the frequency and amplitude of changes during the transitional late glacial and late <b>interglacial</b> <b>phases</b> were markedly {{higher than that of}} the full interglacial interval. These differences are probably a reflection of the relative size of ice sheets in the circum-North Atlantic and associated ice-rafting events and climatic perturbations during these periods. During intervals of increased ice volume, it appears that North Atlantic variability has a significant downstream impact, dominating the climate signal in northwest Greece. During intervals of minimum ice volume there may be a decoupling between the North Atlantic system and continental climates with other factors, such as insolation changes, becoming more important. The length of the Last Interglacial at Ioannina defined by the presence of forest is here estimated to be c. 15 ka, in agreement with recent results from Portugal, but in conflict with estimates of c. 10 ka {{for the duration of the}} Eemian in northwest Europe. In the absence of independent confirmation for these estimates, however, these differences and associated implications remain unresolved...|$|R
40|$|As an {{introduction}} {{to a number of}} researches of his own the author wishes to give the following data: „Veen” has two meanings in Dutch: 1. in a petrographic sense (peat) Von Büllow’s definition was accepted: „Torf” ist zu deflnieren als ein meist dunkles, kohlenstoffreiches und ± saures Gemenge unvollständig spezifisch-zersetzter Pflanzenteile, das erdgeschichtlich jüngste Glied der Verwantschaftsreihe der Kohlen, dessen Bildung noch heute andauert. ” 2. in a plant-sociological-geographic sense (bog) the following definition has been suggested: a bog is a plot, the surface of which consists of a layer of peat, either covered or not with vegetation, with which that layer is genetically connected. The classification of bogs according to their position with regard to the water-level of the surroundings (Staring) and that of the geological chart were rejected on account of their ambiguous character. The classification suggested by Van Baren according to the environment in which the bogs have been formed, was likewise thought insufficient. Preference was given to the classification according to the plants which gave rise to the peat (eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic bogs) and according to the origin of the water needed for peat formation (topogenous, ombrogenous and soligenous bogs). The conditions of peat-formation are of a botanical (presence of a vegetation and micro-organisms), climatologic (presence of a certain temperature and moisture) and geological nature (presence of a basin, valley or dead river-branch, certain level of ground water, a possible impervious layer). With reference to a number of authors (Picardt; Van Lier; Grisebach, Venema and Staring; Weber) the alteration in conception as to peatformation from the 17 th via the 18 th and 19 th to the 20 th century has been given. The word „Peel” cannot be derived from „palus”. Nothing is certain about its origin. It may mean the low land, bog or marsh. The bogs of the Peel lie on the Brabant-Limburg border-plateau (fig. 2). Lorié and Pannekoek van Rheden have shown that the peatformation of the Peel is likely to have occurred in channels, which have been formed by the Meuse, in co-operation with wind and rain (fig. 4). The bogs were therefore in the first instance topogenous formations, which afterwards developed into ombrogenous bogs. For his own research the author collected peat in three ways: 1. by cutting lumps of peat from open profiles; 2. by boring with a simple peat-bore (photograph 1); 3. by boring with the Utrecht peat-bore, an improvement on Dachnowski’s (fig. 5). To assist in the pollen-analytic examination the samples were treated according to Erdtman’s method. The latter has the following advantages compared with the usual treatment with a 10 % KOH-solution: 1. the surface-structures of the pollen-grains are more distinct and as a result the grains themselves can be recognized better; 2. the pollen is more concentrated, so that in spite of the method taking up much time, a saving of time is possible. How the method is applied may be found in the chapter concerned (p. 38 and following). For the stratigraphic examination the samples were broken apart in a glass-bowl of water and viewed with a binocular microscope. Dry sandy samples were broken in water, when seeds and other vegetative parts came floating to the top; next they were put with a brush on thick blotting paper and studied through the binocular microscope. The designations for the sediments and species of peat have been derived from Fægri & Gams. For Scheuchzeria peat a new designation has been added. A plea was made for replacing the word pollen-analysis by „palynology”. A survey of the observations and examinations up to abt. 1935 closes the introduction (see the diagrams of Weber, Erdtman and Duyfjes in the figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9). The author’s own research refers to the Southern and Astense Peel, as in the remaining grounds of the geological chart indicated I 4 v (= raised bog) no samples could be taken owing to the digging off having progressed too far. 10 profiles were examined. The situation of the bore-sites has been given in the geological chart of the grounds (fig. 3). The result of the examination (figs. 10 — 27) and the discussion on it may be summerized as follows: Zoning of pollen-diagrams The sub-zoning of the late- and post-glacial periods according to Blytt & Sernander has proved useful as a zoning of pollen-diagrams, provided atlantic and sub-boreal are joined. It is desirable to replace Blytt & Sernander’s terminology by a different one, because the authors gave a climatologic connotation to their names of periods. The limit between pleistocene and holocene was drawn between preboreal and boreal as Florschütz did. As phases of the holocene the following names were suggested: young post-glacial = sub-atlantic mid post-glacial = sub-boreal and atlantic old post-glacial = boreal. Neither in the Peel nor elsewhere in Holland have Allerød-deposits been found. They {{are not likely to be}} found either, as on account of the long distance from the land-ice-margin the flora will have been hardly or not at all influenced by the Allerød interstadial period. For Holland therefore the zoning of the late-glacial according to Firbas (1935) may be considered sufficient. The names of the periods do not bear a climatologic connotation as those of the post-glacial phases do. For the sake of a unity the following names have been suggested: young late-glacial = pre-boreal mid late-glacial = sub-arctic period old late-glacial = arctic period. Forest-history In a table (p. 98), in which likewise the Peel diagrams of Weber, Erdtman and Duyfjes have been inserted, the examined profiles have been arranged from North to South. From each profile it has been stated whether it originated in a certain period (+) or not (—). The sub-arctic phase was characterized by forests of Betula and Pinus and was followed by the pre-boreal phase, in which Corylus and Alnus occurred. Also from the other Dutch diagrams (see list on p. 99) it appeared that in the Netherlands the Alnus pollen occurs with an equal frequency before, during and after that of the Quercetum mixtum. The old post-glacial zone of the diagrams shows a peak in the Pinusline. In contrast with the from Mid-Europe there is not always a maximum in the Corylus-curve after the Pinus-peak. In other Dutch diagrams this phenomenon is likewise found. Only in 28 % of all Dutch profiles with a boreal zone does a hazel-maximum succeed a Pinus one. They often co-incide (16 %), while in the remaining cases no hazelpeak has been established. There is no fixed order of sequence in the occurrence of the components of the Quercetum mixtum, either in the Peel or elsewhere in Holland. The mid post-glacial is the phase of culmination of warmth-loving forest elements: Alnus pollen shows the highest percentage in this zone. Quercus pollen also occurs in great quantities, while Ulmus and Tilia take up an important place up to the „Grenzhorizont”. The absolute and empiric Fagus pollen limits are found at different heights in the mid post-glacial zone of the diagrams, the rational limit lies somewhere near the „Grenzhorizont”. In the young post-glacial phase the Fagus pollen attains fairly high percentages (up to 30 %). The maxima in the East and South-east of the Netherlands are between 20 % and 38 %; they decrease towards the coast and increase towards the South-east (Hautes Fagnes, Belgium) and East (Germany). It seems incorrect to class the Netherlands almost entirely among the oak-alderterritory poor in beeches, as Firbas did. An attempt has been made to fit the Peel-diagrams into Overbeck & Schneider’s zonation system. For the territory for which it has been made there are already difficulties (p. 104), for use in the Peel and other Dutch diagrams there are even more objections (p. 68, 104). Godwin’s zonation system appeared to be a little less forced, but not quite useful on account of too many details. From his horizons that of Ulmus proved useless for the continent. Neither for the Peel nor for the Netherlands and its surrounding territory can a detailed zonation system be designed. It has proved difficult to proceed any farther than Rudolph’s „Grundsukzession”: birch, pine-hazel-mixed oak-forest-beech, in which the alder generally joins the mixed oak-forest and the hornbeam the beech. Before drawing far-reaching conclusions from the course of the curves (as has been done by some authors) more palynological researches are needed in accordance with the actuality principle, known from geology. Pollen-grains from warmth-loving trees in seemingly sub-arctic spectra In profile 4 (Deurnse Peel II) pollen-grains of Abies, Alnus, Picea, Tilia, Ulmus and Corylus were found in the „late-glacial” zone (figs. 14, 15). Investigations were made as to which of the following possibilities would be the cause of their appearance: 1. in taking and preparing the samples pollution occurred; 2. pollen-transport over long distances has taken place; 3. the pollen-grains found have got secondarily into the deposit; 4. warmth-loving trees have occurred in favourable circumstances in the late-glacial phase or 5. in an interstadial period or in an <b>interglacial</b> <b>phase.</b> The said pollen-grains probably hail from a Würm interstadial or <b>interglacial</b> <b>phase.</b> Interglacial peat On the site of the bore-point 7 it was possible to collect samples from the layers under the peat. The upper 40 cm of the diagram Griendtsveen IX (fig. 27) of this profile proved a repetition of the lower 40 cm of the Griendtsveen I profile (fig. 18). The diagram shows that pollen of Carpinus, Picea and Abies occurs showing the deposit to be of interglacial age. The pollen-curves, however, pass unnoticed from an interglacial into a post-glacial portion. The limit is likely to be found between the two, about 30 cm below the mowing field. There is therefore a great stratigraphic hiatus. Pollen-analytically it could not be decided from which interglacial period the profile hails; on account of its situation on the middle terrace, it was deemed likely that it was an Eem sea deposit. The examined profile probably corresponds to Jessen & Milthers’ zone g; showing it to have been formed at the end of the Eem sea period. The Meuse therefore cannot have flowed through this part of the Astense Peel after the mid Eemean phase. Stratigraphy This is difficult to summarize. Compare various profiles. Individual mention may be made here of: 1. peat on a podsol layer; this was found in two places (Deurnse Peel I Kraaienhut and Griendtsveen VIII). Peat-formation may be thought to have occurred in the following way: heather started growing on drift-sand giving rise to a podsol layer. As the latter is impervious the vegetation surface became marshy. The heath was replaced by a Caricetum from which peat arose. Gradually more Eriophorum occurred, from which almost pure vaginatum peat arose. The bog-surface grew moister and moister, Sphagnum cuspidatum and Scheuchzeria could grow on it and formed a „Vorlaufstorf”. Only then could non-extremehydrophile Sphagna join in peat-formation. 2. the occurrence of Scheuchzeria-peat after the „Grenzhorizont” period. This species of peat, which is often found at the basis of the old Sphagnum-peat as a mesotrophic transition vegetation, has for the Netherlands only been found in the young post-glacial phase in the Peel (Deurnse Peel I Kraaienhut, Griendtsveen V and VIII and Nederweerd). At present the plant is very rare. The severe decline of this plant was also observed elsewhere. Probably it is caused by the gradual drying up or reclaiming of the raised bogs. Of the present station of Scheuchzeria near Ommen a short description has been given (p. 59 and photographs 2, 3, 4). 3. the „Grenzhorizont”. Where the young Sphagnum-peat has not been dug for the preparation of moss-litter, the Peel bogs show a clear „Grenzhorizont” (photograph 8). The conceptions about its origin have been discussed. The distinct separation between the old and the young Sphagnum-peat was not considered sufficiently explained. Though on the whole the „Grenzhorizont” is synchronous in the North-west European profiles, the point of transition from old to young Sphagnumpeat was fairly unstable and easily changeable as to time. Generally the date of the „Grenzhorizont” is fixed at about 500 A. D., though there are differences in opinion. There is a lack of archeological correlation which renders a correct dating impossible. Interference of man in the Peel Three ways of interference were stated: 1. peat has been dug off for the greater part in the territory of the Peel: young Sphagnum-peat for the preparation of moss-litter, old Sphagnum-peat for fuel. The trees which appeared when the bog was dug up in the „Veenderij der Maatschappij Griendtsveen” are sometimes in so good a condition, that they are used for building sheds. The 1 st, 2 nd and 4 th beam in the foreground of the shed in photo 5 has been sawn from a 30 m long subfossil pine. 2. in a native peat-digging it was possible to collect recent young Sphagnum-peat. 40 to 50 years ago the peasants living there had dug peat in holes, which were afterwards left to themselves. Sphagnum started growing again and the holes were filled in again. The diagram (fig. Griendtsveen VII) represents the surrounding heath with scattered pines and birches, sown by the wind, and a pine-plantation close by. 3. in the profiles Nieuwe Peel, Griendtsveen VI and VII it has been fixed by the indications given by Firbas, that only in the surface layers of the bog has corn-pollen occurred. So in these parts cultivation of cereals will be of recent date. This also appeared from the history of the reclamation of the said territory...|$|E
40|$|Western Eurasia {{yielded a}} rich Middle (MP) and Late Pleistocene (LP) fossil record documenting the {{evolution}} of the Neandertals that can be analyzed in light of recently acquired paleogenetical data, an abundance of archeological evidence, and a well-known environmental context. Their origin likely relates to an episode of recolonization of Western Eurasia by hominins of African origin carrying the Acheulean technology into Europe around 600 ka. An enhancement of both glacial and <b>interglacial</b> <b>phases</b> may have {{played a crucial role in}} this event, as well as in the subsequent evolutionary history of the Western Eurasian populations. In addition to climatic adaptations and an increase in encephalization, genetic drift seems to have played a major role in their evolution. To date, a clear speciation event is not documented, and the most likely scenario for the fixation of Neandertal characteristics seems to be an accretion of features along the second half of the MP. Although a separation time for the African and Eurasian populations is difficult to determine, it certainly predates OIS 11 as phenotypic Neandertal features are documented as far back as and possibly before this time. It is proposed to use the term “Homo rhodesiensis” to designate the large-brained hominins ancestral to H. sapiens in Africa and at the root of the Neandertals in Europe, and to use the term “Homo neanderthalensis” to designate all of the specimens carrying derived metrical or non-metrical features used in the definition of the LP Neandertals...|$|R

40|$|Paleoenvironmental {{variations}} {{that occurred}} in Italy from the Middle Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene are described. The number of large mammal species seems increased moderately, especially from the Galerian to the Late Aurelian biochronological units. On the contrary, the paleobotanical data show a decrease of the forest cover from the Middle Pliocene to the late Early Pleistocene and an increase of lands occupied by prairies and steppes. This change is also supported {{by the appearance of}} hypsodont taxa among mammals. The distribution of mammal faunas between the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian sides of Central Italy, during the Middle and Late Pleistocene, seems not to be influenced by climatic and environment differences. When the Adriatic data are more complete, it is possible, in fact, to observe a trend that is fairly close to that of the Tyrrhenian. The majority of megaherbivorous taxa has an Asian origin, and it can be hypothesized that in the <b>interglacial</b> <b>phases,</b> the Tosco-Emilian Apennines allowed the taxa coming from the northeast to enter and spread out into the more diversified Tyrrhenian side, whereas during the glacial periods the narrow Ligurian corridor were followed. This research supports the role of the Italian Peninsula as a refuge area for continental Europe; this particular condition permits the Italian mammal faunas to develop endemic lineage (such as Elephas antiquus italicus Osborn, 1931, Cervus elaphus rianensis Leonardi & Petronio, 1974, C. e. aretinus Azzaroli, 1947, etc.).
