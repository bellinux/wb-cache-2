25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the <b>hard</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E
