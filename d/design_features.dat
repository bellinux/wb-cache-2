5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a deployment that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included <b>design</b> <b>features</b> that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E

Reportedly, the 777 could eventually be replaced by a new aircraft family, Yellowstone 3, which would draw upon technologies from the 787.|$|E

5|$|Since {{its design}} {{does not meet}} current highway bridge standards, Pulaski Skyway is {{considered}} functionally obsolete, In 2007, it was rated structurally deficient. The 2007 collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis raised concerns about {{the stability of the}} skyway, one of eight New Jersey bridges with similar <b>design</b> <b>features.</b> Within days of the collapse, NJDOT announced that it would start a previously planned one-year, $10-million project to make critical repairs. The work was the first phase of a planned 10-year, $200-million interim renovation project, the first significant repairs since 1984.|$|E

5|$|The square-windowed Comet 1 was {{the first}} model produced, a total of 12 {{aircraft}} in service and test. Following closely the <b>design</b> <b>features</b> of the two prototypes, the only noticeable change was the adoption of four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units, replacing the single main wheels. Four Ghost 50 Mk 1 engines were fitted (later replaced by more powerful Ghost DGT3 series engines). The span was 115ft (35.05m), and overall length 93ft (28.35m); the maximum takeoff weight was over 105,000lb (47.628kg) and over 40 passengers could be carried.|$|E

His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again, and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works, including Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg).|$|E

It is capable of absorbing up to 5,000 Gs of shock, far {{in excess of the}} forces generated by a normal golf swing.

5|$|Blek is a 2013 puzzle {{video game}} for iOS and Android by Kunabi Brother, {{a team of}} {{brothers}} Denis and Davor Mikan. The player draws a snakelike black line that recurs in pattern and velocity across the screen to remove colored dots and avoid black dots. It is minimalist in <b>design,</b> <b>features</b> excerpts of Erin Gee, and takes inspiration from Golan Levin, the Bauhaus, and Japanese calligraphy. The brothers designed the game as a touchscreen adaptation to classic game Snake and worked on the game for over six months. It was released in December 2013 for iPad, and was later released for other iOS devices and Android.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with <b>design</b> <b>features</b> of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, {{the first of several}} tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel <b>design</b> <b>features</b> a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the {{building}} underwent an extensive $20million renovation directed by Chicago architect Gunny Harboe, whose restoration work included Loop landmarks the Rookery Building and Reliance Building. The project included {{restoration of the}} main lobby to emphasize the <b>design</b> <b>features</b> of the art deco era, elevator modernization, façade renovation and cleaning, and the continued renovation of upper floor corridors and hallways. Though impractically small for modern use, mailboxes in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex. An improved electrical infrastructure, with ten main feeds from seven different Commonwealth Edison electrical substations, was added in addition to redundant cooling systems and upgraded telecommunications capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{operating}} cost replaced capacity {{as the primary}} factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared <b>design</b> <b>features,</b> including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} of <b>design</b> <b>features</b> {{from other}} revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The revolver has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to an already fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is unique to the weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
