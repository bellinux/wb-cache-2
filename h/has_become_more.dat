5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E

The stadium's capacity exceeded 100,000 from the early 1900s until the 1980s and the Roar could be heard whenever Scotland scored an important goal. After the renovation of the stadium and the reduced capacities, the roar <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> muted.|$|E
5|$|Whale was {{openly gay}} {{throughout}} his career, {{something that was}} very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> common, some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext {{and it has been}} claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led {{to the end of his}} career.|$|E
5|$|As the {{commercial}} application of molecular diagnostics <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> important, {{so has the}} debate about patenting of the genetic discoveries at its heart. In 1998, the European Union's Directive 98/44/ECclarified that patents on DNA sequences were allowable. In 2010 in the US, AMP sued Myriad Genetics to challenge the latter's patents regarding two genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, which are associated with breast cancer. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court partially agreed, ruling that a naturally occurring gene sequence could not be patented.|$|E

5|$|Because of its durability, {{titanium}} <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> {{popular for}} designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness {{makes it a}} good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands. It <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E

5|$|It is a bird of open sclerophyll forests, {{eucalypt}} and acacia woodlands and scrublands, with sparse or no understory, or low {{cover with}} shrubs such as Triodia, Lomandra or Hibbertia. It is less common in mallee scrub. In arid areas and northern Australia, {{it is more}} restricted to woodland alongside rivers and billabongs. It <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> common in southwest Western Australia with land clearing, though has become rare around Darwin on account of urban development.|$|E
5|$|Lakefront Station's lack of {{modernization}} since its opening <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> noticeable, especially its appearance {{and lack of}} adequate signage. In August 2012, when the Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland was under construction, a Cuyahoga County official {{expressed a desire to}} keep Lakefront Station out of view. One proposed solution was to build a new station underground, but {{due to a lack of}} funding, the county settled on hiding the station behind trees and shrubs as a short-term solution.|$|E

5|$|One {{criticism}} of the practice holds that the manager has enough to be preoccupied with during a game without playing. With specialized bullpens, extensive scouting reports, and increased media scrutiny, {{the job of a}} manager <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> complex. A player–manager needs to decide how much playing time to give himself. Don Kessinger, player–manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1979, believes he did not play himself enough. Additionally, Bill Terry felt he became isolated from his team when he became a player–manager.|$|E
