40|$|We {{provide a}} brief {{overview}} {{of the history of the}} jour-nal Contributions to Zoology and analyse the papers published in the last 27 years by topic. Founded in 1848 as ‘Bijdragen tot de Dierkunde’, 160 years and 76 volumes later it is one of the oldest zoological <b>journals</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> regularly printed. Over the last decades most papers dealt with invertebrates (60 %), followed by vertebrates (23 %), insects (10 %) and non-taxonomic papers. Contributions to Zoology has seen a change from a largely alpha taxonomic <b>journal</b> to one <b>that</b> <b>is</b> truly general in scope. Systematic biol-ogy and comparative morphology of both extant and extinct taxa nowadays make up about half of the pa-pers published. Ethology as a research subject has been gradually phased out, and judged by the number of papers published, Conservation Biology has seen its coming of age of as a mainstream biological sci-ence. With contributors from 36 countries, of which 40 % from outside Europe, Contributions to Zoology is a truly international journal, for research and re-searchers from various parts of the world. The journal Contributions to Zoology started in 1848 under the name Bijdragen tot de Dierkunde and adopt-ed its current English name to be the leading title in 1995. Nearly 160 years and 76 volumes later it is one of the oldest zoological <b>journals</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> regularly printed. In the past some volumes spanned multiple years and there have been periods, such as during the great wars, when publication of the journal was halted...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the {{characteristics}} of third sector research, based on peer reviewed scientific publications for the period starting 1971 up to 2014. Three main variables are analyzed: authorship, journal and keywords. Tools used included Elton Bryson Stephens Co (EBSCO) thesaurus, for search keys definition, spreadhsheets, for data processing, and SCOPUS database for data collection. In terms of contribution, the results show an increase in scientific publication, contrary to results found ten years ago by Helmig, Jegers and Lapsley (2004), could guide research in this field. Besides that, the terms ‘NGO’, ‘non-profit organization’ and ‘Civil society’ are used extensively, in general and specifically by core <b>journals,</b> revealing <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> room for taxonomy discussions about these organizations, since there are articles naming similar organizations after different terms.

40|$|Enterprise {{architecture}} originates {{from the}} 1980 ’s. It emerged among ICT practitioners to solve complex {{problems related to}} information systems. Currently EA is also utilised to solve business problems, although the focus <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in ICT and its alignment with business. EA {{can be defined as}} a description of the current and future states of the enterprise, and as a change between these states to meet stakeholder’s goals. Despite its popularity and 30 years of age, the literature review conducted on top information and management science <b>journals</b> revealed <b>that</b> EA <b>is</b> <b>still</b> lacking the sound theoretical foundation. In this conceptual paper, we propose General Systems Theory (GST) for underpinning theory of EA. GST allows us to see enterprises as systems of systems consisting of, for instance, social organisations, humans, information systems and computers. This explains why EA can be used to describe the enterprise and its components, and how to control them to execute the managed change. Implications to science and practice, and some directions for future research are also provided...|$|R
40|$|The travelogue of a post-colonial traveller: The travels of Isobelle by Elsa Joubert Die reise van Isobelle (The travels of Isobelle) {{written by}} Elsa Joubert is {{regarded}} as one of her best novels. In many respects this novel can be considered as an overview of an extensive and impressive oeuvre. This article attempts to indicate that this novel not only relates to the important tradition of travel writing in Afrikaans literature, but also comments on this tradition from a feminist and postcolonial perspective. In a certain sense this novel can also be read as a continuance (or rewriting) of Joubert's own travel <b>journals</b> <b>that</b> have <b>still</b> <b>been</b> embedded in a colonial consciousness. Once again a symbiotic relationship exists between the above-mentioned novel and several of Elsa Joubert's other travel journals. In this article the intertextual ties with Water en woestyn and Die verste reis are explored in particular. The premise of this hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the characteristic aspect of travel literature is the unseverable tie between centrifugal and centripetal forces. To a great extent the structure of this extensive work, with its extraordinarily solid motif structure, already determines this...|$|R
