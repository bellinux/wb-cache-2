40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} resistance of 809 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates collected from humans in Norway between 1975 and 1998 was studied. The material was subdivided into {{domestic and foreign}} isolates according to whether the patient <b>had</b> recently <b>travelled</b> <b>abroad</b> or not. In imported isolates the largest increase in resistance was in 1996 when 35 % of the isolates were multi-resistant. The first multi-resistant isolate acquired in Norway appeared in 1994, but already in 1998 23 % of the isolates domestically acquired were multi-resistant, and a majority were S. Typhimurium DT 104. We found no ciprofloxacin resistance in domestically acquired isolates. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed on selected multi-resistant isolates. The method discriminated well between different multi-resistant isolates, but not between DT 104 isolates. Resistant and multi-resistant S. Typhimurium were until 1998 essentially recovered from patients who <b>had</b> <b>travelled</b> <b>abroad,</b> but multi-resistant isolates, mainly DT 104, are now also being transmitted within the country...|$|R
