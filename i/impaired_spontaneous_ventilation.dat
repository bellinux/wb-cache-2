Estudo transversal, realizado em um hospital de nÃvel secundÃrio da rede pÃblica de Fortaleza (CE), nos meses de abril a setembro de 2013. A amostra foi composta por 205 crianÃas. Os dados foram coletados por meio de uma avaliaÃÃo pulmonar e entrevista com os responsÃveis. As informaÃÃes obtidas foram analisadas para determinar a presenÃa ou ausÃncia dos indicadores clÃnicos dos diagnÃsticos em estudo. Posteriormente, esses dados foram encaminhados a enfermeiros diagnosticadores para inferÃncia diagnÃstica. Foram utilizados os softwares Excel e SPSS para organizaÃÃo e anÃlise estatÃstica dos dados. O nÃvel de significÃncia adotado foi de 5 %. O estudo adotou os princÃpios Ãticos e recebeu parecer Ãtico favorÃvel (parecer nÂ 237. 389 / 13). Houve uma discreta prevalÃncia para o sexo masculino (52, 3 %) e mediana de idade de 36 meses. Das crianÃas avaliadas, 89, 3 % desenvolveram DesobstruÃÃo ineficaz de vias aÃreas; 86, 8 %, PadrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz; 28, 8 %, Troca de gases prejudicada e 5, 9 %, VentilaÃÃo espontÃnea prejudicada. DesobstruÃÃo ineficaz de vias aÃreas apresentou dispneia, mudanÃa na frequÃncia respiratÃria, mudanÃa no ritmo respiratÃrio, ortopneia, ruÃdos adventÃcios e tosse ineficaz como indicadores mais prevalentes. MudanÃa na frequÃncia respiratÃria, mudanÃa no ritmo respiratÃrio, ortopneia, ruÃdos adventÃcios respiratÃrios, sons respiratÃrios diminuÃdo e tosse ineficaz apresentaram associaÃÃo estatisticamente significante com este diagnÃstico. E ruÃdos adventÃcios respiratÃrios e tosse ineficaz mostraram-se como os indicadores mais acurados. PadrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz apresentou ortopneia, taquipneia e uso da musculatura acessÃria para respirar como os indicadores mais prevalentes. Evidenciou-se associaÃÃo estatisticamente significante de alteraÃÃes na profundidade respiratÃria, taquipneia, uso da musculatura acessÃria e ortopneia com PadrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz. Uso da musculatura acessÃria para respirar, alteraÃÃes da profundidade respiratÃria e ortopneia apresentaram-se como mais acurados para padrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz. Troca de gases prejudicada apresentou dispneia, respiraÃÃo anormal, taquicardia e hipoxemia como os indicadores mais prevalentes. Hipoxemia foi o Ãnico indicador que mostrou associaÃÃo estatisticamente significativa, alÃm de manifestar-se como mais acurado para troca de gases prejudicada. Para VentilaÃÃo espontÃnea prejudicada, dispneia, frequÃncia cardÃaca aumentada e SaO 2 diminuÃda foram os indicadores mais prevalentes. CooperaÃÃo diminuÃda, SaO 2 diminuÃda e uso aumentado da musculatura acessÃria para respirar estiveram associados significativamente com ventilaÃÃo espontÃnea prejudicada e uso aumentado da musculatura acessÃria para respirar apresentou-se com melhor acurÃcia. Para a associaÃÃo entre os diagnÃsticos, desobstruÃÃo ineficaz de vias aÃreas manteve relaÃÃo com padrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz e padrÃo respiratÃrio ineficaz com Troca de gases prejudicada. VentilaÃÃo espontÃnea prejudicada nÃo apresentou associaÃÃo. Acredita-se que o conhecimento do perfil diagnÃstico de populaÃÃes especÃficas possa contribuir para que as intervenÃÃes de enfermagem sejam orientadas por decisÃes diagnÃsticas, facilitando assim, escolha de aÃÃes adequadas. The {{planning to}} lead the care and to support the nursing knowledge in specific clinical situations {{is based on the}} use of accurate nursing diagnoses. The use of good clinical indicators for predicting diagnosis is essential in order to reach this precision. This study aimed at determining the measures of accuracy of clinical indicators for nursing diagnosis, such as: Ineffective airway clearance, Ineffective breathing pattern, Impaired gas exchange and <b>Impaired</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> in asthmatic children through a cross-sectional study held in a secondary level public hospital in Fortaleza (CE), from April to September 2013. The sample consisted of 205 children with asthma whose data were collected through a pulmonary assessment and interviews with their parents. The data were analyzed by the researcher to determine the presence or absence of: Ineffective airway clearance; Ineffective breathing pattern; Impaired gas exchange and <b>Impaired</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> indicators based on a research protocol and then diagnostician nurses analyzed this information for diagnostic inference. For statistical analysis, SPSS and Excel were used with a significance level of 5 %. The study adopted the ethical principles and received the assent of the Federal University of CearÃ Ethics and Research (opinion No. 237. 389 / 13). There was a slight prevalence for males (52. 3 %) and average age of 36 months. 89. 3 % of the children assessed developed Ineffective airway clearance; 86. 8 % developed Ineffective breathing pattern; 28. 8 % developed Impaired gas exchange and 5. 9 % of the children developed <b>Impaired</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Ineffective airway clearance presented dyspnea, change in respiratory rate, change in respiratory rhythm, orthopnea, rales and ineffective cough as the most prevalent indicators. Change in respiratory rate, change in respiratory rhythm, orthopnea, respiratory rales, decreased breath sounds and ineffective cough showed a significant association with this diagnosis whereas ineffective cough and respiratory rales appeared as the most accurate indicators. Ineffective breathing pattern had orthopnea, tachypnea and use of accessory muscles to breathe as the most prevalent indicator. A statistically significant association between changes in respiratory depth, tachypnea, accessory muscle use and orthopnea with Ineffective breathing pattern was also observed in this study. The Use of accessory muscles for breathing, changes in respiratory depth and orthopnea were observed as more accurate for Ineffective breathing pattern. Impaired gas exchange presented dyspnea, abnormal breathing, tachycardia and hypoxemia as the most prevalent indicators. Hypoxemia was the only indicator that showed a statistically significant association, and were seen as more accurate for Impaired gas exchange. For <b>Impaired</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> dyspnea, increased heart rate and decreased SaO 2 were the most prevalent indicators. Decreased cooperation, decreased SaO 2 and increased use of accessory muscles to breathe were significantly associated with <b>Impaired</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> and increased use of accessory muscles to breathe was presented with better accuracy. For the association between diagnoses, Ineffective airway clearance remained related to Ineffective breathing pattern and Impaired gas exchange and Ineffective breathing pattern remained related to Impaired gas exchange. <b>Impaired</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> showed no association. It is believed that knowledge of the diagnostic profile of specific populations may contribute to nursing interventions so that they are guided by diagnostic decisions, thus facilitating the choice of the most appropriate actions...|$|E

30|$|Controlled {{ventilation}} in {{our patient}} with the ETT tip above the fistula would have led to leak through the fistula leading to gastric distension and possible aspiration. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> being negative pressure ventilation does not cause air leak through fistula. Thus, we sorted to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation.</b> In {{the absence of a}} muscle relaxant, deeper anaesthesia levels are required to prevent movement in response to surgical stimulus. Under this condition, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> in the bag mode may lead to apnea/hypopnea and may easily be missed till hypoxia ensues. CPAP+PSV (continuous positive airway pressure + pressure support ventilation) and PSV-pro are the two <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> modes in Avance CS 2 machine. They ensure delivery of adequate tidal volume due to pressure support even when the patient hypoventilates. Further, automatic switch to back up ventilation (when apnea is detected for prescribed time as set in the machine) prevents unattended hypoxia. Application of CPAP also prevents atelectasis which leads to better oxygenation and minimises post-operative complications. In our case, the patient could maintain <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> except for one occasion when back up ventilation was initiated.

Studies {{that address}} the defining characteristics (DC) {{can contribute to the}} improvement of diagnostic reasoning, directly influencing the choice of nursing diagnoses most suitable for clinical situation of the patient. This study examined how nursing diagnoses ineffective breathing pattern (IBP), ineffective airway clearance (IAC), impaired gas exchange (IGE) and <b>impaired</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> (ISV) presented themselves during the post-operative period in children with congenital heart diseases and showed the measures of accuracy of the defining characteristics. It was developed an cohort study in a hospital in the public network in Fortaleza-CE. The sample was consisted of 54 children aged 5 - 17 years with congenital heart diseases in post-operative of cardiac surgery. The children were followed for a minimum period of five and maximum of ten days. To collect the data, it was used an instrument based on the characteristics of the diagnostics studied and some relevant literature about the lung evaluation. The data were collected through examination of the child and interview with their parents. The information obtained were analyzed by the researcher to determine {{the presence or absence of}} DC of nursing diagnoses IBP, IAC, IGE e ISV and data was organized into spreadsheets. After, the spreadsheets were sent to nurses diagnosticians that performed the diagnostic inference process. It was used Excel and PASW software for organizing and analyzing statistical data. The level of significance was 5 %. Among children evaluated, 30 (55, 5 %) developed IAC, 25 (46, 3 %) developed IGE e 21 (38, 8 %) developed IBP during the monitoring period. In order to infer IAC, the DC most accurate was respiratory rales and to IBP the characteristic that presented the highest accuracy measurements was use of accessory muscles to breathe. As for the inference IGE, the characteristic most accurate was hypoxemia. For the nursing diagnosis ISV, was not possible to establish statistically significant accuracy of defining characteristics. Based on the analysis of multiple matches, the best characteristics that assist in differentiating between the diagnoses IBP, IAC e IGE were: change in respiratory rate, excessive amount of mucus, respiratory rales, cough absent and tachypnea to IAC; dyspnea, nasal flaring, change in respiratory rate and use of accessory muscles breathing to IBP e carbon dioxide decreased, abnormal arterial blood gases, abnormal arterial pH e PO 2 decreased to IGE. The results helped identify the DC more representative of IBP, IAC e IGE in children with congenital heart diseases in post-operative period.

30|$|COMFORT {{scale and}} COMFORT {{behaviour}} scale {{are the only}} validated sedation scales for mechanically ventilated children. COMFORT-B scale includes 6 behavioural items which are state of awakening, levels of agitation, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation,</b> characteristics of movements, muscular tone, and faces. Contrary to original COMFORT scale, it does not contain physiological items.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Tracheobronchial {{foreign body}} {{aspiration}} {{is a common}} life-threatening condition in children. There are controversies {{in the management of}} this condition, including the type of ventilation during bronchoscopy.  This study aims to compare anesthesia with controlled <b>ventilation</b> versus <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> in rigid bronchoscopy in children with foreign body aspiration.  Materials and Methods: Patients who were candidates for rigid bronchoscopy due to foreign body aspiration were randomly assigned to either anesthesia with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> or controlled ventilation. End tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2), electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO 2), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and complications and accidents during the surgery and recovery were recorded for each patient. Surgeon comfort during the procedure was also evaluated for each patient. A 20 % change in HR or NIBP was considered significant. SpO 2 values under 90 % are considered desaturation.  Results: Fifty-one patients (31 male and 20 female) entered the study. The mean age was 26. 76 months, ranging from 6 to 100 months. Choking and cough were present in 94 % and 96. 1 % of the patients, respectively. Nuts were the most common foreign body (76. 9 %). The controlled ventilation group had significantly fewer complications, and surgeon comfort was significantly higher in this group. Oxygen desaturation was significantly more prevalent in the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> group during laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (...|$|R
40|$|Background: Induction {{of general}} {{anesthesia}} {{in a patient}} with compromised airway has always caused dilemma to anesthesiologist, especially for toddler this is paramounted. Case Presentation: An 18 month old boy had a huge sized lingual mass which not only filled entire oral cavity but protruded outside the mouth up to about 5 cm. Having in mind the diagnosis of hemangioma, prior to induction it was attempted to reduce the mass but could be reduced only minimally by manual decompression. While the tongue, still outside the mouth, with full preparedness for anesthesia was induced maintaining the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation.</b> During laryngoscopy and intubation the tongue was {{pulled out of the}} oral cavity to ease the passage of the endotracheal tube. The mass was excised successfully and patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Conclusion: Maintenance of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> is the crucial safety element during induction...|$|R
30|$|Introduction Ventilator {{support is}} {{frequent}} after pediatric cardiac surgery, but high airway pressures can be detrimental on right ventricular function and pulmonary blood flow. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a mode that improves patient–ventilator interactions, thus helping to maintain <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The use of NAVA after pediatric cardiac surgery has been seldom studied.|$|R

The presentation describes the airway management of a 2 -year-old child suffering from FMD with significant retrognathia, posted for major long bone corrective osteotomy.

30|$|In all phases, {{reference}} RR {{was measured}} continuously using both electrical thoracic impedance (ECG-RR) and chronometric evaluation (Manual-RR) over a 30 -s period, under <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ventilation</b> or ventilatory rate (Ventilator-RR) for patients under ventilatory assistance. We {{considered as a}} reference the mean RR value over three consecutive measurements, taken each 15  min, during a mean 60 -min duration, by a dedicated research assistant.|$|R
