5|$|Thorpe {{began his}} {{athletic}} career at Carlisle in 1907 when <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> {{the track and}} beat all the school's high jumpers with an impromptu 5-ft 9-in jump still in street clothes. His earliest recorded track and field results come from 1907. He also competed in football, baseball, lacrosse and even ballroom dancing, winning the 1912 intercollegiate ballroom dancing championship.|$|E
2500|$|According to Vautin, {{he earned}} his {{nickname}} [...] "Fatty" [...] soon after joining Manly in 1979. While being shown around Brookvale Oval by club secretary Ken Arthurson, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> retired Manly premiership captain Fred Jones who was in conversation with club and Kangaroos fullback Graham Eadie. Jones asked Eadie [...] "Who is that fatty?", and the name stuck.|$|E
2500|$|Faldo had a {{reputation}} for being an insular character who did not engage in any of the usual social courtesies. He generally kept other players at arm's length. Faldo was described as having [...] "an intense focus that peers found less than endearing." [...] In 2002, Faldo's former Ryder Cup colleague Sandy Lyle said: [...] "I've never known Nick. If <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> me right now, he wouldn't stop to talk. He wouldn't even say hello." ...|$|E
50|$|The video {{features}} frontman Kevin Palmer {{walking down}} a street leaving everything <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> being blown by a massive gust of wind. It found significant airplay on MTV2.|$|R
50|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In The Trouble with Harry, he can be seen 21 minutes into the film as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> a parked limousine while an old man looks at paintings for sale at the roadside stand.|$|R
6000|$|LENTULUS (indicating Lavinia, who {{is still}} looking towards the arches after the captain). That woman's got a figure. (<b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> her, staring at her invitingly, but she is preoccupied and is not {{conscious}} of him). Do you turn the other cheek when they kiss you? ...|$|R
2500|$|Inmates emptied their toilet buckets over {{soldiers}} who had thrown the Koran on the dirt floor. After the arrival of General Geoffrey Miller in late 2002 (the abuse by the military was reported as considerably worsened during his command), the inmates coordinated a welcome, emptying their buckets of excrement on him as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> their cages. [...] Thereafter inmates called him [...] "Mr. Toilet." [...] For dumping excrement on General Miller, Kurnaz reported prisoners received an extra month of solitary confinement. Later the cellblock was subject to reduced rations, which were halved for about forty days.|$|E
2500|$|Yu Fan {{was from}} Yuyao County (餘姚縣), Kuaiji Commandery, {{which is in}} present-day Yuyao, Zhejiang. At a young age, he was already known for being studious and extraordinary. When he was 11, a guest who came to visit his elder brother ignored the young Yu Fan when <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> him. Yu Fan later wrote to the guest, [...] "I heard that amber does not contain rotten plant {{material}} and that magnets do not attract bent needles. Is it not appropriate for you to ignore me when you walked past me?" [...] The guest was very surprised after reading Yu Fan's letter. Yu Fan attracted greater attention after this incident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{deposition}} of the Ngô brothers {{was greeted with}} widespread joy by the South Vietnamese public. Large spontaneous street demonstrations took place. The offices of the Times of Vietnam, the Ngô family's propaganda mouthpiece, were burned. Elsewhere, the crowd smashed windows and ransacked any building associated with Nhu. The tension released by {{the downfall of the}} regime sparked off celebrations similar to Lunar New Year celebrations. Americans were treated and received with great enthusiasm and Lodge was mobbed by the Saigon public and it was joked that Lodge would win any Vietnamese election by a landslide. Lodge recommended immediate recognition of the new regime by Washington, asserting that the popular approval of the Vietnamese for the coup warranted it. Lodge reported: [...] "Every Vietnamese has a grin on his face today". The crowds swarmed onto the grounds of Gia Long Palace in a carnival atmosphere, punctuated by celebratory ARVN gunfire, while a sea of Buddhist flags flew throughout the city. As Lodge traveled from his residence to the US embassy, the crowds cheered his convoy, and when <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> the Xá Lợi Pagoda, the focal point of violent government raids by Nhu's Special Forces on 21 August which had left a large death toll, he was mobbed by jubilant Buddhists. The people were very happy with the soldiers, giving them fruit, flowers and garlands of roses.|$|E
50|$|Beginning with Super Bowl XL, {{a special}} Lombardi Trophy {{ceremony}} takes place. A former NFL player, usually a past Super Bowl MVP or notable {{figure of the}} host city's franchise, brings the Lombardi Trophy {{to the center of}} the stadium, as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> members of the winning team.|$|R

50|$|Directed by Bertrand Lee, {{the music}} video {{opens with a}} bokeh and later sharpens to reveal band member David Tan. The camera then traces him around the {{downtown}} core of Singapore at dawn as <b>he</b> <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> activities of daily life. He ends up at Marina Barrage by morning, performing with the band for the song's finale.|$|R
2500|$|Cary wrote [...] "there was {{not doubt}} of the {{legality}} of the catch", Jack Fingleton called it [...] "one of the most unfortunate decisions {{in the history of the}} Tests." [...] and most English pressmen shared their view. However, E.W. Swanton reported [...] "The Don waited for the decision, confident that it was a bump ball, and the umpire Borwick, ruled 'not out'". In the Australian dressing rooms the players were divided as to whether he was out or not. When Bradman returned at the end of the session he said he had played down on a yorker and to Ray Lindwall there was no doubt as to his sincerity. In the end the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt, but it had repercussions. Bradman recovered his form and hit 159 runs in 160 minutes before he was out for 187, which set up Australia's victory in the First Test by an innings and 332 runs. This was a morale-booster for a young team with eight debutants, but if Bradman had been out the Australian total would have been less, England would have batted on a flat wicket and the thunderstorm that wrecked the wicket would have caught Australia in their second innings. 'As <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> Bradman at the end of the over Hammond glared at Bradman and said tensely, [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series"'. The England captain was furious that Bradman had not walked in what was supposed to be a post-war goodwill tour and refused to talk to him for the rest of the series except to call the toss. To the press he was more diplomatic [...] "I thought it was a catch but the umpire may have been right and I may have been wrong" [...] Bradman, 38 years old and suffering from fibrositis, had been advised not to play by his doctor and a cheap dismissal might have made him retire, especially if he had been caught on a sticky wicket in the second innings. Keith Miller later wrote [...] "that decision was subsequently admitted in nearly every quarter to have been erroneous".|$|E
2500|$|By 28 May several witness reports {{had been}} {{received}} by the police. One sighting of Nelson, at 5.15pm, reported {{that she had been}} with a man who was [...] "very drunk" [...] and was being violent towards her, [...] "punching her on the head". Another witness said he saw Nelson walk past his garden in Newmains {{in the company of a}} man with a tattooed face. A third witness had seen Nelson and a man of similar appearance in Newmains, and said: [...] "He just looked angry," [...] punching a lamp post as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> and saying he was going to [...] "kill some cunt tonight." [...] One witness said he had overheard the man, who was [...] "angry and agitated," [...] saying that he would [...] "end up killing someone tonight." [...] Another witness heard him tell Nelson: [...] "This is all your fucking fault" [...] while pointing angrily in her face. A fourteen-year-old girl also saw the pair together [...] "boozing behind Newmains Asda." [...] She said he was bare-chested and sunburnt and told her his name was [...] "Rab Bayne" [...] and had [...] "asked me to rate his body, like out of ten." [...] She described how the pair were drinking alcohol that they claimed was stolen – the male drinking tequila and Nelson drinking vodka. A passer-by reported seeing Nelson with a man with a facial tattoo outside the Scotmid store in Newmains, where she was rubbing suntan lotion into his sunburned back which was [...] "red as a lobster". He said: [...] "She didn't look too happy. I thought it was a boyfriend-girlfriend thing. They must have got something in the shop, sun tan lotion, because as they were walking away the girl was rubbing something onto his shoulders." [...] A shirtless, sunburned man with a tattooed face was also seen [...] "wandering aimlessly" [...] in Cambusnethan on the evening of 22 May, attracting the attention of a family who had gathered to watch the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final on television. One of the group said: [...] "What attracted attention was his hairstyle and his back was very, very red from the sun." [...] Police also received information that Robert Bayne had telephoned an acquaintance on 24 May and asked for help to [...] "batter" [...] the last people to see Nelson. Crucially, the call was made before the body had been identified. The witness said: [...] "He asked me to help him batter [...] I don't know why he said this because we didn't know it was Zoe who was found." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{momentary}} faintness {{came upon}} him. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> {{and down the}} street, returned and surveyed the shop again.|$|E
5000|$|As {{in most of}} {{the episodes}} (except 7 and 10), Artur Barciś plays a cameo-observer role, this time as a young man rowing across the river and then {{carrying}} his boat away after exchanging glances with Anka. Later, in the scene in which Anka admits having written a fake letter, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> again with his boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle Lange," [...] said Armand boldly, as without {{hesitation}} <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> quickly <b>past</b> the lodge making {{straight for the}} stairs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Noel Clarke {{walking around the}} British countryside and encountering or creating The Prodigy's [...] "ant" [...] logo. Among other places, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> the acoustic mirrors at Denge {{and at the end}} he is standing on one of the Maunsell Forts in the Thames Estuary. For a few seconds, you can see the band in the video.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't you speak?" [...] he said, after a moment's pause. [...] "What are {{you looking}} at me like that for? Stop! Let's say our say in the other room." [...] <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> me towards the door, and half opened it.|$|E
60|$|The dogs {{had lain}} {{down in the}} snow, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> them to join his partner in the sled. Together they watched the strange animal that had pursued them for days and that had already {{accomplished}} the destruction of half their dog-team.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> {{the couch}} {{to the open}} window, and held up the {{drooping}} stalk of a moss-rose, {{looking down at the}} dainty blend of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural objects.|$|E
25|$|The video depicts Yamaguchi in {{a darkened}} room, behind a row of naked women who are lying {{down on the ground}} in a line. He traces the {{contours}} that their bodies made, as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> the bodies. These scenes are interspersed with footage of Tokyo. In the final scene, a wider top-down angle shows that the naked women are spelling out the word eureka in capital letters.|$|R
50|$|One day he's {{walking home}} from band practice, and <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> the school gymnasium, right past varsity {{basketball}} practice. The coach {{looks up and sees}} him and takes in the size (6-foot-3, 190 pounds). The kid passes the eye test, so the coach stops him and asks him why he's not playing - basketball, that is, not the cornet."Well, I've never played, and I'm not very coordinated", the kid says.|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> {{her into}} the hall, and the little manservant {{suddenly}} materialised {{in the middle of}} the space and came forward to brush him obsequiously. Lady Harman regarded that proceeding for some moments in a preoccupied manner and then passed slowly into the classical conservatory. She felt that in view of her engagements the discussion of Lady Beach-Mandarin was only just beginning.|$|E
60|$|Cavanagh {{found the}} street empty, silent, and utterly commonplace. And as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> Halsey's saloon the tumult {{of the night}} seemed born of a vision in disordered sleep--and yet it had happened! From these reeking little dens a score of foul tatterdemalions had issued, charged with {{malicious}} fury. Each of these shacks seemed the lurking-place of a species of malevolent insect whose sting was out for every comer.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{had seen}} his wife and Mrs Davidson, their deck-chairs close together, in earnest {{conversation}} for about two hours. As <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> them backwards and forwards {{for the sake of}} exercise, he had heard Mrs Davidson's agitated whisper, like the distant flow of a mountain torrent, and he saw by his wife's open mouth and pale face that she was enjoying an alarming experience. At night in their cabin she repeated to him with bated breath all she had heard.|$|E
40|$|Midway {{through the}} third week of the {{election}} campaign the main street of Orange, in mid-western New South Wales, is quiet, untouched by any sign of election fever. Peter Andren, the federal member for Calare, is walking along Summer Street, the main shopping strip, and there’s not much in his demeanour to suggest that he has much to worry about on 9 October. People nod as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past,</b> some of them approaching him for a short, friendly chat...|$|R
5000|$|After his discharge, Cash {{returns to}} the United States and marries his girlfriend Vivian Liberto. The couple moves to Memphis, Tennessee, where Cash works as a {{door-to-door}} salesman to support his growing family. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> a recording studio, which inspires him to organize a band to play gospel music. Cash's band auditions for Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records. After they play [...] "Folsom Prison Blues", the band receives a contract, and launch to stardom {{at the beginning of}} the rock and roll craze.|$|R
50|$|Laing also {{considered}} {{of the way}} 'in typical paranoid ideas of reference, the person feels that the murmurings and mutterings he hears as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> a street crowd are about him. In a bar, a burst of laughter behind his back is at some joke cracked about him' that deeper acquaintance with the patient reveals in fact that 'what tortures him {{is not so much}} his delusions of reference, but his harrowing suspicion that he is of no importance to anyone, that no one is referring to him at all'.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> {{away from}} it, {{with his eyes}} {{regarding}} it, and then turned and came back. He passed through a further indecision, and finally drifted away to the sea front {{and sat down on}} a seat a little way along the Leas and put his arm over the back and regarded [...] "Hughenden." [...] He whistled an air very softly to himself, put his head first on one side and then on the other. Then for a space he scowled fixedly at it.|$|E
60|$|He was, up to {{a certain}} point, the kindest and truest of amigos; then his weird seizure came, and the baby was spilled out of the {{carriage}} he had been so benevolently pushing up and down; or the second officer's legs, as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> with the prettiest girl on board, were hit with the stick that the amigo had been innocently playing shuffle-board with; or some passenger was taken unawares in his vanity or infirmity and made to contribute to the amigo's passion for active amusement.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a brief}} pause. Arnold, having {{asked his}} question, was looking at his companion, half in horror, half in pity. Isaac, white with passion, seemed unable for the moment to make any intelligible reply. Then, drawing in his breath as though with an effort, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> Arnold and {{stood for a moment}} on the {{threshold}} of the door, listening intently. Satisfied, apparently, that {{there was nothing to be}} heard save the usual street noises, he closed the door softly and came back into the room.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>he</b> had <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> his mother’s backyard, Rector put his {{gun to his}} own {{temple and}} fired. Rector was quickly {{discovered}} by other police officers and taken to the local hospital. The shot had destroyed Rector’s frontal lobe.|$|R
60|$|Wampus did not halt. His {{eyes fixed}} upon the bandit's ugly features, still puffing his cigar and with {{hands in his}} pockets <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> {{deliberately}} <b>past</b> Patsy and Beth and straight up to the muzzles of the revolvers.|$|R
