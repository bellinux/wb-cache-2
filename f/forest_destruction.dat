5|$|The {{greatest}} concern facing lemur populations is habitat destruction and degradation. Deforestation {{takes the form}} of local subsistence use, such as slash and burn agriculture (referred to as tavy in Malagasy), the creation of pasture for cattle through burning, and legal and illegal gathering of wood for firewood or charcoal production; commercial mining; and the illegal logging of precious hardwoods for foreign markets. After centuries of unsustainable use, as well as rapidly escalating <b>forest</b> <b>destruction</b> since 1950, less than 60,000km2 (23,000sq mi) or 10% of Madagascar's land area remains forested. Only 17,000km2 (6,600sq mi) or 3% of the island's land area is protected and due to dire economic conditions and political instability, most of the protected areas are ineffectively managed and defended. Some protected areas were set aside because they were naturally protected by their remote, isolated location, often on steep cliffs. Other areas, such as the dry forests and spiny forests of the west and south, receive little protection and are in serious danger of being destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Powerful {{thunderstorms}} affected {{parts of}} Ontario and Quebec on July 17 and July 30 in Peterborough, in eastern Ontario(Ottawa area) {{in the early}} morning hours of August 1 and again in Quebec, centred around Montreal that same evening. More than 450,000people lost power in Quebec in that storm. On August 2, more storms associated with a relieving cool front caused heavy damage over a wide swath of central and eastern Ontario, resulting in 175,000 residents losing power and thousands of felled trees blocking roads. Seventeen tornadoes were confirmed for August 2–3 ranging from F0-F2 in strength, the largest single day tornado outbreak in Ontario eclipsing the 14 recorded during a 1985 outbreak. The intensity of these storms was fueled by the heat bubble to the south. These series of storms killed at least four people and injured many others, in addition to extensive property damage and <b>forest</b> <b>destruction.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2005 Iran’s {{forest area}} totaled about 11 million hectares, {{approximately}} 7 {{percent of the}} country’s surface area. Adequate rainfall and a favorable climate have created 1.5 million hectares of dense forest in the Caspian region. The remainder is distributed among western forests (3.6 million hectares), southern forests (434,000 hectares), desert forests (620,000 hectares), and forests scattered in other locations. Supervised by the Department of Natural Resources, the Caspian forests produced 820,000 cubic meters of timber products in 2004, more than 90 percent of which was for industrial use. The largest and most valuable woodland areas are in the Caspian region and the northern slopes of the Elburz Mts., {{where many of the}} forests are commercially exploitable and include both hardwoods and softwoods. Although forests and pastures are nationalized and 12 percent of forested land is nominally protected, <b>forest</b> <b>destruction</b> by the private sector is routine. Limited forest areas, mismanagement, and destruction have compelled Iran to import lumber and wood products. In addition, forest fires destroy 20,000 hectares of forest area each year. Between 1954 and 2004, an estimated 41 percent of Iran’s forest land was lost. According to the former director of Iran’s Department of Environment (Iran), the rate of destruction of forestland amounts to 100,000 hectares per year. The cutting of trees is rigidly controlled by the government, which also has a reforestation program.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} given in 1915, Rothrock {{recalled}} {{the forests of}} his youth: [...] "Sixty years ago I walked from Clearfield to St. Marys; thence to Smethport -- 60miles; {{most of the way}} through glorious white pine and hemlock forests. Now these forests are gone." [...] In describing the forest conditions of 1915 he said, [...] "6,400 square miles; more than 4 million acres [...] of the state are desolated, cut and unprotected from fire." [...] He compared Pennsylvania's forests to similar <b>forest</b> <b>destruction</b> in China. He worried that, [...] "unless we reforest, Pennsylvania's highlands will wash into the oceans."

2500|$|In the mid-1980s, {{acid rain}} and sudden <b>forest</b> <b>destruction</b> renewed debate {{on whether or}} not a general speed limit should be imposed on autobahns. A car's fuel {{consumption}} increases with high speed, and fuel conservation is a key factor in reducing air pollution. Environmentalists argued that enforcing limits of [...] limit on autobahns and [...] on other rural roads would save lives as well as the forest, reducing the annual death toll by 30% (250 lives) on autobahns and 15% (1000 lives) on rural roads; the German motor vehicle death toll was about 10,000 at the time. The Federal Government sponsored a large-scale experiment with a [...] speed limit in order to measure the impact of reduced speeds on emissions and compliance. Afterward, again, the Federal Government declined to impose a mandatory limit, deciding the modest measured emission reduction would have no meaningful effect on forest loss. By 1987 all restrictions on test sections had been removed, even in Hesse where the state government was controlled by a [...] "red-green" [...] coalition.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{complaints}} in 1925 regarding crop and <b>forest</b> <b>destruction</b> {{as a result}} of smoke from the smelter, COMINCO accepted responsibility and offered to compensate the farmers who were affected. COMINCO also proposed installing fume-controlling technologies to limit future damage and reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide. [...] The company had initially raised smoke stacks to four hundred feet in an effort to increase the dispersion of pollutants; however, this had resulted in prevailing winds moving the noxious fumes downwind to the inhabitants of the Columbia River Valley, thereby making the situation worse. The company also tried to offer payments to the affected residents or even offered to purchase the land outright, which some would have accepted. [...] However, the company was denied this method of compensation because of Washington State's prohibition of property ownership by foreigners. This led to the official petition by the farmers and landowners of Washington in 1927 for state and federal support against the smelter, claiming the smoke was damaging United States lands. In 1931, the IJC awarded the farmers $350,000 in damages, but did not set guidelines for sulphur dioxide emission reduction. The compensation was far less than the plaintiffs had expected and the IJC settlement was eventually rejected under the pressure of Washington's State Congressional Delegation. [...] The unsatisfactory result of the IJC decision led to the establishment of a three-person Arbitral Tribunal to resolve the dispute in 1935.|$|E

40|$|In {{tropical}} Africa {{the transition}} from the Middle Holocene (ca. 7000 to 3800 years BP) climate to the Late Holocene (ca. 3800 BP to present) was abrupt and marked by major paleoenvironmental shifts. The sediment and lake level changes in forested equatorial belt of tropical Africa, in the Sahel and Sahara and in the tropical areas of other continents (India, Australia and South America) are interpreted in terms of paleoclimate based on comparison made between the African paleodata and some present-day rainfall anomalies. These anomalies are associated with sea surface temperature (SST) variations and are closely linked to the intensity of upwelling and trade winds. We conclude that the abrupt changes in the tropical belt {{at the beginning of the}} Late Holocene could be related to the variation of the Zonal Walker Circulation, mainly the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The SST opposition between northern and southern Atlantic Ocean has a major influence on climatic changes in tropical Africa. Moreover, the predicted global warming during the next century could lead in tropical Africa to climate induced large rain <b>forest</b> <b>destructions.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} written {{accounts of}} <b>forest</b> <b>destruction</b> in Southern Europe begin around 1000 BC in {{the histories of}} Homer, Thucydides and Plato and in Strabo's Geography. Forests were exploited for ship building, and urban development, the manufacture of casks, pitch and charcoal, {{as well as being}} cleared for agriculture. The intensification of trade {{and as a result of}} warfare, increased the demand for ships which were manufactured completely from forest products. Although goat herding is singled out as an important cause of environmental degradation, a more important cause of <b>forest</b> <b>destruction</b> was the practice in some places of granting ownership rights to those who clear felled forests and brought the land into permanent cultivation. Evidence that circumstances other than agriculture were the major causes for <b>forest</b> <b>destruction</b> was the recovery of tree cover in many parts of the Roman empire from 400 BC to around 500 AD following the collapse of Roman economy and industry. Darby observes that by 400 AD [...] "land that had once been tilled became derelict and overgrown" [...] and quotes Lactantius who wrote that in many places [...] "cultivated land became forest" [...] (Darby 1956, 186). The other major cause of <b>forest</b> <b>destruction</b> in the Mediterranean environment with its hot dry summers were wild fires that became more common following human interference in the forests.|$|E
