500|$|Ripken spent 1960 {{with the}} Fox Cities Foxes of the Class B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, {{known as the}} Three-I League. He had his best season that year, batting a career-high [...]281 with 100 hits, nine home runs, and 74 RBI. Earl Weaver, {{eventually}} a Hall of Fame manager for the Orioles but manager of Fox Cities in 1960, recalled, [...] "He was hitting over [...]300 until our team bus driver quit and Cal started doing his job, too. The 15-hour bus trips were strenuous work, but Rip always was hard as nails -- toughness personified." [...] During spring training in 1961, he suffered an injury after several foul tips went off his shoulder. Initial X-rays showed nothing, but three months into the season {{it was discovered that}} Ripken had a dislocated shoulder, an atrophied deltoid muscle, and a tendon problem. He continued to play, but the injury was one which would take years to fully recover from, and his son, Cal Jr., wrote, [...] "Practically speaking, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> wanted to stay in the game he'd have to shift his sights from playing to coaching and managing." [...] He played with three teams in 1961: the Class D Leesburg Orioles of the Florida State League, the Double-A Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, and the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings of the International League. The stint with Rochester came because the Red Wings were in desperate need of a catcher; although Ripken could catch and handle pitchers, the injury had robbed him of the ability to throw well. He appeared in 58 games with the Class D Appleton Foxes in 1962, and played his final games in 1964, when made two appearances for the Class A Aberdeen Pheasants of the Northern League.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, King's son, Martin Luther King III, {{was quoted as}} being pleased with the sternness of the depiction, saying that [...] "Well <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was not confrontational, given what he was facing at the time, what else could he be?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Owen F. Bieber {{was born}} in December 1929 to Albert F. and Minnie (Schwartz) Bieber in the hamlet of North Dorr, Dorr Township, Michigan. His father was of German {{ethnicity}} and an autoworker at McInerney Spring and Wire Company (an automotive parts supplier) who had co-founded UAW Local 687. It was the first UAW local organized within the city limits of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The family were devout Roman Catholics, and Bieber attended Visitation Elementary School (a two-room school) and Catholic Central High School in nearby Grand Rapids. As a child, he worked pulling weeds in onion and celery fields. He {{graduated from high school}} in 1948, and in July of that year took a job at McInernery Spring and Wire as a wire bender (making seats for Cadillac and Hudson cars). [...] "You had to bend 8- and 9-gauge spring wire, sometimes five wires at a time. Those Hudsons, they had a seat four miles long... It was a hard job. After the first hour in there, I felt like just leaving. <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> hadn't worked there, too, I probably would've", he later said.|$|E
6000|$|... "The dear soul {{thought she}} was doing a {{wonderful}} thing for me when she made me an artist, but perhaps, after all, {{it would have been}} better for me <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> will had prevailed and I were now but an honest carpenter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No, thanks!” replied Aynsley. “I {{must get}} back before I’m missed. There’d be trouble <b>if</b> <b>my</b> irascible <b>father</b> guessed why I’d come here.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A French vessel, {{employed}} in the timber trade," [...] he said, still speaking to himself--"a French vessel, named La Grace de Dieu. <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> belief had been the right belief--if the fatality had been following me, step by step, from <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> grave, in one or other of my voyages, I should have fallen in with that ship." [...] He looked up again at Mr. Brock. [...] "I am quite sure about it now," [...] he said. [...] "Those women are two, and not one." ...|$|R
2500|$|McCaughey died of {{lung cancer}} on 8 February 2006. He was {{believed}} to have contracted cancer over a year previously and was thought to be in remission after treatment. The local Ballymena Times reported, [...] "McCaughey apparently underwent a 'Road To Damascus' style conversion - supporting the peace process and leading a campaign against Neo Nazis". A tribute was also reported from a leading Irish Trade Unionist Peter Bunting. Bunting's father was once held at gun point by McCaughey in 1971 due to the fact he was a Catholic and was forced to leave his job. Bunting stated [...] "Billy McCaughey was prepared to kill for what he saw as his people. At the end of his days, he had lived for more people than he could have ever dreamed about in 1971. I would also like to think that, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> had lived long enough to witness the full life of Billy McCaughey, then he too would have recognised him as a brother and a comrade." [...] David Ervine described him as having an [...] "immense effect on people's attitudes." [...] He was buried in his native Ahoghill.|$|E
60|$|Const. Yes, {{and that}} very privately; <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> know it, I am undone.|$|E

6000|$|JOHNNY. Oh yes I was: I know I was. Well, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> blessed <b>father</b> {{had come}} in he'd have told me to control myself. As if I was losing my temper on purpose! ...|$|R
60|$|This puzzled me yet more; and {{a thought}} coming into my head, I asked <b>if</b> he and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> had been twins.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good God!' said Miss Bertram hastily to Sampson, ''t is that wretch Glossin's voice! <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> sees him, it {{will kill}} him outright!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The prisoner, {{standing}} between his two guards, gripped his stocking cap nervously. [...] "Will you please to tell me, sir, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> is killed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then why do {{you want}} to have a fuss, and a bother, and a chatter? <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and mother don't approve, they can telegraph.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot exactly answer," [...] {{replied the}} apprentice. [...] "Perhaps never, <b>if</b> such be <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> pleasure," [...] {{continued}} Conachar, with assumed indifference.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{hear you}} are an {{official}} personage--I ought to say, perhaps, a retired official personage. We might have received you more respectfully, <b>if</b> both <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> daughters had been present at the station. It's not my fault that my sister was not with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That’ll do," [...] said Annis decidedly; [...] "if it {{was good}} enough for <b>my</b> <b>father</b> it is good enough for me. <b>If</b> it wasn’t <b>my</b> <b>father</b> I may learn {{something}} about him. Is it far?" ...|$|R
60|$|Fred. What an unlucky {{accident}} is this! <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> should discover her, she's ruined: If he does not, yet I {{have lost}} her conversation to-night.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} forget him," [...] she replied. [...] "That {{part of life}} is finished, but <b>if</b> ever <b>my</b> <b>father</b> can spare me, I shall {{go back to my}} work again. Sometimes those work the best and {{accomplish}} the most who carry the scars of a great wound." ...|$|R
60|$|How {{much the}} love of <b>my</b> <b>father</b> may still have swayed her I do not know. But to me it seems that in what next she did there was more of duty, more of penitence, more of {{reparation}} for the sin of having been a woman as God made her, than of love. Indeed, I almost know this to be so. In delicate health as she was, she bade her people prepare a litter for her, and so she had herself carried into Piacenza, to the Church of St. Augustine. There, having confessed and received the Sacrament, upon her knees before a minor altar consecrated to St. Monica, she made solemn vow that <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> life was spared she would devote the unborn child she carried {{to the service of}} God and Holy Church.|$|R

6000|$|... "What {{can have}} become of Doctor Rochecliffe?" [...] said Alice; [...] "he {{that is so}} ready with advice;--where can they be gone? Oh, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> could but rouse himself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are no flatterer, Tuscarora, as I {{have always}} {{found in our}} intercourse. <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> ever punished you with severity, you will allow, me, at least, to imagine it was merited." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Flora,' {{returned}} Alexander, 'a pound note won't see us very far; and besides, this is <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> business, and I {{shall be}} very much surprised <b>if</b> it isn't <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who pays for it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Killed! That {{magnificent}} fellow! Ah, I forgot. Sally, my wits are sadly mixed. I {{ought to}} be glad <b>if</b> somebody kills <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> defamer. But, oh, I can't be! ...|$|R
60|$|DEAR SIR,--My father {{received}} your {{favour of}} the both current, {{and as he}} has been for some months very poorly in health, and is in his own opinion (and, indeed, in almost every body's else) in a dying condition, he has only, with great difficulty, written a few farewell lines to each of his brothers-in-law. For this melancholy reason, I now hold the pen for him to thank you for your kind letter, and to assure you, Sir, that it shall not be <b>my</b> fault <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> correspondence in the north die with him. My brother writes to John Caird,[6] and to him I must refer you for the news of our family.|$|R
60|$|Sir ANTHONY To please my father! zounds! not to please--Oh, my father--odd so!--yes--yes; <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> indeed had desired--that's {{quite another}} matter. Though he wa'n't the indulgent father that I am, Jack.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know this,' said Mrs. Doncastle, {{in great}} anger, 'that <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{had been in}} the room, I should not have let the fact pass unnoticed, and treated him like a stranger!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it may be}} appeased. <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{has done}} you this injustice, show him how an Indian can forgive an injury, and take back his daughters. You have heard from Major Heyward--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never dreamed," [...] Margaret declared, as {{she looked}} around her, [...] "that I should ever find myself inside this house. It has always seemed to me like one great bluebeard's chamber. <b>If</b> ever <b>my</b> <b>father</b> spoke of it at all, it was as of a place which he {{intended}} to convert {{into a sort of}} miniature Hell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"At Aquae Solis," [...] I said. It was {{perfectly}} true.
