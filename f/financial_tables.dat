In the globalised world, changes happen in activities of companies as in many fields with the help of developments in information and communication technologies. Companies have been starting activities globally and the number of multinational companies has been increasing, and in this context, the movements of goods, service and capital have been passing the national borders. Globalization has affected the science of accounting as the other disciplines. Depending on these developments, the applications of accountancy which is used at national level before have been inadequate in providing information that the users of <b>financial</b> <b>tables</b> have required. Works that were launched to solve this problem in developed countries resulted in the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which have been gradually adopted by other countries as the common language of accounting.

The results are obtained from the answers given to the questionnaire by financ ial executives of the firms. The current capital structure of the firms and their association with the growth opportunities are cross-examined by referring to data from ISE database. The {{results suggest that the}} firms avoid using long term debt and they prefer shorter maturity for corporate debt. An expected negative relationship between debt usage and growth opportunities is not found for the firms. Most of the firms confirm that, they set a target capital structure for future and they fo llow it systematically when they finance investments. Furthermore, majority of firms in the sample emphasize that they plan to increase the portion of long term debt in their target capital structure and this is validated after controlling the <b>financial</b> <b>tables</b> of the firms for the next year.

40|$|Empirical {{research}} studies of finance have investigated students' performance in Principles of Finance courses {{and the effect}} of class attendance on students' performance. Similarly, accounting research has been directed at readability of accounting narratives and lexical choices. However, no published study has explored and analysed the multimodal literacy and numeracy social practices of international students in a core business module, and within a multidimensional research framework. This study is of interest as most international ESL/EFL students in Australia and elsewhere are enrolled in business programmes. This paper explores the literacy and numeracy social practices of 10 first-year Master of Commerce Accounting international students in a Principles of Finance module. It is underpinned by the proposed multidimensional framework which is framed by Halliday's systemic functional linguistic theory and by O'Halloran's multisemiotic framework for the analysis of mathematical symbolism. The findings are presented in terms of (1) the epistemologies of Principles of Finance, (2) a Systemic Functional Multimodal Discourse Analysis (SF-MDA) of the experiential meanings in students' capital budgeting management reports, and (3) a description of the actual practices the participants engaged with to complete the assignment and their explanations of their texts. Implications of these findings and the research framework presented. The SF-MDA contributes to the description of experiential meaning in <b>financial</b> <b>tables</b> and graphs. It indicates a potential research tool for the systemic functional analysis of multimodal finance and accounting discourses. The multidimensional exploration of participants' literacy practices presented here could also provide a framework for similar investigation across a broad range of educational settings.

The regular collection of revenues in municipalities, while making expenditures in most efficient ways depend on the healthy functioning of the budget and accounting and the financial control system correspondingly. In is necessary for municipalities to continuously control the balance of incomes and expenses, determining and eliminating the negativities in this balance.

40|$|The author uses an {{input-output}} (I-O) {{approach to}} derive internationally comparable estimates of GNP for the 15 {{economies of the}} Former Soviet Union (FSU). The commonly accepted measure of economic output of GDP or GNP based on the System of National Accounts (SNA) cannot be readily estimated for these economies because relevant statistical reporting systems {{have yet to be}} set up to replace the system used historically - the Material Product System (MPS). The author's three-tier approach improves on the short-cut method of bridge tables (from MPS to SNA) by integrating additional financial data and using the inherent cross-checks of I-O tables. The three steps in the process are to: (1) analyze the official 20 -sector MPS-type I-O tables; (2) integrate financial data on services, etc., from National Economic Balance (NEB) tables; and (3) convert the I-O table derived from the integrated NEB tables to SNA forms. The author resolves inconsistencies between Goskomstat I-O tables for the overall FSU accounts and those for the 15 individual FSU economies by drawing on data from other <b>financial</b> <b>tables.</b> The main adjustments are in inter-republic trade, which is included in individual FSU economies'I-Os, but not in the overall I-O for the FSU, and for unplanned sectors (military, police, and so on). Additional adjustments necessary to estimate GNP from net material product - such as inclusion of nonmaterial services - are explicitly shown in the appropriate I-O sectors. Appendices report details on these and other adjustments, notably the apportionment and reevaluation of inter-republic trade from internal to foreign trade prices. The end product is one in which income, output, and expenditures are estimated in a consistent SNA-type framework for the overall FSU and for the 15 individual FSU economies. These I-O tables provide the information needed for macroeconomic and sectoral analysis, and form the basis for estimating per capita GNP for these economies. The author presents the three-tier I-O tables for the FSU region as a whole in this paper, but presents only the SNA tier for individual economies.
