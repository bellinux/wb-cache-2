40|$|Bovine dermis was <b>exposed</b> {{outdoors}} in the Antarctic in 2013 {{to study the}} skin damage caused by short-wavelength ultraviolet light under the ozone hole. Collagen was extracted from the <b>exposed</b> dermis with pepsin. The amount of solubilized collagen in the <b>exposed</b> dermis was only 20 %– 40 % of that in dermis shielded from ultraviolet light. The dermis was most difficult to extract when <b>exposed</b> in summer, and then when <b>exposed</b> in spring. Differential scanning calorimetry {{was used to determine}} the melting endothermic behavior of the dermal tissue. The peak temperature was highest for the dermis <b>exposed</b> in summer. The <b>exposed</b> dermis was degraded with cyanogen bromide to determine whether cross-linking had occurred. Cross-linked peptides were detected in the dermis <b>exposed</b> in summer or spring, but the dermis <b>exposed</b> in autumn did not differ markedly from the light-shielded dermis. These data show that cross-linkages were readily formed in the collagen molecule chains in dermis <b>exposed</b> to ultraviolet light in summer, when solar elevation is highest and the period of sunshine is longest. A comparison of the dermis <b>exposed</b> in spring and that <b>exposed</b> in autumn showed that cross-linkages were formed more readily by ultraviolet light in spring, when the ozone hole occurred. オゾンホール発生時の短波長紫外線による皮膚へのダメージを調べるため、南極にて牛の真皮の屋外曝露を行った。曝露後の真皮に対してコラーゲンのペプシンを抽出したところ、曝露した真皮は紫外線を遮光していたものに比べてコラーゲンが 20 ～ 40 ％程度しか可溶化されなかった。特に夏季に曝露したものが最も抽出されにくく、次いで春季に曝露したものが抽出されにくかった。さらに、臭化シアン分解によって架橋の有無を調べたところ、秋季に曝露したサンプルでは遮光サンプルと顕著な差は見られなかったが、夏季および春季に曝露したサンプルでは紫外線によって架橋したペプチドが検出された。以上のことから、太陽高度が最も高くて日照時間が長い夏季の紫外線を浴びた真皮は、コラーゲン分子鎖に架橋を生じさせやすいことがわかった。また、春季と秋季の曝露を比較すると、オゾンホール発生時である春季の方が紫外線によって架橋を生じさせやすいことも判明した...|$|R

Naturally <b>exposed</b> dogs were from four geographic regions of the country. No differences were detected between immunoblot patterns of naturally <b>exposed</b> symptomatic or asymptomatic dogs from {{different areas of the}} country. The immunoblot patterns obtained with sera from experimentally <b>exposed</b> dogs were different from those obtained with sera from naturally <b>exposed</b> dogs and were characterized by reactivity to fewer and different protein bands. Immunoblot analysis using an OspA-protein-producing Escherichia coli recombinant showed that experimentally <b>exposed</b> dogs produced antibodies to OspA, whereas naturally <b>exposed</b> dogs did not. Modifications of the immune response over time, different routes of antigen presentation, and strain variation are factors postulated to account for the observed differences...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} how Armadillo officinalis modulates its behavior in terms of turn alternation when <b>exposed</b> to micro-vibrations propagating through a A T-maze with multiple exits {{was used to evaluate}} the turn alternation pattern in i) adult individuals of A. officinalis <b>exposed</b> or ii) not <b>exposed</b> to micro-vibrations, iii) juveniles of A. officinalis <b>exposed,</b> and vi) adult individuals of Armadillidium vulgare <b>exposed.</b> The generalized regression models used highlighted a significant association between the turn alternation pattern and the micro-vibration (not exposed/exposed), animal’s state (adults/juveniles), and species (A. vulgare/ A. officinalis). In particular, an average higher number of turn alternations was observed for the adults of A. officinalis <b>exposed</b> to the microvibrations compared to i) the not <b>exposed</b> adults, ii) the <b>exposed</b> juveniles, and iii) the <b>exposed</b> adults of A. vulgare. No significant association was instead highlighted between adults of A. officinalis not <b>exposed</b> and adults of A. vulgare <b>exposed</b> to the micro-vibration. Our results showed that A. officinalis seems to be very sensible to external vibrations, differently from A. vulgare. In addition, the sensitiveness to the vibrations seems increasing passing from the juvenile state to the adult condition. This sensitiveness might be linked to the peculiarity of this species to emit vibrations by means of a stridulatory organ...|$|R
