40|$|This study quantifies {{the impact}} of {{traditional}} and ‘new age ’ provisions of preferential trading arrangements (PTAs) on merchandise trade and investment. It does so by estimating gravity models of bilateral trade and investment. It finds that recent and some past RTAs are not as benign as some contemporary empirical assessments have suggested. A careful consideration of the analytical issues — controlling comprehensively for other observable and unobservable factors, and testing explicitly for whether the trade and investment effects are significantly different after PTA formation than before — accounts for the less <b>favourable</b> <b>finding</b> in this study. It is possible for RTAs to have even more adverse effects on investment flows, If investment responds in ‘beachhead ’ fashion to the trade provisions of RTAs, the trade carried out from those beachheads could constitute traditional trade diversion. The investment provisions of RTAs could also create investment diversion. However, the paper finds little evidence of beachhead investment. Instead, it finds evidence of net investment creation {{in response to the}} ‘new age’, non-trade provisions of RTAs. Thus the finding on investment is more positive than for trade, but not without qualifications...|$|E

The objective {{of the study was}} to find out the consequences of thyroid gland disorder on a person’s life, and whether the treatment length has any effect on subjective problems of patients. Common problems reported by patients were evaluated; the final number of such “common problems ” in the final stage of the research was 56. In order to achieve better orientation in the processing of results, the patient-described types of disorders were classified according to the patients’ own opinions into the following groups: eufunctional thyroid gland, inflammation, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, tumour and surgery. The fact is that in the first year of treatment, almost half of all patients with a thyroid gland disorder experienced some problems caused by the disease. It is not a <b>favourable</b> <b>finding</b> that in the upcoming years, i. e. from 2 to 10 years, the number of those with problems will increase to as much as 61 %. The period of treatment between 11 and 15 years means a decrease in the occurrence of problems to 50 %, but with the number of patients with problems increasing, their number becomes even higher than that in the period of 2 to 10 years.

40|$|M. Sc. (Med), Faculty of Health Sciences,University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 Background: Many factors {{affect the}} {{prescribing}} of medication {{to patients with}} schizophrenia including variables that relate to physicians and may result in marked variance {{in the choice of}} drugs, dosages, drug combinations, route of administration and the use of antipsychotic, anticholinergic, sedative and other adjuvant drugs. Clinical practice guidelines were developed to address this variance and for other reasons, including the management of side-effects, drug innovation, rising costs, information overload, changes in treatment goals and the management of medication non-adherence. There are advantages and disadvantages to using clinical practice guidelines including those pertaining to context and cultural norms, but they remain the best method of assessing prescribing quality. Many guidelines are {{based on the results of}} randomised clinical trials (with a single drug) or are the consensus of experts in the field. Despite the development and publication of these guidelines over the past two decades, they are frequently not adhered to resulting in much variance in treatment. Aims and objectives: The aim of the study was to determine to what extent the prescribing of psychotropic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia was consistent with the most recent version of each of five guidelines that originate outside South Africa (two from the United States and one each from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia and New Zealand); and one that was developed locally. Methodology: A retrospective, cross-sectional prescription chart review with data sampling at three time points (on hospital admission, at fourteen days thereafter and on hospital discharge) was undertaken. A sample population was drawn over a three year period during which the patients’ physician had access to the same drug formulary. Seventy patients met the study selection criteria in terms of age, diagnosis and receipt of antipsychotic medication during hospital stay and on discharge. Seventy patients met the study selection criteria, and their prescriptions for psychotropic medication (exclusively) were examined for a number of parameters including: drug class, drug name, dose, route of administration and whether the medication was to be administered routinely or ‘as needed’. Findings and discussion: As compared with the recommendations made in some or all of the guidelines, first generation antipsychotic agents were over-prescribed especially early on in the patients’ hospital stay, whereas second generation antipsychotics were under-prescribed. The profile changed after fourteen days and on discharge there were more patients on second generation drugs than on the older drugs. More patients were discharged on depot antipsychotic treatment than were admitted which is considered a <b>favourable</b> <b>finding,</b> however, many patients receiving the depot form continued to be prescribed the oral drug on a routine basis and for an indefinite period, resulting in antipsychotic polypharmacy. Anticholinergic drugs were prescribed as prophylaxis for the extra-pyramidal side-effects of the first generation antipsychotic drugs and more than a quarter of the sample received these drugs on discharge, after which they were to be taken routinely and indefinitely. A similar finding was made with the use of benzodiazepine sedatives, where nearly a quarter of patients received these drugs on discharge - again to be taken routinely and for an unspecified period. Sodium valproate was given increasingly to many patients in the sample and was prescribed to over a quarter of those upon discharge, without an indication of duration. Limitations: The study was retrospective in design, without the benefit of the patients’ clinical histories and treatment progress, and the findings were compared with guidelines whose age spanned more than a decade and some of which had become redundant. Conclusions: The study demonstrated some prescribing habits that were not in accord with the guidelines used for comparison in the study. The extent of the disagreement reveals the need for a prospective pilot study that will include the patients’ clinical progress in the study design which will provide greater insight into why specific medication parameters were chosen by the physician for the individual patient. If the findings justify it, then a programme promoting better adherence to the most current guidelines should be commenced...|$|E

The approach is innovative since literature has mainly investigated until now only the simultaneous relationship between advertising, recall and liking. The analysis is carried out for the markets of small automobiles, deodorants and shampoos. Main empirical findings for the analysed categories highlight that: 1) carryover effects of ad liking on the recall measures may be detected but not systematically, and 2) the ad liking role of ad likeability on memorial responses varies among product categories. Moreover 3) a further finding shows that, whereas positive influences are thoroughly retrievable (in the small car category), ad likeability influences more advertising than brand awareness and more total than unaided awareness. ...|$|R

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) {{is characterized by}} the production of a wide array of autoantibodies. Thus, the condition was traditionally classified as a “B-cell disease”. Compelling evidence has however shown that without the assistance of the helper T lymphocytes, it is indeed difficult for the “helpless” B cells to become functional enough to trigger SLE-related inflammation. T cells have been recognized to be crucial in the pathogenicity of SLE through their capabilities to communicate with and offer enormous help to B cells for driving autoantibody production. Recently, a number of phenotypic and functional alterations which increase the propensity to trigger lupus-related inflammation have been identified in lupus T cells. Here, potential mechanisms involving alterations in T-cell receptor expressions, postreceptor downstream signalling, epigenetics, and oxidative stress which favour activation of lupus T cells will be discussed. Additionally, how regulatory CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and γδ T cells tune down lupus-related inflammation will be highlighted. Lastly, while currently available outcomes of clinical trials evaluating therapeutic agents which manipulate the T cells such as calcineurin inhibitors indicate that they are at least as efficacious and safe as conventional immunosuppressants in treating lupus glomerulonephritis, larger clinical trials are undoubtedly required to validate these as-yet <b>favourable</b> <b>findings...</b>|$|R

The injection of either of these hormones in a dose of 100 mg. into a knee joint affected by rheumatoid arthritis resulted in a generalized anti-inflammatory response, includ-ing improvement in other inflamed joints {{as well as that}} injected. This generalized improvement usually persisted for 2 to 3 weeks. These <b>favourable</b> <b>findings</b> led to further study with these steroids, utilizing the more practical intramuscular route of administration.

40|$|Background A {{number of}} widely {{prevalent}} job stressors {{have been identified}} as modifiable risk factors for common mental and physical illnesses such as depression and cardiovascular disease, yet there has been relatively little study of population trends in exposure to job stressors over time. The aims of this paper were to assess: (1) overall time trends in job control and security and (2) whether disparities by sex, age, skill level and employment arrangement were changing over time in the Australian working population. Methods Job control and security were measured in eight annual waves (2000 – 2008) from the Australian nationally-representative Household Income and Labour Dynamics of Australia panel survey (n= 13   188 unique individuals for control and n= 13   182 for security). Observed and model-predicted time trends were generated. Models were generated using population-averaged longitudinal linear regression, with year fitted categorically. Changes in disparities over time by sex, age group, skill level and employment arrangement were tested as interactions between each of these stratifying variables and time. Results While significant disparities persisted for disadvantaged compared with advantaged groups, results suggested that inequalities in job control narrowed among young workers compared with older groups and for casual, fixed-term and self-employed compared with permanent workers. A slight narrowing of disparities over time in job security was noted for gender, age, employment arrangement and occupational skill level. Conclusions Despite the <b>favourable</b> <b>findings</b> of small reductions in disparities in job control and security, significant cross-sectional disparities persist.

Methods To determine differences in the methodological quality, sponsorship, authors' conflicts of interest, and findings among trials with different "types" of intention-to-treat, we undertook a cross-sectional study of RCTs published in 2006 in three general medical journals (the Journal of the American Medical Association, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet) and three specialty journals (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, the American Heart Journal and the Journal of Clinical Oncology). Trials were categorized based on the "type" of intention-to-treat reporting as follows: ITT, trials reporting the use of standard ITT approach; mITT, trials reporting {{the use of a}} "modified intention-to-treat" approach; and "no ITT", trials not reporting the use of any intention-to-treat approach.

Methods For assessing psychosocial work factors on works councils within the sector represented by the trade union IG Metal in Germany, a research by using the German standard version of COPSOQ (Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire) was performed. The instrument includes 87 single items forming 25 aspects of strain and stress. Results from the study group of works councils were compared to those from employees working in administration and {{to the general population}} mean (COPSOQ database). Statistical analysis included t-tests, analysis of variance and multiple comparisons of means. To be significant in terms of statistics, p Results All in all, 309 works councils from a national survey of the German chemical and metalworking industries took part in the study. 113 were full-time works council members (exempted from the duty to perform their regular work), 196 were voluntary members (acting as employee representatives on an honorary basis alongside their normal duties). Comparison between works councils and employees working in administration (leadership roles (N= 1810) and non-leadership roles (N= 2970)) and for employees in general (N= 35. 000) showed unfavourable values for works councils for most scales. Significantly higher values indicating higher strain and stress were found for the scales: emotional demands, work-privacy conflict, role conflicts, mobbing, cognitive stress symptoms and burnout. Unfavourable results were obtained for the aspects: quality of leadership, social support, sense of community and general health. <b>Favourable</b> <b>findings</b> were found on the scales: influence at work, quantity of social relations and the partly positive values for quantitative demands and commitment to the workplace. Conclusion Compared to the reference groups, works council members perceive the psychosocial demands of working life as more exhausting for the majority of aspects. This allows several conclusions. One reason may be the extended tasks employee representatives face, an other may be that the education of most works council members does not seem appropriate to the high demands of their managerial and executive tasks. </p...|$|R

Of note, case presented in the peculiar form of recurrent episodes of acute leukoencephalopathy, with favourable outcome, which, to our knowledge, has not been described yet. We speculate about the aetiology of this condition, which is still poorly understood. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{recruiting and}} retaining an adequate mental health nursing workforce is acknowledged. The major {{in mental health}} nursing {{has been identified as}} a strategy to promote this specialist area of practice as desirable for students’ future careers. Measuring its success requires the collection of detailed data about the structure, content, and uptake of these programmes. A survey was specifically developed to elicit descriptive information about the structure and content of a major in mental health nursing programmes. Fourteen universities participated in this research. Eight had implemented a major, one intends to do so in 2011, and five had abandoned or suspended their plans for the major. The findings suggest considerable variation in both structure and content of the major in mental health nursing throughout Australia. Students are required to commit to and commence the programme at differing stages, and there is a substantial variation in the theoretical and clinical content in mental health undertaken as a requirement for the major. The numbers of students taking the major is relatively small in most universities; however, the retention rates are <b>favourable.</b> These <b>findings</b> provide important data for discussion about the ideal structure and content of a major in mental health nursing...|$|R
40|$|Preclinical studies {{indicate}} that vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or SAHA) inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, increases acetylated histones H 2 a, H 2 b, H 3, and H 4, and thereby induces differentiation and apoptosis {{in a variety of}} tumour cell lines, including murine erythroleukaemia, human bladder transitional cell carcinoma, and human breast adenocarcinoma. On the basis of these <b>favourable</b> preclinical <b>findings,</b> vorinostat has been selected as a candidate for clinical development with the potential to treat patients with selected malignances, including Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Phase I clinical trials in patients with haematological malignances and solid tumours showed that both intravenous (i. v.) and oral formulations of vorinostat are well tolerated, can inhibit HDAC activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumour tissue biopsies, and produce objective tumour regression and symptomatic improvement with little clinical toxicity. The dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of i. v. vorinostat were primarily haematologic and were rapidly reversible within 4 – 5 days of therapy cessation. In contrast, the DLT for oral vorinostat were primarily non-haematologic (including dehydration, anorexia, diarrhoea, fatigue) and were also rapidly reversible, usually within 3 days. Further research is warranted to optimise the dosing schedule for vorinostat, particularly with respect to dose, timing of administration, and duration of therapy, and to fully delineate the mechanism(s) of antitumour effect of vorinostat in various types of malignances. Several phase II studies are currently ongoing in patients with haematological malignances and solid tumours...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To examine {{short term}} {{and long term}} health related quality of life (HRQoL) of {{survivors}} of congenital anorectal malformations (ARM) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and to compare these patients' HRQoL {{with that of the}} general population. METHODS: HRQoL was measured in 286 ARM patients and 111 CDH patients. All patients were administered a symptom checklist and a generic HRQoL measure. For the youngest children (aged 1 - 4) the TAIQOL (a preliminary version of the TAPQOL) was used, for the other children (aged 5 - 15) the TACQOL questionnaire, and for adults (aged > 16) the SF- 36. RESULTS: As appeared from the symptom checklists, many patients remained symptomatic into adulthood. In the youngest ARM patients (aged 1 - 4 years), generic HRQoL was severely affected, but the older ARM patients showed better HRQoL. In the CDH patients, the influence of symptoms on HRQoL seemed less profound. The instruments we used revealed little difference between adults treated for ARM or CDH and the general population. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that for two neonatal surgical procedures, improved survival does not {{come at the expense of}} poor HRQoL in adults. Even though there is considerable suffering in terms of both morbidity and mortality in the youngest group, the ultimate prognosis of survivors of the two studied congenital malformations is <b>favourable.</b> This <b>finding</b> can be used to reassure parents of patients in need of neonatal surgery for one of these conditions about the prospects for their child...|$|R
40|$|Public health {{strategies}} {{for reducing the}} risk of coronary heart disease have focused on lowering plasma lipids, particularly cholesterol levels, with recent studies also highlighting triacylglycerol (TAG) as an important modifiable risk factor. One approach is to supplement the diet with probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Putative health benefits include improved resistance to gastrointestinal infections, reduction in lipid levels and stimulation of the immune system. Prebiotics are selectively fermented dietary components that are aimed at improving host health through selective fermentation by the gut microbiota, such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Animal studies have shown prebiotics to markedly reduce circulating TAG {{and to a lesser extent}} cholesterol concentrations, with <b>favourable</b> but inconsistent <b>findings</b> with respect to changes in lipid levels in human studies. Here we provide an overview of the effects, and possible mechanisms, of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics (combination of a probiotic and prebiotic) on circulating lipeamia in humans...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the trust-based mechanisms underlying {{the relationship between}} ethical leadership and followers 2 ̆ 7 organisational citizenship behaviours (OCBs). Based on three-wave survey data obtained from 184 employees and their supervisors, we find that ethical leadership leads {{to higher levels of}} both affective and cognitive trust. In addition, we find support for a three-path mediational model, where cognitive trust and affective trust, in turn, mediate the relationship between ethical leadership and follower OCBs. That is to say, we found that ethical leadership leads to the development of cognitive trust, which subsequently influences the development of affective trust. Affective trust, in turn, induces followers to exhibit OCBs as a means of reciprocating the leader 2 ̆ 7 s <b>favourable</b> behaviour. Our <b>findings</b> suggest that both affective and cognitive trust {{plays an important role in}} the social exchange processes that underlie the relationship between ethical leadership and the discretionary behaviour of followers. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of galaxies {{is influenced by}} the environment in which they reside. This effect should be strongest for the least-mass and -luminosity galaxies. To study dwarf galaxies in extremely low density environments we have compiled a deep catalogue of dwarf galaxies in the nearby Lynx-Cancer void. This void hosts some of the most metal-poor dwarfs known to date. It borders the Local Volume at the negative supergalactic Z (SGZ) coordinates and has the size of more than 16 Mpc. With a distance to its centre of only 18 Mpc it is close enough to allow the search for the faintest dwarfs. Within the void 75 dwarf (- 11. 9 > M_B > - 18. 0) and 4 subluminous (- 18. 0 > M_B > - 18. 4) galaxies have been identified. We present the parameters of the void galaxies and give a detailed analysis of the completeness of the catalogue as a function of magnitude and surface brightness. The catalogue appears almost complete to M_B < - 14 mag, but misses part of the fainter low surface brightness (LSB) face-on galaxies. This sample of void galaxies builds the basis of forthcoming observational studies that will give insight into the main stellar population, HI-mass-to-light ratio, metallicity and age for comparison with dwarfs in higher density regions. We briefly summarize the information on the unusual objects in the void and conclude that their concentration hints that voids are environments that are <b>favourable</b> for <b>finding</b> and studying unevolved dwarf galaxies.

30|$|Some {{encouraging}} {{findings have}} been also documented by applying this biomimetic approach in cases of “complex” lesions involving the subchondral bone. A 46 -year-old former athlete (Kon et al. [2009]) was successfully treated by implanting the scaffold in multifocal osteochondral defects of the medial femoral condyle, trochlea and patella, and concurrently by restoring the correct alignment of a varus knee through a closing-wedge high tibial osteotomy. Good clinical outcome and positive MRI results were recorded at 12  months’ follow-up. <b>Favourable</b> <b>findings</b> were reported also in a 50 -year-old woman affected by a tibial plateau osteochondral defect following a Schatzker type II fracture (Filardo et al. [2009]). Due {{to the complexity of}} the lesion, an integrated mechanical and biological approach was applied to restore the previous anatomic features. Besides filling the bone and cartilage defect with this three-layered implant, the tibial plateau was elevated by an opening-wedge osteotomy and filled with homologous bone graft, and finally a dynamic external distractor was applied to allow early mobilization while protecting the implant. Twelve months later the patient was pain free and returned to a satisfactory activity level, stable until the 4  years’ follow-up. A further case report dealt with an Olympic-level female athlete affected by multifocal degenerative knee lesions. The patient underwent a complex combined treatment: implantation of the scaffold, autologous osteochondral grafting, patellar realignment, and meniscal allograft transplantation to address both joint surface lesions and associated comorbidities. The patient was able to return to high-level competitions within 24  months after surgery (Perdisa et al. [2014]). Following these promising outcomes, obtained through a combined mechanical and biological approach as a salvage procedure, a more extensive application was experimented for complex osteochondral lesions. Thirty-three patients affected by “complex” knee lesions, according to defined criteria (Filardo et al. [2013 b]), were treated by implanting this multi-layered scaffold and combining concurrent procedures to address axial misalignment and meniscal resection sequelae. A good clinical outcome was recorded at 24  months’ follow-up. The clinical results were then compared with those of a homogeneous group of 23 patients previously treated with a similar protocol but with the implantation of a chondral scaffold. A better outcome was found in the osteochondral scaffold group. Finally, the biomimetic scaffold was also tested for the treatment of unicompartmental OA in young patients (Marcacci et al. [2013]), to attempt an alternative solution to metal resurfacing. Currently, the main surgical indication in a young and active population affected by unicompartmental OA consists of unloading osteotomies or unicompartmental metal resurfacing (Gomoll et al. [2012 b]), but the high functional demands and the young age of this kind of patient increase the risk of prosthetic revision. In this challenging population, characterized by a combination of high functional demands and great expectations regarding their recovery on one hand, and a limited choice of treatment options on the other, a solution to delay or even avoid metal resurfacing is highly desirable. The osteochondral scaffold was then implanted in a group of 43 patients affected by unicompartmental OA (Kellegren-Lawrence[*]<[*]= 3), with full-thickness focal cartilage lesions in stable knees. Concurrent procedures were performed when required (15 osteotomies, 11 meniscal scaffolds and 9 meniscal allograft implantations). The clinical outcome showed a significant clinical improvement from pre-op to the 3  years’ follow-up. The best benefits were obtained in patients under 40  years old; thus, the authors recommended this surgical approach as a new treatment option for young OA patients.|$|R
