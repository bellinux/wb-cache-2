2500|$|The town {{straddles}} the Red Rock Fault. Its [...] <b>downthrow</b> {{to the west}} brings the Permo-Triassic sandstones and mudstones of the Cheshire Plain up against the Millstone Grit and shales of the Peak District. To the immediate east of the fault are the coal measures of the Carboniferous period which, unlike those in the Lancashire Coalfield, are missing the top layers. Here we find outcrops of the Middle Coal Measures. Coal from these strata, particularly the Four Foot Mine (or seam), the Five Foot Mine and the Accommodation Mine, was mined in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century. The lower ground, including most of Poynton, is covered by glacial till left by the retreating ice sheet {{at the close of the}} last ice age.|$|E
60|$|The Craven fault, for instance, extends for {{upwards of}} 30 miles, and along this line the {{vertical}} {{displacement of the}} strata has varied from 600 to 3000 feet. Prof. Ramsay has published an account of a <b>downthrow</b> in Anglesea of 2300 feet; and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in Merionethshire of 12,000 feet; yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface to show such prodigious movements; the pile of rocks on the one or other side having been smoothly swept away. The consideration of these facts impresses my mind almost {{in the same manner}} as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity.|$|E
60|$|When thus {{impressed}} with the slow {{rate at which the}} land is worn away through subaerial and littoral action, it is good, in order to appreciate the past duration of time, to consider, on the one hand, the masses of rock which have been removed over many extensive areas, {{and on the other hand}} the thickness of our sedimentary formations. I remember having been much struck when viewing volcanic islands, which have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the lava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same story is told still more plainly by faults--those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other, to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, and it makes no great difference whether the upheaval was sudden, or, as most geologists now believe, was slow and effected by many starts, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible. The Craven fault, for instance, extends for upward of thirty miles, and along this line the vertical displacement of the strata varies from 600 to 3,000 feet. Professor Ramsay has published an account of a <b>downthrow</b> in Anglesea of 2,300 feet; and he informs me that he fully believes that there is one in Merionethshire of 12,000 feet; yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface of the land to show such prodigious movements; the pile of rocks on either side of the crack having been smoothly swept away.|$|E

Most deformations occur within the hanging wall side. The <b>downthrown</b> block slips downward and basinward {{relative to the}} upthrown block. This is caused due to the differential load of the overlying sediments and the high mobility of the lowermost low density layer.|$|R

50|$|Five {{substantial}} faults {{affect the}} Wigan Coalfield running nearly parallel to and equidistant from each other. The Great Haigh Fault begins near Bickershaw Colliery and passes northward through Hindley, Kirkless Hall, Haigh, and Arley {{to the west}} of Adlington Park. The Great Standish or St Catherine's Fault has a <b>downthrow</b> to the east and passes under St. Catherine's Church at Ince. The Giant's Hall Fault passes by Abram, west of Ince Hall Colliery, west of Gidlow and under Giant's Hall Farm to Standish Church. The Great Shevington Fault passes by Hawkley Hall and east of Kirkless Hall. The Great Pemberton Fault is a <b>downthrow</b> and passes Pemberton, Orrell and {{to the west of}} Shevington.

50|$|As {{the fault}} grows upward, it {{cuts through the}} newly formed {{sedimentary}} layers at the top. Therefore, the overall displacement along the fault plane is not the same. Further, the lowermost layer has higher displacement than the uppermost layer while the intermediate layer displacement lies in between (fig. 2). Because the fault plane flattens into décollement, the <b>downthrown</b> block moves basinward and the displaced sedimentary layer of the <b>downthrown</b> block bends close to the fault plane forming rollover anticline, synthetic and antithetic faults. Figure 3 is an E-W seismic line at Svalbard area showing footwall, hanging wall and the geometry of sedimentary layers around the fault plane.|$|R

40|$|Movement {{of growth}} faults, {{a type of}} normal fault which is formed during {{sedimentation}} and is characterized by having greater vertical thickness on the <b>downthrown</b> fault side, on barrier islands contributes to wetland losses. The opening objective {{of this study was}} to quantify land cover change within a Matagorda, Texas wetland that results from sea level rise and elevation change over time due to coastal faulting. The closing objective {{of this study was to}} simulate land cover conversion as a function of relative sea level rise (RSLR) within the wetland and to compare and contrast the impact of specific rates of both fault-induced elevation change and predicted International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sea level rise projections. To accomplish these objectives a time series of aerial images was classified using automated unsupervised classification and hand digitization. After classification, total wetland losses on both the upthrown and <b>downthrown</b> sides of the fault were evaluated as a function of spatial distance from the fault plane. This classified product was draped over a digital elevation model (DEM) layer to evaluate elevations of land cover classes and model potential future outcomes based on RSLR. Classification results show that while wetland loss occurred on both sides of the fault, losses were far more extensive on the <b>downthrown</b> side. It was concluded that this vertical fault movement impacts wetland losses, especially on the <b>downthrown</b> side. Modeling results show that rapid water level rise can force wetland land cover class conversion regardless of whether this relative rise is caused by vertical fault displacement or eustatic sea level rise, resulting in the destruction of vital wetland areas. Current recorded conditions of sea level rise along the Texas Gulf Coast leave a grim outlook for regions similar to this study area...|$|R
50|$|The {{earthquake}} rupture {{is estimated}} to be about 25 km in length and 575 km2 in area, with a displacement of about 0.6 m. The mainshock was preceded by a major foreshock. Ground rupture was observed {{in the form of a}} series of small vertical faults, with <b>downthrow</b> to the west, offsetting part of National Highway 22 between Sumdo and Kaurik, with displacements up to 50 cm.|$|E
50|$|Several faults run roughly northwest-southeast {{through the}} area, notably the Overton Fault, which roughly {{parallels}} the B5439 and B5152 roads, and the Frodsham Fault, which runs north from {{the vicinity of}} Crowmere {{to the mouth of}} the River Weaver. Both of these faults and others in the area <b>downthrow</b> to the east. Movement on them is thought to have taken place in the Tertiary period. The uplift resulted in trapping the water table at an elevation of around 200 ft at which level springs developed.|$|E

Erosion of the Upper Triassic units (Keuper facies and Imón Fm) and deposition of terrestrial facies (lutites, sandstones and polymict breccias), took place in the uplifted blocks. During episode 2, tectonic reactivation combined to long-term sea level rise, resulted in the setting of tidal flat facies, preserved as dolomitic breccias, cellular limestones and finelly-crystalline limestones. Deposition of shallow subtidal facies (mudstones and oolitic-peloidal and bioclastic packstones-grainstones) was favoured in the more subsident areas of <b>downthrown</b> blocks.

5000|$|Collingwood also {{lay in the}} Great Artesian Basin. Nevertheless, {{there does}} not seem to be any record of an {{artesian}} bore ever being attempted at Collingwood, as was done in many other places in Outback Queensland, even locally (as at Dagworth, 65 km to the northwest, in the 1890s) often with great success. Geologically, the site lies in the Eromanga Basin. More locally, the geology consists of the Cretaceous Winton Formation, and it was at Manfred Station (...) , 168 km from Collingwood's former site, where the formation yielded up at least two palaeobotanical fossils to a J. Williams in 1920. More recently, in 2005, Australovenator and Diamantinasaurus matildae Early Cretaceous dinosaur remains were unearthed by palaeontologists at the [...] "Matilda site" [...] not far north of the former town, on Elderslie Station (site's position roughly [...] ). A [...] "major fault" [...] passes just southeast of the Collingwood site, called the Cork Fault. It runs roughly northeast to southwest. Its <b>downthrow</b> is to the northwest, towards Collingwood. Seismic studies along this fault began in 1960 with the Bureau of Mineral Resources (now Geoscience Australia). In the years that followed, a number of other surveys were conducted by private companies, among which was the Western River Seismic Survey in 1967 by the United Geophysical Corporation, which was [...] "aimed at further defining the Permo-Triassic section on the downthrown (west) side of the Cork Fault indicated by the previous Collingwood survey (Phillips, 1966)." [...] This information is all held in a report that also mentions petroleum exploration in the area, with one exploratory well sunk about 20 km north of the former townsite, at Lovelle Downs (...) [...] Drilling was underway late in 1972 by Hematite Petroleum. The Cork Fault might have begun as long ago as the Mesoproterozoic (1.6 to 1.0 billion years ago), when it would have been part of a great network of active normal faults in the land that would eventually come to be known as Australia, although then, the land was part of the supercontinent of Rodinia. The team from Monash University who reached these conclusions and presented them in 2015, namely Giovanni P. T. Spampinato, Laurent Aillères, Peter G. Betts and Robin J. Armit, believed that while the Cork Fault was to be regarded as a fundamental crustal discontinuity, it was not Rodinia's former eastern margin. This they believe because the Cork Fault is the line in the Earth's crust where the Proterozoic Mount Isa terrane (the fault's downthrown side mentioned above) has been thrust under the Phanaerozoic Thomson Orogen (the upthrown side).Robert Logan Jack, FGS, FRGS, the Government Geologist for Queensland, wrote a report on the region (and indeed all Queensland) in 1892. Along with fellow geologist Robert Etheridge, Junior, the New South Wales Government Palaeontologist, Jack identified [...] "a bed of gypsum, of workable thickness, and of great purity" [...] at Chollarton, a place said by Jack to lie near Collingwood (although the name only seems to appear in one other place in the records, also in connection with Jack's work). Jack also mentioned in his report that the area between Wokingham Creek and the Diamantina River, just north of the town, was characterised by grey sandstones [...] "with occasional sandy ironstone or ironmasked sandstone". He furthermore wrote that there was silicified wood strewn over the ground. Jack's report also makes clear that there are coal seams in the region. A well sunk about 1878 between Werna and Ayrshire Downs, about 50 km north of Collingwood, struck two such seams, and otherwise yielded strata of grey sandstones and sandy shales with beds of argillaceous flagstone (which contained seashells) and sandstone with iron pyrites. The well also yielded forth many fragments of silicified and carbonised wood. The boring ended at 204 feet (62 m) in hard, fine-grained sandstone. Water was struck at two levels below the first coal seam. Other wells in the region, too, struck coal (but not always water).|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The Canisp Shear Zone {{is a major}} {{structure}} in the central region of the mainland Lewisian. Evidence is presented toshow {{that there have been}} two major phases of movement. In the first phase, during the Inverian, a broad belt of steeply-inclined foliation was formed bounded to the southby the north limb of the Lochinver antiform. The associated lineation plunges teeply to the SE, indicating adip-slip movement with <b>downthrow</b> to the north, and a small dextral strike-slip component. Quartz-epidiorite and ultrabasic dykes were then emplaced sub-parallel tothe shear plane, their emplacement was controlled by pre-existing planes of weakness. The second, Laxfordian, phase of movement reactivated the Inverian structure. Deformation was concentrated in narrow zones of high strain, with an associated strong, penetrative lineation plunging shallowly ESE. The shear sense is dominantly dextral strike-slip with a small <b>downthrow</b> to the north. This change from dominantly dip-slip to dominantly strike-slip movement agrees with models for other areas of the Lewisian (Coward & Park, this vol.) and appears to be associated with a change in style towards more localized zones of deformation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the Southern Eastern Desert of Egypt, A NW–SE {{oriented}} structural graben {{extends from}} the North of Aswan to the Red Sea coast with a length of about 400 km and an average width of 30 km. The area has significant potential for development {{as it may be}} provided with water from surface and subsurface sources and is the site of prospection for petroleum. The present paper is an attempt to understand the structural evolution and genetic development of the geomorphologic features of the area and constructing presently a new geomorphological map at a scale of 1 : 250, 000 using Landsat ETM images and field checks. Available geological maps and the produced geomorphological map are digitized by using the ARC-GIS software. The same program is also used to produce a 3 D DEM for surface and subsurface features. Based on new interpretations of aeromagnetic and radiometric data, the subsurface features of the basement cover were illustrated on a 3 D map. Geological–geomorphological profiles have been constructed in different directions in the area to identify present and ancient geomorphologic features. The place and shape of subsurface deep seated NW–SE trending faults have been determined. The faults, which generated the graben have downthrows in the order of 900 – 5800 m. The surface and subsurface observations delineate the dominant <b>downthrow</b> of about 3750 m.

40|$|Thin-plate flexure {{theory has}} {{previously}} assumed unconstrained end loading {{to model the}} flexure associated with a fault cutting a strong upper crust above an inviscid substratum. This assumption implies that fault planes are not parallel when the density differential across the plate differs on upthrown and downthrown sides, as {{in the development of}} a sediment-filled half-graben. A downward-widening extension crack would develop during planar normal faulting, which conflicts with the geological experience that such cracks are closed by overburden pressure below a few hundred metres depth. A new analytical solution is presented, in which the fault planes are constrained to be parallel and in contact. The new theory gives a substantially larger ratio of upthrow to <b>downthrow,</b> and a significantly wider half-graben and narrower uplift. Key words: faulting, flexure, half-graben...|$|E
30|$|When fault {{elements}} dissect a permeable layer, {{a connection}} {{can be developed}} between shallower part (up thrown side) with the deeper one (<b>downthrown</b> side) that, in turn, will provide vertical fluid flow path and the pressure transfer from the higher-pressured part (deeper) to the shallower part until the two pressures are equalized.
