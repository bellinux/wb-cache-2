40|$|As efforts grow {{to develop}} spatio-temporal {{database}} systems and temporal geographic information {{systems that are}} capable of conveying how geographic phenomena change, it is important to distinguish the elements that are fundamental to scenarios of change. This paper presents a model based on the explicit <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> with respect to states of existence and non-existence for identifiable objects. Such changes are of concern when, for instance, modeling and reasoning about nations that are subsumed through conflict only to return once more at a later time, or about water bodies that fluctuate due to seasonal or climatic change. The basis for tracing these changes is the concept of object identity. Identity, distinct from an object's properties, values, or structure, is that unique characteristic that distinguishes one object from another. Based on a small set of primitives relating to the identity states of objects, we model the semantics associated with change and through a sys [...] ...|$|E

However, oftentimes the lack of well-established sets of benchmarks leads to situations where these approaches are evaluated using different datasets, which results in biased comparisons. In this data paper we describe and make publicly available a set of benchmarks from six Java applications, {{which can be used}} in the evaluation of various software engineering (SE) tasks, such as feature location and impact analysis. These datasets consist of textual <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> requests, the locations in the source code where they were implemented, and execution traces. Four of the benchmarks were already used in several SE research papers, and two of them are new. In addition, we describe in detail the methodology used for generating these benchmarks and provide a suite of tools in order to encourage other researchers to validate our datasets and generate new benchmarks for other subject software systems...|$|E

40|$|Although {{technological}} determinism is an inadequate <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> it remains common, if implicit, in much information science literature. Recent developments {{in science and}} technology studies offer a social constructivist alternative, in which technology is seen, not as autonomous, but as the result of interests. However, the stability of these interests can be argued to privilege social factors {{in the same way as}} {{technological determinism}} privileges technological factors. A second alternative is to shift to a relativist stance and analyse discourse as interaction, rather than as a neutral carrier of information, or communication. The focus of the discourse analyses of interview interactions presented in this paper is on two aspects of discursive structure, the indexical category of ‘research’, and interest management, which refers to the ways that participants manage their own and others’ stakes in particular accounts. The paper concludes by noting how formal scholarly communication acts as a ‘category entitlement’ in interviews, and how technological determinism works as a dilemma for this entitlement that participants (including researchers) negotiate at the very local level of their interactions and accounts...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTheory {{predicts that}} {{senescence}} should inevitably evolve because selection pressure declines with age. Yet, {{data show that}} senescence is not a universal phenomenon. How can these observations peacefully coexist? Evolution of any trait hinges on its impact on fitness. A complete mathematical <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in fitness, the total fitness differential, involves selection pressure along with a perturbation function that describes how the vital rates, mortality and fecundity, are affected across ages. We propose that the perturbation function {{can be used to}} model trade-offs when vital rates are perturbed in different directions and magnitude at different ages. We find that for every trade-off we can identify parameter values for which senescence does evolve and others for which it does not. We argue that this reconciles the apparent contradiction between data and theory. The total fitness differential is also instrumental in deriving mathematical relationships between alternative indicators of selection pressure. We show examples and highlight that any indicator combined with the right perturbation function can be used to parameterize a specific biological change. Biological considerations should motivate what perturbation functions are used. We interpret the relevance of Hamilton's finding that selection pressure declines for the evolution of senescence: declining selection pressure is a necessary but not a sufficient condition...|$|E
40|$|Numerous organisations {{worldwide}} have {{or are in}} {{the process}} of implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems because of the many advantages they bring to an organisation. This paper gives a brief history and description of ERP and describes the many advantages and some of the disadvantages of an ERP system. However, despite the advantages, ERP projects have an extremely high failure rate, sometimes putting the entire organisation into jeopardy. One way to avoid failure is the use of change management as a baseline to the ERP project as it is being implemented. A brief history and <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> management is also outlined and discussed in this paper. Also, the different change management strategies and when/where management should use each of them is also examined. Critical Success Factors (CSF) can be used to benchmark an ERP system, whereby each of the CSF’s has to be met to a sufficient degree before the ERP project can be considered a success. This paper merges these schools of thought; both change management and Critical Success Factors and creates one model called 3 C 2 M, (Combined CSF and Change Management Model) that harnesses the advantages of each. The idea behind this model is to treat the people aspects (change management) and technological aspects (CSF) of change in an ERP implementation together with one model...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{research}} on geodata uncertainty {{has been conducted}} in the past decades, mostly related to modeling, quantifying, and communicating uncertainty. But findings on if and how users can incorporate this information into spatial analyses are still rare. In this paper we address these questions {{with a focus on}} land cover change analysis. We conducted semi-structured interviews with three expert groups dealing with change analysis in the fields of climate research, urban development, and vegetation monitoring. During the interviews we used a software prototype to show change scenarios that the experts had analyzed before, extended by visual depiction of uncertainty related to land cover change. This paper describes the study, summarizes results, and discusses findings as well as the study method. Participants came up with several ideas for applications that could be supported by uncertainty, for example, identification of erroneous change, <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> detection algorithm characteristics, or optimization of change detection parameters. Regarding the aspect of reasoning with uncertainty in land cover change data the interviewees saw potential in better-informed hypotheses and insights about change. Communication of uncertainty information to users was seen as critical, depending on the users’ role and expertise. We judge semi-structured interviews to be suitable {{for the purpose of this}} study and emphasize the potential of qualitative methods (workshops, focus groups etc.) for future uncertainty visualization studies...|$|E

In fact there are no ontologies for quantitative <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> such temporal <b>changes.</b> In this article we present the Web Ontology Language for <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> Continuous <b>Changes</b> (WOLCC) which provides vocabulary for quantitative <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> dynamics, e. g. the mathematical equations for the rate of acceleration of the body, and logical <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> conditions under which the equations are active, boundary conditions at which the equations cease to hold, transitions at boundary conditions, and interactions between dynamically changing parts.

WOLCC is orthogonal to OWL in that it provides for web-based <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in data, typically triggered by actions/events, where the data and actions/events can be described in OWL (or other data modeling languages).
