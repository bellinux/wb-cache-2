5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream,</b> it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E

A version that is {{probably}} {{closer to the truth}} is that Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. He quotes local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini was taken to a command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini {{made it clear that the}} Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> of obscenities.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} mapping stream programs (i. e., programs written <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>streaming</b> style for streaming architectures such as Imagine and Raw) onto a general-purpose CPU. We develop and explore a novel way of mapping these programs onto the CPU. We {{show how the}} salient features of stream programming such as computation kernels, local memories, and asynchronous bulk memory loads and stores can be easily mapped by a simple compilation system to CPU features such as the processor caches, simultaneous multi-threading, and fast inter-thread communication support, resulting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> executable that efficiently uses CPU resources. We present an evaluation of our mapping on a hyperthreaded Intel Pentium 4 CPU as a canonical example of a general-purpose processor. We compare the mapped stream program against the same program coded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more conventional style for the general-purpose processor. Using both micro-benchmarks and scientific applications we show that programs written <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>streaming</b> style can run comparably to equivalent programs written <b>in</b> <b>a</b> traditional style. Our results show that coding programs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>streaming</b> style can improve performance on today’s machines and smooth the way for significant performance improvements with the deployment of streaming architectures...|$|R
