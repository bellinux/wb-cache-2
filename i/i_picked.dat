I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
