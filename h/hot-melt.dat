40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to prepare wax-incorporated pectin-based {{emulsion}} gel beads using a modified emulsion-gelation method. The waxes in pectin–olive oil mixtures containing a model drug, metronidazole, were <b>hot-melted,</b> homogenized and then extruded into calcium chloride solution. The beads formed were separated, washed with distilled water and dried for 12  h. The influence of various types and amounts of wax on floating and drug release behavior of emulsion gel beads of calcium pectinate was investigated. The drug-loaded gel beads were found to float on simulated gastric fluid if the sufficient amount of oil was used. Incorporation of wax into the emulsion gel beads affected the drug release. Water-soluble wax (i. e. polyethylene glycol) increased the drug release while other water-insoluble waxes (i. e. glyceryl monostearate, stearyl alcohol, carnauba wax, spermaceti wax and white wax) significantly retarded the drug release. Different waxes had a slight effect on the drug release. However, the increased amount of incorporated wax in the formulations significantly sustained the drug release while the beads remained floating. The results suggest that wax-incorporated emulsion gel beads could be used as a carrier for intragastric floating drug delivery...|$|R

These acids can be obtained via chemical or biological routes by using various feedstocks such as linear alkanes. Linear alkanes are chemically inert; hence, the production of reactive products requires complex and sophisticated reactions catalysed by either catalysts or enzymes. However, simultaneous by-product formation on chemical synthesis increases production cost and limits commercial availability, preventing their widespread application. Biological routes alternatively, selectively transform linear alkanes into fatty and a,w-dicarboxylic acids. Linear alkanes, due to their relative abundance and increased availability, following the expansion of gas-to-liquid fuels technology, are viewed as prospective feedstocks for the microbial production of a,w-dicarboxylic acids. The commercialisation of the biological conversion of linear alkanes is constrained by the low turnover frequency of the cytochrome P 450 hydroxylase complex responsible for catalysing the first and rate limiting step of the monoterminal and diterminal pathways. Low product yields {{may be caused by}} the further catabolism of a,w-dicarboxylic acids, through the ~-oxidation pathway into energy, carbon dioxide and water. To prevent this, metabolic engineering techniques can be applied to prevent ~-oxidation by disrupting the genes encoding the enzyme catalysing the first step in the~-oxidation pathway. The specific productivity of bioconversion can then be increased further by over-expressing the genes encoding the cytochrome P 450 hydroxylase complex. Recombinant Yarrowia lipolytica strains TVN 497, TVN 499, TVN 501 and TVN 502 were developed in such a manner by the collaborating research group at the University of the Free State and made available for this research...|$|R
30|$|ZnO films (active area 0.28 cm 2) {{of various}} {{thicknesses}} (14 to 35 μm) were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (8 to 10 Ω/□, 3 mm in thickness, Nippon Sheet Glass Co.

Screen-printable ZnO paste was prepared by dispersing commercially available ZnO nanoparticles (UniRegion Bio-Tech, Taiwan) in an equal proportion of α-terpineol (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and ethyl cellulose. Before dye adsorption, the ZnO films were sintered at 400 °C for 1 h {{to remove any}} organic material in the paste. This thermal treatment sintered the nanoparticles together to form an interconnecting network. Dye sensitization was achieved by immersing the sintered ZnO films in a 0.5 mM solution of cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2, 2 ′-bipyridyl- 4, 4 ′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N 719, Solaronix; Solaronix SA, Aubonne, Switzerland).

40|$|University of Minnesota Master of Science thesis. August 2014. Major: Natural {{resources}} {{science and}} management. Advisor: Steven J. Severtson. 1 computer file (PDF); ix, 53 pages. A new approach was introduced for incorporating renewable biomass into existing commercial pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) polymers {{in the form}} of acrylated macromonomers (MM). MM were prepared with L-lactide and caprolactone via a bulk ring-opening polymerization initiated by N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide (HEAA). Acrylic adhesive copolymers were synthesized by free-radical solution polymerization in presence of 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA), acrylamide and macromonomers. This approach was achieved without sacrificing adhesive performance. Incorporation of the MM into the polymers was confirmed via proton NMR. Properties and adhesive performance of the new polymer were compared with its 100 % acrylic commercial version. When synthesized using the same approach, the biomass-containing PSA had a lower molecular weight, higher glass transition temperature (Tg) and lower melt viscosity. Introduction of MM had little impact of tack force, shear time and shear adhesion failure temperature and peel strength increased substantially. Influence of HEAA capped L-lactide/caprolactone MM composition on acrylic <b>hot-melts</b> was also reviewed. A series of MMs, synthesized using catalyzed ring-opening polymerizations, were produced containing a broad range of lactic acid and caprolactone repeat units. Results indicate that the properties and performance of adhesive polymers are strongly dependent on lactide composition. In general, increasing lactide content increases polymer hardness enhancing cohesive strength, while reducing it (i. e., increasing caprolactone content) softens the polymer. Optimal adhesion is found to require a balance between these tendencies as indicated by the existence of a clear maximum in both tack and peel data. The results demonstrate that a broad range of properties is achievable through relatively minor modifications to MM composition. It is expected that these hybrid materials can be optimized for a variety of self-adhesive applications...|$|R

The active electrode area was 0.25 cm 2, and the films had a thickness of 8 μm. The resulting films were then gradually heated and annealed at 150 °C for 1 h to remove organic materials in the paste and to increase crystallinity of ZnO.

The holes, joints and/or slots are permeable and are diagonally introduced to the surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for adhering components from same or different metals in the automotive-, aircraft- and engineering- and related industries, comprises coating adhesive surfaces of the components to be joined with an adhesive for actual adhesion process, introducing conical holes, joints and/or slots in the adhesion surfaces by a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser after coating, filling the holes, joints and/or slots with fast-hardening adhesives and then hardening. The holes, joints and/or slots are permeable, are diagonally introduced to the surface during tensile stress of the adhered components, and have changing directions. Contour sections act as the holes, joints and/or slots, where slots are S-shaped with oblique sections. Oblique boring and oblique cutting edge are implemented {{for the production of}} holes, joints and/or slots after trepanning process. Cyanacrylate and/or low-viscous 2 -K-epoxide resin and/or ultraviolet activated- or ultraviolet hard adhesive system are used as fast hardening adhesives. The holes, joints and/or slots are introduced into the join parts and then the adhesion surfaces are coated with the adhesive that penetrates into the join parts. The adhesive is temporarily heated and then flows into the holes, joints and/or slots. The temperature lies under the hardening temperature. <b>Hot-melts</b> are used as adhesive, are heated up to melting and flow into the holes. The heating and cooling of the adhesive in the holes, joints and/or slots take place before hardening the adhesive surfaces. The low-melting metals are introduced into the holes, joints and/or slots. The hardening of the adhesive surfaces is integrated into a continuous overall process. The hardening of the adhesive surfaces takes place in the cathodic immersion lacquer process during the application in the automobile industry. The already hardened adhesive is displaced with specified adhered rivet. The strengthening takes place by filling materials. The adhesives are strengthened in the holes, joints and slots to increase their firmness. The fiber strengthening of the adhesive takes place by carbon fibers, glass fibers and or textile fibers. Carbon-nanotubes and/or particles in micro- or nano-size are used as the filling materials.
