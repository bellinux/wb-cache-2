Chronicity of hepatitis B virus(HBV) is mainly due to its ability to debilitate host's immune system. Therefore, major measures {{have been taken to}} stop this process and help patients with chronic hepatitis B infection recover from their illness. While satisfactory results have been achieved using preventive HBV vaccines, a reliable and effective therapeutic treatment is still in need of extensive studies. Current treatments for chronic hepatitis B include direct antiviral agents and nucleoside/nucleotide analogs, which are not always effective and are also costly.

To remedy this situation, mental health experts and Texas politicians began to create a system of healing known as state asylums. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} determine how Texas mental health care came into being, the research and theories behind the prevention and treatment programs that asylum physicians employed to overcome mental illness, in addition to the victories and shortcomings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. Through this work, it will be shown that during the 1850 s until the 1920 s institutions faced difficulty in achieving success from many adverse conditions including, but not limited to, overcrowding, large geographical conditions, poor health practices, faulty construction, insufficient funding, ineffective prevention and treatment methods, disorganization, cases of patient abuse, incompetent employees, prejudice, and legal improprieties. As a result, by 1930, these asylums were merely places to detain the mentally ill in order to rid them from society. This thesis will also confirm that while both Texas politicians and mental health experts desired to address and overcome mental illness in Texas, they were unable to do so due to arguments, selfishness, corruption, failures, and inaction on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> both sides. However, this thesis will ultimately reveal it was lack of full support from Texas legislators, deriving from the idea that this system was not one of their top priorities among the state’s concerns, that led to <b>the</b> inability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Texas mental health care system to properly assist their patients...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{evolutionary}} theory {{has attempted to}} predict <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> traits through their effect at the cell-level. Virulence traits, when expressed in parasites, act to decrease <b>the</b> fitness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host, and thus indirectly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parasite itself. To explain <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> such traits, current evolutionary models must therefore assume {{a positive correlation between}} virulence and parasite transmission. Parasite virulence can be selected for as long as <b>debilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present host is compensated by an increase in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> new hosts becoming infected. Here, I test <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> such models to explain <b>the</b> apparent success <b>of</b> a plasmid-borne virulence trait (postsegregational killing (PSK)). In contrast to expectations of cell-level models, PSK did not enable host cells, or host plasmids, to replicate more frequently. Despite this, in some environments plasmids encoding PSK were more successful than isogenic ΔPSK counterparts. To explain this finding I present an alternative, 'competition' model. This model proposes that PSK systems are selected at the plasmid-level, by inhibiting <b>the</b> reproduction <b>of</b> competitors, without <b>the</b> need to contribute to cell-level fitness. A mathematical model was written to formalise predictions of this model. Experimental test of these predictions were consistent with the proposal above. I also demonstrate that the competition model can explain <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> PSK systems to <b>the</b> genomes <b>of</b> plasmids. Other commonly plasmid-borne traits (e. g. antibiotic resistance) may also form de-facto PSK systems, rendering a cell 'addicted' to an otherwise dispensable element. If so, an understanding of how plasmid-level competition influences their selection may be essential to models hoping to predict their success and evolution. In support of this interpretation, I demonstrate <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> plasmids to undergo plasmid-level competition in environments inhibiting cell-level reproduction...|$|R
