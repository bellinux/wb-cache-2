In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is {{you spend a lot}} of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Carey described going under-cover as the stalker role: [...] "Well, we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> outside. I'm walking up to the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, {{there were a lot}} of people just standing there taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole rigmarole. It is what it is. So, basically, I went into costume as the stalker, and I told my bodyguard, 'I don't want you to walk with me.' So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2001, Giuliani's {{attorney}} {{revealed that}} Giuliani was impotent due to prostate cancer treatments {{and had not}} had sex with Nathan for the preceding year. [...] "You don't get through treatment for cancer and radiation all by yourself", Giuliani said. [...] "You need people to help you and care for you and support you. And I'm very fortunate I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who did that, but nobody did more to help me than Judith Nathan." [...] Giuliani argued in a court case that he aimed to introduce Nathan to his children on Father's Day 2001, and that Hanover had prevented this visit. Giuliani and Hanover finally settled their divorce case in July 2002 after his mayoralty had ended, with Giuliani paying Hanover a $6.8 million settlement and granting her custody of their children. Giuliani married Nathan on May 24, 2003, and gained a stepdaughter, Whitney. It was also Nathan's third marriage after two divorces.|$|E

2500|$|Cecil's killing went largely unnoticed in the animal's native Zimbabwe. The country's The Chronicle {{newspaper}} wrote: [...] "It {{is not an}} overstatement {{that almost}} 99.99 percent of Zimbabweans didn’t know about this animal until Monday. Now we have just learnt, thanks to the British media, that we had Africa’s most famous lion all along, an icon!" [...] The BBC's Farai Sevenzo wrote: [...] "The lion's death has not registered much with the locals". [...] At the same time, Zimbabwean officials stated that the killing of Cecil had already caused a decrease of tourism revenues. A significant decrease was noted in Hwange, where the lion had lived. Many international tourists, who had planned to see the lion, had cancelled their trips. [...] "This killing is a huge loss to our tourism sector that was contributing immensely to the national wealth", said Emanuel Fundira, {{the president of the}} Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe. [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> in terms of visitors, coming in to the country to enjoy and view Cecil, so really this was a great loss," [...] Fundira said, and that Cecil's presence was [...] "a draw card," [...] and compared his death to [...] "the demise of an icon". The director of the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, Karikoga Kaseke, said that tourism had been booming, but that Zimbabwe was now perceived as a country which was not interested in protecting and promoting animal rights, and this had also had a negative effect on the tourism sector.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E

I had to dress up in a stiff white dress with a sash, and Jen tied two big white fly-away bows on my hair that kept rasping my neck and {{tickling}} my ears in a most exasperating way. Then an old lady whom I detest tried to make me talk before everybody, and all I could do was to turn as red as a beet and stammer: [...] "Yes, ma'am," [...] "no, ma'am." [...] It made Mother furious, because it is so old-fashioned to say [...] "ma'am." [...] Our old nurse taught me to say it when I was small, and though it has been pretty well governessed out of me since then, it's sure to pop up when I get confused and nervous.|$|E

6000|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--Your letter came yesterday. It then {{occurred}} to me that I might have known (per mental telegraph) that it was due; {{for a couple of weeks}} ago when the Weekly came containing that handsome reference to me I was powerfully moved to write you; and my letter went on writing itself while I was at work at my other literature during the day. But next day my other literature was still urgent--and so on and so on; so my letter didn't get put into ink at all. But I see now, that you were writing, about that time, therefore a part of my stir could have come across the Atlantic per mental telegraph. In 1876 or '75 I wrote 40,000 words of a story called [...] "Simon Wheeler" [...] wherein the nub was the preventing of an execution through testimony furnished by mental telegraph from the other side of the globe. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> scattered about the globe who carried in their pockets something like the old mesmerizer-button, made of different metals, and when they wanted to call up each other and have a talk, they [...] "pressed the button" [...] or did something, I don't remember what, and communication was at once opened. I didn't finish the story, though I re-began it in several new ways, and spent altogether 70,000 words on it, then gave it up and threw it aside.|$|E
60|$|My {{favourite}} red willow {{was also}} the chosen haunt of another being, a peregrine falcon, a large handsome female that used to spend some months each year with us, and would sit for hours {{every day in the}} tree. It was an ideal tree for the falcon, too, not only because it was a quiet spot where it could doze the hot hours away in safety, but also on account of the numbers of pigeons we used to keep. The pigeon- house, a round, tower-shaped building, whitewashed outside, with a small door always kept locked, was usually tenanted by four or five hundred birds. These cost us nothing to keep, and were never fed, as they picked up their own living on the plain, and being strong fliers and well used to the dangers of the open country abounding in hawks, they ranged far from home, going out in small parties of a dozen or more to their various distant feeding-grounds. When out riding we used to come on these flocks several miles from home, and knew they were our birds since no one else in that neighbourhood kept pigeons. They were highly valued, especially by my father, who preferred a broiled pigeon to mutton cutlets for breakfast, and was also fond of pigeon- pies. Once or twice every week, according to the season, eighteen or twenty young birds, just ready to leave the nest, were taken from the dovecote to be put into a pie of gigantic size, and this was usually the grandest dish on the table when we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to dinner or supper.|$|E
