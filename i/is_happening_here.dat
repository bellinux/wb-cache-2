[...] suggested that crustal deformation in this region {{is a continuation of}} the Basin and Range region immediately to the south, with any connection to the OWL deemed circumstantial. [...] Another explanation is that clock-wise rotation of part of Oregon (discussed below) about a point near the Wallula Gap has pulled the Blue Mountains away from the OWL; this might also explain why the OWL seems to be bending here.|$|E

You see what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> in Paris. You see the foul spectre of Anarchy stalking through a land fallen into confusion. Probably you have enough imagination to conceive something of what must follow. And do you deceive yourself that out of this filth and ruin there will rise up an ideal form of society?

However, it does appear possible to modulate heart rate and blood pressure to some extent via relaxation methods and meditative techniques. In physiological terms what must <b>be</b> <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{a change in the}} ratio of sympathetic (stimulatory, increasing rate) versus parasympathetic (inhibitory, decreasing rate) tone (activity) throughout the body. This will have a direct effect on the activity of the sinoatrial node and therefore the entire heart (Amihai and Kozhevnikov 2015).|$|R
