5000|$|Few organoiodine {{compounds}} {{are important}} industrially, {{at least in}} terms of large scale production. Iodide-containing intermediates are common in organic synthesis, because of the easy formation and cleavage of the C - I bond. Industrially significant organoiodine compounds, often used as disinfectants or pesticides, are iodoform (CHI3), methylene iodide (CH2I2), and methyl iodide (CH3I). [...] Although methyl iodide is not an industrially important product, it is an important intermediate, being a transiently generated intermediate in the industrial production of acetic acid and acetic anhydride. The potential for methyl iodide to replace the ubiquitous dependence on methyl bromide as a soil fumigant has been considered, however limited information is available on environmental behavior of the former. [...] <b>Ioxynil</b> (3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile), which inhibits photosynthesis at photosystem II, is among the very few organoiodine herbicides. A member of the hydroxybenzonitrile herbicide class, <b>ioxynil</b> is an iodinated analog of the brominated herbicide, bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile).|$|E

40|$|Interactions of <b>ioxynil</b> (3, 5 -diiodo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile) with a {{pure culture}} of Erwinia carotovora grown in a glucose-simple salts medium were studied. Growth of E. carotovora was {{inhibited}} by <b>ioxynil</b> and, {{to a lesser}} extent, by its acid form at 25 and 50 μg/ml. Growth was not inhibited by the amide or ester forms of <b>ioxynil</b> or p-hydroxybenzonitrile at the same concentrations. E. carotovora could be trained to grow in 50 μg or higher concentrations of <b>ioxynil</b> per ml by serial transfers of the organism through increasing <b>ioxynil</b> concentrations. No degradation or detoxification of <b>ioxynil</b> was detected. Toxicity tests indicated that, in the adapted culture, cell-free supernatant fluid remained toxic to a nonadapted culture. Adaptation of E. carotovora resulted in a lengthened lag phase, a decreased growth rate, and very few adverse effects on the total population. The adapted resistant culture retained this characteristic only when <b>ioxynil</b> was present. Adaptation was demonstrated to be a physiological variation, not a selection of a mutant or of preexisting resistant cells. <b>Ioxynil</b> slightly stimulated the respiration rate of E. carotovora and moderately inhibited that of an adapted culture. Because the respiration rate of an adapted culture {{in the absence of}} <b>ioxynil</b> surpassed that of a parent culture still in the presence of <b>ioxynil,</b> a competition of two alternate routes of electron transport is implied. These data support the conclusion that an alternate growth mechanism is involved in the adaptation mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} {{mechanism of}} <b>ioxynil</b> (3, 5 -diiodo- 4 -hydroxy-benzonitrile) was studied in dimethylsulfoxide using the electrochemical methods (tast polarography, cyclic voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis) combined with GC/MS identification of products. The reduction {{is accompanied by}} the cleavage of iodide yielding 3 -iodo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile. Surprisingly, this process requires only one electron for the exhaustive electrolysis of the starting compound. We showed that the apparent one electron reduction observed in the aprotic solvent {{is due to the}} autoprotonation by another molecule of <b>ioxynil.</b> The overall one electron reduction (uptake of two electrons per two molecules of <b>ioxynil)</b> is changed {{in the presence of a}} strong proton donor to a two electron process per one molecule...|$|E
40|$|A new Synechocystis 6714 mutant, IoxIIA, {{resistant}} to the phenol-type herbicide <b>ioxynil</b> was isolated and characterized.

In IoxIIA, the change of Asn 266 to Asp gives a 3 x resistance, whereas in IoxIA, the change of the same amino acid to Thr gives a 10 x resistance.

DC polarography shows two irreversible reduction waves for <b>ioxynil</b> and only one reduction wave for bromoxynil and chloroxynil.

The main decomposition pathway includes the cleavage of the halogen atom and the dimerization of the dehalogenated intermediate.

40|$|Bicarbonate {{depletion}} of chloroplast hylakoids reduces the affinity of the herbicide, <b>ioxynil,</b> to its binding site in Photosystem (PS) II. This herbicide {{is found to}} be a relatively more efficient inhibitor of the Hill reaction when HCO 3 is added to C 02 -depleted thylakoids in subsaturating rather than in saturating concentrations. The reason for this dependence of the inhibitor efficiency on the HCOf concentration is that the inactive HCO 3 -deficient PS II reaction chains bind less <b>ioxynil</b> than the active PS II electron-transport chains that have bound HC 03 -, and, thus, after addition of a certain amount of <b>ioxynil</b> the concentration of the free herbicide increases when the HC 03 - concentration decreases. Therefore, the inhibition of electron transport by <b>ioxynil</b> increases at decreasing HCO 3 - levels. Measurements on the effects of modification of lysine and arginine residues on the rate of electron transport are also presented: the rate of modification is faster in the presence than in the absence of HCO~-. Therefore, we suggest hat surface-exposed lysine or arginine residues are not involved in binding of HCO~- (or CO 2 or CO 2 -) to its binding protein, but that HCO~- influences the conformation of its binding environment such that the affinity for certain herbicides and the accessibility for amino acid modifiers are changed...|$|E
40|$|Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans {{has been}} shown to grow by {{coupling}} the oxidation of lactate to the metabolic reductive dehalogenation of ortho chlorines on polysubstituted phenols. Here, we examine the ability of D. chlororespirans to debrominate and deiodinate the polysubstituted herbicides bromoxynil (3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile), <b>ioxynil</b> (3, 5 -diiodo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile), and the bromoxynil metabolite 3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzoate (DBHB). Stoichiometric debromination of bromoxynil to 4 -cyanophenol and DBHB to 4 -hydroxybenzoate occurred. Further, bromoxynil (35 to 75 μM) and DBHB (250 to 260 μM) were used as electron acceptors for growth. Doubling times for growth (means ± standard deviations for triplicate cultures) on bromoxynil (18. 4 ± 5. 2 h) and DBHB (11. 9 ± 1. 4 h), determined by rate of [14 C]lactate uptake into biomass, were similar to those previously reported for this microorganism during growth on pyruvate (15. 4 h). In contrast, <b>ioxynil</b> was not deiodinated when added alone or when added with bromoxynil; however, <b>ioxynil</b> dehalogenation, with stoichiometric conversion to 4 -cyanophenol, was observed when the culture was amended with 3 -chloro- 4 -hydroxybenzoate (a previously reported electron acceptor). To our knowledge, this is the first direct report of deiodination by a bacterium in the Desulfitobacterium genus and the first report of an anaerobic pure culture with the ability to transform bromoxynil or <b>ioxynil.</b> This research provides valuable insights into the substrate range of D. chlororespirans...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine if satisfactory weed control in vegetable crops (scallions) could be achieved and overall chemical use reduced by very repeated low dose applications of contact and contact residuals herbicides. The trials showed that scallion crops could tolerate certain post-emergence herbicides better than weed populations earlier in their life cycle provided the first true leaf of the crop had reached 1. 5 - 2 cm in length. Various combinations or cocktails of herbicides of cyanazine, oxyfourfen, <b>ioxynil</b> and gesagard were tested both at Kinsealy and in several commercial locations in Co. Dublin at very low rates varying from 17 to 70 g/ha and these were compared with current standard post-emergence recommendation of single rate <b>ioxynil</b> at 0. 4 - 0. 7 kg/ha. Each of the cocktail combinations apart from <b>ioxynil</b> and cyanazine produced highly satisfactory weed control when repeated at 7 - 12 day intervals commencing when the first true leaf averaged 2 cms long, over a wide range of conditions. The most effective and satisfactory weed control was achieved from either the oxyflourfen (17 - 35 g/ha) plus cyanazine (35 - 70 g/ha) or the ioxynil(17 - 35 g/ha) plus gesagard (17 - 35 g/ha) combinations.

The results obtained with these methods were compared with those from nitrite production and utilization by pure cultures of Nitrosomonas sp and Nitrobacter sp respectively, and with measurement of oxygen uptake by these organisms and enriched soil, by conventional Warburg techniques for these herbicides. The results indicate that there were differential effects of the herbicides on the growth and metabolism of the nitrifying organisms; the nitrification process was affected at a lower herbicide concentration than the growth rate. The evidence suggests {{that there was an}} adaptation of the nitrifying organisms during growth, i. e. a selective proliferation of a tolerant strain. <b>Ioxynil,</b> propanil, chloroflurazole and bromoxynil were the most toxic while dichlobenil, paraquat and endothal were the least toxic of the herbicides.

40|$|Póster presentado en el Plant Biology Europe 2014 Congress (FESPB/EPSO) celebrado en Dublín (Irlanda), del 22 al 26 de junio de 2014 Nitrogen {{oxidized}} species (RNS) are molecules {{involved in}} cell signalling, characterized for modulating plant responses to stressful conditions. An essential RNS in plants is nitric oxide (NO), known for mediating in numerous physiological processes. Despite {{the importance of}} NO for plant development, {{the existence of a}} mammalian-like nitric oxide synthase is doubtful and data on oxidative production of NO in plants are still vague (1). However, the detection of NO, nitrite and nitrate in plants grown under exclusive ammonium nutrition demonstrates the existence of oxidative reactions leading to the production of such molecules from the ammonium cation. It has been described that phosphorous deficiency enhances NO production (2) and that the enzymatic system cytochrome P 450 (CytP 450) is induced by phosphorous starvation (3). For that reason, the general aim of this work was to study the effect of the herbicide <b>ioxynil,</b> a CytP 450 inhibitor, and phosphorus deficiency, which induces CytP 450, monitoring NO and nitrate production in pea plants under ammonium nutrition. Phosphorous deficiency enhanced lateral root development and decreased growth, whilst <b>ioxynil</b> inhibited lateral root growth. The implication of CytP 450 in nitrogen oxidation is discussed. The study of NO production under ammonium nutrition will have a clear impact in the knowledge of tolerance to ammonium in plants of agricultural interest, and it will surely contribute to ameliorate fertilization policies.

The most successful herbicide is ametryne which can be used at sufficiently low levels to virtually eliminate phytotoxicity; but which controls a broad range of weeds if applied at an early post-emergence stage. Ametryne is usually applied in conjunction with atrazine or cyanazine. In early spring, on virgin lands and on basalt soils, asulam combinations with <b>ioxynil</b> + 2, 4 -D or ametryne are recommended if other ametryne mixtures cannot be sprayed at a very early post-emergence stage.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to obtain {{detailed}} information about the behaviour of the common herbicides bromoxynil, <b>ioxynil,</b> and mecoprop during artificial groundwater recharge and bank filtration. The experiments carried out at the Institut fuer Wasserforschung (IfW) simulated the worst case situations during slow sand filtration, aerobic and anaerobic underground passage and in saturated and unsaturated soil. An analytical procedure was developed suitable for the determination of the herbicides as well as their degradation products. The procedure is based on an enrichment step on graphitized carbon black, a methylation directly at the surface of the adsorbent and a determination of the analytes with GC/MS after elution. A determination limit of concentrations below 10 ng/L was routinely achieved. The behaviour of the herbicides and of 15 metabolites could be followed; 7 of the metabolites were identified for the first time. (orig.)

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid in vitro {{toxicological}} assay, utilizing submitochondrial particles (SMP), {{has been used}} to evaluate the toxic effects of fifteen herbicides belonging to the phenol and phenoxyalkanoic acid chemical classes. The SMP assay allows the quantitative evaluation of the toxicity of compounds with different mechanisms of action: uncouplers, inhibitors of the enzyme complexes involved in reverse electron transfer and in oxidative phosphorylation and chemicals that alter the membrane structure. The two groups of herbicides showed different levels of toxicity. For phenol derivatives, EC 50 values ranged from 0. 16 μM (<b>ioxynil)</b> to 6. 7 μM (2, 4 -dinitrophenol), whereas for phenoxy herbicides EC 50 values ranged from 21 μM (2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2, 4, 5 -T) to 110 μM (4 -chloro- 2 - methylphenoxyacetic acid, MCPA). On the average, the toxicity of phenolic compounds is greater than that of phenoxyalkanoic acids by two orders of magnitude. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) were developed between EC 50 values and various molecular descriptors. The results suggest the existence of different mechanisms of action for the two classes of compounds. The findings obtained for phenolic herbicides are consistent with a protonophoric uncoupling mechanism, whereas for phenoxy herbicides a non-specific mode of action at membrane level can be hypothesized. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
