5|$|By December 1974, Lennon and Pang {{considered}} {{buying a}} house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, {{who claimed to have}} found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused {{to such an extent that}} Pang believed he had been brainwashed. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E

5|$|Hours earlier, Lucan had again {{called his}} mother, at about 12:30am. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be}} in touch later that day, but {{declined}} to speak with the police constable who had accompanied her to her flat; instead, he said he would call the police later that morning. Ranson discovered that Lucan had travelled to Uckfield when he was called by Ian Maxwell-Scott, who told him that Lucan had arrived at his home a few hours after the murder, and spoken with his wife, Susan. While there, the earl had written two letters to his brother-in-law, Bill Shand-Kydd, and posted them to his London address. Maxwell-Scott also called Shand-Kydd at his country house near Leighton Buzzard and told him about the letters, prompting the latter to immediately drive to London to collect them. After reading them, and noting that they were bloodstained, he took them to Ranson.|$|E
5|$|John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer were {{virtually}} unknown before being cast {{in their respective}} roles as Jim and Pam, the central love interests. Krasinski had attended school with B. J. Novak, and the two were friends. Fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible, creating the original Pam hairstyle. In an interview on NPR's Fresh Air, Fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for Pam and Jim, with the producers partnering the different potential Pams and Jims (four of each) together to gauge their chemistry. When Fischer finished her scene with Krasinski, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she was his favorite Pam, to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite Jim. Adam Scott and John Cho both auditioned {{for the role of}} Jim, and Kathryn Hahn also auditioned for the role of Pam.|$|E

25|$|Two detectives from RHD interrogated her {{the next}} month, July 2010. She {{told them she}} was {{concerned}} that events leading to Lazarus's arrest {{in which she was}} involved had been portrayed differently in the media than she recalled them, putting the department in a more favorable light. Nuttall as well, she recalled, had been placed in an equally difficult position, since <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Lazarus may have learned that they had reopened the investigation despite the precautions he and Barba had taken.|$|E
25|$|After a {{thorough}} {{review of the}} initial evidence, Andrew T. Cayley Q.C. wrote to the Chief Prosecutor {{at the time in}} which <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the prosecution could not proceed on the evidence it had. That report was immediately discarded and Cayley was reprimanded for his views. As a result of {{the manner in which the}} chief prosecutor ignored Cayley's advice and pursued the indictment against Mr. Haradinaj, three senior prosecutors Geoffery Nice Q.C., Andrew T Cayley Q.C. and Mark Harmon left the office of the Prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|He {{first met}} his wife Vivien, an air {{stewardess}} with BOAC, in Bermuda whilst touring there with Yorkshire in 1964, when she was engaged to someone else. He pursued her relentlessly, even though initially she considered him not to be her type. Brian gambled with his love life too: on New Year's Day 1965 <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if she didn't agree to marry him, he would never see her again. They married the following March. They went on to have one daughter, Lynn, and a son, Lance.|$|E

25|$|Governor Miguel de la Torre {{ordered her}} arrest on {{the charge that}} she planned to {{overthrow}} the Spanish Government in Puerto Rico. As the island had no women's prison, she was held without bail at the Castillo (Fort) de San Crist√≥bal. Among the evidence which the Spanish authorities presented against her was a letter dated October 1, 1824, from Rojas in which <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the Venezuelan rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the Venezuelan rebels {{and the leaders of}} the Puerto Rican independence movement was in danger of being discovered.|$|E

Eventually she was allowed to visit him in Hollywood, but her visits were kept short.|$|E

25|$|After the {{dispersal}} {{of the family}} of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the only thing they fear was FIRE, if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that she had gone to tell her people. They were soon prepared for the marauders.|$|E

500|$|Tibbets was {{promoted}} to colonel in January 1945 and brought his wife and family along with him to Wendover.

500|$|In March 1783, Prince Potemkin made {{a rhetorical}} push to {{encourage}} Empress Catherine to annex Crimea.

Encouraged by this news, Empress Catherine issued a formal proclamation of annexation on [...] Tatars did not resist the annexation.
