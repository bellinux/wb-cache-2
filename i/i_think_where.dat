'Our young friends sailed on Sunday, August 7; and we {{expected}} the Bishop to sail the next day, but the winds were foul and boisterous, {{and we had}} him with us till Friday morning, the 12th.

I think it was partly to please our Maori maiden, who sat by his side on a footstool in the twilight, plying him with questions with so much lively natural interest that he warmed up in return. Generally, he shrank into himself, and became reserved at once if pressed to tell of his own doings. He spoke one evening quite openly about his dislike to ship life. We were laughing at some remembrance of the Bishop of Lichfield's satisfaction when once afloat; and he burst into an expression of wonder, how anyone could go to sea for pleasure. I asked him what he disliked in particular, and he answered, Everything. That he always felt dizzy, headachy, and unable to read with comfort; the food was greasy, and there was a general sense of dirt and discomfort. As the time drew nigh for sailing, he talked a good deal about the rapidly growing evil of the labour trade. He grew very depressed one day, and spoke quite despondingly of the future prospects of the Mission. He told us of one island, Vanua Lava, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>where,</b> a few years ago, 300 men used to assemble on the beach to welcome him. Now, only thirty or forty were left. He saw that if the trade went on {{at the same rate as}} it had been doing for the last year or two, many islands would be depopulated, and everywhere he must expect to meet with suspicion or open ill will.' ...|$|E

The tower, which is {{traditionally}} named after Hannibal, is seen on a height that makes part {{of the line of}} enclosing hills. It is a large, old castle, apparently of the Middle Ages, with a square front, and a battlemented sweep of wall. The town of Torres (its name, <b>I</b> <b>think),</b> <b>where</b> Hannibal's main army is supposed to have lain while the Romans came through the pass, was in full view; and I could understand the plan of the battle better than any system of military operations which I have hitherto tried to fathom. Both last night and to-day, I found myself stirred more sensibly than I expected by the influences of this scene. The old battle-field is still fertile in thoughts and emotions, though it is so many ages since the blood spilt there has ceased to make the grass and flowers grow more luxuriantly. I doubt whether I should feel so much on the field of Saratoga or Monmouth; but these old classic battle-fields belong to the whole world, and each man feels as if his own forefathers fought them. Mine, by the by, if they fought them at all, must have been on the side of Hannibal; for, certainly, I sympathized with him, and exulted in the defeat of the Romans on their own soil. They excite much the same emotion of general hostility that the English do. Byron has written some very fine stanzas on the battle-field,--not so good as others that he has written on classical scenes and subjects, yet wonderfully impressing his own perception of the subject on the reader. Whenever he has to deal with a statue, a ruin, a battle-field, he pounces upon the topic like a vulture, and tears out its heart in a twinkling, so that there is nothing more to be said.|$|E
6000|$|I {{see much}} of the rest of that {{particular}} Paris time in the light of the Institution Fezandié, and I see the Institution Fezandié, Rue Balzac, in the light, if not quite of Alphonse Daudet's lean asylum for the petits pays chauds, of which I have felt the previous institutions of New York sketchily remind me, at least in that of certain other of his studies in that field of the precarious, the ambiguous Paris over parts of which the great Arch at the top of the Champs-Elysées flings, at its hours, by its wide protective plausible shadow, a precious mantle of [...] "tone." [...] They gather, these chequered parts, into its vast paternal presence and enjoy at its expense a degree of reflected dignity. It was to the big square villa of the Rue Balzac that we turned, as pupils not unacquainted with vicissitudes, from a scene swept bare of M. Lerambert, an establishment that strikes me, at this distance of time, as of the oddest and most indescribable--or as describable at best in some of the finer turns and touches of Daudet's best method. The picture indeed should not be invidious--it so little needs that, I feel, for its due measure of the vivid, the queer, the droll, all coming back to me without prejudice to its air as of an equally futile felicity. I see it as bright and loose and vague, as confused and embarrassed and helpless; I see it, I fear, as quite ridiculous, but as wholly harmless to my brothers and me at least, and as having left us with a fund of human impressions; it played before us such a variety of figure and character and so relieved us of a sense of untoward discipline or of the pursuit of abstract knowledge. It was a recreational, or at least a social, rather than a tuitional house; which fact had, I really believe, weighed favourably with our parents, when, bereft of M. Lerambert, they asked themselves, with their considerable practice, how next to bestow us. Our father, like so many free spirits of that time in New York and Boston, had been much interested in the writings of Charles Fourier and in his scheme of the [...] "phalanstery" [...] as the solution of human troubles, and it comes to me that he must have met or in other words heard of M. Fezandié as an active and sympathetic ex-Fourierist (I think there were only ex-Fourierists by that time,) who was embarking, not far from us, on an experiment if not absolutely phalansteric at least inspired, or at any rate enriched, by a bold idealism. I like to think of the Institution as all but phalansteric--it so corrects any fear that such places might be dreary. I recall this one as positively gay--bristling and bustling and resonant, untouched by the strenuous note, for instance, of Hawthorne's co-operative Blithedale. I like to think that, in its then still almost suburban, its pleasantly heterogeneous quarter, now oppressively uniform, it was close to where Balzac had ended his life, though I question its identity--as for a while I tried not to--with the scene itself of the great man's catastrophe. Round its high-walled garden at all events he would have come and gone--a throb of inference that had for some years indeed to be postponed for me; though an association displacing to-day, over the whole spot, every other interest. I in any case can't pretend not to have been most appealed to by that especial phase of our education from which the pedagogic process as commonly understood was most fantastically absent. It excelled in this respect, the Fezandié phase, even others exceptionally appointed, heaven knows, for the supremacy; and yet its glory is that it was no poor blank, but that it fairly creaked and groaned, heatedly overflowed, with its wealth. We were externes, the three of us, but we remained in general to luncheon; coming home then, late in the afternoon, with an almost sore experience of multiplicity and vivacity of contact. For the beauty of it all was that the Institution was, speaking technically, not more a pensionnat, with prevailingly English and American pupils, than a pension, with mature beneficiaries of both sexes, and that our two categories were shaken up together to the liveliest effect. This had been M. Fezandié's grand conception; a son of the south, bald and slightly replete, with a delicate beard, a quick but anxious, rather melancholy eye and a slim, graceful, juvenile wife, who multiplied herself, though scarce knowing at moments, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>where</b> or how to turn; I see him as a Daudet méridional, but of the sensitive, not the sensual, type, as something of a rolling stone, rolling rather down hill--he had enjoyed some arrested, possibly blighted, connection in America--and as ready always again for some new application of faith and funds. If fondly failing in the least to see why the particular application in the Rue Balzac--the body of pensioners ranging from infancy to hoary eld--shouldn't have been a bright success could have made it one, it would have been a most original triumph.|$|E

40|$|Credit from stored grain Cue: Farmers {{are often}} {{forced to sell}} their crops when prices are low, because they need money quickly. One way to get better prices {{is known as the}} {{warehouse}} receipt system. Under this system, farmers are able to deposit their harvested maize in a warehouse and be given a receipt which states the amount {{and the quality of the}} grain they have stored. The farmer can then, if they wish, give this receipt to a bank in order to obtain a loan, enabling them to buy inputs for the new season or pay for other items. Later in the season when grain prices should have risen, the farmer can sell the stored maize, repay the loan and hopefully have some money left over. So in Zambia, a few years ago the Zambia Agricultural Commodity Agency tried to set up a warehouse receipt system. But it failed. So why did a system that sounded so good for commercial farmers not deliver better profits? To find out, Chris Kakunta spoke to Rob Munro, a marketing adviser for USAID, which helped to set up the pilot project. IN:	?Essentially it was a very donor-driven ? OUT:	?a commercial commodities market. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Rob Munro of USAID in Zambia, on some of the challenges connected with the warehouse receipt system, in providing credit to smallholder farmers. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Munro	Essentially it was a very donor-driven entity, in that the commodity traders and the banks never really bought into the concept of warehouse receipts. Kakunta	And that led to it failing? Munro	Essentially yes. But I think one of the key problems here, and this will bring us on to lessons which we?ve learnt from that experience, is that a warehouse receipt system depends on the existence of a functioning, high volume commodities market. If you look at this year in particular, there is very little maize stored in warehouses. There is very little maize in total, from this particular harvest and there is no incentive for farmers to be depositing crop into a warehouse, looking for higher prices further into the year. Kakunta	If we have to really look at the system itself, does it really work? Munro	I think the answer to that is yes. It requires the presence of a very strong commodities market where there is plenty of supply, ample demand, multiple buyers and also, critically, a credible pricing system. Kakunta	What is the way forward in terms of warehouse receipt system here in Zambia? Munro	I think it?s important to realise that from a smallholder?s point of view, a warehouse receipt is not the answer to all his or her marketing problems. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>where</b> the primary value of it lies is that by putting commodity into a secure storage at grades and standards in terms of quality and quantity which are recognised by the industry, that warehouse receipt becomes a very valuable trading tool. So I think that?s its primary use as a trading tool, allowing small, relatively small parcels of crop to be aggregated into a large parcel which is then accessible by commercial markets. Secondary to that is a financing option. And I think it?s important to realise that the cost of finance is very high. You need to be very sure, if you are looking for finance from a warehouse receipt, you need to be very sure that the gains in price which you are hoping to take advantage of later on in the season are significantly more than your costs of finance. There have been examples in Zambia, one in particular I?m thinking of, where a crop was deposited at the beginning of the marketing season, held onto until later on in the year, and by the time that crop was released from the warehouse it was actually worth less than the combination of its underlying price and the price of storage and finance. So it?s a risky? like any financing, like any market speculation, it?s a risky business. And therefore it?s not the answer for all smallholders. But I think, like I said, more importantly it?s a valuable tool for bringing your crop into a commercial commodities market. End of track. Zambia?s experience with the warehouse receipt system, whereby farmers can borrow money using stored grain as collateral...|$|E
