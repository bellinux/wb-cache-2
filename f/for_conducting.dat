Instructions <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> the Seder appeared on the English side only and references to biblical verses cited in the text were on the Hebrew side. The Haggadah presents only the text and directions <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> the Seder, without exegesis.|$|E
5|$|After {{investigating}} the massacre, the Supreme Court of Spain officially reprimanded Governor-General de Oraá. The court affirmed that Pule and the cofradía had no political motives.

5|$|In response, Corbulo {{sent the}} legions IV Scythica and XII Fulminata to Armenia, while he {{detailed}} {{the three other}} legions under his command (III Gallica, VI Ferrata and XV Apollinaris) to fortify {{the line of the}} river Euphrates, fearing that the Parthians might invade Syria. At the same time, he petitioned Nero to appoint a separate legate for Cappadocia, with the responsibility <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> the war in Armenia.|$|E

5|$|This {{thumb is}} {{typically}} {{interpreted as a}} close-quarter stiletto-like weapon against predators, although it could also {{have been used to}} break into seeds and fruits, or against other Iguanodon. One author has suggested that the spike was attached to a venom gland, but this has not been accepted, as the spike was not hollow, nor were there any grooves on the spike <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> venom.|$|E
5|$|Active from 1921 to 1942 {{as part of}} the 94th Infantry Division, {{the brigade}} was {{transformed}} into a reconnaissance troop during and after World War II, supporting the 94th Division as it fought in Europe. Activated again from 1997 to 1999 and again in 2006, the unit gained responsibility <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> training for other reserve component army units with a variety of purposes. Today, the unit is responsible for training selected United States Army Reserve and National Guard units East of the Mississippi River.|$|E

5|$|Born in South Wales, Edwards {{moved with}} his parents to England and sang in choirs as a child. He {{witnessed}} his first opera (Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera) at eleven years old when his parents {{took him to the}} Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. Seven years later, he was conducting Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta H.M.S. Pinafore on that same podium.

5|$|In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new {{research}} station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was {{enthusiastic about the}} new station, and it proved very successful <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an endless loop until {{nearly all of them}} died of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise, {{along with}} other ships in the sector, {{experience}} a localized time-distortion, and soon after receive a distress-call from Dr. Paul Manheim in a nearby system.

5|$|The German naval staff hoped {{all these}} changes could be {{accomplished}} by April 1943, with the carrier's first sea trials taking place in August that year. Towards that end, Chief Engineer Wilhelm Hadeler was reassigned to oversee Graf Zeppelins completion. Hadeler planned on getting the two inner shafts and their respective propulsion systems operational first, giving the ship an initial speed of 2526 knots, fast enough for sea trials to commence and <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> air training exercises. By the winter of 19431944 she {{was expected to be}} combat-ready.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's No. 38 Squadron was {{selected}} to transport Australia's share of the bristles. This squadron was equipped with Douglas Dakota aircraft, and was responsible at the time <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> regular flights from Australia to Japan carrying personnel and supplies for the Australian element of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. A detachment of three Dakotas led by No. 38 Squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader John Balfe, was sent from Australia to Hong Kong {{in preparation for the}} task. As flying conditions were expected to be difficult, each of these aircraft was manned by two highly experienced pilots as well as another airman who performed the duties of navigator, radio operator and flight engineer.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm (FAA) {{operated}} a substantially modified {{variant of the}} Harrier, the British Aerospace Sea Harrier. The Sea Harrier was not intended for ground-attack duties and, unlike the standard Harrier, was equipped with radar and Sidewinder missiles for air combat duties and fleet air defence. The Sea Harrier was also fitted with navigational aids for carrier landings, modifications to reduce corrosion and a raised bubble-canopy for greater visibility. The aircraft were later equipped to use AIM-120 AMRAAM beyond-visual-range anti-aircraft missiles and the more advanced Blue Vixen radar for longer range air-to-air combat, as well as Sea Eagle missiles <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> anti-ship missions.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the closure has been questioned, as the United States still {{has the ability to}} conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan, and {{according}} to the Pakistani military, the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones, as well as for emergency landings and logistical support, and not <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011. Following the incident, Pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future US drones intruding on its airspace, and the US suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan. One report said that American drone attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50% due to the Salala attack, as well as legal cases.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{his plea}} bargain, Bell pleaded guilty in July 1997 to {{collecting}} the names and home addresses of IRS employees, and the home addresses of FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and police in Clark County, Washington; Bell also accepted responsibility <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> a stinkbomb attack in the Vancouver IRS office. He was convicted of the two low-level felonies and sentenced in December 1997 to eleven months in prison followed by three years of federal probation. As a condition of his sentence, Bell was compelled to pay, upon his release, $1,359 in restitution for the stinkbomb attack. He was also subjected to three years of supervised release, during which he was barred from accessing computers and from possessing chemicals.|$|E

5|$|Colony Ross, {{known as}} Fort Ross today, {{was built in}} California just north of San Francisco Bay. It was the RAC's southernmost outpost and {{operated}} from 1812 to 1841, and was established as an agricultural base for supplying the northern settlements with food as well as <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> trade with Alta California. The Ross Colony included a number of settlements spread out over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay. The administrative center was Port Rumianstev at Bodega Harbor, off Bodega Bay. An artel hunting camp was located on the Farallon Islands. Three ranches were established: the Kostromitinov Ranch on the Russian River {{near the mouth of}} Willow Creek, the Khlebnikov Ranch in the Salmon Creek valley about a mile (1.6km) north of the present day Bodega, and the Chernykh Ranch near present-day Graton. Fort Ross employed native Alaskans to hunt seals and sea otters on the California coast. By 1840 California's sea otter population had been severely depleted.|$|E
5|$|Gjems-Onstad {{joined the}} Norwegian {{resistance}} movement after Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940. He {{was arrested in}} Sweden for his involvement with Norwegian resistance activity {{in the country in}} 1941, and was sent to the United Kingdom where he joined the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani Linge) and received British military training. He was deployed to Norway in 1943 as part of Lark, assigned with establishing radio connection with London. He led Lark in Trøndelag between 1943 and 1945, which constituted the leadership of Milorg in the region. His other activities included to assist with weapons smuggling, prepare the sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz and plotting to assassinate Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande. He also founded the Durham organisation <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> psychological warfare {{towards the end of the}} war, and he took part in blowing up railway tracks. Gjems-Onstad's efforts during the Second World War led him to become one of Norway's highest decorated war heroes.|$|E
5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E
