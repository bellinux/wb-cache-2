500|$|Bolstered by 18,000 fresh {{troops from}} the {{divisions}} of Major Generals Buell and Lew Wallace, Grant counterattacked at dawn {{the next day and}} regained the field, forcing the disorganized and demoralized rebels to retreat back to Corinth while thousands deserted. Halleck ordered Grant not to advance more than one day from Pittsburg Landing, stopping the pursuit of the Confederate Army. Although Grant had won the battle the situation was little changed, with the Union in possession of Pittsburg Landing and the Confederates once again holed up in Corinth. Grant, now realizing that the South was determined to fight and that the war would not be won with one battle, would later write, [...] "Then, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> all idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest." ...|$|E

Keselowski clinched his first pole {{position in the}} Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.515. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Bowyer. Stewart qualified third, Jamie McMurray took fourth, and Juan Pablo Montoya started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twenty-fifth, while Harvick was scored in twenty-seventh. The two drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Jeff Green and Johnny Sauter. Once qualifying concluded Keselowski said, [...] "I felt I got a shot at the pole before I qualified but you never really know.

500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up.</b> I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E

I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature." [...] He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, [...] "for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, 'The Scream?'

2500|$|In November 2001 Coxon was {{admitted}} to the priory hospital for 28 days to be treated for alcoholism. During this time, Blur began the recording sessions that would produce the material for their next album, Think Tank. In February 2002, Coxon rejoined the band in the studio {{for the rest of the}} recording of Think Tank but after five days was asked by then manager Chris Morrison not to go back into the studio as the other members of the band had reported that the session was not going too well with him present. Coxon took this as a sign and left the band. As he stated in an interview in 2006, [...] "I had a breakthrough, I think my life just became calmer, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> drinking.

2500|$|... "I {{would have}} liked to open {{the left side of the}} thorax to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was {{slightly}} supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.".|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Tam Harvey, Connolly started {{a group called}} the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, [...] "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." [...] The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. [...] "Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. So, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E
