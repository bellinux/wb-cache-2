50|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} the <b>frame</b> <b>alignment</b> system so that the receiver of the frame can tell where it begins, there is so called a <b>frame</b> <b>alignment</b> signal (FAS). In the 2 Mbit/s frame system, the FAS {{is a combination of}} seven fixed bits ("0011011") transmitted in the first time slot in the frame (time slot zero or TS0). For the alignment mechanism to be maintained, the FAS {{does not need to be}} transmitted in every frame. Instead, this signal can be sent in alternate frames (in the first, in the third, in the fifth, and so on). In this case, TS0 is used as the synchronization slot. The TS0 of the rest of the frames is therefore available for other functions, such as the transmission of the alarms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{exponential}} growth of multimedia technologies and media streaming activities have increased video publishing and sharing activities tremendously. Because of this massive media consumption, {{huge number of}} pirated copies of videos are proliferating on the Internet causing huge piracy issues. Fighting video piracy requires copy detection followed by the accurate <b>frame</b> <b>alignments</b> of master and pirated videos, in order to estimate distortion model and capture location in the theatre. Existing research on pirate video registration utilizes only visual features for aligning pirate and master videos, while only less effort is made to employ acoustic features. Further, most studies in illegal video registration concentrate on the alignment of watermarked videos, while few attempts are made to address the alignment of non-watermarked sequences. To solve these issues, a novel and robust registration scheme using multimodal features is proposed, which is also suitable for content based methods such as Content-Based video Copy Detection (CBCD) ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{watermarking}} applications {{may benefit}} from the availability of both the original and the watermarked media content to perform detection. However, one {{must take into account}} that the watermarked media might have undergone deformations such that direct correspondence between original and watermarked signal is not possible anymore. Extra processing is therefore needed to benefit from the availability of both signals. In video applications, besides the spatial deformations, one must also consider a possible temporal structure modification of the watermarked content. Such distortions include frame rate modifications, scene removal and temporal cropping. In this paper, we present how one can perform an automatic <b>frames</b> <b>alignment</b> of spatially and temporally deformed video sequences. Our approach consist in establishing a correspondence between automatically detected key-frames in the two sequences. The key-frame detection is inspired from existing methods dealing with scene cuts localization and semantics (MPEG 7 -like) scene classification. Different simulations show that the method can cope with common temporal deformations. Anglai...|$|R

50|$|Framing {{has been}} {{utilized}} {{to explain the}} process of social movements (Snow & Benford, 1988). Movements are carriers of beliefs and ideologies. In addition, {{they are part of}} the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers (Snow & Benford, 1988). Mass movements are said to be successful when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties.

50|$|In an E1 channel, {{communication}} {{consists of}} sending consecutive frames from the transmitter to the receiver.

This way, the bytes received in each slot are assigned to the correct channel. A synchronization process is then established, and it is known as <b>frame</b> <b>alignment.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractFollowed by video copy detection, {{temporal}} <b>frame</b> <b>alignments</b> of the copied video {{with the}} master contents {{is essential in}} numerous forensic applications such as, computation of geometric distortions and estimation of pirate location in a theater during illegal cam- corder captures. State-of-the-art temporal video copy registration methods are exploiting only visual features of videos, while no effort is made to employ audio signatures. Furthermore, existing studies are primarily focusing on the alignment of watermarked videos, while very few efforts are made towards non-watermarked videos. To solve these issues, this paper presents a robust tempo- ral registration scheme by utilizing visual-audio ﬁngerprints, which consists of two stages: First, the video sequence is compactly represented using 1 -D motion and acoustic proﬁles; Second, accurate frame-to-frame matches are computed using sliding window based dynamic programming technique.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} a workplace interaction between two nonnative English {{as a second language}} teachers and one native-English as a second language teacher.

In addition, this study aims to contribute to the research that has been conducted in both institutional and noninstitutional settings where professionals of different language and cultural backgrounds happen to interact. Analysis of conversation between native and nonnative speakers of English seems to provide evidence that different use of contextualization cues can lead to misunderstanding (Gumperz, 1982; Gumperz, Jupps & Roberts, 1979; Roberts, Davies & Jupp, 1992). However, when conversation takes place between native and nonnative teachers of English as a second language (NES teachers and NNES teachers) other issues besides misunderstanding may arise. One of these issues can be the active involvement of the participants to save one’s or the other’s face, which can create conflicting frames during the interaction...|$|R

40|$|Studies are {{reviewed}} {{that address the}} problem of the variables controlled in the maintenance of body posture and generation of limb movement. Vestibulospinal and neck reflexes cancel each other in response to roll, but not in response to pitch of the animal. In pitch trunk orientation is not effectively stabilized in space. Instead, limb length and orientation relative to the vertical are accurately controlled in normal cats pitched statically and dynamically by variable angles. Control of limb geometry may even take precedence over the control of the projected centre of mass. Coordinate transformation results in a constraint of planar covariation of the elevation angles at all limb segments in cat posture. Because the same constraint applies also to human locomotion, we suggest that sharing the same laws of intersegmental coordination for the control of posture and locomotion helps to assure the maintenance of dynamic equilibrium during movement. Moreover, because several neural sites encode posture and movement in gravity-based reference <b>frames,</b> <b>alignment</b> in register of spatial information derived from multiple sensors and directed to multiple effectors is made possible...|$|R

40|$|Text-dependent speaker {{verification}} {{is becoming}} {{popular in the}} speaker recognition society. However, the conventional i-vector framework which has been successful for speaker identification and other similar tasks works relatively poorly in this task. Researchers have proposed several new methods to improve performance, {{but it is still}} unclear that which model is the best choice, especially when the pass-phrases are prompted during enrollment and test. In this paper, we introduce four modeling methods and compare their performance on the newly published RedDots dataset. To further explore the influence of different <b>frame</b> <b>alignments,</b> Viterbi and forward-backward algorithms are both used in the HMM-based models. Several bottleneck features are also investigated. Our experiments show that, by explicitly modeling the lexical content, the HMM-based modeling achieves good results in the fixed-phrase condition. In the prompted-phrase condition, GMM-HMM and i-vector/HMM are not as successful. In both conditions, the forward-backward algorithm brings more benefits to the i-vector/HMM system. Additionally, we also find that even though bottleneck features perform well for text-independent speaker verification, they do not outperform MFCCs on the most challenging Imposter-Correct trials on RedDots.

With the constant transformation of web 2. 0. phenomenon, the demarcation lines between these domains and their influence has become more blured and difficult to pinpoint. As a result, specific research methods and theories have become adaptable instruments, laying the path for grounded theory approaches or new research methods. Framing theory, having as basis that the media focuses attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning, has shifted towards organisations, and further on, to institutions. Framing is a quality of communication that leads others to accept one meaning over another. Framing theory suggests that how something is presented (the “frame”) influences the choices people make. In online communicative contexts, their own personal framings allows the communicative actors to make use of language and forethought so that specific embodiments of future evolutions may be depicted.

40|$|Strapdown {{inertial}} navigation systems (INS) need an alignment process to determine the initial attitude matrix between the body frame and the navigation <b>frame.</b> The conventional <b>alignment</b> process is to compute the initial attitude matrix using the gravity and Earth rotational rate measurements. However, under mooring conditions, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) employed in a ship’s strapdown INS often suffers from both the intrinsic sensor noise components and the external disturbance components caused by the motions of the sea waves and wind waves, so a rapid and precise alignment of a ship’s strapdown INS without any auxiliary information is hard to achieve. A robust solution is given in this paper to solve this problem. The inertial <b>frame</b> based <b>alignment</b> method is utilized to adapt the mooring condition, most of the periodical low-frequency external disturbance components could be removed by the mathematical integration and averaging characteristic of this method. A novel prefilter named hidden Markov model based Kalman filter (HMM-KF) is proposed to remove the relatively high-frequency error components. Different from the digital filters, the HMM-KF barely cause time-delay problem.
