40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} the tuning and miniaturization performance induced by a volume perturbation inserted in a cavity resonator. The volume perturbation {{is either a}} rectangular perturbation centrally located, called central postperturbation (CPP) or dually, a hole shaped in an annular extruded volume, called side annular perturbation (SAP). The tuning and miniaturization mechanism is fully described using the small perturbation theory. This serves the analytical evaluation of the frequency shift resulting from the insertion of the perturbation volume in the cavity resonator. The impact of these perturbations is assessed also by HFSS simulations and measurements of 72 different cavity resonators. An <b>idle</b> <b>cavity</b> resonator characterized by a resonance frequency of 4 GHz is tuned from 1 to 6 GHz. A maximal frequency shift of 3 GHz and 2 GHz is measured for respectively the resonator with CPP and SAP, {{resulting in a total}} tuning range of 125 %. Additionally, the CPP serves miniaturization purposes, as cavity resonators with a resonance frequency as low as 1 GHz were measured, derived from an <b>idle</b> <b>cavity</b> resonator at 4 GHz. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The DSP-based bunch-by-bunch {{feedback}} system {{installed in the}} PEP-II HER {{has been used to}} damp HOM-induced instabilities at beam currents up to 605 mA during commissioning. Beam pseudospectra calculated from {{feedback system}} data indicate the presence of coupled bunch modes that coincide with the 0 -M- 2 cavity HOM. Bunch current and synchronous phase measurements are also extracted from the data. These measurements reveal the impedance seen by the beam at revolution harmonics. The impedance peak at 3 *frev indicates incorrect parking of the <b>idle</b> <b>cavities,</b> and explains the observed instability of mode 3. Bunch synchrotron tunes are calculated from lorentzian ts to the data.

40|$|<b>Idle</b> {{harmonic}} <b>cavities</b> {{can be used}} in low emittance storage {{rings in}} order to lengthen the stored bunches and therefore decrease the intra beam scattering dominating the beam life time (Touschek scattering). Asymmetries in the filling pattern, as current gaps for ion clearing, can induce a significant transient beam loading effect in the harmonic system, which results in bunch length and bunch phase variation along the electron train. This non linear behavior mainly results in a reduction of the mean achievable lengthening, and has some direct consequences on the storage ring operation as for example the evolution of the filling pattern in the top up mode or the temporal resolution of the x-ray experiments in camshaft mode. Here below we report on recent streak camera measurements carried out at the SLS diagnostic beam line (DB) which quantify experimentally the transient beam loading effects induced by the superconducting third harmonic system and show a possible improvement for the time resolved measurements in camshaft mode...|$|R
40|$|The beam {{lifetime}} in the 2 GeV low emittance {{storage ring}} ELETTRA {{is dominated by}} the Touschek effect. The present method of increasing the lifetime is to operate with a controlled amount of longitudinal coupled bunch instability, which also helps to stabilize the beam against transverse modes. In the future, with the foreseen elimination of both longitudinal and transverse modes, there is the requirement for a new solution to increase lifetime, which is a fundamental issue in ELETTRA since the energy is ramped from 1. 0 to 2. 0 GeV in the storage ring. A 3 rd harmonic cavity, operating at 1. 5 GHz, can increase the bunch length, and correspondingly the lifetime, by a factor 3 to 4. To achieve this result an <b>idle,</b> superconducting (SC) <b>cavity</b> seems the most attractive solution, since it can provide the required voltage at a reasonable field gradient (6. 0 MV/m) with negligible beam energy loss, which can be easily restored by the normal conducting (NC) RF system. Furthermore the cavity can be designed {{in such a way as}} to almost eliminate the effects of its own Higher Order Mode spectrum. In this report we present the preliminary electromagnetic design of the cavity. ...|$|R
