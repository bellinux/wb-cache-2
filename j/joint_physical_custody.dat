500|$|According to Gayle Smith, {{a family}} lawyer, {{there are some}} {{inherent}} benefits to a <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> arrangement. One benefit of <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> is that the burden of sole custody is not placed on the parent as the time involved in raising the children is divided among the two parties involved, allowing each of the parties more time to spend on their careers, for instance. A second benefit of <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> is that the children will still have a [...] "significant period" [...] of time {{with each of the}} parents, which closely resembles the relationship before the divorce, legal separation, or break-up. A third benefit of <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> is that it helps ensure that the children will grow up with both a male and a female role model, which may not be ensured through sole physical custody, for instance.|$|E
500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} criticisms to <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody.</b> A {{criticism of the}} <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> arrangement is that {{due to the nature}} of the arrangement, the parents are in frequent contact with each other than in other situations, leading to conflict which has the potential to negatively impact all parties involved, including the children. Research does not support this concern. Numerous studies found that parents with <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> had lower levels of conflict. There are numerous opinions that the constant moving back and forth between two homes will have a negative impact on children emotionally. The feeling that there is [...] "Mom's House" [...] and [...] "Dad's House" [...] doesn't leave anywhere for the children to feel is [...] "my home".|$|E

500|$|In <b>joint</b> <b>{{physical}}</b> <b>custody,</b> {{also known}} as joint physical care, the child has a legal home or domicile in both parents' homes. As with any child custody case involving the division of parenting time, the lodging and care of the child is shared according to a court-ordered custody schedule ({{also known as}} a [...] "parenting plan" [...] or [...] "parenting schedule"). In some states, the term visitation is no longer used with <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody,</b> but is instead reserved to sole custody orders.|$|E
500|$|In {{some states}} <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> creates a {{presumption}} of equal shared parenting, however in most states, <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> creates {{an obligation to}} provide each of the parents with [...] "significant periods" [...] of physical custody so as to assure the child of [...] "frequent and continuing contact" [...] with both parents. For example, states such as Alabama, California, and Texas do not necessarily require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time, whereas states such as Arizona, Georgia, and Louisiana do require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time where feasible. Courts generally have not clearly defined what [...] "significant periods" [...] and [...] "frequent and continuous contact" [...] mean, which requires parents to litigate to find out. In some states, however, courts have provided a clear definition, for instance, in Nevada, the Supreme Court has defined <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> as an arrangement where each parent has at least 40% of the custodial time on a yearly basis.|$|E
500|$|Divorce is {{difficult}} on all parties {{involved in the}} process, including the children. Due to the stressful nature of divorce, along with inherent issues {{on the amount of}} time the children can spend with each parent, the process can have a long and lasting impact on the children. Unless the children's parents are often involved in intense conflict, or one of the parents is abusive and/or mentally ill, the children tend to fare better if the custody arrangement is a joint custody arrangement. Numerous studies have found that in joint custody arrangements, the children tend to exhibit better relationships with their families, better performance in their schools, higher levels of self-esteem, and fewer conduct and emotional issues. Further, it has been found that children that have a sole custody arrangement tend to have poorer outcomes when compared to average children (or rather children who do not have divorced parents), where children that have a joint custody arrangement tend to fare as well as average children. However, <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> with an even division of time is not always necessary. These effects are generally seen simply when the children spend a substantial amount of time with both parents. According to Robert Emery, a divorce mediation expert, [...] "In many ways, <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> is the ideal arrangement for children because they still have two parents very much involved in their lives." [...] This statement has been supported by psychological data. [...] Speculation that parental conflict erases the benefits of <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> have not been supported by empirical research. A 2017 paper appearing in a journal published by the American Psychological Association analyzed every study that included measures and controls for conflict when comparing joint and sole physical custody families. Conflict was neither more nor less damaging for children in <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> than those in sole custody. Of 16 studies that controlled for conflict when measuring children’s adjustment, only one reported worse adjustment in <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody.</b> One study found that boys did better and girls worse. Fourteen studies reported either better outcomes in <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> or no differences, even after taking conflict into account.|$|E

500|$|In {{joint custody}} both parents are {{custodial}} parents and neither parent is a non-custodial parent, or, in other words, {{the child has}} two custodial parents. In the United States, many states recognize two forms of joint custody, which include <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody</b> (called also [...] "shared custody" [...] or [...] "shared placement") and joint legal custody. [...] In <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody,</b> the actual lodging and care of the child is shared according to a court-ordered custody schedule.

With <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> <b>custody,</b> a court's use of terms such as [...] "primary custodial parent" [...] and [...] "primary residence" [...] may not have much significance beyond being part of the court's division of child tax exemptions between the parents, as both parents are custodial parents.|$|E

40|$|The author meta-analyzed studies {{comparing}} child {{adjustment in}} <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> or <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> with sole-custody settings, including comparisons with paternal custody and intact families where possible. Children in <b>joint</b> <b>physical</b> or legal <b>custody</b> were better adjusted than children in sole-custody settings, but {{no different from}} those in intact families. More positive adjustment of joint-custody children held for separate comparisons of general adjustment, family relationships, self-esteem, emotional and behavioral adjustment, and divorce-specific adjustment.

Research evidence has clearly demonstrated that, on average, children from divorced families are not as well adjusted as those in intact families, although this relative disadvantage does not necessarily imply clinical levels of maladjustment (Amato & Keith, 1991 b; Guidubaldi & Perry, 1985).
