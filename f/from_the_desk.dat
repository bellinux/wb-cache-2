25|$|The person {{called up}} to read from the Torah – the summons is called an aliyah and the person so honored is called an oleh – hastens from his seat to the desk, going {{directly}} to the desk without any interruptions. Although around the world, including North America, many congregations will have a trained scroll reader for the actual recitation, the very considerable honor of the reading is attributed to the oleh. If there was a previous portion read, the previous oleh then steps aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> The oleh takes his place at the desk facing the open scroll, the verse where his portion begins is pointed out for him, he may kiss the scroll (usually by kissing {{the corner of his}} prayer shawl or the Torah wrapping and then touching that to the margin – not the writing – of the scroll), and then he may close his eyes, or avert his face, or otherwise indicate that the blessing he is about to recite is not being read from the text of the Torah. While reciting the blessings he holds both handles of the scroll, and if the actual scroll reading is done by someone else, the oleh steps to the side but continues to hold with one hand one of the scroll's handles.|$|E

[...] The document carried the highest security restriction (BIGOT list). Cicero conveyed limited information about Operation Overlord (the code name for the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944), which was not correlated by the Germans until after the war when films about Cicero were released. According to the British Foreign Office's postwar review of Cicero's potential impacts: [...] "It [...] provided the Germans with streams of information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> of the ambassador about British and Allied intentions in the Near and Middle East and for the conduct of the war generally, and might easily have compromised Operation Overlord (the preparations for D-Day)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Issues arose after Santorum was {{defeated}} for re-election to the Senate in 2006, and Senator Craig Thomas began his {{tenure at the}} candy desk. Wyoming, the state he was representing, has no members of the National Confectioners Association, and therefore no candymakers large enough to donate hundreds of dollars of candy to fill the desk. Senate ethics rules [...] "forbid members accepting gifts worth $100 or more a year from a single source," [...] which can become a problem if {{a large amount of}} candy is consumed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> each year. An exception to this rule allows larger gifts of objects created or produced in the state the senator is from, as long as the items are primarily not used by the senator and his staff. This is so senators can [...] "offer visitors home-grown snacks, such as Florida orange juice or Georgia peanuts." [...] When asked about Thomas being in charge of the candy desk, Susan Smith, a representative from the National Confectioners Association, stated, [...] "We're happy to provide candy if there are [...] members...It would be difficult for us to do now." [...] These issues were worked around by asking many small, local, Wyoming confectionery businesses and chocolatiers to give small amounts of candy that were rotated {{in and out of the}} desk.|$|E
