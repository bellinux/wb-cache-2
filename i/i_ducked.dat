2500|$|In {{the return}} series in Australia Trott made 19 {{runs in the}} first Test at Brisbane, before {{returning}} home due to a stress related illness. In his autobiography, he cites his increasing struggles facing the short ball as a principal cause of his problems: [...] "I felt I was being questioned as a man. I felt my dignity was being stripped away with every short ball <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> or parried. It was degrading." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July 1987, a {{day after}} Gandhi went to Sri Lanka and signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, an honour guard named Vijitha Rohana hit him on his {{shoulder}} with his rifle; Gandhi's quick reflexes saved him from injury. The guard was then dragged by his security personnel. The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of [...] "the damage he had caused" [...] to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through {{the corner of my}} eye some movement. <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> down a little bit in a reflex action. By my ducking, he missed my head and the brunt of the blow came on my shoulder below the left ear.|$|E
60|$|At that <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> at once under water, and, {{holding my}} breath until {{movement}} was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as I could. The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly growing hotter.|$|E

60|$|I let {{him come}} almost upon me. Then <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> beneath his outstretched arms, {{at the same time}} {{sidestepping}} to the right. Pivoting on my left toe, I swung a terrific right to his jaw, and, like a felled ox, he dropped in his tracks.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} there was tense silence, then Thurid, with a roar of rage sprang for my throat; just as Xodar had upon {{the deck of the}} cruiser. The results were identical. <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> beneath his outstretched arms, and as he lunged past me planted a terrific right {{on the side of his}} jaw.|$|E
60|$|My agility {{saved me}} for the instant. <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> beneath his raised arm, and when he wheeled to come at me again he found a sword's point in his face. And {{a moment later he}} felt an inch or two of it in the muscles of his knife arm, so that {{thereafter}} he went more warily.|$|E
50|$|In 1911 {{commemorative}} {{flower beds}} were {{set out for}} the coronation of King George V; similarly in 1937 for King George VI. During World War <b>I</b> <b>ducks</b> and rabbits were raised, and vegetables grown, to aid the war effort. In 1942 the park was turned into allotments and the normal closing time was extended to allow for the extra work involved. The park was placed on the Heritage National Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in 1986. A grant was received from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2005 to refurbish the tea room.|$|R

60|$|I {{tried to}} thrust my {{head through the}} manhole, and the sphere rolled over. It was as though {{something}} had lugged my head down directly it emerged. <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> back sharply, or I should have been pinned face under water. After some wriggling and shoving I managed to crawl out upon sand, over which the retreating waves still came and went.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{was upon}} me, {{reaching}} for my throat, and precisely as I {{had done that}} day in the courtyard of the Temple of Issus I did here in the garden of the palace of Salensus Oll. <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> beneath his outstretched arms, and as he lunged past me I planted a terrific right upon the side of his jaw.|$|E

It {{is the first time}} I have ever gone underneath on the Canadian Pacific, and the internal arrangements are new to me. I try to crawl {{over the top of the}} truck, between the truck and the bottom of the car. But the space is not large enough for me to squeeze through. This is new to me. Down in the United States I am accustomed to going underneath on rapidly moving trains, seizing a gunnel and swinging my feet under to the brake-beam, and from there crawling over the top of the truck and down inside the truck to a seat on the cross-rod.|$|R

60|$|As he {{came for}} me, {{like a great}} bear, <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> again beneath his outstretched arm, and as I came up planted as clean a blow upon his jaw as ever you have seen. Down went that great {{mountain}} of flesh sprawling upon the ground. He was so surprised and dazed that he lay there for several seconds before he made any attempt to rise, and I stood over him with another dose ready when he should gain his knees.|$|E

"Why, the Spaniard ran {{when he saw}} me, and {{got into}} a cabin; but the woman, instead of running, came {{at me with a}} knife, and chased me round the table like a very cat-a-mountain. So <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> under the old man's hammock, and out into the gallery; and when I thought the coast was clear, back again I came, and {{stumbled}} over this. So I just picked it up, and ran on deck with my tail between my legs, for I expected verily to have the black woman's knife between my ribs out of some dark corner." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to the thicket where I hed left my hoss, an' loaded up with two more guns an' another belt, an' busted a fresh box of shells. If I {{recollect}} proper, I got some cigarettes, too. Well, I mozied back to the cabin. It was a boo-tiful moonshiny night, an' I wondered if ole Bill's gun was as purty as I'd heerd. The grass growed long round the cabin, an' I crawled up to the door without startin' anythin'. Then I figgered. There was only one door in thet cabin, an' it was black dark inside. I jest grabbed open the door an' slipped in quick. It worked all right. They heerd me, but hedn't been quick enough to ketch me {{in the light of the}} door. Of course there was some shots, but <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> too quick, an' changed my position.|$|E
6000|$|Now we were together, {{and there}} was no room for both, so after a certain amount of dodging I went under, as the lighter dog always does in a fight. That buffalo seemed to do {{everything}} to me which a buffalo could do under the circumstances. It tried to horn me, and partially succeeded, although <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> at each swoop. Then it struck me with its nose and drove me to the bottom of the pool, although I got hold of its lip and twisted it. Then it calmly knelt on me and sank me deeper and deeper into the mud. I remember kicking it in the stomach. After this I remember no more, except a kind of wild dream in which I rehearsed all the scene in the dwarf's hut, and his request that when I met the buffalo with the cleft horn in the pool of a dried river, I should remember that he was nothing but a [...] "poor old Kafir cheat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{see very}} well, for a battery that {{supported}} the charge was shelling the retreating Allies and just then our ambulance was hit. But Maurie says he watched the scene and that when Gys attempted to lift the wounded man up he suddenly turned weak as water. The Germans had captured the gun, by this time, and their officer himself hoisted the injured man upon the doctor's shoulders and attended him to our ambulance. When I saw the fight was over I hastened to help Gys, who staggered so weakly {{that he would have}} dropped his man a dozen times on the way had not the Germans held him up. They were laughing, as if the whole thing was a joke, when crack! came a volley of bullets and with a great shout back rushed the French and Belgians in a counter-charge. I admit <b>I</b> <b>ducked,</b> crawling under the ambulance, and the Germans were so surprised that they beat a quick retreat.|$|E

60|$|I {{was growing}} annoyed with the man. <b>I</b> could have <b>ducked</b> him, {{but for the}} {{reflection}} that my prospects of obtaining his consent to my engagement would scarcely have been enhanced thereby.|$|R
6000|$|And {{there and}} then we {{stripped}} {{and put on the}} gloves. Bang! a long, gorilla arm flashed out, landing the gloved end on my nose. Biff! he caught me, in a duck, {{on the side of the}} head nearly knocking me over sidewise. I carried the lump raised by that blow for a week. <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> under a straight left, and landed a straight right on his stomach. It was a fearful blow. The whole weight of my body was behind it, and his body had been met as it lunged forward. I looked for him to crumple up and go down. Instead of which his face beamed approval, and he said, [...] "That was beautiful." [...] The next instant I was covering up and striving to protect myself from a hurricane of hooks, jolts, and uppercuts. Then I watched my chance and drove in for the solar plexus. I hit the mark. The Nature Man dropped his arms, gasped, and sat down suddenly.|$|E
60|$|As I have said, I forgot everything. In racing {{across an}} open space I ran full tilt upon {{a colony of}} snakes. They did not deter me. I was mad. They struck at me, but <b>I</b> <b>ducked</b> and dodged and ran on. Then there was a python that ordinarily would have sent me {{screeching}} to a tree-top. He did run me into a tree; but the Swift One was going out of sight, and I sprang {{back to the ground}} and went on. It was a close shave. Then there was my old enemy, the hyena. From my conduct he was sure something was going to happen, and he followed me for an hour. Once we exasperated a band of wild pigs, and they took after us. The Swift One dared a wide leap between trees that was too much for me. I had to take to the ground. There were the pigs. I didn't care. I struck the earth within a yard of the nearest one. They flanked me as I ran, and chased me into two different trees out of the line of my pursuit of the Swift One. I ventured the ground again, doubled back, and crossed a wide open space, with the whole band grunting, bristling, and tusk-gnashing at my heels.|$|E

I have noticed that the geese are bad layers, {{but they are very}} productive with their eggs. One goose can lay between 20 to 30 eggs in a clutch, but only about 15 % will hatch properly. My tests were to get the duck to sit on the goose s eggs. During the first test, <b>I</b> replaced the <b>duck</b> s eggs with those of the goose. Of the six eggs hatched by the <b>duck,</b> <b>I</b> got three goslings. In my second test, <b>I</b> replaced six <b>duck</b> eggs with three goose eggs, and I got two goslings and some ducklings. In the third test, I let the goose sit on the eggs, and I got just one gosling. My conclusion is that when I want goslings, <b>I</b> let the <b>duck</b> sit on them. After 28 to 30 days, the young goslings leave their shells and get used to their adoptive mother, for the first month. Then they abandon their incubator duck and go back to their biological parents.
