5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six <b>individual</b> <b>drive</b> units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E

50|$|Most major {{hard disk}} and {{motherboard}} vendors support S.M.A.R.T, which measures drive {{characteristics such as}} operating temperature, spin-up time, data error rates, etc. Certain trends and sudden changes in these parameters {{are thought to be}} associated with increased likelihood of drive failure and data loss. However, S.M.A.R.T. parameters alone may not be useful for predicting <b>individual</b> <b>drive</b> failures. While several S.M.A.R.T. parameters affect failure probability, a large fraction of failed drives do not produce predictive S.M.A.R.T. parameters. Unpredictable breakdown may occur at any time in normal use, with potential loss of all data. Recovery of some or even all data from a damaged drive is sometimes, but not always possible, and is normally costly.|$|E
50|$|The {{information}} is sent {{from the computer}} processor to the BIOS into a chip controlling the data transfer. This is then sent out to the hard drive via a multi-wire connector. Once the data are received onto the circuit board of the drive, they are translated and compressed into a format that the <b>individual</b> <b>drive</b> can use to store onto the disk itself. The data are then passed to a chip on the circuit board that controls the access to the drive. The drive is divided into sectors of data stored {{onto one of the}} sides of one of the internal disks. An HDD with two disks internally will typically store data on all four surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} UniDisk 3.5", Apple {{introduced}} the UniDisk 5.25 (A9M0104) {{in a plastic}} case, which modernized {{the appearance of the}} Disk II to better match the Apple IIe. Since the UniDisk 5.25" [...] could fully replace the Disk II in all its uses, the original Disk II was canceled at this point. This was followed in 1986 by a Platinum-gray version which was renamed Apple 5.25 Drive (A9M0107), companion to the Apple 3.5 Drive, and introduced alongside the first Platinum-colored computer, the Apple IIGS. Essentially these were both single half-height Disk II mechanisms inside an <b>individual</b> <b>drive</b> enclosure, just like the Disk IIc had been. All of these drives introduced a daisy chain pass-through port. While the drives are essentially interchangeable among Apple II computers, both {{with each other and with}} the earlier drives, only the Apple 5.25 Drive can be used with the Apple IIe Card on a Macintosh LC.|$|E

50|$|The {{electronic}} {{differential lock}} (EDL) employed by Volkswagen is not, {{as the name}} suggests, a differential lock at all.

This effectively transfers power to the other wheel.|$|R
5000|$|All LCI(L) were {{twin shaft}} {{propelled}} by two banks of Detroit Diesel 6-71 [...] "Quad" [...] Diesel engines {{that produced a}} total of 1600 BHP. These engines were a wartime expedient design that utilized existing and readily available engines. Four 2-stroke Detroit Diesel 6-71 (inline 6 cylinder with 71 cubic inch displacement per cylinder) with Roots blower were coupled to create a bank {{for each of the}} two propeller shafts. The 4 engines per bank were joined together using <b>individual</b> <b>drive</b> clutches hence the name [...] "Quad Diesel". If a single engine were to fail, the broken engine could be disconnected from the unit via its clutch and repaired while the other 3 engines were still operating. General Motors Corporation Electro-Motive Division supplied the reduction gears, propellers, drive shafts and control units. Each of the two propellers was a reversible pitch propeller, which allowed the propeller shaft to spin only in one direction for either ahead or astern operation. This, coupled {{with the use of a}} stern anchor which was dropped as the ship approached the beach, was used to pull the ship off the beach after the troops had disembarked. Two auxiliary Detroit Diesel 2-71's drive the two 30Kw 120V D.C. Ship's Service Generators.|$|E
50|$|In most {{automatic}} transmissions, {{the drive}} turbine only functions as an input to the transmission where {{the power is}} redirected to gears in its automatic gearbox. Turboglide differs by using three <b>individual</b> <b>drive</b> turbines, each connected to a different ratio inside the gearbox. Oil leaving the pump first strikes the turbine connected to the Low (first gear) ratio. The design of the turbine permits oil to pass through its blades and strike the next turbine in line, the one connected to the Intermediate ratio, which receives some of the energy remaining in the oil flow. After leaving the intermediate turbine, the oil is passed to the direct turbine which is direct drive at drive shaft speed. As the car starts from rest, the low turbine, which has the greatest gear reduction ratio {{is relatively easy to}} bring up to match pump (engine) speed and the car starts from rest easily and accelerates quickly. While this occurs, the intermediate turbine receives an ever increasing share of the energy from the pump, as the Low turbine moves faster and oil passes more freely through it. Eventually, the low turbine matches pump speed, and the low turbine freewheels on a one-way sprag clutch much like on a bicycle. At this point, the intermediate turbine is carrying the majority of the drive force, and some energy is being sent to the direct turbine from the oil passing through the intermediate turbine as it also begins to match pump speed. Eventually, the intermediate turbine also matches pump speed, and the oil passes freely through low and intermediate turbines to drive the direct turbine alone, in direct drive (1:1 ratio). Because of the overlapping power input in different ratios, there is no 'shift' or sequential gearing, rather there is a concurrent geared drive, in effect the car starts out in 1-2-3, eventually drops 1 to be in 2-3 and eventually drops 2 to be in 3 alone.|$|E
