It was for this reason why many considered the fragrance to be at risk if it failed. Additionally, controversy arose after Lopez fired her manager Benny Medina that summer, causing the public to read more negative publications about Lopez.

2500|$|Macquarie Group economists {{estimated}} {{the energy crisis}} could reduce gross domestic product growth by 0.25 percentage points in the third quarter, as gas prices increased {{and the percentage of}} gas production allocated to export reduced. Natural gas sales were worth $5.2billion in the 2006/2007 financial year, and its five-year trend growth rate is 16.8%. Chief Macquarie economist Richard Gibbs said, [...] "WA supplies the lion's share of the gas exports. The effect on exports is that as {{there is a shortage of}} gas in the system, the capability to export will be diminished because the gas that there is will be directed towards domestic use... The gas exports have been pretty healthy. In the next couple of quarters that will be moderated dramatically if not stalled altogether.

[...] Its formula of controlling super-powered beings in a massive sandbox environment, and using their abilities to cause mayhem and destruction has influenced other video game series such as Infamous, Prototype, Saints Row, The Saboteur and Just Cause 2. Game creator Brian Fleming was influenced by the climbing and parkour aspects of the first Crackdown in designing the gameplay for Infamous. The series' mainstay gameplay of collecting orbs in an open world environment to increase a character's abilities, was also copied by another similar game called Prototype. Keiichiro Toyama cited Crackdown as a big influence in developing his award-winning game Gravity Rush, stating that he [...] "really liked the aspect of unlocking skills and becoming more powerful, and achieving a higher level of freedom as you become more powerful".|$|E
