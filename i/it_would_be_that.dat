In 2011, when Vogue put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, [...] "I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, 'This is something new. This is something different.' [...] The printers called {{to make sure that}} was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made." [...] In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> one. [...] "t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for Vogue." ...|$|E
500|$|David Duchovny was {{somewhat}} {{disappointed with the}} episode, hoping {{he would have had}} a chance to do more in an episode that was primarily a symbolic journey for him rather than a real one. The actor said [...] "I like the psychology, and I like the thinking that went into the episode as a viewer. As an actor, I felt like an opportunity passed me by. If I had to do any episode over again, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> one." [...] The actor called the episode in 1995 the greatest missed opportunity they had. Chris Carter disagreed, stating that Fox Mulder's role in the episode was the right way to do it, and that the dramatic weight for the episode had to shift from Mulder to Dana Scully.|$|E

[...] Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton had {{performed}} the song prior to joining Aerosmith. [...] Perry recalled, [...] "'Train Kept A-Rollin {{was the only}} song we had in common {{when we first got}} together. [...] Steven's band had played 'Train' and Tom and I played it in our band... It's a blues song, if you follow its roots all the way back... I always thought if I could just play one song, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> one because of what it does to me".

500|$|West {{was also}} {{regarded}} for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA described West as [...] "obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win… {{a level of}} intensity so high it could melt lead". Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: [...] "He took a loss harder than any player I've ever known. He would sit by himself and stare into space. A loss just ripped his guts out." [...] Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a [...] "Jerry West Night", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: [...] "Jerry, you are, {{in every sense of}} the word, truly a champion… If I could have one wish granted, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> you would always be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Cosmopolitan {{journalist}} Alex Rees noted how it {{was normal}} for the singer to sound [...] "breathy" [...] and [...] "breathless" [...] following four songs in a row on the album discussing sex. Nicole James of Fuse called the song a [...] "sexed-up midtempo banger". Jem Aswad of the same publication noted {{the presence of a}} [...] "wild, jazzy, Joni-ish melody that flies all over the scale". Jordan Runtagh from the website VH1 called [...] "No Angel" [...] a [...] "classic fake-out love song" [...] and connected to the singer's real-life relationship with husband Jay-Z. A more mixed review came from Ryan E.C. Hamm from Under the Radar who noted that the experimentalistic songs on Beyoncé which do not work well, managed to look better only because of the record itself; he examplified this with [...] "No Angel", criticizing it as [...] "a little boring". Both Christopher R. Weingarten of Spin and Tom Breihan of Stereogum called the song [...] "boring"; the latter added <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> way for listeners [...] "until that subtle digital bassline finds its way into your head". Breihan, however, praised the singer's falsetto vocals as [...] "a thing to behold". Melissa Locker of Time magazine stated that the singer sang [...] "slightly obnoxiously" [...] in [...] "No Angel". Una Mullally from The Irish Times questioned how [...] "No Angel" [...] was included in the track listing of Beyoncé, before adding [...] "but it did and we're {{just going to have to}} deal with it". However, she concluded that the song should be listened several more times to be understood.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} of The Art of Angel Sanctuary 2: Lost Angel, A.E. Sparrow of IGN praised the artbook, {{describing}} it as [...] "more of an encyclopedia or compendium for the series". He complimented the artwork, stating,"I was absolutely blown away with each turn of the page, figuring it couldn't get any more brilliant, and was proven wrong every time. If I had any complaint, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the artwork doesn't go on long enough." [...] McNeil shared his views, greatly enjoying the artwork.|$|E
2500|$|Upholding the {{validity}} of clause (4) of article 13 [...] and a corresponding provision in article 368(3), inserted by the 24th Amendment, the Court settled in favour of the view that Parliament {{has the power to}} amend the Fundamental Rights also. However, the Court affirmed another proposition also asserted in the Golaknath case, by ruling that the expression [...] "amendment" [...] of this Constitution in article 368 means any addition or change in any of the provisions of the Constitution within the broad contours of the Preamble and the Constitution to carry out the objectives in the Preamble and the Directive Principles. Applied to Fundamental Rights, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> while Fundamental Rights cannot be abrogated, reasonable abridgement of Fundamental Rights could be effected in the public interest. The true position is that every provision of the Constitution can be amended provided the basic foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the same.|$|E
