60|$|The gentle Minor Canon has {{had it in}} his {{thoughts}} to leave the room, without a word. But looking round at the door, and seeing this dejected figure, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it, touches it with a mild hand, says ‘Good night!’ A sob is his only acknowledgment. He might have had many a worse; perhaps, could have had few better.|$|E

"And {{that is true}} too, mine honest friend," [...] sighed Dalgetty; [...] "yet if {{you knew}} but the value of Gustavus, and the things we two have done and {{suffered}} together--See, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> look at me!--Be kind to him, my good breechless friend, and I will requite you well." [...] So saying, and withal sniffling a little to swallow his grief, he turned from the heart-rending spectacle in order to follow his guide.|$|E
6000|$|And {{occasionally}} the poor, simple-minded person really is overcome by these imagined terrors. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our dingy realities again, {{to the good}} old grimy world he knows, thanking God beyond measure that he will never {{live to see the}} hateful day when one baby out of every four ceases to die in our manufacturing towns, when lives of sordid care are banished altogether from the earth, and when the [...] "sense of humour" [...] and the cult of Mark Tapley which flourishes so among these things will be in danger of perishing from disuse....|$|E

6000|$|There {{is nothing}} in Mr. Stevenson's {{sometimes}} writing essays, sometimes romances, and anon poems to mark him versatile beyond other authors. One dreads his continuing to do so, with so many books at his back, lest it means weakness rather than strength. He experiments too long; {{he is still a}} boy wondering what he is going to be. With Cowley's candor he tells us that he wants to write something by which he may be forever known. His attempts in this direction have been in the nature of trying different ways, and he always starts off whistling. Having gone so far without losing himself, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> try another road. Does his heart fail him, despite his jaunty bearing, or is it because there is no hurry? Though all his books are obviously by the same hand, no living writer has come so near fame from so many different sides. Where is the man among us who could write another [...] "Virginibus Puerisque," [...] the most delightful volume for the hammock ever sung in prose? The poems are as exquisite as they are artificial. [...] "Jekyll and Hyde" [...] is the greatest triumph extant in Christmas literature of the morbid kind. The donkey on the Cevennes (how Mr. Stevenson belabored him!) only stands second to the [...] "Inland Voyage." [...] "Kidnapped" [...] is the outstanding boy's book of its generation. [...] "The Black Arrow" [...] alone, to my thinking, is second class. We shall all be doleful if a marksman who can pepper his target with inners does not reach the bull's-eye. But it is quite time the great work was begun. The sun sinks while the climber walks round his mountain, looking for the best way up.|$|E
60|$|Desire of Comfort.--This is {{a motive}} which {{strongly}} attaches certain animals to human habitations, {{even though they}} are unwelcome: it is a motive which few persons who have not had an opportunity of studying animals in savage lands are likely to estimate at its true value. The life of all beasts in their wild state is an exceedingly anxious one. From my own recollection, I believe that every antelope in South Africa has to run for its life every one or two days upon an average, and that he starts or gallops under the influence of a false alarm many times in a day. Those who have crouched at night by the side of pools in the desert, {{in order to have a}} shot at the beasts that frequent them, see strange scenes of animal life; how the creatures gambol at one moment and fight at another; how a herd suddenly halts in strained attention, and then breaks into a maddened rush, as one of them becomes conscious of the stealthy movements or rank scent of a beast of prey. Now this hourly life-and-death excitement is a keen delight to most wild creatures, but must be peculiarly distracting to the comfort-loving temperament of others. The latter are alone suited to endure the crass habits and dull routine of domesticated life. Suppose that an animal which has been captured and half-tamed, received ill-usage from his captors, either as punishment or through mere brutality, and that he rushed indignantly into the forest with his ribs aching from blows and stones. If a comfort-loving animal, he will probably be no gainer by the change, more serious alarms and no less ill-usage awaits him; he hears the roar of the wild beasts and the headlong gallop of the frightened herds, and he finds the buttings and the kicks of other animals harder to endure than the blows from which he fled. He has the disadvantage of being a stranger, for the herds of his own species which he seeks for companionship constitute so many cliques, into which he can only find admission by more fighting with their strongest members than he has spirit to undergo. As a set-off against these miseries, the freedom of savage life has no charms for his temperament; so the end of it is, that with a heavy heart <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the habitation he had quitted. When animals thoroughly enjoy the excitement of wild life, I presume they cannot be domesticated, they could only be tamed, for they would never return from the joys of the wilderness after they had once tasted them through some accidental wandering.|$|E

Deva meets up with Bala and tells her {{that he has been}} lying about him and has not considered her to be a lover but as one among the many girls who fell for his charm.

50|$|John Barbour, in his {{description}} of Douglas' last battle, describes a similar rout, with Douglas and his contingent pursuing the fleeing enemy closely. There is, however, {{no mention of the}} siege of Teba in Barbour's account, which describes the Christian army advancing from Seville to repel an invasion from Morocco. According to Barbour, Sir James outruns the rest of his men and finds himself far out in front with only ten or so followers. Too late, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> rejoin the main body. The agile Moorish cavalry see their opportunity, rally and counter-attack. In the running fight that follows, Douglas sees Sir William St.Clair surrounded by a body of Moors, trying to fight his way free. With the few knights still with him, Douglas rides to the rescue but all are killed, including Sir William St.Clair and the brothers Sir Robert and Sir Walter Logan.|$|E

50|$|Datiange (Mansion of Heaven) is a stone chamber {{carved out}} of the cliffs and is {{regarded}} as the finest of the Longmen Grottoes. The relief carving on the walls, the gods, the sacrificial table and the candlesticks are all sculpted following the original shape of the rocks. The Kuixing (God of literature and exams) in the center has one foot on a huge turtle. Holding a dipper and a brush, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> look into the blue sky above the cliffs. Yet his brush has no point. It is said that the stone carver broke the brush point by accident and spoiled the work of decades. He dropped his knife and threw himself over the cliffs. Standing on the Longmen, the lake is vast and the sky is endless. In the morning, it is an ideal place to greet the rising sun. In the evening, one can admire the sparkling lights of downtown Kunming.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, in Rome, a man enters Vorenus' home as Niobe is {{preparing}} food and walks {{straight to the}} baby's crib, telling Niobe that {{he just wants to}} see his son. Niobe tells him to leave but as he makes to do so, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> face Niobe to try to persuade her to love him again. She resists for a moment but slowly starts to give in, but just as the two are about to exchange a kiss, Vorena the Elder enters the door and interrupts them. Niobe quickly makes the man leave. Vorena believes that if Niobe were to tell Vorenus the truth about the baby and that she thought he was dead, Vorenus would forgive her and everything would be fine, but Niobe knows full well better. She knows that if Vorenus were to learn the truth, he would then have the legal and moral right and obligation to kill her and all his children.|$|E
50|$|The tamed Carnotaurus then stomps Chichaks head flat. The dinosaur roars at the villagers, then {{approaches}} Turok and snarls at him, as lightning flashes in the background. Turok remains {{still as}} the Carnotaurus reveals {{blood on her}} teeth. She makes a few growls {{as if she is}} trying to communicate with him to either thank him or tell him that she must do something else. The remaining cavemen try to sneak past her, but she catches them. The cave dwellers run for their lives as the Carnotaurus chases them. With Turok letting the Carnotaurus live to chase after the cavemen, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> see everyone with Sepinta, who is dead. On top of the summer hunting grounds, everyone is seen with torches and plan to burn Sepintas body, weapons, and items. They all look down with sadness and sorrow for the loss of their chief. Aniwa sobs as she and Andar let go.|$|E
