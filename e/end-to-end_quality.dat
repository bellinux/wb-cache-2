40|$|The {{successful}} {{deployment of}} multimedia streaming services, over a multiservice IP-based heterogeneous infrastructure, requires resource-efficient, scalable and reliable network transport. This {{can be achieved}} using end-to-end methods, e. g. adaptive application-level source and channel coding. Network assistance can also be employed, e. g. multicast routing and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning mechanisms. Multicast transport in particular presents many challenges with respect to scalability, reliability and congestion control. Furthermore, with an increasing use of bandwidth-constrained and unreliable access networks such as Wireless LAN (WLAN) networks, implementing adaptive schemes which can utilize the scarce network resources is important. In this thesis, topics {{in the area of}} adaptive rate, congestion and error control schemes for video streaming applications over heterogeneous networks are studied.

In the same way, many operators connect to hubs to transit MMS messages, in an attempt to fix the many interoperability problems with this messaging technology. SMS Hubbing is about simplifying the SMS interworking system, by replacing much of the unproductive, identical investments in international agreements made traditionally by mobile operators. As well as this, SMS Hubbing is about providing a higher level of service to SMS, by introducing <b>end-to-end</b> <b>quality</b> of service through Service Level Agreements (SLAs).|$|E
40|$|Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) {{promise a}} wide scope of {{emerging}} potential applications in both {{civilian and military}} areas, which require visual and audio information to enhance the level of collected information. The transmission of multimedia content requires a minimal video quality level from the user’s perspective. However, links in WMSN communi- cations are typically unreliable, as they often experience fluctuations in quality and weak connectivity, and thus, the routing protocol must evaluate the routes by using <b>end-to-end</b> link <b>quality</b> information to increase the packet delivery ratio. Moreover, the use multiple paths together with key video metrics can enhance the video quality level. In this paper, we propose a video-aware multiple path hierarchical routing protocol for efficient multimedia transmission over WMSN, called video-aware MMtransmission. This protocol finds node-disjoint multiple paths, and implements an <b>end-to-end</b> link <b>quality</b> estimation with minimal over- head to score the paths. Thus, our protocol assures multimedia transmission with Quality of Experience (QoE) and energy-efficiency support. The simula- tion results show the benefits of video-aware MMtransmission for disseminating video content by means of energy-efficiency and QoE analysis...|$|R

40|$|Management summary The {{aim of this}} {{deliverable}} is two-fold. Firstly, it aims at {{defining the}} initial concepts for specifying and negotiating <b>end-to-end</b> <b>quality,</b> i. e., a service quality meta-model suitable for the definition and negotiation of service quality specifications and SLAs. The research method for creating this quality meta-model follows a design approach. Initially, requirements are collected dictating the information, structure, and constraints that this meta-model should capture. Then, based on these requirements, the meta-model is designed and finally created. Secondly, this deliverable aims at proposing a methodology for decomposing <b>end-to-end</b> <b>quality</b> into quality specifications for individual SLAs. The research method for achieving this goal follows a hybrid approach: a proof-of-concept and a paper-based approach. In particular, the meta-model’s effectiveness and sufficiency is highlighted by modeling a composite service negotiation scenario and its result, which is a decomposition of <b>end-to-end</b> <b>quality</b> into quality specifications of individual SLAs. Then, initial attempts (materialized in papers of WP members) are provided that address (composite) service negotiation...|$|E
40|$|The Differentiated Services (DiffServ or DS) {{framework}} {{takes an}} edge over IntServ 1 because it is scalable and lesser complex. On the other hand, the application level <b>end-to-end</b> <b>quality</b> of service, in DiffServ, may get compromised because: 1) network resources are not allocated at microflow level (a data stream pertaining to a single connection) but at aggregate level (collection {{of one or more}} microflows), 2) the DiffServ working group does not specify algorithms for PHBs but their output behaviours and 3) <b>end-to-end</b> <b>quality</b> is function of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between the adjacent domains transited by the connection and a large diversity in SLAs is quite evident as each DS domain would have different service provision policies. We focus, in this paper, on the first two issues.
