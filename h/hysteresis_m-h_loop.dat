Microstructural and elemental analysis using a scanning electron micrograph and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively, were carried out at room temperature with higher magnification exhibiting a uniform distribution of grains and stoichiometry. The appearance of hysteresis loops (P-E) confirms the existence of ferroelectricity of the sample with a high remnant polarization of (2 P(r)) 17. 76 mu Ccm(- 2). Using impedance spectroscopy, the electrical properties of the material were investigated at a wide range of temperature (25 - 500 degrees C) and frequencies (1 kHz - 1 MHz) suggesting dielectric non-Debye-type relaxation in the material. The nature of the Nyquist plot (Z' similar to Z ") shows the dominance of the grain contribution in the impedance. The bulk resistance of the compound decreases with increasing temperature, like that of a semiconductor, which shows a negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTCR) behavior.

Rietveld analysis of diffraction data confirm the formation of single phase PFW, without traces of any parasitic pyrochlore phase. PFW was found to crystallize in the cubic structure at room temperature. The Rietveld refinement of neutron diffraction data measured at room temperature confirmed the G-type antiferromagnetic structure of PFW in our sample.

The sample histories focussed are, (i) the field cooled (FC), (ii) the zero field cooled (ZFC) and (iii) an isothermal reversal of field from the normal state. An understanding of the results {{in terms of the}} modulation in the plastic deformation of the elastic vortex solid and supercooling across order-disorder transition is sought. The critical current density Jc(H) of a hard superconductor does not display any path dependence in field (H) and it decays monotonically with increase in H. Its magnetic response is well described by the prescriptions of the celebrated critical state model. An isothermal magnetization <b>hysteresis</b> (<b>M-H)</b> <b>loop</b> of a strongly pinned superconductor defines an envelope within which lie magnetization values measured along all paths.

The novel combination of material properties such as room temperature ferromagnetism and semiconducting behavior has spawned interest in spin current injection for storage devices. Dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) are traditional semiconductors in which magnetic transition metal impurities with partially filled 'd' statesand lanthanide series elements with partially filled 'f' shell electrons replace cations of the host semiconducting materials. DMS are assumed to be potential resources for practical spintronic based devices [1 - 3]. It is an exciting field of research wherein both the charge and spin are used for transportation, storage and processing of information in a single spintronic device [4]. Room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) is an essential property for DMS materials. In order to acquire RTFM in DMS materials, transition metal (Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, Cr) has been doped in different semiconductors such as ZnO [5], GaN [5], TiO 2 [6], CdS [7], CdSe [8] and SnO 2 [9]. II-VI and III-V DMS offer unique combination of structural, electronic and magnetic properties, which strongly depends on the nature and concentration of the dopant. The transition metals find greater solubility in II–VI compound semiconductors, when compared with III-VI semiconductors[10]. Till date extensive reports are available on nitride, oxide and chalcogenide DMS with different theories and mechanisms explaining the interactions such as double exchange, super-exchange and RKKY type in both the theoretical and experimental aspects with conflicting results on room temperature ferromagnetism. Yet, the origin of observed magnetism in DMSs is still a topic of debate[11, 12]. Apart from this, various reasons for the observed magnetis...|$|R

Effects of La substitution on the structural, electrical and ferroelectric properties of Bi 1 -x-yGdxLayFe 1 -yTiyO 3 samples have been studied by performing X-ray diffraction and dielectric measurements as well as characterizing <b>M-H</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop.</b> The results indicate that, when La content exceeds 0. 2, the crystal structure of the ceramic samples changes from rhombohedral to tetragonal phase. The maximum ferroelectric transition temperature (T-c) of this system was 190 degrees C with the dielectric constant peak of 2500 at 100 kHz for y= 0. 5. With increasing La content, the remanent magnetization increases and the coercive magnetic field decreases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

It {{is due to the}} strong ferromagnetic behavior, resulting from the formation of high volume fraction of the complete crystalline SrFe 12 O 19 phase as seen in Fig.  2. Thus, a strong interaction of magnetic moments within domains occurred due to exchange forces. This observed phenomenon can be considered as an ordered magnetism in the sample. In fact, in order to obtain an ordered magnetism and a well-formed <b>M–H</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop,</b> there must exist a significant domain formation, a sufficiently strong anisotropy field, Ha, and optional addition contributions which come from defects such as grain boundaries and pores [39].

40|$|The {{magnetization}} reversal {{and dynamics}} of a spin valve pillar, whose lateral size is 64 × 64 nm^ 2, are studied by using micromagnetic simulation {{in the presence}} of spin transfer torque. Spin torques display both characteristics of magnetic damping (or anti-damping) and of an effective magnetic field. For a steady-state current, both M-I and <b>M-H</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> show unique features, including multiple jumps, unusual plateaus and precessional states. These states originate from the competition between the energy dissipation due to Gilbert damping and the energy accumulation due to the spin torque supplied by the spin current. The magnetic energy oscillates as a function of time even for a steady-state current. For a pulsed current, the minimum width and amplitude of the spin torque for achieving current-driven magnetization reversal are quantitatively determined. The spin torque also shows very interesting thermal activation that is fundamentally different from an ordinary damping effect. Comment: 15 figure...|$|R

The main objective of this thesis was to study the mechanisms involved {{in the emergence of}} the peak in the magnetic hysteresis loops in the two samples (the so-called peak effect). It is argued that point disorder in the form of oxygen vacancies or substitution is responsible for pinning at intermediate and high field. Vortex dynamics at fields below and above the peak in hysteresis loops for the sample are shown to be well explained by a quasi-lattice Bragg Glass state and elastic Collective and Plastic Vortex Creep, respectively. For this purpose, relaxation in magnetic moment was measured at different fields and temperatures. Following that, the field and temperature dependence of the normalized relaxation rate, S, the effective activation energy, U, and the critical exponent were calculated. Analysis of all these quantities in the material led {{to the conclusion that the}} transition from a highly ordered vortex lattice (Abrikosov lattice) to an amorphous vortex lattice is responsible for the rise in magnetic moment at low fields, and subsequently the crossover from this amorphous state to a plastically deformed vortex lattice, which is assisted by dislocations, is responsible for the suppression of the peak effect in <b>m-H</b> <b>loops.</b> The investigation of flux pinning by twin planes has attracted considerable attention, since naturally-formed twin planes occur regularly in Y 123 crystals. One of the characteristic properties of vortex pinning by twin planes is a cusp-like dependence of the irreversibility field (H[subscript irr]) on the angle (?) between the twin plane and the magnetic field. The cusp appears around (?) = (?), within the angular range (?). The angle (?) is called the lock-in angle. The measurement of the angular dependence of H[subscript irr] has been the principal method used to study the locking of magnetic vortices by twin planes and the determination of (?). However, due to the high irreversibility field of 123 systems, such measurements could be conducted only at high temperatures, close to T[subscript c], at which the irreversibility field is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Further, H [subscript irr] is defined by an arbitrary value of magnetization, at which the ascending and descending branches of the magnetic hysteresis loop, or the zero-field cooled and field-cooled branches of the temperature dependence of the magnetization, are seen to merge. Because of this, it is highly desirable to develop an alternative method for obtaining (?), which relies on universal physical principles instead of arbitrary definitions. Such a method is presented in this work. This method was developed for an off-stoichiometric Sm 123 single crystal. Due to the global behaviour of the hysteresis loop at high temperatures close to T[subscript c] for twinned superconductors this method is not restricted to this compound and can be used for all twinned superconductors irrespective of their microstructures or oxygen contents. This method for determining the lock-in angle (?) for pinning of the vortices on extended defects, i. e. twin planes here, was employed without any pre-assumed criterion for defining (?). Appropriate scaling of the hysteresis loops for different angles close to the c-axis led to a clear discrimination between the two vortex dynamics regimes. From this scaling the lock-in angle was determined to be 6 degrees � 0. 1 degrees, which means that the uncertainty in determining the lock-in angle using this method is considerably less than with other existing methods.
