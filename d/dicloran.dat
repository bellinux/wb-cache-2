40|$|Objective. To assess {{efficacy}} and safety diclofenacol 1 % liniment application {{in comparison with}} diclo- ran plus. Material and methods. An open controlled 2 -weeks trial of diclofenacol 1 % liniment on 30 pts with active joint syndrome (group 1) compared with <b>dicloran</b> plus 1 % gel on 20 pts (group II). Pts age ranged from 16 to 79 years, mean disease duration was 8, 2 1, 5 years. Most pts had II activity degree. Results. Diclofenacol 1 % liniment applications decreased pain at rest and at movement and circle of aim joints. In pts with RA effect was more prominent. <b>Dicloran</b> plus provided equivalent results. Local effect of diclofenacol appeared in average after 31, 5 min. (from 10 to 73 min) and lasted during 118, 3 min (from 50 to 240 min.). Diclofenacol allowed to decrease dose of oral NSAIDs in 43, 3 % of pts and <b>dicloran</b> - in 40 % of pts. Diclofenacol safety was good without local and systemic adverse events. Conclusion. Diclofenacol 1 % liniment manufactured by Hiperion S. A. (Rumania) can be recommended for wide administration in treatment of joint diseases particularly in pts with concomitant gastrointestinal diseases and hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide smoke {{generating}} {{products are}} widely used by amateurs and professionals {{but there is little}} published information available about their burn and deposition characteristics to enable the risks associated with using these devices to be assessed. This paper investigates their burn characteristics, deposition patterns, pesticide air concentrations and potential exposure to operators. Thirteen firings were carried out in different spaces with different ventilation con-ditions. Three types of devices were investigated: <b>dicloran,</b> permethrin and red dye. Pesticide air concentrations increased after firing, reaching a maximum determined by the room volume in 10 min and decreasing exponentially as a result of ventilation and deposition. Ejected pesticide was present in the aerosol phase but there were only occasional traces of vapour. Settlement of pesticide was affected by surface orientation, height, sampling material and the pesticide-to-space volume ratio. The manufacturer’s recommended treatment period for <b>dicloran</b> of 4 h followed by half an hour of ventilation may be insufficient to reduce pesticide to safe levels for re-entry under very calm conditions...|$|E
40|$|Isolates of Botrytis cinerea from {{containerized}} {{conifer seedlings}} from two nurseries in the Northern Rocky Mountains {{were exposed to}} the dicarboximide fungicides vinclozolin and iprodione and the chlorinated nitroaniline fungicide <b>dicloran</b> to evaluate occurrence and characteristics of resistant strains. The isolates were grown on test media prepared by incorporating the fungicides at various concentrations into potato dextrose agar. In this way, we were able to select B. cinerea strains resistant to increasing fungicide concentrations up to a maximum of 10, 000 ug/ml. Resistance to the three fungicides occurred in isolates not previously exposed to the chemicals. Some strains were even resistant to high fungicide concentrations. Genetic stability of these resistant strains was confirmed by growing them in the absence of fungicides. Cross-resistance among the three fungicides was common. Vinclozolin and iprodione generally inhibited spore germination more than mycelial growth; the opposite was true for <b>dicloran.</b> Ramifications of fungicide resistance in disease control are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to determine levels of tolerance of 10 Botrytis cinerea isolates from the Flathead Indian Reservation greenhouse (Ronan, MT) to six fungicides. In vitro growth and conidial germination on fungicide-amended potato dextrose agar were used as criteria for assessing tolerance.

Most isolates displayed slight tolerance to captan; four were slightly tolerant to vinclozolin. <b>Dicloran</b> and iprodione were the most effective fungicides in limiting growth and spore germination of the Botrytis isolates tested.

We also measured eight pesticides in 48 -hr personal air samples collected from the mothers during pregnancy. The following seven pesticides were detected in 48 – 83 % of plasma samples (range, 1 – 270 pg/g) : the organophosphates chlorpyrifos and diazinon, the carbamates bendiocarb and 2 -isopropoxyphenol (metabolite of propoxur), and the fungicides <b>dicloran,</b> phthalimide (metabolite of folpet and captan), and tetrahydrophthalimide (metabolite of captan and captafol). Maternal and cord plasma levels were similar and, except for phthalimide, were highly correlated (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted over 2 years in Yuma County, AZ, and Imperial County, CA, {{to determine the}} efficacy of several biocontrol agents {{for the management of}} lettuce drop caused by Sclerotinia spp. Commercial formulations of Trichoderma harzianum (Plantshield, Supersivit), Gliocladium virens (Soilgard), Coniothyrium minitans (Contans), and Bacillus subtilis (Companion) were evaluated and compared with the chemical fungicide iprodione (Rovral) against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and S. minor. A single application of biocontrol products or of Rovral did not reduce lettuce drop caused by either Sclerotinia species. However, two applications of Contans, one at planting and one at post-thinning, significantly reduced the incidence of lettuce drop caused by S. sclerotiorum and increased yield but had no effect on S. minor at both locations in both years. Two applications of other biocontrol products did not significantly reduce disease incidence despite medium to high recovery following application. In contrast, Contans was only sporadically recovered following application. In vitro fungicide sensitivity evaluation revealed that both Trichoderma and Gliocladium species were tolerant to iprodione, <b>dicloran</b> (Botran), and vinclozolin (Ronilan) up to 1, 000 ppm a. i., whereas both Sclerotinia spp. and C. minitans were sensitive to all three fungicides above 1 ppm. In summary, Contans was the most effective treatment for the control of lettuce drop caused by S. sclerotiorum, but no treatment was effective against S. minor in the desert lettuce production systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simultaneously performed two-/three-phase hollow-fiber-based liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) method for {{the determination of}} aromatic amines {{with a wide range}} of pK(a) (- 4. 25 to 4. 6) and log K(ow) (0. 9 - 2. 8) values in environmental water samples. Analytes including aniline, 4 -nitroaniline, 2, 4 -dinitroaniline and <b>dicloran</b> were extracted from basic aqueous samples (donor phase, DP) into the microliter volume of organic membrane phase impregnated into the pores of the polypropylene hollow fiber wall, then back extracted into the acidified aqueous solution (acceptor phase, AP) filling in the lumen of the hollow fiber. The mass transfer of the analytes from the donor phase through the organic membrane phase into acceptor phase was driven by both the counter-coupled transport of hydrogen ions and the pH gradient. Afterwards, the hollow fiber was eluted with 50 mu L methanol to capture the analytes from both the organic membrane and the acceptor phase. Factors relevant to the enrichment factors (EFs) were investigated. Under the optimized condition (DP: 100 mL of 0. 1 M NaOH with 2 M Na(2) SO(4); organic phase: di-n-hexyl with 8 % trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO); AP: 10 mu L of 8 M HCl; extraction time of 80 min), the obtained EFs were 405 - 2000, dynamic linear ranges were 5 - 200 mu g/L (R > 0. 9976). and limits of detection were 0. 5 - 1. 5 mu g/L. The presence of humic acid (0 - 25 mg/L dissolved organic carbon) had no significant effect on the extraction efficiency. The proposed procedure worked very well for real environmental water samples with microgram per liter level of analytes, and good spike recoveries (80 - 103 %) were obtained. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.
