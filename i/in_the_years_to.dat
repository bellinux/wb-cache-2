5|$|Although Z. Marcas {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France {{were in danger of}} being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
5|$|Among {{those who}} met with Jinnah to seek his return was Liaquat Ali Khan, who {{would be a major}} {{political}} associate of Jinnah <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come and the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. At Jinnah's request, Liaquat discussed the return with a large number of Muslim politicians and confirmed his recommendation to Jinnah. In early 1934, Jinnah relocated to the subcontinent, though he shuttled between London and India on business for the next few years, selling his house in Hampstead and closing his legal practice in Britain.|$|E

5|$|After {{buying the}} team, COMSAT {{organized}} its Denver sports franchises under a separate subsidiary, Ascent Entertainment Group Inc., which {{went public in}} 1995, with 80% of its stock bought by COMSAT and the other 20% available on NASDAQ. The Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver (where the Denver Nuggets also played) on October 6, 1995, winning 3–2 against the Detroit Red Wings. Valeri Kamensky scored the first goal as the Avalanche. Led by captain Joe Sakic, forward Peter Forsberg and defenseman Adam Foote {{on the ice and}} Pierre Lacroix as the general manager and Marc Crawford as the head coach, the Avalanche became stronger when All-Star Montreal Canadiens goalie Patrick Roy joined the team. Feeling humiliated for being left in the net after having let in nine goals in 26 shots during a Canadiens game against the Red Wings, Roy joined the Avalanche on December 6, 1995, together with ex-Montreal captain Mike Keane in a trade for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Ručinský and Andrei Kovalenko. Roy would prove a pivotal addition for Colorado <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
5|$|Enemies of the Association soon fought back. George Henderson, {{the range}} detective who had pinned Ella Watson, {{was murdered by}} rustlers near Sweetwater Creek in October 1890, an obvious taunt to the Association. The cattle barons soon {{tightened}} their control and hunted down those who tried to oppose them. The double lynching of the Averells {{was followed by the}} lynching of Tom Waggoner, a horse trader from Newcastle, in June 1891. A friend of Waggoner named Jimmy the Butcher, who was once arrested for rustling the Standard Cattle Company, was also murdered. Range detective Tom Smith killed a suspected rustler, and when he was indicted for murder, political connections of the Association secured his release. These killings would precipitate more hostilities and violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E

5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
5|$|Helen Beatrix Potter {{was born}} in Kensington, London on 28 July 1866 to wealthy parents, and educated at home {{by a series of}} governesses and tutors. She {{displayed}} artistic talent early, drawing and sketching mammals, insects, reptiles and amphibians, flowers and plants. In the early 1890s, she enjoyed her first professional artistic success when she sold six designs to a greeting card publisher. On 16 December 1901, she privately issued The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and, on 2 October 1902, a trade edition of the tale was released by Frederick Warne & Co. to great success. She published tales similar in content, style, and format for Warnes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> follow, and, in 1904, The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, a sequel to Peter Rabbit. In July 1905, Potter bought Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District with the profits from her books and a small legacy left her by an aunt; the farm became her home away from London and her artistic retreat. In a few years, Potter had established her own career, income, and home.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} five seasons, the Rockets either failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs or were {{eliminated}} in the first round. The first elimination in 1988 led to Fitch's dismissal, with Don Chaney replacing him as head coach. Chaney, like Olajuwon, also played for the Houston Cougars under Guy Lewis, having played along Elvin Hayes in the late 1960s. Chaney had his best season during 1990–91, where he was named the Coach of the Year after leading the Rockets to a 52-30 record despite Olajuwon's absence due to injury for 25 games. Despite Olajuwon's usual strong numbers, the underwhelming roster could not be lifted out of mediocrity. However, the attempts to rebuild the team nucleus incorporated players that would later make an impact <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come, such as Kenny Smith, Vernon Maxwell, Robert Horry, Mario Elie, Sam Cassell and Otis Thorpe.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> follow, public revelations on {{the state}} of Charles and Diana's {{marriage}} continued. Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher {{than at any time in}} living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.|$|E
5|$|Senator Robert F. Wagner {{proposed}} the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no {{stand on the}} legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} as to {{the early}} seat of the ruling clan. Modern archeology {{has shown that the}} gord in Gniezno did not even exist before about 940. This fact eliminates the possibility of Gniezno's early central role, which is what had long been believed, based on the account given by Gallus Anonymus. The relics found in Giecz (including a great concentration of silver treasures), where the original gord was built some 80 years earlier, point to that location. Other likely early capitals include the old gords of Grzybowo, Kalisz or Poznań. Poznań, which is older than Gniezno, was probably the original site of Mieszko's court in the earlier years of his reign. The first cathedral church, a monumental structure, was erected there. The events of 974–78, when Mieszko, like his brother-in-law Boleslaus II of Bohemia, supported Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, in his rebellion against Otto II, created a threat of the emperor's retribution. The situation probably motivated Mieszko to move the government to Gniezno, which was safer due to its more eastern location. The emperor's response turned out to be ineffective, but this geographical advantage continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come. The growing importance of Gniezno was reflected in the addition around 980 of a new southern part to the original two segments of the gord. In the existing summary of the Dagome iudex document written in 991-92 before Mieszko's death, Mieszko's state is referred to as Civitas Gnesnensis, or the Gniezno State.|$|E
5|$|Through {{fortunes}} {{of marriage and}} inheritance, Warwick emerged in the 1450s at the centre of English politics. Originally he was a supporter of King Henry VI; however, a territorial dispute with the Duke of Somerset led him to collaborate with Richard, Duke of York, in opposing the king. From this conflict he gained the strategically valuable post of Captain of Calais, a position that benefited him greatly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come. The political conflict later turned into full-scale rebellion, where in battle York was slain, as was Warwick's father Salisbury. York's son, however, later triumphed with Warwick's assistance, and was crowned King Edward IV. Edward initially ruled with Warwick's support, but the two later fell out over foreign policy and the king's choice of Elizabeth Woodville as his wife. After a failed plot to crown Edward's brother, George, Duke of Clarence, Warwick instead restored Henry VI to the throne. The triumph was short-lived however: on 14April 1471 Warwick was defeated by Edward at the Battle of Barnet, and killed.|$|E
