25|$|A {{tiltrotor}} is {{an aircraft}} {{which uses a}} pair or more of powered rotors (sometimes called proprotors) mounted on rotating shafts or nacelles {{at the end of}} a fixed wing for lift and propulsion, and combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. In September 1930, George Lehberger devised the basic concept of tilt rotor aircraft, that is, a relatively low <b>disc</b> <b>loading</b> thruster (propeller) that can tilt its axis from the vertical (for vertical lift) to the horizontal (for propulsive thrust). On September 16, 1930, Lehberger was issued U.S. patent #1,775,861.|$|E

40|$|International audienceEstimation of {{the disk}} load {{in order to prevent}} low back pain is useful. However, the {{conventional}} methods of measuring <b>disc</b> <b>load</b> are invasive and their use is limited due to measurement environments. This study proposes a new method of estimating the lumbar <b>disc</b> <b>load</b> to measure curvature of the lumbar portion and to estimate the lumbar <b>disc</b> <b>load</b> safely using a bending sensor. The radius curvature can be measured relatively easily and without damaging the body by using this method. The bending sensors are attached along vertebra end of five vertebras and the curvature of the lumbar portion is estimated by reading the change in output voltage. The lumbar disk load with static posture was estimated by proposed method. The result shows the same tendency as the previous method. The proposed method has a possibility of developing a new system using the biofeedback based on the lumbar <b>disc</b> <b>load...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction. One {{common cause}} of low lumbar back pain is {{degenerative}} disc disease. A physiological intervertebral disc has several functions in the axial system. Each disc {{is attached to the}} vertebra above and below and serves as a connector and a spacer. Surgical treatment of back pain becomes more common in medical practice. There are two surgical methods in treating back pain (when replacing intervertebral disc) : spinal fusion and artificial discs. Disadvantage of the fusion is decrease of mobility in dependence on the increasing of adjacent vertebrae and <b>discs</b> <b>load...</b>|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{the weight}} of a {{helicopter}} increases disk loading. For a given weight, a helicopter with shorter rotors will have higher disk loading, and will require more engine power to hover. A low disk loading improves autorotation performance in rotorcraft. Typically, an autogyro (or gyroplane) has a lower rotor <b>disc</b> <b>loading</b> than a helicopter, which provides a slower rate of descent in autorotation.|$|E
50|$|In fluid dynamics, disk loading or <b>disc</b> <b>loading</b> is {{the average}} {{pressure}} change across an actuator disk, such as an airscrew. Airscrews with a relatively low disk loading are typically called rotors, including helicopter main rotors and tail rotors; propellers typically have a higher disk loading. The V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft has a high disk loading relative to a helicopter in the hover mode, but a relatively low disk loading in fixed-wing mode compared to a turboprop aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the small}} {{diameter}} fans used in turbofan jet engines, the main rotor on a helicopter {{has a large}} diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air.

50|$|Only the {{limitations}} of weight and materials (e.g., the strengths and melting points of materials in the turbine) reduce the efficiency at which a turbofan gas turbine converts this thermal energy into mechanical energy, for while the exhaust gases may still have available energy to be extracted, each additional stator and turbine disk retrieves progressively less mechanical energy per unit of weight, and increasing the compression ratio of the system by adding to the compressor stage to increase overall system efficiency increases temperatures at the turbine face. Nevertheless, high-bypass engines have a high propulsive efficiency because even slightly increasing the velocity {{of a very large}} volume and consequently mass of air produces a very large change in momentum and thrust: thrust is the engine's mass flow (the amount of air flowing through the engine) multiplied by the difference between the inlet and exhaust velocities in—a linear relationship—but the kinetic energy of the exhaust is the mass flow multiplied by one-half the square of the difference in velocities. A low <b>disc</b> <b>loading</b> (thrust per disc area) increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use.|$|E
5000|$|If all the {{gas power}} from a gas turbine is {{converted}} to kinetic energy in a propelling nozzle, the aircraft is best suited to high supersonic speeds. If it is all transferred to a separate big mass of air with low kinetic energy, the aircraft is best suited to zero speed (hovering). For speeds in between, the gas power is shared between a separate airstream and the gas turbine's own nozzle flow in a proportion which gives the aircraft performance required. The first jet aircraft were subsonic and the poor suitability of the propelling nozzle for these speeds due to high fuel consumption was understood, and bypass proposed, as early as 1936 (U.K. Patent 471,368). The underlying principle behind bypass is trading exhaust velocity for extra mass flow which still gives the required thrust but uses less fuel. Whittle called it [...] "gearing down the flow". Power is transferred from the gas generator to an extra mass of air, i.e. a bigger diameter propelling jet, moving more slowly. The bypass spreads the available mechanical power across more air to reduce the velocity of the jet. The trade off between mass flow and velocity is also seen with propellers and helicopter rotors by comparing <b>disc</b> <b>loading</b> and power loading. For example, the same helicopter weight can be supported by a high power engine and small diameter rotor or, for less fuel, a lower power engine and bigger rotor with lower velocity through the rotor.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{expensive}} and risky Rotorcraft-Pilot Couplings (RPC) that can develop during flight testing phases {{of any new}} prototype aircraft, it is beneficial to crosscheck the RPC susceptibility of the vehicle {{as early as possible}} during the design process. One of the objectives of the European project ARISTOTEL (2010 - 2013) is to provide guidelines to designers and simulator programs to reveal RPC aspects of the vehicle to be designed. First, a methodology to assess the sensitivity of Handling Qualities (HQs) and RPCs to design parameters is presented: a design envelope is created around a baseline configuration while considering various parameter constraints and simulation models in state space representation are developed. Second, three PIO criteria are applied to predict the susceptibility to PIO of a set of configurations belonging to the design envelope. Assessment based on Bandwidth-Phase Delay (BPD) reveals that the lowest tip speed values and the lowest <b>disc</b> <b>loading</b> values have the best HQs. Category II PIO assessment based on Open Loop Onset Point (OLOP) shows that lowest actuator rate limits are obtained for the configurations with high tip speed values and high <b>disc</b> <b>loading</b> values.
