50|$|Part IVA {{is a set}} {{of general}} anti-avoidance {{measures}} addressing schemes with a dominant purpose of creating a tax benefit. Section 177E specifically covers <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping.</b> That section exists to avoid any difficulty that might arise from identifying exactly where a tax benefit arises in <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping.</b> <b>Dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> will generally result in money to owners being taxed as dividends, irrespective of interposed steps.|$|E

50|$|The tax {{landscape}} {{has changed}} considerably since these times. The anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA are much broader and specifically apply against <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> {{of the kind}} Cadiz used. Capital gains tax would apply to Slutzkin's proceeds too.|$|E

The price of a k-year <b>dividend</b> <b>strip</b> is {{the present value of}} the dividend paid in k years. The value of the stock market is the sum of all <b>dividend</b> <b>strip</b> prices across maturities. We study the properties of strips and find that expected returns, Sharpe ratios, and volatilities on short-term strips are higher than on the aggregate stock market, while their CAPM betas are well below one. Short-term strip prices are more volatile than their realizations, leading to excess volatility and return predictability. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} {{interest in}} the case today is its part in judicial interpretation of the section 260 anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, and indirectly in overall <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> operations of the time (insofar as action against the vendors' position failed).|$|E
50|$|For an investor, <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> {{provides}} dividend income, and {{a capital}} loss when the shares fall in value (in normal circumstances) on going ex-dividend.

50|$|In late 1968 Slutzkin {{wished to}} dispose of Francis Richards, to save ongoing {{accounting}} fees and operating costs.

40|$|We {{summarize}} {{and extend}} the new literature on the term structure of equity. Short-term equity claims, or <b>dividend</b> <b>strips,</b> have on average significantly higher returns than the aggregate stock market. The returns on short-term dividend claims are risky as measured by volatility, but safe as measured by market beta. These facts are hard to reconcile with traditional macro-finance models and we {{provide an overview of}} new models that can reproduce some of these facts. We relate our evidence on <b>dividend</b> <b>strips</b> to facts about other asset classes such as nominal and corporate bonds, volatility, and housing. We conclude by discussing the broader economic implications by linking the term structure of returns to real economic decisions such as hiring and investment...|$|R
50|$|Cadiz then {{proceeded}} with its <b>dividend</b> <b>strip,</b> causing Francis Richards to pay dividends totalling $103,744.70. Cadiz then on-sold {{the company for}} $6,831.96, a price possible because as a private company which had paid out an excess distribution (under section 106 of the ITAA) it was worth more than its asset value. The net profit to Cadiz was $6,183.36 before expenses.|$|R
40|$|Negligible pricing {{frictions}} in {{underlying asset}} markets can become greatly magnified when using no-arbitrage arguments to price derivative claims. Amplification {{occurs when a}} replicating portfolio contains partially offsetting positions that lever up exposures to primary market frictions, and can cause arbitrarily large biases in synthetic return moments. We show theoretically and empirically how synthetic <b>dividend</b> <b>strips,</b> which {{shed light on the}} pricing of risks at different horizons, are impacted by this phenomenon. <b>Dividend</b> <b>strips</b> are claims to dividends paid over future time intervals, and can be replicated by highly levered long-short positions in futures contracts written on the same underlying index, but with different maturities. We show that tiny pricing frictions can help to reproduce a downward-sloping term structure of equity risk premia, excess volatility, return predictability, and a market beta substantially below one, consistent with empirical evidence. Using more robust return measures we find smaller point estimates of the returns to shortterm dividend claims, and little support for a statistical or economic difference between the returns to short- versus long-term dividend claims...|$|R
50|$|Slutzkin v Federal Commissioner Of Taxation (1977) 140 CLR 314 was a High Court of Australia case {{concerning}} the tax position of company owners who {{sold to a}} <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> operation. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) claimed the proceeds {{should be treated as}} dividends, but the Court held they were a capital sum like an ordinary investment asset sale.|$|E
50|$|Tax {{treatment}} of dividends varies between tax jurisdictions. For instance, in India, dividends are tax {{free in the}} hands of the shareholder, but the company paying the dividend has to pay dividend distribution tax at 12.5%. There is also the concept of a deemed dividend, which is not tax free. Further, Indian tax laws include provisions to stop <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> {{can be used}} as a tax {{avoidance}} strategy, enabling a company to be distributed company profits to its owners as a capital sum, instead of as a dividend, which offers tax benefits if the effective tax rate on capital gains is lower than for dividends. For example, consider a company called ProfCo wishing to distribute $X, with the help of a stripper called StripperCo.|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 “The Term Structure of Equities” {{examines}} the term structure of equities. Using observed prices of <b>dividend</b> <b>strips,</b> prices of zero-coupon equities are extracted, and their yields and returns characteristics are documented. An affine term structure model {{is used to}} model the term structure of equities. The model is estimated, and model-implied equity yields and returns are shown to match the data well. However, the modelimplied long-run risk-neutral mean of the short rate is implausible. (The next chapter takes this into account and estimates bond and equity yield curves jointly using data on both zero-coupon bonds and zero-coupon equities.) Chapter 2 “Estimating a Unified Framework of Co-Pricing Stocks and Bonds” estimates a maximal identifiable affine term structure model that explains the joint prices of stocks and bonds. Using the test assets of Treasury bonds and <b>dividend</b> <b>strips,</b> it is shown that the estimated model can generally match the time series and cross-sectional properties of zero-coupon bonds, zero-coupon equities and the aggregate stock index. Moreover, imposing restrictions prevalent in the co-pricing literature on the maximal model enhances certain features of the model such as the high return of the short-term <b>dividend</b> <b>strip,</b> but reduces the model’s ability to fit {{other aspects of the}} data such as the level of the market risk premium. Chapter 3 “The Role of Asian Countries” Reserve Holdings on the International Yield Curves” studies the effect of Asian countries’ reserve holdings on the yield curves of six industrialized countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Switzerland and Australia. A Gaussian affine term structure model with three yield factors and three unspanned macro factors including reserves is estimated to fit the yield curve of each country. Impulse responses and variance decompositions show that Asian countries’ reserve holdings are an important factor affecting the international yield curves...|$|R
50|$|The {{promoter}} {{would have}} the company pay (to the promoter) a dividend of the money it had left, then the promoter on-sold the now empty shell to someone else. The way the promoter paid the owners for undistributed profits was similar to a <b>dividend</b> <b>strip</b> operation. In any case the amount the promoter paid was a tax deduction (since the promoter {{would be in the}} business of buying and selling shares) and the dividend would be taxable income, leaving just the promoter's commission taxable, not the whole original company profit.|$|R

These assumptions will then be the focus of analysis and debate." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> {{by investors}} has the general {{advantages}} or disadvantages described above, {{but in addition}} in Australia there are franking credits attached to dividends under the dividend imputation system. Those credits can only be used by eligible investors (see the dividend imputation article), so there's a tension between different investors for the amount shares should fall when going ex-dividend. A rationally priced drop for one group is a bonus or trading opportunity for the other.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> is the {{practice}} of buying shares a short period before a dividend is declared, called cum-dividend, and then selling them when they go ex-dividend, when the previous owner is entitled to the dividend. On the day the company trades ex-dividend, theoretically the share price drops {{by the amount of}} the dividend. However, the experience is that quality companies tend to recover the value of the dividend within a matter of weeks, at which time they trade normally.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{provisions}} {{scattered throughout the}} income tax legislation seek {{to deal with the}} evil of <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> (primarily s 177 E of ITAA 1936, s 207 - 145 and 207 - 150 of ITAA 1997). However nowhere in the legislation is there a definition of <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping.</b> This has been of concern to tax advisers because (in the absence of the availability of the CGT small business concessions) plain vanilla tax planning has traditionally favoured a shareholder who controls a private company with undistributed profits first stripping the profits out of the company by way of a dividend issue before selling the shares. Of course, it all depends on the tax profile of the company and the shareholder bur a scenario can be envisaged whereby the dividend would be tax free to the shareholder and any capital gain on the disposal of the shares minimised (or a loss generated). The more recent the acquisition of the company by the shareholder the greater the concern that the <b>dividend</b> <b>stripping</b> rules may have an application...|$|E

We recover prices of <b>dividend</b> <b>strips,</b> which are short-term assets that pay dividends on the stock index every period up to period T and nothing thereafter. It is short-term relative to the index because the index pays dividends in perpetuity. We find that expected returns, Sharpe ratios, and volatilities on short-term assets are higher than on the index, while their CAPM betas are below one.

The short-term claims have an average CAPM loading on the market of 0. 5 and have a small positive loading on the book-to-market factor.

40|$|In {{this note}} we value and hedge European options on assets paying {{discrete}} stochastic dividends. Our hedging strategy is {{based only on}} the underlying asset, risk-free bonds and <b>dividend</b> <b>strips.</b> Our simple strategy is easily seen to be compatible with early results based, among other things, {{on the existence of}} a dividend forward contract. Such contracts, however, are not traded in the market place and, therefore, our simpler strategy gains in clarity and practical application. In this note we analyze the problem of valuing a European call option written on an asset paying discrete random dividends. Dividends are an important feature when characterizing the process of the underlying asset for the purpose of pricing derivatives, as stressed in the early papers of Merton (1973) and Black (1975). In Black (1975) the dividends were considered to be stochastic, although with a continuous deterministic yield, whereas in Merton (1973) dividends are discrete, paying a known amount at a given payment date. A paper by Chance, Kumar and Rich (2002) [Chance et al. hereafter] relaxes these assumptions, allowing for stochastic, discrete dividends. As usual, the valuation of a European option is given by the value of a self-financing portfolio that replicates the final payoff of the option at maturity. The application of this principle to random dividends is an important ∗Corresponding author’s contact: tel. + 351. 213. 822. 723, fax + 351. 213. 873. 973, email...|$|R

40|$|In U. S. data, value {{stocks have}} higher {{expected}} excess returns and higher CAPM alphas than growth stocks. We find the external-habit model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) can generate a value premium in both CAPM alpha and expected excess return {{so long as}} the persistence of the log surplus-consumption ratio is not too high. In contrast, Lettau and Wachter (2007) find that when the log surplus-consumption ratio is assumed to be highly persistent as in Campbell and Cochrane, the external-habit model generates a growth premium in expected excess return. However, the micro evidence favors a less persistent log surplus-consumption ratio. We choose a value for this persistence which is sufficiently low that the most recent 2 years of log consumption contribute over 98 % of all past consumption to log habit, which is a much more reasonable number than the 25 % contribution generated by the Lettau-Wachter value. In our model, expected consumption is slowly mean-reverting, as in the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), which is why our model is able to generate a price-dividend ratio for aggregate equity that exhibits the high autocorrelation found in the data, despite the very low persistence of the price-of-risk state variable. Our results suggest that an external habit model in the spirit of Campbell and Cochrane can deliver an empirically sensible value premium once the persistence of the surplus consumption ratio is calibrated to the micro evidence rather than set to a value close to one. When we allow the conditional volatility of consumption growth to also be slowly mean reverting as in the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron, our model is also able to generate empirically sensible predictability of long-horizon returns using the price-dividend ratio, without eroding the value premium. Our results also suggest that models with fast-moving habit can deliver several empirical properties of aggregate <b>dividend</b> <b>strips</b> that have been recently documented. ...|$|R
40|$|In early 1997, the Malaysian {{stock market}} index began a {{downward}} spiral together with stock markets of several ASEAN countries. On 14 July 1997, Bank Negara of Malaysia gave up the defence of the Malaysian ringgit after jacking up the short rate to 50 % and spending US$ 10 billions on unsuccessful monetary operations. Two years on, much has happened and the Asian crisis appears to be history. However, in many respects, the Asian crisis has had a much greater and more adverse impact on Malaysia than the world market crash in October 1987. This paper analyses the Malaysian share of the 1997 Asian crisis. The Malaysian stock market, often classified as an emerging or developing stock market together with other Asian markets, is shown to possess characteristics distinct from the developed stock markets in the US and the UK. A strong contagion effect in the region was present although it is debatable if {{it was due to}} investor herding behavior or the interrelated cross border trade. There is no evidence that many useful techniques, such as diversification across time, <b>stripping</b> <b>dividends</b> and hedging, have been implemented in the Malaysian context. The Malaysian government has managed the crisis well under the circumstances. In some respects, South Africa has many features similar to those of Malaysia; the close tie with the neighbouring countries, the internal racial conflict, the rich natural resources and the potential for strong growths. There are many useful lessons to be learnt from the experience in Malaysia...|$|R
