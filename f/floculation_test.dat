H-antigen prepared from emulsion of lung which appeared severe pathological findings shows antigenic nature specifically as positive <b>floculation.</b> <b>test</b> for antibodies produced by Rickettsia orientalis as follows: 1. F-antigen fraction which are fresh emulsion of infected lung do not appear positive floculation against homologous antibodies produced by Rickettsia orientalis. 2. But the F-antigen appears positive reaction after the manipulation of which the material contains F-antigen fraction are frozen and disolved quickly 2 - 3 times continuously by dryice-Acetone. 3. H-antigen shows positive reaction against homologous antibodies whether the emulsion contains Rickettsia or not. 4.

40|$|Phospat is the {{key element}} of nutrien that cause eutrophication. Recently, many home industri such as Laundry can effect to the stream, it caused eutrophication. Phospat is one of {{builders}} in deterjen that cause eutrophication. Multivalen Metal Ions is one of Coagulant that used as Phospat removal from domestic waste, esspesially deterjen by Coagulation – <b>Floculation</b> <b>test.</b> The most commonly used coagulants of Multivalen Metal Ions are Ferric chloride (FeCl 3) and Aluminium Oxide (Al 2 O 3). There are many variation of Concentration that added into wastewater as coagulant that can remove Phospat from effluent pipe and drainage. The aim of Coagulation <b>Floculation</b> <b>test</b> in this research is to know the optimum dosage of Ferric Chloride and Aluminium Oxide to remove phospat. The result {{of this research is}} that Aluminium Oxide more effective to remove phospat than Ferric Chloride to remove phospat from effluent pipe and drainage. Aluminium Oxide removed phospat in effluent pipe around 66, 49 %. The abbility of Ferric Chloride to removed phospat around 54, 25 %. Aluminium Oxide more effective than Ferric Chloride, it caused that Aluminium Oxide can make floc destabilisation at pH 6 – 8. Efficiency of Ferric Chloride and Aluminium Oxide almost the same to remove phospat in drainage. The abbility to remove phospat is around 73, 9 % of Ferric Chloride and 74, 85 % of Aluminium Oxide. The ability of Ferric Chloride is significant to remove phospat in drainage, it cause Ferric Chloride has abbility to remove phospat at pH 8 or more...|$|E
40|$|An ELISA {{test for}} {{trichinosis}} using as antigen a larvae soluble fraction from Trichinella spiralis {{was carried out}} {{for the detection of}} IgMand IgA specific antibodies in 45 serum samples from patients confirmed or suspected to have trichinosis by strong clinical and epidemiological evidences. All the patients had positive serology detected by precipitin test, bentonite <b>floculation</b> <b>test,</b> indirect hemagglutination test and ELISA IgG test. The cut-off value was determined using two criteria. Criterion A was determined in each plate, using three positive controls and two negative ones; the average of the negative controls and the weakest positive control, muliplied by a 1. 2 factor was, considered the cut-off value. Criterion B was determinated using the average plus three standard deviations from 64 apparently healthy persons serum samples. In both cases, three serum dilutions (1 : 10, 1 : 100 and 1 : 500) were used. The sensitivity of ELISA IgM was 100. 0, 93. 3 and 82. 2 % using serum dilutions of 1 : 10, 1 : 100 and 1 : 500 respectively (criterion A) and 100. 0, 97. 8 and 95. 6 % for the same dilutions (criterion B), whereas the values for ELISA IgA were: 100. 0, 91. 1 and 86. 7 % (criterion A) and 100. 0, 100. 0 and 91. 1 %(criterion B). In order to find out the specificity of ELISA IgM and ELISA IgA, additional 118 serum samples from individuals with other parasitoses, such as cysticercosis (18) hydatidosis (39), fascioliasis (12), toxocariasis (30), Chagas' disease(12) and individuals with non-specif eosinophilia (7), were also tested. ELISA IgM presented a specificity of 92. 3, 93. 4 and 97. 3 % (criterion A) and 96. 2, 97. 8 and 97. 8 % (criterion B) whereas the results for ELISA IgA were 97. 8, 98. 9 and 99. 4 % (criterion A) and 98. 4 % for the 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 dilutions and 100. 0 % for the 1 : 500 dilution (criterion B). The positive predictive values of ELISA IgM were 76. 3, 77. 8 and 88. 1 % (criterion A) and 86. 5, 91. 7 and 91. 5 % (criterion B) whereas the negative ones were 100. 0, 98. 3 and 95. 7 % (criterion A) and 100. 0, 99. 4 and 98. 9 % (criterion B). The positive predictive values of ELISA IgA were 91. 8, 95. 3 and 97. 5 % (criterion A) and 93. 8, 93. 8 and 100. 0 % (criterion B) whereas the negatives ones were: 100. 0, 97. 8 and 96. 8 % (criterion A) and 100. 0, 100. 0 and 97. 8 %(criterion B).

40|$|Observing the {{clinical}} symptomes of the cholecystopathy patients in this distrit the following results were obtained. 1. 45. 1 % {{of the cases}} represented prodromal symptomes. Nausea and chilly sensation were most common. Fatigability, stiffness of the shoulders, vomiting, anorexia and fullness in the epigastrium were frequent in this order. 2. The abdominal pains were usually colic or severe in nature, and their localizations were mainly in the right hypochondrium or epigastrium. 45. 5 % of the abdominal pains were radiated to right shoulders, right back and to right hemithorax. The durations of the abdominal pains; 28. 9 % of the cases were less than 24 hours, in 79. 4 % of the cases disappeared within 10 days. 3. 59. 9 % of cholecystopathy cases were febrile and 25. 3 % were icteric. Serum bilirubin was determined in 50 relapsed cases and 80 % of those were less than 2. 0 mg%. Severe jaundice was seen in few cases. 4. In their entire clinical courses, the patients who represented all three cardinal symptomes, fever, abdominal pain and icterus, were only 12. 4 % on the other hand, cases with abdominal pain and fever were 45. 1 %, and the cases only with abdominal pain were 39. 4 %. 5. Vomitings were seen in 30. 5 % of the cases. There was a tendency of obstipation, which was seen in 28. 9 %. 9. 4 % of the cases had diarrhoe. 6. 43. 2 % of the cases had enlarged livers. The palpable gall bladders were noted in 22. 4 %. The palpable spleens and/or enlarged splenic dell area were observed in 9. 8 % of the cases. 7. Liver function tests; positive urine urobilinogen reactions in 62. 4 %, positive serum Takata reactions in 18 %, positive Gross reactions in 11. 4 %, positive cepbalin cholesterol <b>floculation</b> <b>tests</b> in 35. 2 %, positive thymol turbidity tests in 23. 2 %, positive Cobalt reactions in 24. 4 % and positive Bromsulpbalein tests in 37. 2 % of the cases. 8. Duodenal juice; greenish tone in 32. 1 %, abnormal outflows in 25 %, thin appearing B-gall in 25. 2 %, presence of gall sands in 7. 1 %, and presence of parasites eggs in 7. 2 %. Bacteriological investigations of the duodenal juices revealed that colis in 64. 8 %, diplococci in 23. 2 %, streptococci 5. 4 % and staphylococci were 3. 6 %. 9. Gastric juices; hypo- or anacidity in 65. 2 %, presence of ascaris eggs in 26. 7 % and presence of anchylostoma eggs were noted in 9. 3 % of the cases. 10. Hemograms; an increase in leucocytes was seen in 33. 7 % of the cases. 11. The cholecystopathy patients who had subjective symptomes, even during the periodes {{in which there was}} no sign of acute exacerbations, were 36. 8 % of the cases. The subjective symptomes were mainly discomforts and/or heavy sensations in the right hypochondrium or epigastrium. These patients still had some impairments of the liver, namely, positive urine urobilinogen reactions in 29. 2 %, hyperbilirubinemias (over 1. 0 mg%) in 32. 7 % and positive serum Takata reactions in 16. 7 % of the cases. 12. Observing 21 cases who underwent cholecystectomy, 23. 8 % of these cases were completely cured. In them 11 cases had gall stones. Remote prognosis were worse in those who had no gall stone. 13. It was thought that the functional disorders of gall bladder played a major roll in getting cholecystopathy. Repeating the following; dyskinesia inflammation organic change, and then turned to be irreversible organic changes at about the age of 40 years. Ascariasis did not appeared to be a main cause of cholecystopathy in this district...|$|R
