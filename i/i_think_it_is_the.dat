500|$|In {{his final}} public appearance, U.S. Army General Billy Mitchell said, [...] "I believe that, in the future, whoever holds Alaska {{will hold the}} world... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} strategic place in the world." [...] That year, Congress passed the Wilcox National Air Defense Act, which provided for a new airbase in Alaska for cold-weather testing and training. A survey team visited Fairbanks in 1936, and in 1937, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 7596, which set aside [...] of public land east of Fairbanks for the new airbase, which was named Ladd Army Airfield after Army pilot Arthur Ladd. Preliminary construction began in summer 1939, {{a few days before}} Germany invaded Poland to start World War II. The first runway was finished in September 1940, and the base was dedicated then, before most of the buildings were complete.|$|E

We contend {{that this is the}} first showing of a hopeful effort, under Government auspices, to solve the housing problem, the first plan to be tried and tested which offers to you any {{solution}} of the housing problem. [...] Therefore, we want someone to administer it with faith in it and with faith in the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are those}} who say that to kill [...] Martin [...] is terrorism, but to attack an army camp is guerrilla warfare and to bomb civilians is {{professional}} warfare. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same from the moral point of view. Is it better to drop an atomic bomb on a city than to kill a handful of persons? I don’t think so. But nobody says that President Truman was a terrorist. All the men we went for individually – Wilkin, Martin, MacMichael and others – were personally interested in succeeding in the fight against us.|$|E

Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> natural perversity; {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> false pride {{at getting}} over sea-sickness; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> reading 'Robinson Crusoe,' and books warning of {{me not to}} go to sea." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 31 May 2012, Pietersen {{announced}} his retirement from one-day international cricket. Although he intended to still play Twenty20s for England, and especially the World Twenty20 tournament in September 2012, the terms of his central contract meant {{that he had to}} retire from both forms. Remaining available for Test cricket only, Pietersen said that [...] "with the intensity of the international schedule and the increasing demands on my body, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right time to step aside and let the next generation of players come through to gain experience for the World Cup in 2015." [...] This announcement came {{on the back of his}} 80 against the West Indies at Trent Bridge as England took an unassailable 2–0 lead in the three-Test series. However, on 9 July 2012, Pietersen reversed his decision and suggested that he may return to ODIs in the future.|$|E
2500|$|John O'Hara {{wrote in}} the New York Times; [...] "The most {{important}} author living today, the outstanding author {{since the death of}} Shakespeare, has brought out a new novel. The title of the novel is Across the River and Into the Trees. The author, of course, is Ernest Hemingway, the most important, the outstanding author out of the millions of writers who have lived since 1616." [...] Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, and when I say <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, you may think me crazy. It will probably be a popular book. The critics may treat it pretty roughly. But its hauntingly tired cadences are the direct speech of a man's heart who is speaking that directly for the first time, and that makes it, for me, the finest thing Hemingway has done." ...|$|E
