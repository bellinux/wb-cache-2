5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (<b>Draize</b> <b>test)</b> because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, {{scientists}} {{have been trying to}} replace the regulatory in vivo <b>Draize</b> eye <b>test</b> by in vitro methods, but so far only partial replacement has been achieved. In order to better understand the reasons for this, historical in vivo rabbit data were analysed in detail and resampled with the purpose of (1) revealing which of the in vivo endpoints are most important in driving United Nations Globally Harmonized System/European Union Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging (UN GHS/EU CLP) classification for serious eye damage/eye irritation and (2) evaluating the method’s within-test variability for proposing acceptable and justifiable target values of sensitivity and specificity for alternative methods and their combinations in testing strategies. Among the Cat 1 chemicals evaluated, 36 – 65 % (depending on the database) were classified based only on persistence of effects, with the remaining being classified mostly based on severe corneal effects. Iritis was found to rarely drive the classification (< 4 % of both Cat 1 and Cat 2 chemicals). The two most important endpoints driving Cat 2 classification are conjunctiva redness (75 – 81 %) and corneal opacity (54 – 75 %). The resampling analyses demonstrated an overall probability of at least 11 % that chemicals classified as Cat 1 by the <b>Draize</b> eye <b>test</b> could be equally identified as Cat 2 and of about 12 % for Cat 2 chemicals to be equally identified as No Cat. On the other hand, the over-classification error for No Cat and Cat 2 was negligible (< 1 %), which strongly suggests a high over-predictive power of the <b>Draize</b> eye <b>test.</b> Moreover, our analyses of the classification drivers suggest a critical revision of the UN GHS/EU CLP decision criteria for the classification of chemicals based on <b>Draize</b> eye <b>test</b> data, in particular Cat 1 based only on persistence of conjunctiva effects or corneal opacity scores of 4.

METHODS: Ex vivo GSNO and SNAC toxicities were clinically and histologically analyzed using freshly excised pig eyeballs. In vivo experiments were performed with 20 albino rabbits which were randomized into 4 groups (5 animals each) : Groups 1 and 2 received instillations of 150 µL of aqueous HPMC solution containing GSNO 1. 0 and 10. 0 mM, respectively, {{in one of}} the eyes; Groups 3 and 4 received instillations of 150 µL of aqueous HPMC solution-containing SNAC 1. 0 and 10. 0 mM, respectively, {{in one of the}} eyes.

All animals underwent clinical evaluation on a slit lamp and the eyes were scored according to a modified <b>Draize</b> eye <b>test</b> and were histologically analyzed.

Therefore, NASA must assess potential toxicity and recommend appropriate mitigation measures to ensure that explorers are adequately protected. Visual acuity is critical during exploration activities and operations aboard spacecraft. Therefore, the present research was performed to ascertain the ocular toxicity of authentic lunar dust. Methods Small (mean particle diameter[*]=[*] 2. 9 [*]±[*] 1. 0 μm), reactive lunar dust particles were produced by grinding bulk dust under ultrapure nitrogen conditions. Chemical reactivity and cytotoxicity testing were performed using the commercially available EpiOcular TM assay. Subsequent in vivo <b>Draize</b> <b>testing</b> utilized a larger size fraction of unground lunar dust that is more relevant to ocular exposures (particles Results In vitro testing indicated minimal irritancy potential based on the time required to reduce cell viability by 50 % (ET 50).
