40|$|Communities {{living in}} flats produce both liquid and solid waste in large quantities. The liquid waste {{is called the}} {{wastewater}}. This wastewater will be a potential threat to the environment. Soysapura Housing Scheme treatment plant was taken up for this research study. This plant consists of Imhoff tank, trickling filter, <b>humus</b> <b>tank</b> and sludge drying beds. In this treatment plant performance of trickling filter was selected for detailed study. Grab samples were taken from inlet of the imhoff tank, trickling filter, <b>humus</b> <b>tank</b> and from the outlet of the <b>humus</b> <b>tank.</b> Grab samples were taken from 05 30 hrs. to 19 30 hrs. in two hourly intervals. Sampling was done by having a small gap between {{the first set of}} sampling and second set of sampling with the idea to see any variation in wastewater inflow patterns over a period. From the samples collected bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS) and pH were determined. The performance of the trickling filter was under detail study. A relationship for organic loading and trickling filter efficiency improved with increase of organic loading. Also a relationship of COD & BOD for the influent of trickling filter was obtained. With the loading pattern, the plant could be classified as a low rate tricking filter. Also this plant could treat further additional load after carrying out the suggested improvements. The cause of trickling filter performance are discussed and areas which require futher study and development are indentified and recommendations are made for future investigations...|$|E

40|$|The Beaudesert Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), {{originally}} {{built in}} 1966 and augmented in 1977, {{is a typical}} biological trickling filter sewage treatment plant comprising primary sedimentation tanks, trickling filters and <b>humus</b> <b>tanks.</b> The plant, despite not originally being designed for nitrogen removal, has been consistently achieving over 60 % total nitrogen (TN) reduction and low effluent ammonium concentration of less than 5 mg NH 3 -N/L. Through the return of a nitrate-rich stream from the <b>humus</b> <b>tanks</b> to the primary sedimentation tanks and maintaining an adequate sludge age within the primary sedimentation tanks, the current plant is achieving a substantial degree of denitrification. Further enhanced denitrification has been achieved by raising the recycle flows and maintaining an adequate SRT. This paper describes the approach to operating a trickling filter plant to achieve nitrification and denitrification to a high level. The effectiveness {{of this approach is}} demonstrated through pilot plant trials and analysis of their corresponding results. These results show a significant improvement in nitrogen removal capability whilst maximising the asset life of existing infrastructure. This shows great potential as a retrofit option for small and rural communities with pre-existing trickling filters that require improvements in terms of nitrogen removal.

40|$|STOAT {{has been}} {{extensively}} used for the dynamic simulation of a trickling filter based Sewage Treatment Plant Some alternative schemes have been suggested for the modernization of the existing sewage treatment works Different schemes have been compared {{with respect to the}} removal of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). b-COD, ammonia, nitrates etc in them The <b>humus</b> <b>tanks</b> (settling tanks associated with trickling filters) were modeled using the Takacs settler model [I Takacs, G G Patry and D. Nolasco A dynamic model of the clarification-thickening process Water Research 25. 1263 - 1271, 1991]. The results emphasize that COD based models are preferred over the BOD based ones. A compact bio-film with variable film thickness was proposed for the new schemes Suggested The newly proposed Scheme 3 was found most effective for reducing the mean b-COD level to as low as 2 3 mg/l. while the mean TSS level was brought down to 0 5 mg/l as compared to the mean levels of TSS (42 0 mg/l) and b-COD (48. 0 mg/l) in the existing plant (C) 2009 Elsevier B V. ...|$|R
5000|$|Treatment {{of sewage}} {{in the area}} {{began in the late}} nineteenth century. The 1881 Ordnance Survey map shows open fields and Deephams farm between the railway and the navigation, but by 1896, housing has begun to appear. Edmonton Sewage Works was built on a site {{to the west of the}} railway, and the farm had become Edmonton sewage farm. The works {{included}} three rectangular filter beds and a large building. By 1914, both facilities were owned by Edmonton Urban District, and the farm had expanded to include a large irregular-shaped filter bed. Major expansion had taken place by the 1930s, with <b>humus</b> <b>tanks</b> to the west, sludge beds to the north and filter beds to the east. In the middle was a sewage pumping station, and the complex was served by a network of tramways. A major expansion of the site commenced in 1939, but the onset of the Second World War resulted in the work being suspended until 1948. When work resumed, contracts were awarded to W. & C. French, Holland, Hannen & Cubitts and Marples Ridgway.|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} {{was to assess the}} {{potential}} to control Cryptosporidium in vulnerable catchments, using the Louth area in the Anglian Water region as a case study. This was completed through a literature review, a critical analysis of existing data and a four month sampling programme. It was found that Cryptosporidium oocysts which could potentially contaminate humans who get their drinking water from the downstream Covenham Water Treatment Works (WTW), were originating from Louth Sewage Treatment Works (STW). The oocysts from human or sheep hosts were entering Louth STW in the crude sewage. The STW collects and builds up the oocysts in the sludge holding tanks. When dewatering occurs, the sludge holding tanks release a large amount of Cryptosporidium into the STW, which in turn passes {{through the rest of the}} works, relatively untreated, into Louth Canal. The oocysts in Louth Canal were abstracted from, and added to, Covenham Reservoir. The oocysts from the reservoir occasionally passed through to Covenham WTW, where there is potential for human contamination. The literature review identified that treatment processes at Louth STW were less effective at oocyst removal than other research has indicated. Trickling filters and <b>humus</b> <b>tanks</b> removed a lower percentage of Cryptosporidium oocysts (17 % and 44 %) than literature suggested (91 %). Overall, it appeared that during the sampling period, the works added 18 oocysts/l, when the influent and the final effluent of the works were compared. This is because of the episodic nature of oocysts and the way that they were being recycled in the works. Oocysts entering Louth STW seemed to be being concentrated in the sludge holding tanks and then recirculated in the sludge supernatant from the dewatering process, back to the primary settlement tanks. This meant that primary settlement at Louth STW was not as effective (- 1299 %) as literature suggests (54 % removal) because of the additional input of oocysts to this treatment process. The concentration increase of Cryptosporidium oocysts within primary settlement tanks has not been observed previously. Not only did this appear at Louth STW, but also at Stamford STW, which was sampled as an additional STW. Because of this research, the operation and monitoring of the sludge at Louth STW is to be further investigated. Additional treatment options are to be considered at the STW and WTW, such as sand filtration at Louth STW and the installation of a permanent UV system or ultrafiltration at Covenham WTW. Further work would be to complete a more in depth analysis of more STWs to determine whether other sites have the same potential to accumulate and release Cryptosporidium. Another area for further study would be to look at the different combinations of treatments that STW use. This would help us understand why there are discrepancies in Cryptosporidium removal rates between sites. This would help to determine the most effective combination of treatment methods for the removal of Cryptosporidium during wastewater treatment...|$|R
