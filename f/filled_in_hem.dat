40|$|Thermodynamic {{calculation}} of combustion parameters and equilibrium composition of HEMs combustion products showed, {{that at the}} increase of aluminum powder dispersity the specific impulse and combustion temperature of solid propellants are reduced due to the decrease of the mass fraction of active aluminum in particles. Partial or complete replacement of aluminum by metal powder (B, Mg, AlB 2, Al alloy, Fe, Ti and Zr) <b>in</b> <b>HEMs</b> composition leads to the reduce of the specific impulse and combustion temperature. Replacement of aluminum powder by boron and magnesium <b>in</b> <b>HEM</b> reduces the mass fraction of condensed products in the combustion chamber of solid rocket motor.

40|$|Mouse {{models have}} proven {{invaluable}} for understanding erythropoiesis. Here, we describe an autosomal recessive, inherited anemia in the mouse mutant hem 6. Hematologic and transplantation analyses reveal a mild, congenital, hypochromic, microcytic anemia intrinsic to the hematopoietic {{system that is}} associated with a decreased red blood cell zinc protoporphyrin to heme ratio, indicative of porphyrin insufficiency. Intercross matings show that hem 6 can suppress the porphyric phenotype of mice with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). Furthermore, iron uptake studies <b>in</b> <b>hem</b> 6 reticulocytes demonstrate defective incorporation of iron into heme that can be partially corrected by the addition of porphyrin precursors. Gene expression and enzymatic assays indicate that erythroid 5 -aminolevulinic acid synthase (Alas 2) is decreased <b>in</b> <b>hem</b> 6 animals, suggesting a mechanism that could account for the anemia. Overall, these data lead to the hypothesis that hem 6 encodes a protein that directly or indirectly regulates the expression of Alas 2...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{examine whether}} TLR- 4 {{has an effect}} on {{hemorrhage}} induced changes in lung, and to investigate the change of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by hemorrhagic shock in mice. MethodsForty-eight male mice, including C 3 H/HeN mice and C 3 H/HeJ mice, were randomly divided into sham group (n= 12), hemorrhagic shock group with twelve mice in each phase. Blood pressure (BP) was monitored continuously by attaching carotid artery catheter to a strain gauge pressure transducer/ polygraph. Arterial blood samples were taken for blood gas analysis. A mouse model of non-lethal hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation was used to observe pulmonary myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and wet/dry weight ratio (W/D). The expression of HO- 1 was observed by means of RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. IL- 6 and IL- 10 in lung tissue homogenate were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The pulmonary pathologic changes were observed under electron microscope and light microscope. ResultsCompared with sham group, the expression of HO- 1 in lung tissue was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>Hem</b> 24 h and Hem 48 h of C 3 H/HeN mice (P< 0. 01). The expression of HO- 1 mRNA and the levels of IL- 6, IL- 10 and MPO in lung tissue were markedly increased <b>in</b> <b>Hem</b> 24 h (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05); Compared with C 3 H/HeN mice, the expression of HO- 1 mRNA and the levels of IL- 6 and IL- 10 in C 3 H/HeJ mice significantly decreased <b>in</b> <b>Hem</b> 24 h and Hem 48 h (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05), and the W/D, MPO in C 3 H/HeJ mice were obviously lower <b>in</b> <b>Hem</b> 24 h (P< 0. 05). The injuries of lung tissues after hemorrhagic shock have been demonstrated by histological examination with electron microscope and light microscope. ConclusionsTLR- 4 and HO- 1 might modulate the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory processes in inflammatory reaction of hemorrhagic shock-induced ALI, and the activation of Toll-like receptor might induce the transcription activity of HO- 1, which may {{play a key role in}} acute lung injury...|$|R

40|$|Hem 1 (Hematopoietic protein 1) is a hematopoietic cell-specific {{member of}} the Hem family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. Orthologues of <b>Hem</b> 1 <b>in</b> Dictyostelium discoideum, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans are {{essential}} for cytoskeletal reorganization, embryonic cell migration, and morphogenesis. However, the in vivo functions of mammalian Hem 1 are not known. Using a chemical mutagenesis strategy in mice to identify novel genes involved in immune cell functions, we positionally cloned a nonsense mutation <b>in</b> the <b>Hem</b> 1 gene. Hem 1 deficiency results in defective F-actin polymerization and actin capping in lymphocytes and neutrophils caused by loss of the Rac-controlled actin-regulatory WAVE protein complex. T cell development is disrupted <b>in</b> <b>Hem</b> 1 -deficient mice at the CD 4 −CD 8 − (double negative) to CD 4 +CD 8 + (double positive) cell stages, whereas T cell activation and adhesion are impaired. Hem 1 -deficient neutrophils fail to migrate in response to chemotactic agents and are deficient {{in their ability to}} phagocytose bacteria. Remarkably, some Rac-dependent functions, such as Th 1 differentiation and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) –dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines proceed normally <b>in</b> <b>Hem</b> 1 -deficient mice, whereas the production of Th 17 cells are enhanced. These results demonstrate that Hem 1 is essential for hematopoietic cell development, function, and homeostasis by controlling a distinct pathway leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, whereas NF-κB–dependent transcription proceeds independently of Hem 1 and F-actin polymerization...|$|R
