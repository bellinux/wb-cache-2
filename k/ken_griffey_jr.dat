5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day {{and it would}} be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.</b> spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Rick Monday became MLB's {{first draft}} pick after being {{selected}} by the Kansas City Athletics. Royce Lewis is the most recent first overall pick; he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 2017. Overall, 23 of the 50 picks before 2015 {{have participated in the}} All-Star Game, and three (Bob Horner, Darryl Strawberry, and Bryce Harper) have won the Rookie of the Year Award. Twenty-five of the fifty picks before 2015 have been drafted from high schools, one has been drafted out of the Independent American Association, and the others were drafted from universities. To date, Arizona State University and Vanderbilt University are the only schools from which multiple number-one overall draft picks have been chosen. No first overall pick was inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame until 2016, when <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.</b> was inducted with a record 99.3% of votes cast.|$|E
5|$|In {{the bottom}} half of the inning, Yankees ace Jack McDowell, who had entered the game in the 9th inning for a rare relief appearance, faced Joey Cora, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.,</b> and Edgar Martínez—the second, third, and fourth batters in the Mariners' order, respectively. Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line and reached first base safely on an infield hit. Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call, believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines; however, the umpires' ruling stood. Center fielder Griffey singled to short right-center field, {{allowing}} Cora to reach third base. Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left field line, scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with the winning run. The Mariners' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey, Martinez, and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise's first ever playoff series victory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> <b>Jr.'s</b> number 24 was retired at the {{beginning}} of the 2016 season, with the retirement ceremony taking place on August 6, 2016. Griffey had been elected to the Hall of Fame in January of that year.|$|R
50|$|Eric Steven King (born April 10, 1964) is {{a former}} pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB).

Those teams are the Detroit Tigers (1986-1988 and 1992), Chicago White Sox (1989-1990) and Cleveland Indians (1991).|$|R
5|$|Australia {{was based}} in Peoria, Arizona—the site of the Seattle Mariners spring {{training}} camp—for their preparation for the formal start of their 2009 campaign. Unlike 2006, {{in which they had}} one exhibition game, they competed against three different Major League clubs: the Seattle Mariners, the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago White Sox. Their game against Seattle was <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.'s</b> first game playing for the Mariners since October 1999, and was also their first victory as part of a World Baseball Classic tour.|$|R

5|$|The most Gold Gloves {{ever won}} by one player is 18 by pitcher Greg Maddux. He won 13 {{consecutive}} awards from 1990 to 2002, {{all in the}} National League. Brooks Robinson has the most wins as a third baseman, with 16 Gold Gloves, and is tied for the second-highest total overall with pitcher Jim Kaat, who won his 16 awards consecutively. Iván Rodríguez has won the most Gold Gloves as a catcher, with 13 career awards in the American League. Ozzie Smith has 13 wins at shortstop; he and Rodríguez are tied for the fourth-highest total among all winners. Among outfielders, Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays, who played primarily right field and center field, respectively, are tied for the lead with 12 Gold Gloves. Keith Hernandez, the leader at first base, has won 11 times, and Roberto Alomar leads second basemen with 10 wins. Other players with 10 or more wins include shortstop Omar Vizquel (11), catcher Johnny Bench (10), third baseman Mike Schmidt (10), and outfielders <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> <b>Jr.,</b> Ichiro Suzuki, Andruw Jones, and Al Kaline (10 each).|$|E
5|$|As an {{exception}} to the retired-number policy, MLB began honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, which is an annual observance that started in 2004. For the 60th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. The gesture was originally the idea of outfielder <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.,</b> who sought Rachel Robinson's permission to wear the number. After receiving her permission, Commissioner Bud Selig not only allowed Griffey to wear the number, but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same. Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson's number 42. On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics. In 2009, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, and umpires) wore number 42 on April 15.|$|E

5|$|Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season {{home run}} record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and finally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are {{tied for the}} widest margin of victory for a home run {{champion}} as he topped the next highest total by 35 home runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years until Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years later by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record chase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also has the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in 2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs – Greg Vaughn, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.,</b> Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez, Luis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs 42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major league was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in 1878.|$|E
5|$|The National League {{got things}} {{started in the}} bottom of the first when José Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and {{proceeded}} to steal second. He scored on an RBI single by <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.</b> to give the NL a 1–0 lead. Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for {{in the bottom of}} the third when, with Reyes on second, he lofted a high fly ball to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordóñez. The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a two-out single by Iván Rodríguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning. The AL would score one inning later when, after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts, Ichiro Suzuki hit a long fly ball off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what became the first and only inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history. The homer gave the AL a 2–1 lead and resulted in Ichiro's MVP win.|$|E

50|$|The Indians' second veteran Orel Hershiser {{was called}} upon {{to stem the tide}} against Tim Belcher. Both {{pitchers}} dueled for four innings until the Indians broke through {{in the top of the}} fifth with a two-run single by Carlos Baerga. In the next inning, the Indians grabbed two more on a Manny Ramírez homer and an RBI triple by Sandy Alomar, <b>Jr..</b> <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.'s</b> sixth postseason homer put the Mariners on the board to make it 4-1 in the bottom of the sixth. The Indians would put the game away when Manny Ramírez hit his second homer of the game in the eighth to make it 5-1. Hershiser would give way to José Mesa in the ninth. Mesa would issue a one-out solo homer to Jay Buhner but would recover to close out the win.|$|R
50|$|Game 5 was a matchup between Chris Bosio and Orel Hershiser. Hershiser {{was looking}} to {{continue}} his excellence and he got {{off to the right}} start when the Indians knocked home a run in the first thanks to an error by Tino Martinez. But Hershiser's slim lead would be cut in the third when <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.'s</b> RBI double tied the game. In the fifth, an error by Albert Belle gave the Mariners the lead. The Mariners were closing in on a 3-2 lead going home but the Indians wouldn't allow it as Jim Thome stepped to the plate in the sixth with a man on and hit a two-run homer to give the Indians the lead back. The Mariners had their share of chances. In the seventh, they had men on the corners with one out and <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.</b> at the plate. Paul Assenmacher was summoned from the bullpen. He proceeded to strike out Griffey on a high fastball as the crowd cheered, and the camera showed his wife going crazy. Then Jay Buhner stepped to the plate. Normally manager Mike Hargrove would bring in a right-hander, but he stayed with Assenmacher. He struck out Buhner on a low breaking ball and then slowly, stoically walked off the mound, head down, somber expression, with 40,000 fans screaming wildly. The Mariners could never capitalize on any more opportunities and José Mesa closed the door in the ninth.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} memorable moments of Griffeys career with the Mariners came during the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the New York Yankees. After losing the first two games, the Mariners and Griffey {{were on the verge of}} elimination, but came back to win the next two games, setting up a decisive fifth game. In the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 5, with Griffey on first base, {{teammate}} Edgar Martínez hit a double. Griffey raced around the bases, slid into home with the winning run, and popped up into the waiting arms of the entire team. The 1995 AL Division Series would kick off a brief rivalry between the Yankees and the Mariners. Griffey may have escalated it by saying that he would never play for the Yankees, because the Yankees allegedly treated his father, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Sr. badly. Also, when Griffey was a kid visiting his dad in the Yankee clubhouse, Yankee manager Billy Martin would, believing that children did not belong in the clubhouse, kick him out of there. Although the Mariners subsequently lost the ALCS to the Cleveland Indians (managed by later Mariners manager Mike Hargrove), that moment remains one {{of the most}} memorable in Mariners history, capping a season that [...] "saved baseball in Seattle", Seattles improbable late season playoff run that year, spurred by the return of Griffey from injury, led to the construction of Safeco Field and the future security of a franchise rumored for years to be on the move. The play also inspired the title of the video game <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> <b>Jr.s</b> Winning Run for the Super NES.|$|R

50|$|Scott Kamieniecki faced Chris Bosio in Game 4. The Yankees {{came out}} {{swinging}} {{in the first}} as they put three runs on the board on a sac fly and a two-run single by Don Mattingly. In the third, the Yanks got two more on Paul O'Neill's two-run homer. Bosio was finished, pitching only two-plus innings. The Yankees were poised to take the series but the Mariners would refuse to go quietly again. In {{the bottom of the}} third, Edgar Martínez's three-run homer energized the crowd and gave the Mariners new life. Later in the inning, Luis Sojo's sac fly would make it a one-run game. In the fifth, Mattingly's error allowed the Mariners to tie the game and complete a five-run comeback. Then in the sixth, with Sterling Hitchcock pitching, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> <b>Jr.'s</b> homer gave the Mariners a 6-5 edge. In the eighth, Norm Charlton's wild pitch allowed the Yankees to tie the game at six. John Wetteland was called on to keep the game tied for the Yankees, but he would load the bases with nobody out for Edgar Martínez. Martinez would then hit a grand slam, giving him seven RBIs and the Mariners a 10-6 lead. Then Jay Buhner's homer later in the inning put the Mariners on top 11-6. The Yankees, however, refused to die and scratched out two runs. They would put the tying run at the plate in the person of Bernie Williams, but Williams would fly out to center to set up Game 5.|$|R
5000|$|Rose's best {{minor league}} season was in 1997 at Chattanooga, for the Chattanooga Lookouts, at age 27.

Later that year, Rose was {{called up to}} the Cincinnati Reds for his first and only time in the major leagues. He hit only [...]143 in just 11 games for the Reds, but was widely shown on popular sports {{highlight}} shows when he copied his dad's famous crouching batting stance during the first pitch of his first Major League at-bat.

5000|$|In January 1988, Griffey, {{at the age}} of 18, {{attempted}} to commit suicide by swallowing 277 aspirin pills but wound up in intensive care in Providence Hospital in Mount Airy, Ohio. <b>Griffey</b> <b>Jr.</b> cited arguments with his father, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Sr.; depression; and anger as reasons for his attempted suicide. On his failed attempt, <b>Griffey</b> <b>Jr.</b> stated, [...] "It seemed like everyone was yelling at me in baseball, then I came home and everyone was yelling at me there. I got depressed. I got angry. I didn't want to live." [...] He stated that he had also previously contemplated taking his own life, but he had not acted on it until this incident. After Griffey swallowed the aspirin, his girlfriend's mother drove him to the hospital. While in intensive care, he ripped the IV from his arm in order to stop an argument between him and his father. Both <b>Griffey</b> <b>Jr.</b> and his father have stated that the incident changed their relationship, and there is now more understanding on both sides.|$|R
