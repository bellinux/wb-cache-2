40|$|ABSTRACT: Spirometry and maximal {{respiratory}} {{pressures are}} pulmonary function parameters {{commonly used to}} evaluate respiratory function. Prediction values are available for conventional lung function devices using a standard tube or <b>flanged</b> <b>type</b> of mouthpiece connection. This equipment is not suitable for patients with facial or buccal muscle weakness, because of air leakage around the mouthpiece. A face mask {{was used for the}} portable lung function devices used in the neuromuscular department. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the face mask and the conventional mouthpiece for the measurement of spirometry and of respiratory pressures in 22 healthy subjects. Values obtained with the conventional mouthpiece differed significantly from values obtained with the face mask. With the mask, forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second were 200 mL lower, and maximal expiratory pressure was 3. 2 kPa lower than with the mouthpiece. Subsequently, new prediction values for face mask spirometry and maximal respiratory pressures were obtained from 252 other healthy subjects, from which new prediction equations were derived. It was concluded that the face mask connection to the lung function device is a valid alternative, is easy to use and is most useful to monitor changes in patients. This study confirms the importance of appropriate prediction equations, depending on subject-instrument interfaces...|$|E

50|$|From 1935, all the ex Class 14B {{locomotives}} except no. 1750 were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14R. Only slight modifications {{were found}} {{necessary to take}} the new boilers. In the process, the engines were also equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of the original cabs. The flangeless leading coupled wheels were <b>flanged</b> and <b>Type</b> MR tenders were attached to the reboilered engines. No. 1750 was sold to ISCOR without being reboilered.|$|R

40|$|A {{human factors}} {{experiment}} employed a hemi-anechoic sound {{field in which}} listeners were required to localize a vehicular backup alarm warning signal (both a standard and a frequency-augmented alarm) in 360 -degrees azimuth in pink noise of 60 dBA and 90 dBA. Measures of localization performance included: (1) percentage correct localization, (2) percentage of right [...] left localization errors, (3) percentage of front-rear localization errors, and (4) localization absolute deviation in degrees from the alarm′s actual location. In summary, the data demonstrated that, with some exceptions, normal hearing listeners′ ability to localize the backup alarm in 360 -degrees azimuth did not improve when wearing augmented hearing protectors (including dichotic sound transmission earmuffs, flat attenuation earplugs, and level-dependent earplugs) as compared to when wearing conventional passive earmuffs or earplugs of the foam or <b>flanged</b> <b>types.</b> Exceptions were that in the 90 dBA pink noise, the flat attenuation earplug yielded significantly better accuracy than the polyurethane foam earplug and both the dichotic and the custom-made diotic electronic sound transmission earmuffs. However, the flat attenuation earplug showed no benefit over the standard pre-molded earplug, the arc earplug, and the passive earmuff. Confusions of front-rear alarm directions were most significant in the 90 dBA noise condition, wherein two types of triple-flanged earplugs exhibited significantly fewer front-rear confusions than either of the electronic muffs. On all measures, the diotic sound transmission earmuff resulted in the poorest localization {{of any of the}} protectors {{due to the fact that}} its single-microphone design did not enable interaural cues to be heard. Localization was consistently more degraded in the 90 dBA pink noise as compared with the relatively quiet condition of the 60 dBA pink noise. A frequency-augmented backup alarm, which incorporated 400 Hz and 4000 Hz components to exploit the benefits of interaural phase and intensity cues respectively, slightly but significantly improved localization compared with the standard, more narrow-bandwidth backup alarm, and these results have implications for the updating of backup alarm standards...|$|R
40|$|After {{only one}} year of operation, thermowells in feed gas supply {{pipeline}} at a natural gas production plant was failed due to fatigue damage accelerated by improper thermowell design for the current operation. It is believed that thermowell configuration having a neck acted as local stress raiser played a remarkable role in initiation of fatigue damage. Besides, the medium flow past a thermowell causes vortices to be shed at a frequency, termed the wake frequency, proportional to the flow velocity. If the wake frequency is {{at or near the}} natural frequency of thermowell, a resonance condition may occur where massive amounts of energy are absorbed by the thermowell, resulting in very high stresses and possible failure. The problem was solved by using modified thermowell configuration to minimize both stress concentration and resonance. In this regard, a thermowell having a continuous low-gradient slope (truncated conical-type thermowell) was used since it has a higher natural frequency and a lower stress concentration in comparison with the failed one that was <b>flanged,</b> straight <b>type</b> thermowell...|$|R
