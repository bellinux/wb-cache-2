5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family, and the type species of the genus Clathrus. It is {{commonly}} known as the latticed stinkhorn, the basket stinkhorn, or the red cage, alluding to the striking fruit bodies that are shaped somewhat like a round or oval hollow sphere with interlaced or latticed branches. The fungus is saprobic, feeding off decaying woody plant material, and is often found alone or in groups in leaf litter on <b>garden</b> <b>soil,</b> grassy places, or on woodchip garden mulches. Although considered primarily a European species, C.ruber has been introduced to other areas, and now has a wide distribution that includes northern Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. The species was illustrated in the scientific literature during the 16th century, but was not officially described until 1729.|$|E

500|$|The Anderson {{family was}} the first to settle the land that was to become the village of Burnside. They brought with them good {{character}} testimonials from Scotland, valuable farming experience and 3000pounds; however, the farming patterns in Scotland differed greatly from those in the antipodes, and the family failed to adapt. The Andersons moved on to Morphett Vale in 1847, selling their land and abandoning their homestead. The buyer of the Anderson land, William Randell, soon decided to build a village in his new property in 1849. He hired surveyor and planner Nathan Hailes to lay out the new village. Hailes was both surprised and disappointed when he found that it had already been settled and left—especially since the growth and adaptation of European foliage to the area. The first villages to be established in the region, those of Glen Osmond, Magill and Kensington had existed for some time when the new village of Burnside was proclaimed. The new village was in a good position to grow; it was bounded by two major thoroughfares, Burnside (now Glynburn) and Greenhill Roads, and had the advantage of lying on Second Creek. The village was soon attracting residents; some of whom were wealthy Adelaide folk building an estate in the foothills, and others who were more concerned with working the land. The village was described in advertisements by Hailes in 1850 as [...] "Burnside the Beautiful" [...] with advantages of [...] "perpetual running water, extensive and diversified view, rich <b>garden</b> <b>soil</b> and good building stone ..." [...] with a [...] "... direct, newly-opened and unblemished route to Adelaide".|$|E
2500|$|The ebony spleenwort is {{sometimes}} grown as a terrarium or garden plant. It can be cultivated in sandy peat, subacid <b>garden</b> <b>soil,</b> other gravelly, sandy or gritty soils, or potting mix under moist to dry conditions. Both acid and alkaline soils are acceptable. Good drainage is essential, and the species will grow even in dry soil. Partial sun or low to high light is recommended, although full shade is tolerated. Plants {{are said to}} be easy to maintain once they have become established, but it has been described as [...] "rather difficult" [...] to grow in Germany. Conrad Loddiges found it necessary to use artificial heat to cultivate ebony spleenwort in Great Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Over time, raw pu'er acquires an earthy flavor due to slow {{oxidation}} and other, possibly microbial processes. However, this oxidation is not {{analogous to}} the oxidation that results in green, oolong, or black tea, because the process is not catalyzed by the plant's own enzymes but rather by fungal, bacterial, or autooxidation influences. Pu'er flavors can change dramatically {{over the course of}} the aging process, resulting in a brew tasting strongly earthy but clean and smooth, reminiscent of the smell of rich <b>garden</b> <b>soil</b> or an autumn leaf pile, sometimes with roasted or sweet undertones.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is the {{assessment}} of the concentration, toxicity and phytoavailability of heavy metals in <b>garden</b> <b>soils</b> in the vicinity of three mines (A, B and C) in South of Morocco by using concurrently selective chemical extractions, MetPLATE™ a toxicity bioassay and plant growth experiments. The tailings materials containing very high concentrations of Mn, Cu and Co in mine A, Co, Mn, Cr and Ni in mine B and Cu and Zn in mine C. The high toxicity of tailings from mine C (86. 7 % inhibition) and moderate toxicity of tailings from mine B (51. 0 % inhibition) were mainly due to the relative high concentrations of soluble Cu and Zn. Nevertheless, the low metal toxicity observed in most <b>garden</b> <b>soils</b> was confirmed by the low metal concentrations in the soil water extracts. In all <b>garden</b> <b>soils,</b> Lactuca sativa L. and Lolium multiflorum L. contained in their shoots Cd, Co, Cr, Cu and Ni below toxic concentrations while Zn (in all soils) and Mn in two soils from mine A were accumulated at concentrations high enough to be considered phytotoxic. The low biomass produced on <b>garden</b> <b>soils</b> in the vicinity of mines B and C is explained by the relative low toxicity compared to mine A. Transfer factor values for Zn were higher than those found for Mn for both plant species, confirming that this element is present at lower bioavailable fraction in soil than Zn...|$|R

60|$|The spot at {{the bottom}} of the garden where she had been {{accustomed}} to climb the wall to meet Matthaus, was the only inch of English ground in which she took any interest; and in spite of the disagreeable haze prevailing she walked out there till she reached the well-known corner. Every blade of grass was weighted with little liquid globes, and slugs and snails had crept out upon the plots. She could hear the usual faint noises from the camp, and in the other direction the trot of farmers on the road to the town, for it was market-day. She observed that her frequent visits to this corner had quite trodden down the grass in the angle of the wall, and left marks of <b>garden</b> <b>soil</b> on the stepping-stones by which she had mounted to look over the top. Seldom having gone there till dusk, she had not considered that her traces might be visible by day. Perhaps it was these which had revealed her trysts to her father.|$|E
40|$|Purpose This study {{explores the}} effect of varying organic matter content on the {{potential}} human health risk of consuming vegetables grown in urban <b>garden</b> <b>soils.</b> Materials and methods Metal accumulation among edible tissues of green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and carrot (Daucus carota L.) was determined for plants grown in five urban <b>garden</b> <b>soils</b> amended with 0, 9, or 25 % (v/v) compost. Potential risk to human health was assessed by calculating a bioconcentration factor and a hazard quotient. Results and discussion Overall, the consumption of lettuce and green bean pods grown in some urban gardens posed a potential human health risk due to unacceptably high concentrations of cadmium or lead. In many cases, compost amendment increased the accumulation of metals in the vegetables. Even in soils considered uncontaminated by current guidelines, some hazard quotients exceeded the threshold value of 1. The compost {{used in this study}} had a high fulvic acid to humic acid ratio, which may explain increased concentrations of metals in plants grown in compost-amended soils. Conclusions These results indicate a need to include soil characteristics, specifically organic matter quality, when setting threshold criteria for metal content of urban <b>garden</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R

60|$|And yet, {{while the}} empty heaven {{was full of}} silent catastrophe, the height of human {{buildings}} above which they sat held {{here and there a}} tiny trivial noise that was the exact antithesis; and they heard some six streets below a newsboy calling, and a bell bidding to chapel. They could also hear talk out of the garden below; and realized that the irrepressible Smith must have followed Gould downstairs, for his eager and pleading accents could be heard, followed by the half-humourous protests of Miss Duke and the full and very youthful laughter of Rosamund Hunt. The air had that cold kindness that comes after a storm. Michael Moon drank it in with as serious a relish as he had drunk the little bottle of cheap claret, which he had emptied almost at a draught. Inglewood went on eating ginger very slowly and with a solemnity unfathomable as the sky above him. There was still enough stir in the freshness of the atmosphere to make them almost fancy they could smell the <b>garden</b> <b>soil</b> and the last roses of autumn. Suddenly there came from the darkening room a silvery ping and pong which told them that Rosamund had brought out the long-neglected mandoline. After the first few notes there was more of the distant bell-like laughter.|$|E
60|$|And now at last Mr. Moore quitted the mill-yard, {{and bent}} his steps to his dwelling-house. It {{was only a}} short {{distance}} from the factory, but the hedge and high bank {{on each side of the}} lane which conducted to it seemed to give it something of the appearance and feeling of seclusion. It was a small, whitewashed place, with a green porch over the door; scanty brown stalks showed in the <b>garden</b> <b>soil</b> near this porch, and likewise beneath the windows--stalks budless and flowerless now, but giving dim prediction of trained and blooming creepers for summer days. A grass plat and borders fronted the cottage. The borders presented only black mould yet, except where, in sheltered nooks, the first shoots of snowdrop or crocus peeped, green as emerald, from the earth. The spring was late; it had been a severe and prolonged winter; the last deep snow had but just disappeared before yesterday's rains; on the hills, indeed, white remnants of it yet gleamed, flecking the hollows and crowning the peaks; the lawn was not verdant, but bleached, as was the grass on the bank, and under the hedge in the lane. Three trees, gracefully grouped, rose beside the cottage. They were not lofty, but having no rivals near, they looked well and imposing where they grew. Such was Mr. Moore's home--a snug nest for content and contemplation, but one within which the wings of action and ambition could not long lie folded.|$|E
60|$|But, on {{the other}} hand, the schools of the modern period have {{developed}} masses of instruction that {{were not to be}} found in the schools of the past. The school has reached downward and taken over, systematized, and on the whole, I think, improved that preliminary training of the senses and the observation that was once left to the spontaneous activity of the child among its playmates and at home. The kindergarten department of a school is a thing added to the old conception of schooling, a conversion of the all too ample school hours to complete and rectify the work of the home, to make sure of the foundation of sense impressions and elementary capabilities upon which the edifice of schooling is to rise. In America it has grown, as a wild flower transferred to the unaccustomed richness of <b>garden</b> <b>soil</b> will sometimes do, rankly and in relation to the more essential schooling, aggressively, and become a highly vigorous and picturesque weed. One must bear in mind that Froebel's original thought was rather of the mother than of the schoolmistress, a fact the kindergarten invaders of the school find it convenient to forget. I believe we shall be carrying out his intentions as well as the manifest dictates of common sense if we do all in our power by means of simply and clearly written books for nurses and mothers to shift very much of the kindergarten back to home and playroom and out of the school altogether. Correlated with this development, there has been a very great growth in our schools of what is called manual training and of the teaching of drawing. Neither of these subjects entered into the school idea of any former period, so far as my not very extensive knowledge of educational history goes.|$|E

It was possible, to associate most of the results to a) special types of regions e. g. urban or rural areas and b) locations without resp. with specific causes of loadings. Zinc, lead, cadmium and copper in <b>garden</b> <b>soils</b> are the wide spread heavy metals with higher concentrations than in arable soils.
