40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{experimentally}} determine the air flow through the cooling module (air-conditioning condenser plus engine radiator) of a Ford Windstar minivan when the van is operated {{at a fraction of}} a vehicle length behind a lead van. Pressures and temperatures are measured across the cooling module while the vans are in operation, and a standard calibration relates the pressure drop to the flow velocity through the cooling module. The Windstars are connected in tandem and driven on a test track at spacings of 0. 22, 0. 28, 0. 38, 0. 62, 0. 88, and 1. 0, expressed as fractions of the Windstar length. For the purposes of the test, an override switch is installed to allow the close-following van to be operated either with both cooling fans remaining on or with both fans disabled. Air flow is expressed either as a volume flow, in cubic meters per second, or as the fraction of the flow for a van operating in isolation at the same forward speed. With both fans disabled, the air flow is approximately twenty per cent of the <b>isolation</b> <b>value</b> at the shortest spacing, and increases to about sixty per cent at a spacing of one vehicle length. With both fans operating, the air flow is approximately fifty per cent of the <b>isolation</b> <b>value</b> at the shortest separation, and increases to about seventy per cent at one vehicle length separation. These represent substantial decreases in air flow, and will result in a diminished operating envelope for the vehicle in close-following.

40|$|Abstract—Finite-ground {{coplanar}} (FGC) waveguide {{lines on}} top of polyimide layers are frequently used to construct three-dimensional Si–SiGe monolithic microwave/millimeter-wave integrated circuits on silicon substrates. Requirements for high-density, low-cost, and compact RF front ends on silicon can lead, however, to high crosstalk between FGC lines and overall circuit performance degradation. This paper presents theoretical and experimental results and associated design guidelines for FGC line coupling on both high- and low-resistivity silicon wafers with a polyimide overlay. It is shown that a gap as small as 6 m between two adjacent FGC lines can reduce crosstalk by at least 10 dB, {{that the nature of}} the coupling mechanism {{is not the same as}} with microstrip lines on polyimide layers, and that the coupling is not dependent on the Si resistivity.

The HCN force field is in good agreement with a recent experimentally derived force field and also with the force field recently computed by Wong and Bacskay.

It is commonly thought that genetic differentiation measures, such as GST and D, should be near zero when allele frequencies {{are close to}} their expected value in panmictic populations, and close to one when they are close to their expected value in isolated populations.

In particular, we show that D captures well the variations of genetic diversity when mutation is weak, otherwise it overestimates it when panmixia is not met. GST detects population differentiation when mutation is intermediate but has a low sensitivity to the variations of genetic diversity when mutation is weak. When mutation is strong the domain of sensitivity of both measures are altered. Finally, we also point out the importance of the number of populations on genetic differentiation measures, and provide recommendations for the use of GST and D...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Parallel genetic {{algorithms}} (PGAs) have been traditionally used {{to overcome the}} intense use of CPU and memory that serial GAs show in complex problems. Non-parallel GAs can be classified into two classes: panmictic and structured-population algorithms. The difference lies in whether any individual in the population can mate with any other one or not. In this work, they are both considered as two reproductive loop types executed in the islands of a parallel distributed GA. Our aim is to extend the existing studies from more conventional sequential islands to other kinds of evolution. A key issue in such a coarse grain PGA is the migration policy, since it governs the exchange of individuals among the islands. This paper investigates the influence of migration frequency and migrant selection in a ring of islands running either steady-state, generational, or cellular GAs. A diversity analysis is also offered from an entropy point of view. The study uses different problem types, namely easy, deceptive, multimodal, NP-Complete, and epistatic search landscapes {{in order to provide}} a wide spectrum of problem difficulties to support the results. Large <b>isolation</b> <b>values</b> and random selection of the migrants are demonstrated as providing a larger probability of success and a smaller number of visited points. Also, interesting observations on the relative performance of the different models are offered, as well as we point out the considerable benefits that can accrue from asynchronous migration.

The value for {{the average number of}} requests supported by each item was initially set to zero (0) for all items. This value is updated in the problem instance by solving the QN model each time the workload changes. This updated instance is then solved by the metaheuristic to obtain optimal solutions for deploying components to the cloud. The values of a component’s consumption of CPU, ram, disk capacity, and bandwidth (i.e., the weights) were generated in the interval [1 - 9].|$|R
40|$|An initial assay of Wu and Min lexical tone sandhi opens {{inquiry into}} a {{possible}} source : Austronesian pitch accent, {{and into a}} sandhi origin for the "third" tone (qu/ departing). One important element in such an assay is the feature Right/Left : focus = preservation, stress, retention, etc, towards the Right or towards the Left. Northern Wu appears to be focus Left, and destressing seems to be spreading in the area. Southern Wu and Min are focus Right. Southern Wu focus does not prevent some Right mergers, and often {{it is the last}} two syllables acting together that is the focus. Northern Min shows similarities to Southern Wu, but Southern Min can be said to have no tone sandhi at all : The Amoy et al tone circles appear to be artifacts of changes in <b>isolation</b> <b>values,</b> since they are virtual reconstructions of the probable prototone values. The one Eakka dialect examined appears to be like Northern Min/Southern Wu. On the basis of this assay, I would hazard the guess that {{in the study of the}} origin of lexical tone sandhi, Southern Min should be classified with the Cantonese/ Thai type, Northern Wu as a separate type heavily influenced by Mandarin, and Southern Wu/Northern Min as the preservation of the oldest, most Austronesianoid type of sandhi. Further speculation would be foolhardly until more information is available and more detailed comparisons and histories are drawn up. Ballard William.
