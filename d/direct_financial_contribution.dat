40|$|Events {{are part}} of the {{attraction}} of a destination and as such {{should be included in the}} integrated marketing for the destination and incorporated into a destination 2 ̆ 7 s branding strategy. This implies the need to evaluate the contribution of an event not just in terms of the <b>direct</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contribution</b> that it generates but also in terms of its consistency with the destination brand values. Consistency as an evaluation criteria concerns how (and if) the interrelationships among the elements of the marketing mix enhance destination brand equity. This paper uses content analysis to demonstrate the importance of incorporating consistency as an evaluation criterion of an event. In particular, the results of a content analysis performed using Australian newspaper articles from 1998 - 2005 show that the set of negative association related to Schoolies week appears to be inconsistent with the brand values of the Gold Coast as expressed in the brand 2 ̆ 7 VeryGC 2 ̆ 7...|$|E
40|$|Relatively {{rare in the}} Netherlands. The {{public sector}} has {{traditionally}} {{played a central role}} in spatial planning and development. Since the 1980 s, however, local authorities have been sharing the responsibility for urban development with the private sector. This article explores the viability of claims drawn from the literature about the effects of private sector involvement in redeveloped public space. Confronting those claims with our empirical material, we expected to find that the participation of the private sector would increase the redevelopment budget but would also lead to restrictions on public access. These two expectations are evaluated in light of the experience in four redeveloped squares in four Dutch cities: Rotterdam, Dordrecht, Enschede and ’s-Hertogenbosch. We found that actors on the public and private sides have different interpretations of what constitutes a <b>direct</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contribution.</b> Those from the private sector believe they have made significant contributions, while those from the public sector see themselves as the sole funders. But they agree on the issue of free access: both public and private actors deny any negative effects of private sector involvement in this respect...|$|E

50|$|This first {{effort at}} wide-ranging reform {{resulted}} in the Tillman Act of 1907. Named for its sponsor, South Carolina Senator Ben Tillman, the Tillman Act prohibited corporations and nationally chartered (interstate) banks from making <b>direct</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> to federal candidates. However, weak enforcement mechanisms made the Act ineffective. Disclosure requirements and spending limits for House and Senate candidates followed in 1910 and 1911. General contribution limits were enacted in the Federal Corrupt Practices Act (1925). An amendment to the Hatch Act of 1939 set an annual ceiling of $3 million for political parties' campaign expenditures and $5,000 for individual campaign contributions. The Smith-Connally Act (1943) and Taft-Hartley Act (1947) extended the corporate ban to labor unions.|$|R
40|$|Multinational {{enterprises}} (MNEs) {{have played}} {{a vital role in}} the economies of developing countries. However, empirical studies on some crucial aspects of MNE involment in these economies appear to be inadequate. One such aspect is their financing pattern. This paper attempts to shed some light on this aspect through an analysis of balance sheet data of a sample of MNE affiliates operating in the manufacturing sector of Sri Lanka. The findings do not support the generally held view that MNEs gear themselves more highly than local firms and that they make use of a greater degree of domestic commercial bank credit. Further, the study reveals that the <b>direct</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> of parent companies to equity capital of their affiliates are very small, indicating a low level of direct foreign inflow of capital into the host country.

The EEF funded many early research efforts, including the creation of the Harry Benjamin Foundation, the early work of the Johns Hopkins University and numerous other important research projects. It developed and maintained an extensive referral list of service providers throughout the US and in several other locales. During the years 1964-1970 and 1972-1975 alone, the EEF donated approximately US $250,000 to the support of projects about transsexualism. In particular, the Harry Benjamin Foundation received over US $60,000 during 1964-1968 and the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic received approximately US $72,000 during the formative years of 1967-1973.|$|R

The foundation gives <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> to a {{wide range}} of charitable causes, and is the second largest shareholder of the financial services company DNB. The foundation's capital is a result of accumulated profits from the former savings banks which are now part of DNB. In addition to giving <b>direct</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contributions,</b> the Savings Bank Foundation invests in causes that benefit the general public. In 2005, they founded the instrument fund, Dextra Musica, with the aim to promote classical music. The fund owns a valuable collection of string instruments which have been placed at the disposal of Norwegian musicians. Furthermore, the foundation invests in fine art which is being exhibited at art museums in Norway. In 2016, the foundation opened Sentralen, a house for the performing arts and a gathering place for social and cultural innovation in the center of Oslo. The building originally served as the headquarters for Christiania Sparebank, which the Savings Bank Foundation DNB sprung out of. Sentralen contains several stages and production spaces as well as a restaurant and café.|$|R

Dolphins are large brained,long-lived mammals with extended developmental periods, complex social lives, a large variety of foraging techniques, and intricate vocal emissions; consequently, they need to engage incognitive tasks, and they respond well to them. Our tasks have been designed for scientifically valid data collection focused mostly on questions relating to echoic object recognition, communication, and imitation/synchrony. The results {{have been published in}} peer-reviewed research journals and are summarized here. Data collection occurs in front of the public and appears to create a connection between the visitors and the dolphins. Through this program the dolphins under Disney’s care have been able to promote conservation via our publications, public education, the testing of new technologies, staff (veterinary, research, husbandry) support at in situ research sites, and <b>direct</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contributions.</b> The program may be a useful example for other public facilities housing dolphins...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the effects of}} decentralization on health financing and governance policies in Mexico {{from the perspective of}} users and providers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in four states that were selected according to geopolitical and administrative criteria. Four indicators were assessed: changes and effects on governance, financing sources and funds, the final destination of resources, and fund allocation mechanisms. Data collection was performed using in-depth interviews with health system key personnel and community leaders, consensus techniques and document analyses. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed by thematic segmentation. RESULTS: The results show different effectiveness levels for the four states regarding changes in financing policies and community participation. Effects on health financing after decentralization were identified in each state, including: greater participation of municipal and state governments in health expenditure, increased financial participation of households, greater community participation in low-income states, duality and confusion in the new mechanisms for coordination among the three government levels, absence of an accountability system, lack of human resources and technical skills to implement, monitor and evaluate changes in financing. CONCLUSIONS: In general, positive and negative effects of decentralization on health financing and governance were identified. The effects mentioned by health service providers and users were related to a diversification of financing sources, a greater margin for decisions around the use and final destination of financial resources and normative development for the use of resources. At the community level, <b>direct</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> were mentioned, as well as in-kind contributions, particularly in the form of community work...|$|R
5000|$|Lord Neuberger, dissenting in his {{reasoning}} (but {{not on the}} result of the 65 to 35 per cent split), advised against easy and frequent changes to law (especially by the judiciary rather than Parliament) that might give rise to new and unforeseen uncertainties and unfairnesses. He advocated the use of the resulting trust where evidence of factors other than <b>direct</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> were absent and expressed concern about imputing intentions to the parties rather than inferring their intentions in light of their actions and statements - the former involves concluding what the parties would have intended whereas the latter involves concluding what they did intend. Lord Neuberger held that there were no grounds for varying the 65/35 split which he believed originated on the acquisition of the property and the establishment of a resulting trust. He was of the opinion that nothing other than [...] "subsequent discussions, statements or actions, which can fairly be said to imply a positive intention to depart from that apportionment, will do to justify a change {{in the way in which}} the beneficial interest is owned." [...] He thought that the facts that they lived together for a long time, have been in a loving relationship, have children, operated a joint bank account and shared the outgoings of the household could not of themselves indicate an intention to vary this unequal split, and that even payments on decoration, repairs, utilities and council tax did not suffice on their own without evidence of an express agreement to vary their shares. He agreed that the appeal should be dismissed, though for different reasons than the majority.|$|R

40|$|In 2009 Rwanda {{introduced}} 9 Years Basic Education (9 YBE) {{and progress}} on access to primary education {{in recent years}} has been highly impressive. However, the challenges still faced by the Rwandan education system remain significant. These include the need to ensure adequate funding, improvements in quality and ensuring great equity. One key part of responding to these challenges requires an efficient and fair school funding system. School funding comes from either public or private sources – for example, parental contributions. These parental contributions can either be for indirect costs of schooling, such uniforms, or for direct costs in the form of financial payments to schools. This research assesses the impact on school funding of the <b>direct</b> <b>financial</b> parental <b>contributions</b> in two contrasting Rwandan Districts – one in a relatively better off urban area and one in a poorer rural area. It demonstrates a clear difference between the two areas. In the wealthier area, parental contributions more than double schools' non-salary spending. In contrast, in the rural area, voluntary parental contributions have a marginal impact on school budgets. These findings raise issues about both equity of funding and whether the Rwandan school system is helping to achieve greater equality of opportunity. The research suggests that schools with pupils with more need are actually worse funded than schools with pupils with less need. This acts against achieving greater equality of opportunity. It is important that the issue of school illegally turning pupils away because their parents do not make a <b>financial</b> <b>contribution</b> – something for which we find some evidence – is addressed. However, more fundamentally, the Rwandan government should develop a more targeted state funding system, with more funding being allocated to schools which have the highest levels of need and least ability to attract additional parental contributions.
