MethodsFrom May 1975 through October 2001, 590 single-disc valves (7 models) were used for <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement, and from November 1980 through July 2002, 1283 bileaflet valves (10 models) were used for <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement. Detailed follow-up was performed {{to a maximum of}} 27. 4 and 21. 9 years with a total of 6872 and 5811 patient-years for single-disc valves and bileaflet valves, respectively. Survival and valve-related events were analyzed. ResultsSingle-disc valves were mainly implanted from 1975 through 1995, whereas bileaflet valves were mainly implanted from 1987 through 2002; thus the years of concurrent use were 1987 through 1995. The bileaflet valve had a significantly lower explantation rate, whereas the single-disc valve had a significantly lower thromboembolism rate. No significant differences were detected in early mortality, long-term survival, and other valve-related complications. When limiting the comparison to the concurrent period of 1987 through 1995, no significant difference was detected in survival or in any valve-related complication.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} develop {{national}} benchmarks for valve replacement surgery by developing statistical risk models of operative mortality. BACKGROUNDNational risk models for {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery (CABG) have gained widespread acceptance, but there are no similar models for valve replacement surgery. METHODSThe Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Surgery Database was used to identify risk factors associated with valve surgery from 1994 through 1997. The population was drawn from 49, 073 patients undergoing <b>isolated</b> aortic <b>valve</b> replacement (AVR) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) and from 43, 463 patients undergoing CABG combined with AVR or MVR. Two multivariable risk models were developed: one for isolated AVR or MVR and one for CABG plus AVR or CABG plus MVR. RESULTSOperative mortality rates for AVR, MVR, combined CABG/AVR and combined CABG/MVR were 4. 00 %, 6. 04 %, 6. 80 % and 13. 29 %, respectively. The strongest independent risk factors were emergency/salvage procedures, recent infarction, reoperations and renal failure. The c-indexes were 0. 77 and 0. 74 for the <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement and combined CABG/valve replacement models, respectively. These models retained their predictive accuracy when applied to a prospective patient population undergoing operation from 1998 to 1999. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic was 10. 6 (p = 0. 225) for the <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement model and 12. 2 (p = 0. 141) for the CABG/valve replacement model.

40|$|BackgroundWe {{hypothesize that}} {{minimally}} invasive valve surgery {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease (CKD) is superior to a conventional median sternotomy. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1945 consecutive patients who underwent <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> surgery. Included were patients with CKD stages 2 to 5. In-hospital mortality, composite complication rates, and intensive care unit and total hospital lengths of stay of those who underwent a minimally invasive approach were compared with those who underwent a standard median sternotomy.

ResultsThere were 688 patients identified; 510 (74 %) underwent minimally invasive surgery, and 178 (26 %) underwent a median sternotomy. There {{was no significant difference}} in mortality. Minimally invasive surgery was associated with fewer composite complications (33. 1 % vs 49. 4 %; odds ratio, 0. 5; P ≤. 001), shorter intensive care unit (48 [interquartile range {IQR}, 33 - 74] hours vs 71 [IQR, 42 - 96] hours; P < . 01), and hospital (8 [IQR, 6 - 9] days vs 10 [IQR, 8 - 15] days; P < . 001) lengths of stay, and a lower incidence of acute kidney injury (8 % vs 14. 7 %; odds ratio, 0. 5; P = . 01), compared with median sternotomy.

40|$|ObjectivePrevious {{studies of}} the {{epidemiology}} of stroke in patients undergoing cardiac surgery have been based primarily on patients having coronary bypass surgery and therefore have limited applicability to the more heterogenous populations seen in the current era. We examine the epidemiology of stroke after cardiac surgery in a contemporary surgical population. MethodsRetrospective analysis was conducted of a prospective database of 5085 adults (coronary bypass 2401, <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> 1003, valve/coronary bypass 546, thoracic aorta 517, transplant/assist device 179, adult congenital 124, other 315) who had cardiac surgery at a single institution over a 6 -year period (1998 – 2004). ResultsStroke occurred in 134 (2. 6 %) patients. Incidence varied according to procedure (coronary bypass 1. 7 %, <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> 1. 8 %, valve/coronary bypass 4. 4 %, and ascending aorta 4. 6 %). Patients who had a stroke had a higher perioperative mortality rate than that of patients who did not (32. 8 % vs 4. 9 %; P <. 0001) and {{a longer period of}} hospitalization (median 30 days vs 7 days; P <. 0001).

Dilatation of the atrioventricular junction {{has been identified as}} a risk factor for repair failure, and we have used suture annuloplasty to correct atrioventricular junction enlargement. The objective was to compare the early results of aortic repair with and without annuloplasty. MethodsBetween November 1995 and January 12, a total of 559 patients were treated with bicuspid aortic valve repair for predominant regurgitation (n =  389), aortic aneurysm (n =  158), or acute dissection (n =  12). <b>Isolated</b> <b>valve</b> repair (aortic valve repair) was performed for aortic valve regurgitation with preserved aortic dimensions (n =  208) and sinotubular junction remodeling plus valve repair for aortic aneurysm and preserved root size (n =  116). Root remodeling was used for dilatation involving the root (n =  235). In 193 patients, dilatation of the atrioventricular junction (> 27 mm) was corrected with suture annuloplasty. ResultsHospital mortality was 0. 5 % (n =  3); 2 patients required pacemaker implantation. Reoperation was necessary for recurrent regurgitation (n =  54) or stenosis (n =  2); 10 -year freedom from reoperation was 82 % but was inferior after <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> repair (70 %, P = . 007) compared with the 2 other techniques. Application of suture annuloplasty improved 3 -year freedom from reoperation after isolated repair (84 %) to 92 % (P = . 07). In all groups, the proportion of patients with no or trivial regurgitation was significantly higher with annuloplasty. ConclusionsPreservation of the bicuspid aortic valve is feasible in many patients.

The incidence of postoperative AF in those who underwent a minimally invasive approach was compared with that of patients undergoing median sternotomy surgery. Resource utilization was approximated on the basis of intensive care unit and total hospital lengths of stay. ResultsA total of 571 patients were identified (413 minimally invasive and 158 median sternotomy). No significant differences in baseline characteristics existed between groups. The incidence of postoperative AF (25 % vs 37 %; P = . 002), use of intraoperative blood products (52 % vs 83 %; P < . 001), and prolonged intubation (≥ 24 hours) (12 % vs 20 %; P = . 008) were significantly less in the minimally invasive group. The intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were 45 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 28 - 66 hours) versus 53 hours (IQR, 45 - 91 hours) (P < . 001), and 5 days (IQR, 4 - 7 days) versus 8 days (IQR, 6 - 11 days) (P < . 001) for the minimally invasive and median sternotomy groups, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Autograft valve {{and root}} {{pathology}} {{is the leading}} cause of Ross procedure failure. To define risk and outcome of autograft valve/root repair at reoperation, a 17 -year experience was analysed. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-two consecutive late survivors underwent cross-sectional clinical and echocardiographic examin-ation on average 10. 8 ± 14. 7 years (range 0. 4 – 17) after Ross procedure. Study endpoints were hospital and late morbidity, freedom from autograft reoperation, freedom from root/valve replacement and functional outcome after valve/root repair. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (20 %) patients underwent 33 cardiac reoperations, the first on average 7. 7 ± 4. 5 years (range 0. 08 – 16. 2) after Ross operation. Nineteen had undergone root replacement, 5 inclusion cylinder and 3 subcoronary grafting. Indication was root path-ology in 17 (63 %) patients and <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> in 10. Surgery consisted in valve repair/sparing in 17 patients and valve/root replacement in 10, with no hospital mortality. Freedom from any autograft valve/root reoperation was 74 ± 5 % at 15 years. No patient with valve/root replacement required second reoperation. Instead, 6 / 17 (35 %) patients having autograft valve repair/sparing and followed for 4. 2 ± 2. 9 years (range 0. 3 – 10. 8) required re-repair/AVR, while 11 present mild AI or less. Freedom from autograft valve/root replacement was 83 ± 5 % at 15 years. At multivariate analysis, predictors of reoperation were age at Ross (P = 0. 002) and use of root technique (P = 0. 049).

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{systematic}} review seeks {{to present the}} outcomes of {{the natural history of}} aortopathy associated with bicuspid aortic valve (ABAV) and after interventions. BackgroundAortopathy is common in patients with ABAV, and early intervention has been proposed {{to reduce the risk of}} dissection. In asymptomatic patients, the timing of surgical management is based upon imaging of aortic size, but the actual threshold is based upon observational data and expert opinion. As evidence of high risk would justify early intervention, we sought to define the natural history of this condition and after interventions. MethodsWe undertook a systemic review of the evidence from observational studies of ABAV published up to June 2013. The primary outcome was annualized all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included acute aortic events, rates of aneurysm enlargement, and peri-operative complications. A random-effects model was used to combine outcomes. A meta-regression was undertaken to assess the impact of potential covariates. ResultsThe 32 eligible papers involved 11, 045 patients (9, 441 BAV and 1, 604 control subjects, age 46 ± 14 years). There were 3 major groups, nonoperated bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients (ages from 30 to 40 years), patients after aortic surgery (generally 40 to 60 years of age) and after <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement (> 60 years of age). The respective annualized mortality of nonoperated BAV patients was 0. 56 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 13 to 0. 99), compared with 0. 78 % (95 % CI: 0. 20 to 1. 36) in patients after aortic surgery and 2. 39 % (95 % CI: 1. 61 to 3. 16) after <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement. The annualized acute event rate in nonoperated BAV patients was 0. 29 % (95 % CI: 0. 23 to 0. 35), this risk being no different from that of a tricuspid aortic valve (risk ratio: 0. 68, 95 % CI: 0. 34 to 1. 36). In the post-surgical series, 30 -day mortality varied from 0 % to 2. 5 %, and the risk of acute events was 0. 16 % (95 % CI: 0. 0 to 0. 32) in patients after aortic surgery and 0. 68 % (95 % CI: 0. 42 to 0. 94) after <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement. Aortic dilation was at a rate of 0. 16  mm/year over 6 decades in healthy BAV subjects and 1. 1 ± 0. 15 mm/year in older aortic valve replacement patients. ConclusionsThe risk associated with ABAV varies according to age and clinical setting. Nonetheless, despite aortic dilatation, the acute aortic event risk of ABAV appears low in current practice. Decision-making regarding the timing of intervention needs to be made on the basis of the balance between this low risk and both the morbidity and mortality of surgery...|$|R

With a description of valve behavior, a feed-forward term can be implemented in the positional control loop of a hydraulically actuated robotic prototype. In order to <b>isolate</b> <b>valve</b> behavior, a test bed apparatus consisting of three separate hydraulic cylinders was constructed to decouple joint movement, and multiple tests were conducted, recording cylinder velocities given a constant pwm signal at a system pressure of 3. 45 MPa. After theoretically justifying the empirical results, a quadratic and bi-linear curve fit to the data provided a practical solution to an otherwise computationally expensive problem. by Abby Carey.
