5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E

Overall (age-adjusted) attendance of the breast cancer screening was 76 % <b>for</b> <b>women</b> aged 50 - 69.

5|$|Feminism in Russia {{originated}} in the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and mostly confined to the aristocracy. Throughout the 19thcentury, the idea of feminism remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20thcentury Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, shifted their focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants and factory workers. After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and nominal equality <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as income inequality and a greater burden of household work.
