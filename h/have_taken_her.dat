25|$|Dryad’s first {{commission}} {{ended on}} 26 April 1872, when Commander Parsons {{left her in}} Devonport. Normal practice of the time was for the ship's company to leave the ship upon decommissioning, {{with the exception of}} a few specialists, including the shipwright and gunner, who would have been accommodated in another vessel. The dockyard would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> in hand for a refit, and she would have recommissioned, with a new captain and crew, on completion.|$|E

At around 19:45, she was spotted by CCTV on a bus at Tveita, heading home. She ate dinner with her family before leaving to visit another friend. Giskegjerde Schjetne started walking home from her friend's home just before midnight, which was her curfew. The walk should <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> half an hour. When she did not arrive well after this time, the family notified the police.|$|E

Volt says they will <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> to the Mikado Building, and Kou calls Leann, {{learning}} there is a train heading for the building in thirty minutes. Leann promises she will back him up in her ship, the Orage. Kou, Sion and Volt catch the train, which is carrying rocket fuel for {{the launch of the}} satellite. On board, they meet Echidna, who is shocked to see Volt. They fight and defeat her, and she jumps from the train into a river.|$|E

25|$|McDernut {{joined the}} fast {{carriers}} again, 3 April, as they provided air {{support for the}} Okinawa campaign. In the screen of TG58.4, she participated in strikes on enemy installations, shipping, and troop concentrations in the Ryukyu Islands and Kyūshū. By 1 July the aircraft carriers were once again set to strike at the northern Japanese home islands. On 7 July McDermut was sent to intercept the Japanese hospital ship Takasago Maru and divert her from a course which would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> into the task force’s fueling area. On the 8 July, the ship was located and a boarding party was dispatched with a message guaranteeing safe conduct if the captain and crew would comply with instructions and courses given. By 10 April, the ships of TF38 had refueled and were underway to conduct strikes against the Tokyo industrial area. McDermut released her charge and rejoined TG38.4 for further strikes on Honshū, Hokkaidō, and the Kuriles.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} towards Rachel remained mostly positive {{throughout the}} show's ten-season run. Writing for The A.V. Club, John Reid believes that Rachel {{is responsible for}} the success of the pilot, explaining, [...] "The story of this group of friends must start with a stranger coming to town," [...] describing Rachel as [...] "the perfect stranger for this plot". Reid also holds Rachel responsible for spurring character development in the show's five other main characters, calling her arrival [...] "a catalyst for all of them to grow, because unlike the rest of them, Rachel is interested in finding meaning for her life". Also writing for The A.V. Club, Sonia Saraiya enjoyed Rachel's first awkward encounter with Ross because, for the first time, [...] "Rachel displays a moment of true empathy for another human being". Saraiya went on to hail Rachel as [...] "as a model for women coming of age in the 1990s—the popular, pretty girl dissatisfied with where those illusions <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> but also unwilling to embrace the more aggressively 'feminist' career-woman strategy". The New York Times Joseph Hanania enjoyed Rachel's telephone conversation with her father during the pilot, describing it as [...] "hilarious." [...] The Los Angeles Times Bob Shayne admitted his attraction towards Rachel, joking, [...] "my feelings for Rachel, I say with some embarrassment, mirror those of Gunther". Cosmopolitan touted Rachel [...] "the best fictional gal pal we've ever had". While People called her [...] "spoiled-but-lovable", TV Guide described Rachel as [...] "neurotic and adorable". Writing for Heat, Ellen Kerry hailed Rachel's gradual transformation from waitress to businesswoman as arguably [...] "the best thing on tv." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 July 1780 Minorca and Porcupine {{engaged the}} French frigate [...] off the Barbary coast. The two-hour {{engagement}} was indecisive. Porcupine and Minorca withdrew {{because even if}} Montreal had struck, they could not <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> off. Also, three other ships had appeared on the horizon. The French lost four killed, including their captain. The English had five killed and two wounded; two of the dead were on Minorca.|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, 2006, Shelly {{was found}} dead, {{hanging in the}} shower of her Greenwich Village work studio apartment. The initial {{examination}} of the scene did not reveal any suspicious circumstances, and police apparently believed {{it to be a}} suicide. Her husband insisted she would never <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> own life, and brought about a re-examination of the bathroom that disclosed a suspect footprint. [...] Police arrested a construction worker, an immigrant from Ecuador who confessed to killing Shelly and making it look as if she had committed suicide.|$|E
2500|$|On March 12, 1857, James Clinton was {{the first}} steamer to reach Eugene [...] It took the Clinton three days to reach Eugene City from Corvallis. [...] The {{distance}} on the river between the two cities was 53 miles. [...] The citizens of Eugene had promised to purchase $5,000 worth of stock in the Clinton if the steamer could reach the city, and it was later said that “it is altogether probable that Captain Cochrane would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> through if it had required three weeks instead of three days.” [...] When the Clinton did arrive in Eugene, the entire town turned out to greet the steamer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{figure is}} related to Heliodurus's work, Aethiopian History with its {{description}} of [...] "a young Lady, sitting upon a Rock, of so rare and perfect a Beauty, as one would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> for a Goddess, and though her present misery opprest her with extreamest grief, yet in the greatness of her afflection, they might easily perceive the greatness of her Courage: A Laurel crown'd her Head, and a Quiver in a Scarf hanged at her back". Her description in the poem is also related to Isis of Apuleius's Metamorphoses, but Isis was a figure of redemption and the Abyssinian maid cries out for her demon-lover. She is similar to John Keats's Indian woman in Endymion who is revealed to be the moon goddess, but in [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] she is also related to {{the sun and the}} sun as an image of divine truth.|$|E
2500|$|Traveling {{from her}} home in Chicago to Bloomington, Maud {{frequently}} paid visits to her sister Helen and her infant daughter, Dorothy Louise Gage. The infant became gravely sick and died on November 11, 1898, of [...] "congestion of the brain" [...] at exactly five months. When the baby, whom Maud adored as the daughter she never had, died, she was devastated and needed to consume medicine. In a letter to her sister, Maud wrote, [...] "Dorothy was a beautiful baby. I could <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> for my very own and loved her devotedly. To assuage her distress, Frank made his protagonist of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz a female named Dorothy. Frank dedicated the book to her, writing [...] "to my good friend and comrade, My Wife". Historian Sally Roesch Wagner, who discovered Dorothy Gale's namesake, told the Associated Press in 1982, [...] "He gave Maud her Dorothy in an immortal way." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Doctor accidentally did {{not return}} for her until twelve years later, Amy grew up a {{different}} person than she would have. She had become [...] "cynical" [...] and [...] "distrustful" [...] as the Doctor {{did not return}} as he had promised and {{she was forced to}} believe he was just an imaginary friend, and had resorted to being [...] "tough". Moffat theorised that Amy would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> anger out on Rory and would have been [...] "mean" [...] about things such as Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. The second episode, [...] "The Beast Below", was to introduce Amy into the role of the Doctor's companion and how much he needed one. Though Amy soon tries to seduce the Doctor, Moffat believed that it was consistent with the cynical character he had built up. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment". In [...] "Amy's Choice", meant to challenge the Doctor and Amy's relationship, Rory dies in an alternate universe that was a result of psychic pollen that had entered the TARDIS. This is when Amy truly realises her feelings for Rory. As a primary part of the series' story arc, Rory officially dies and is erased from history and Amy's memory. Though Rory later returns, he is an Auton duplicate who kills her, which reflected Moffat's belief that all good love stories end in tragedy. The end of [...] "The Big Bang", in which Amy stands up at her wedding and declares the Doctor is real, was the Doctor's success at restoring Amy to the spirit of the girl he first met.|$|E
