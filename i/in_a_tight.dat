5|$|In late 2007, Kartik was {{recalled}} to the ODI team {{in place}} of the struggling Powar midway through the series against Australia. He played his first ODI in 18 months when he returned for the fourth match at Mohali. He took 1/48, and conceded only two runs in the 48th over as Australia stumbled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> run chase to give India their first win of the series.|$|E
5|$|In the event, Ring {{played in}} only one Test, {{the second of the}} five-match series, played at Lord's. He took two wickets, the same number as Benaud, on a pitch {{allegedly}} susceptible to spin and scored 18 and 7 as the match ended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> draw.|$|E

Federer made the final at the Indian Wells Masters, but lost to Novak Djokovic in a final-set tiebreaker. At the Davis Cup quarterfinals, Federer won both of his singles rubbers against Kazakhstan, the second {{of which was the}} first live deciding rubber of his Davis Cup career. Federer then took a wild card into the Monte-Carlo Masters defeating Novak Djokovic {{on his way to the}} finals, but lost to compatriot Stan Wawrinka <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> final.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the decade, Nea Salamina was strong in home games but weak away. Noteworthy is the conquest of the amateur {{championship}} from farm team the period 1960–61, The games of the farm team gathered the same interest with the main team among fans, who enthusiastically celebrated winning the title. During this period the nucleus for a successful team was created, including Kyriakos Koureas (who later played for Olympiakos Piraeus). In December 1963, the league disbanded; at that time, Nea Salamina was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> three-way race with Omonia and APOEL. With the creation of Cypriot National Guard, many Nea Salamina's players joined the army; players would often come straight from camps throughout Cyprus to play league games with no training.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1965–66 season, the Celtics won their eighth consecutive title. Russell's team again beat Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 1 in the Division Finals, proceeding {{to win the}} NBA Finals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> seven-game showdown against the Los Angeles Lakers, with Russell scoring 25 points and grabbing 32 rebounds in a 95–93 win in the deciding seventh game. During the season, Russell contributed 12.9 points and 22.8 rebounds per game. This {{was the first time}} in seven years that he failed to average at least 23 rebounds a game.|$|E
5|$|L'Homme-Rivière is {{a statue}} {{representing}} a log driver at work. The logs are heavily stylized, reduced {{to little more}} than cylinders. The driver and his hook, however, are shown as transforming into a wooden plant. Its location, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> space between two tall buildings, gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge. L'Homme-Rivière is highly dynamic, and has been described as looking as though it is about to spill onto the sidewalk. The log driver is a symbolic figure in the history and culture of Quebec, thanks notably to Félix-Antoine Savard's famous novel Menaud, maître draveur.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} stages of core-collapse may be divided into three phases. During a globular cluster's adolescence, the process of core-collapse begins with stars near the core. However, the interactions between binary star systems prevents further collapse as the cluster approaches middle age.

5|$|The deep-level {{station was}} opened by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS, later the Bakerloo line) on 1 December 1913 as the {{temporary}} terminus of its extension from Edgware Road. To enable the BS {{to continue its}} route to the north-west of Paddington, the station platforms were constructed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> curve. A cross-over between tracks and reversing tunnels were provide beyond the new station. Construction work continued beyond the station to extend the line further to Queen's Park where it met the mainline tracks of the London and North Western Railway. The extension opened in stages, with the first trains running to and from Warwick Avenue on 31 January 1915.|$|E
5|$|With Ivan Lendl as his new {{full-time}} coach, Murray {{began the}} season by {{playing in the}} 2012 Brisbane International. He overcame a slow start {{in his first two}} matches to win his 22nd title by beating Alexandr Dolgopolov in the final. In doubles, he lost in the quarterfinals against second seeds Jürgen Melzer and Philipp Petzschner <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> match. After an exhibition tournament, Murray made it to the semifinals of the 2012 Australian Open, where he was defeated by Djokovic in a four-hour-and 50-minute match.|$|E
5|$|Although Utor tracked {{back over}} water on December10, the storm began to weaken due to {{increasing}} wind shear and dry {{air from the}} west. As a result, the JMA downgraded Utor to severe tropical storm intensity upon its emergence into the South China Sea. Despite these hindering conditions, the storm's improved outflow was sufficient enough to enable redevelopment. At 18:00UTC on December11, the JMA once again upgraded the system to typhoon strength southeast of Hainan. Intensification continued until Utor peaked with winds of 155km/h (100mph) and a minimum pressure of 945mbar (hPa; 27.91inHg) the next day. This strength was held for only twelve hours before Utor's outflow began to succumb to the wind shear and dry air stemming from the monsoonal flow it had previously suppressed. Traveling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> clockwise loop, the typhoon rapidly weakened on December13; by the following day Utor was a minimal tropical storm. At 06:00UTC on December14, the storm degenerated into a tropical depression and continued to execute a small anticyclonic loop before dissipating on December15.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} French lookouts at Santo Domingo had spotted Duckworth {{approaching}} from the southeast, {{it was too}} late for Leissègues to escape. Sailing with the wind westwards along the coast, Leissègues formed a line of battle to meet the approaching British squadron, which had split into two divisions. Although his divisions separated during the approach, Duckworth's lead ships remained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> formation and successfully engaged the head of the French line, targeting the flagship Impérial. Under pressure, the French squadron broke apart with the British isolating and capturing three ships before concentrating on the main combat around the French flagship. Severely damaged and surrounded, Leissègues drove Impérial ashore to avoid capture. The remaining French ship of the line, Diomède, followed him. Although most of the crew of these ships scrambled ashore, British boarding parties captured both vessels and set them on fire. The only French ships to escape the battle were three smaller warships, which Duckworth's squadron had ignored; they eventually returned to France.|$|E
5|$|Former {{manager for}} the Yankees, Joe McCarthy came out of {{retirement}} after a feud with Yankee ownership to sign with the Red Sox as their manager in 1948. Both the Yankees and the Red Sox were involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> pennant race with the Cleveland Indians until the final weekend. The Red Sox eliminated the Yankees in the final series at Fenway Park, overcoming four DiMaggio hits in the final game to tie Cleveland for the pennant. The situation forced the first-ever one-game playoff in AL history, which the Indians won 8–3 at Fenway Park. The city of Boston missed out on a chance for its first all-Boston World Series, as the Indians went on to defeat the Boston Braves in the Series, the last one the Indians have won to date.|$|E
5|$|In New Zealand, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances and traded the lead with Mikkola, Röhrl and Björn Waldegård. Soon after regaining {{the lead on}} stage twelve, she retired with a broken oil pump. After seven rounds, Mouton was second in the championship, 32 points behind Röhrl and 12 ahead of Eklund. The Rally of Brazil was marred by the fatal accident of Brazilian driver Thomas Fuchs, and featured chaotic conditions as parts of the course were not successfully closed for competition. Although only five teams {{made it to the}} finish, Mouton improved her title hopes by winning her duel with Röhrl after the German lost a wheel on the last day. At the 1000 Lakes, she clocked in the eighth fastest time for the famous Ouninpohja stage and placed seventh after the first day. On the following leg, Mouton drove too fast into a jump and damaged her Quattro while landing. After the next jump, her front wheels locked up and she rolled the car. Mouton was next locked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> battle for the win in Sanremo. Although she recorded nine stage wins and Audi took a one-two, she had to settle for fourth behind Röhrl.|$|E
30|$|Statistical {{process control}} charts {{are used to}} detect changes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> process by {{distinguishing}} between assignable causes and common causes of the process variation. When a control chart signals, process engineers initiate a search to identify and eliminate the source of variation.

5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova rebounded at the Wuhan Open, {{reaching}} the semifinals which boosted her hopes {{to qualify for}} the WTA Finals {{for the first time since}} 2009. This run included defeating defending champion Venus Williams and Agnieszka Radwańska, after saving match point. She then lost to fellow Singapore contender Dominika Cibulková <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> three set match. At the China Open, Kuznetsova received a bye into the second round due to her impressive performance at Wuhan. She defeated Misaki Doi but lost to yet another Singapore Contender Madison Keys in the third round. Being the favourite for the title in Tianjin after top seed Agnieszka Radwańska withdrew from her Quarterfinal match, Kuznetsova disappointingly lost to Alison Riske in the semifinals. This would have kept her out of Singapore, until Serena Williams withdrew from Singapore and that left a spot up to grabs.|$|E
5|$|Murray next competed at the Madrid Open and {{following}} his opening win, over Nicolas Almagro, he dedicated the victory to former player Elena Baltacha. He then lost to qualifier Santiago Giraldo {{in the following}} round. Murray then reached {{the quarterfinals of the}} Rome Masters where he lost to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> match in which he had been up a break in the final set. At the French Open, Murray defeated Andrey Golubev and Marinko Matosevic before edging out 28th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber 12–10 in the final set. This was the first time Murray had ever gone beyond 7–5 in a deciding set. He followed this up with a straight sets win over Fernando Verdasco and then recorded a five set victory over Frenchman Gaël Monfils in the quarterfinal, which saw Murray rise to world No. 5 and equal his best ever French Open by reaching the semifinals. However, he subsequently lost to Nadal in straight sets, winning only 6 games in the match. After losing the 2014 French Open semifinals to Nadal, Murray appointed former women's world No. 1, and two-times slam titlist, Amélie Mauresmo as his coach in a 'historic move' which made Mauresmo the first woman to coach a top male tennis player.|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that the demand of real-time services, such as Voice over IP (VoIP), for strict QoS delay demands, {{leads to the}} reconsideration of the ring scattering model [12], which is widely used {{in the evaluation of}} WLAN systems with nonreal time (e.g., data traffic) applications. This is because the QoS requirements have to be satisfied <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tighter</b> time scale, which requires for detailed models to account for the instantaneous channel random fluctuations.|$|R
5|$|Originally, all aetosaurs were {{considered}} {{members of the}} family Stagonolepididae. Early phylogenetic analyses split aetosaurs into two subfamilies, Aetosaurinae and Desmatosuchinae. Aetosaurines are characterized by projections called eminences on the dorsal paramedian osteoderms that are close to the midline of the back. Desmatosuchines have a few more distinguishing characteristics, including grooves on the dorsal paramedians that help them lock to the lateral plates <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> articulation. Many desmatosuchines have long spikes projecting from the lateral plates. These spikes are especially prominent in Desmatosuchus. Aetosaurines, on the other hand, tend to have less spikes. Many aetosaurines, such as Aetosaurus and Neoaetosauroides, have smooth carapaces and lack spikes altogether. More recent studies (see below) have favored a third group, Typothoracisinae, which like Desmatosuchinae has long spikes, but differs in having more sharply angled joints between osteoderms. Moreover, the genus Aetosauroides is now often classified outside Stagonolepididae as a non-stagonolepidid aetosaur, making the names Aetosauria and Stagonolepididae no longer synonymous.|$|E
5|$|Paratroops from 101st Airborne {{were dropped}} {{beginning}} around 01:30, tasked with controlling the causeways behind Utah Beach and destroying road and rail bridges over the Douve River. The C-47s could not fly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> formation because of thick cloud cover, and many paratroopers were dropped {{far from their}} intended landing zones. Many planes came in so low that they were under fire from both flak and machine gun fire. Some paratroopers were killed on impact when their parachutes {{did not have time}} to open, and others drowned in the flooded fields. Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the bocage terrain, with its hedgerows, stone walls, and marshes. Some units did not arrive at their targets until afternoon, by which time several of the causeways had already been cleared by members of the 4th Infantry Division moving up from the beach.|$|E
5|$|The Gateshead Senators (originally the Gateshead International Senators) are an American {{football}} club formed in 1988 when the Newcastle Senators, {{who played at}} Northern Rugby Club, moved across the Tyne {{to play at the}} Gateshead International Stadium. The club has had mixed fortunes but their most successful season came in 1999. Having won eight of their nine games in the regular season, the team won the Division One North title and advanced to the end-of-season playoffs. After beating the Merseyside Nighthawks 430 in the quarter-finals, the Senators defeated the Essex Spartans 3319 in the semi-finals to reach the championship final. At the Saffron Lane Stadium in Leicester, the Senators faced the Bristol Aztecs. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> encounter, the Senators claimed the Division One British American Football League title with a 72 victory. The club reached the playoffs again in the next three seasons but were unable to replicate that success, and after a season voluntarily spent in Division Two in 2003, returned to Division One North in 2004. They continue to play in that division, and in the 2012 season failed to make the playoffs after recording five wins and five defeats in their ten games.|$|E
