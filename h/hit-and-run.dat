5|$|Mardonius also {{initiated}} <b>hit-and-run</b> cavalry {{attacks against}} the Greek lines, possibly trying to lure the Greeks down to the plain in pursuit. Although having some initial success, this strategy backfired when the Persian cavalry commander Masistius was killed; with his death, the cavalry retreated.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} a {{flashback}} of Jackie Tyler telling a younger Rose about her father Pete, who died age 33 in a <b>hit-and-run</b> accident {{on the way to}} a friend's wedding.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions in the border regions of South Vietnam. All of these attacks were {{conducted}} by regimental-size NVA/NLF units, but unlike the usual <b>hit-and-run</b> tactics used by the People's Army forces, these were sustained and bloody affairs.|$|E
5|$|Mike {{has been}} {{comatose}} since the <b>hit-and-run.</b> Dr. Lee Craig (Terry Bozeman) warns Susan that Mike {{will most likely}} not awaken from his coma, but she remains optimistic. She meets Ian Hainsworth (Dougray Scott), a British man whose wife, Jane (Cecily Gambrell), {{has been in a}} coma for several years. Ian asks Susan on a date, which forces her to face the unlikeliness of Mike recovering.|$|E
5|$|Birckenbuehl's son Charlie is kidnapped {{from his}} bedroom, again subdued with a cattle prod. Andrews and Black {{discover}} that the boy's goldfish had been poisoned with whiskey, which {{they believe to be}} another message like Comstock's number. The town's swimming instructor, Adam Burke (Brian Taylor) is interviewed, as he had contact with both missing boys through his coaching. Black discovers that Burke's son had been killed in a <b>hit-and-run</b> accident; Black also receives post containing a paint swatch with the number 528 on it, but he is unsure of its meaning.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Butler {{violated}} diplomatic norms by publicly recounting {{gossip about}} Benito Mussolini {{in which the}} dictator allegedly struck and killed a child with his speeding automobile in a <b>hit-and-run</b> accident. The Italian government protested and President Hoover, who strongly disliked Butler, forced Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams III to court-martial him. Butler became the first general officer to be placed under arrest since the Civil War. He apologized to Secretary Adams and the court-martial was canceled with only a reprimand.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, he {{rejoined the}} 35th Infantry Division at Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, where the German advance had halted. Over-winter <b>hit-and-run</b> attacks on Soviet Army supply routes were the unit's main focus and in spring, Trautmann was {{promoted}} to Unteroffizier (corporal). Gains were made in 1942, but the Soviet counter-offensive hit Trautmann's unit hard, {{and by the time}} it was withdrawn from the Eastern Front, only 300 of the original 1,000 men remained. Trautmann won five medals for his actions on the Eastern Front, including an Iron Cross First Class.|$|E
5|$|In early 1921, using al-Shallash as an intermediary, Hananu began {{receiving}} {{support from}} Emir Abdullah, the Hashemite emir of Transjordan and Faisal's brother. Although the support from Emir Abdullah was relatively small in quantity, the French authorities feared {{it was part}} of a plot by Abdullah and his British allies to oust the French from Syria. Hananu, meanwhile, was launching frequent <b>hit-and-run</b> operations against the French left flank in the area between Urfa and Antioch in an effort to support the Turks at the main battlefront in Gaziantep.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in southeastern Laos was unlike any yet {{seen in the}} Vietnam War, since the PAVN abandoned its old <b>hit-and-run</b> tactics and launched a conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery to crush ARVN positions on the flanks of the main advance. Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made tactical air support and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.|$|E
5|$|This, {{and other}} {{successful}} <b>hit-and-run</b> raids by American carriers in the South Pacific, showed {{that they were}} still a threat, although seemingly reluctant to be drawn into an all-out battle. Yamamoto reasoned that another air attack on the main U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor would induce all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. However, considering the increased strength of American land-based air power on the Hawaiian Islands since the December 7 attack the previous year, he judged that it was now too risky to attack Pearl Harbor directly.|$|E
5|$|Tom Comstock {{comes home}} {{the next day}} to find his son {{returned}}, alive but shaken. Black deduces that the paint swatch matches paint used on the vehicle that killed Burke's son; he also realizes that the boys are being kidnapped to force their fathers to confess hidden sins—Comstock's son was returned after he revealed his affair, while Orlando's son was killed because he kept secret a crime involving money. From there, Black sees that Charlie's kidnapping means that Birckenbeuhl is the <b>hit-and-run</b> driver.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after {{accepting}} the offer, Apollo is assigned to investigate three separate incidents: a <b>hit-and-run</b> involving Phoenix, the theft of a noodle vendor's cart, and the disappearance of Trucy's favorite pair of panties. At the same time, the Kitaki crime family hires him to defend one of their own, Wocky Kitaki, in a murder trial concerning the death of Dr. Pal Meraktis. By connecting the incidents to evidence recovered {{with the help of}} Detective Ema Skye, Apollo discredits the case against Wocky by proving that his fiancée, Alita Tiala, {{was the only one who}} could have committed the crime.|$|E
5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, the {{peaceful}} Mon Calamari converted their passenger liners into warships {{to support the}} rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the ships are crewed almost entirely by Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of Mon Calamari cruisers are the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for <b>hit-and-run</b> attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E
5|$|Although Hananu's revolt {{was largely}} suppressed, a {{low-level}} insurgency involving small ′iṣābāt persisted in Aleppo's countryside. Al-Sa'dun and Uwaid opted {{to continue the}} armed struggle, fleeing to the coastal mountains {{and from there to}} Turkey in December 1921. From the frontier area with Syria, they staged <b>hit-and-run</b> attacks against French forces. With 100 of his fighters, al-Sa'dun entered Jabal Zawiya in the summer of 1922 to punish those who defected from the rebels or residents who switched allegiance. On 26 August, al-Sa'dun's ′iṣābā assaulted a postal convoy in al-Darakiya, a village between Darkush and Antioch. In 1923, rebel commander Aqil al-Saqati and ten of his fighters launched numerous attacks against the French, including an assault against a government building in al-Safira, southeast of Aleppo, and Jisr al-Hadid near Antakya.|$|E
5|$|Black convinces Birckenbeuhl {{to confess}} {{publicly}} to the <b>hit-and-run,</b> {{in order to}} have his son returned. Birckenbeuhl does so, but continues to maintain his innocence in private. Charlie is not returned, however; instead, a cassette is sent to Birckenbuehl by the killer, who explains that since Birckenbeuhl took a life, one must be taken from him in return. Black is able to deduce from the background noise on the tape that Charlie is being held near the local high school's swimming pool. The boy is rescued, and killer—Edward Petey—is found and arrested. However, the elder Birckenbeuhl is found hanged in his bedroom, driven to suicide by his guilt.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the RPF waged a classic <b>hit-and-run</b> style guerrilla war, {{capturing}} some border areas but not making significant {{gains in the}} war against the Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, the Portuguese Royal Family {{arrived in}} Brazil, {{settling}} in Rio de Janeiro. The Hispanic-American colonies became easy prey, {{as they were}} engulfed in turmoil and beset by wars of independence against Spain. In 1811 Prince Regent Dom João (later King Dom JoãoVI) ordered {{the invasion of the}} Banda Oriental (Eastern Bank), which bordered Rio Grande do Sul. João's attempt at conquering the entire region met with failure. He launched another invasion a few years later, in 1816, who counted among their ranks Marques de Sousa's father and paternal grandfather. In 1817, around age 13, he asked his grandfather to allow him to fight in the war. The elder Marques de Sousa agreed, and the youngster learned guerrilla <b>hit-and-run</b> tactics on horseback near the border town of Jaguarão.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{attempts}} at peaceful negotiation by FRELIMO were abandoned and, on September 25, 1964, Eduardo Mondlane began to launch guerrilla attacks on targets in northern Mozambique from his base in Tanzania. FRELIMO soldiers, with logistical {{assistance from the}} local population, attacked the administrative post at Chai Chai {{in the province of}} Cabo Delgado. FRELIMO militants were able to evade pursuit and surveillance by employing classic guerrilla tactics: ambushing patrols, sabotaging communication and railroad lines, and making <b>hit-and-run</b> attacks against colonial outposts before rapidly fading into accessible backwater areas. The insurgents were typically armed with rifles and machine pistols, and the attackers took full advantage of the monsoon season in order to evade pursuit.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, {{militant group}} al Shabaab made a {{strategic}} withdrawal from Mogadishu {{to return to}} <b>hit-and-run</b> tactics. Mayor Mohamed Nur recognized the opportunity as critical to stabilizing and rebuilding the city by any means necessary. Working closely with the UN, USAID, and DRC, Nur's administration also started large-scale rehabilitation of roads and general infrastructure, with residents closely cooperating with the civil and police authorities to tighten up on security. Nur recognized the opportunity to transform Mogadishu although resources were limited. Working closely with urban strategist Mitchell Sipus, the Benadir government sought to design and deploy a data-driven approach to post-war reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|In January 1970 Sabo and {{his unit}} {{departed}} for Vietnam {{to fight in}} the Vietnam War and he began corresponding with his wife regularly via letter. The unit came into contact with North Vietnamese troops frequently for the first several months of its deployment, but most of these were small <b>hit-and-run</b> attacks. On 5 May 1970 Sabo's platoon was attached to the U.S. 4th Infantry Division for a secret mission into Cambodia and dropped into the country on a UH-1 Huey helicopter. They were to conduct a series of interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh Trail with the assistance of heavy air support. For five days they came into constant, heavy contact with North Vietnamese forces that were often of superior size.|$|E
5|$|In October 1966, strike force F-105 Thunderchiefs were {{equipped}} with QRC-160 radar jamming pods whose effectiveness virtually ended their losses to surface-to-air missiles. As a result, SAM attacks {{shifted to the}} Phantoms, unprotected because of a shortage of pods. To protect the F-4s, rules of engagement that allowed the MiGCAP to escort the strike force {{in and out of}} the target area were revised in December to restrict MiGCAP penetration to the edge of SAM coverage. MiG interceptions increased as a result, primarily by MiG-21s using high-speed <b>hit-and-run</b> tactics against bomb-laden F-105 formations, and although only two bombers had been lost, the threat to the force was perceived as serious.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Persians adopted war engines from the Romans. The Romans had {{achieved}} and maintained {{a high degree}} of sophistication in siege warfare and had developed a range of siege machines. On the other hand, the Parthians were inept at besieging; their cavalry armies were more suited to the <b>hit-and-run</b> tactics that destroyed Antony's siege train in 36BC. The situation changed with the rise of the Sasanians, when Rome encountered an enemy equally skilled in siegecraft, who made use of artillery, machines captured from the Romans, embankments, siege towers, and in one instance, even an early form of gas warfare inside tunnels. Recent assessments comparing the Sasanians and Parthians have reaffirmed the superiority of Sasanian siegecraft, military engineering, and organization, as well as ability to build defensive works.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they {{therefore}} resolved to maintain their position. They staged a <b>hit-and-run</b> attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them. On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, the Allies held on to their position, but suffered severe losses (half the Athenian fleet was damaged); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet. That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Lechaeum (391 BC) was an Athenian {{victory in}} the Corinthian War. In the battle, the Athenian general Iphicrates took {{advantage}} of the fact that a Spartan hoplite regiment operating near Corinth was moving in the open without the protection of any missile throwing troops. He decided to ambush it with his force of javelin throwers, or peltasts. By launching repeated <b>hit-and-run</b> attacks against the Spartan formation, Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down, eventually routing them and killing just under half. This marked one of the first occasions in Greek military history on which a force of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites (heavy infantry).|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamics}} of the air war changed in June 1941. The German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, opened up the Eastern Front. The German bomber force was heavily committed to the theatre. The escalation of the fighting in the Mediterranean and North African theatres also diverted German air strength. The operations of the Luftwaffe over Britain changed dramatically. Small numbers of bombers would make <b>hit-and-run</b> attacks on selected targets near the coast {{for the remainder of}} 1941, replacing the mass raids of the preceding autumn and winter. Cunningham used the decline in the pace of operations to train new crews.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>hit-and-run,</b> Mike falls into a coma. Having waited six months for Mike to wake up, she reluctantly enters a {{relationship}} with Ian Hainsworth (Dougray Scott), a British man whose wife, Jane (Cecily Gambrell), has been in a coma for years. When Mike finally awakens, doctors conclude that he now suffers from retrograde amnesia. While Susan is out of town, Edie convinces Mike that Susan was horrible to him during their relationship. Mike turns Susan away when she returns to Fairview. Having lost hope, Susan continues her romance with Ian. Meanwhile, Susan is suspicious of Orson, who has married Bree and is accused of killing his missing ex-wife, Alma (Valerie Mahaffey). When Mike is arrested for the murder of Monique Polier (Kathleen York), Orson's former mistress, Edie breaks up with him, leaving him without bail. Susan defends Mike, which frustrates Ian. He promises to pay for Mike's bail if Susan breaks off all contact with him. Mike is eventually acquitted for the crime. Following Jane's death, Susan accepts Ian's marriage proposal.|$|E
5|$|In November 1940 Air Marshal Sholto Douglas became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Fighter Command. On 8 December 1940 a {{directive}} from the Air Staff called for Sector Offensive Sweeps. It ordered <b>hit-and-run</b> operations over Belgium and France. The operations {{were to be}} conducted by three squadrons to harass German air defences. On 10 January 1941 Circus attacks were initiated by sending small bomber formations protected by large numbers of fighters. The escalation of offensive operations throughout 1941 was designed to draw up the Luftwaffe as Douglas' Command took an increasingly offensive stance. These operations {{became known as the}} Circus offensive. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC 11 Group, penned Operations Instruction No. 7, which he had written on 16 February. Leigh-Mallory outlined six distinct operations for day fighters: Ramrod (bomber escort with primary goal the destruction of the target); Fighter Ramrod (The same goal where fighters escorted ground-attack fighters); Roadstead (Bomber escort and anti-shipping operations); Fighter Roadstead (the same operation as Roadstead but without bombers) along with Rhubarb (poor weather ground attack operation) and Circus operations (see glossary).|$|E
5|$|Li becomes {{obsessed with}} Ah Jong's act of good will. He and Tsang find that Ah Jong visits Jennie at her apartment; {{they plan to}} arrest him {{the next time he}} visits her. Ah Jong visits Jennie and is caught in an ambush from which he manages to escape. Li and Tsang explain to Jennie that Ah Jong was the assassin that blinded her at the nightclub. Ah Jong meets with his Triad manager, Fung Sei, and demands his payment for the job. Fung Sei brings a {{suitcase}} for Ah Jong, who discovers it to be filled with sheets of blank paper before finding himself {{in the middle of a}} Triad ambush. He kills all of the hitmen, but leaves Fung Sei alive. The next day, after Fung Sei's pleas for Wong Hoi fall on deaf ears, Ah Jong does a <b>hit-and-run</b> on Wong Hoi's car, wounding the Triad leader and killing his driver and bodyguard.|$|E
5|$|At Corinth, the {{democratic}} party continued to hold the city proper, while the exiles and their Spartan supporters held Lechaeum, from where they raided the Corinthian countryside. In 391 BC, Agesilaus campaigned in the area, successfully seizing several fortified points, along {{with a large number}} of prisoners and amounts of booty. While Agesilaus was in camp preparing to sell off his spoils, the Athenian general Iphicrates, with a force composed almost entirely of light troops and peltasts (javelin throwers), won a decisive victory against the Spartan regiment that had been stationed at Lechaeum in the Battle of Lechaeum. During the battle, Iphicrates took advantage of the Spartans' lack of peltasts to repeatedly harass the regiment with <b>hit-and-run</b> attacks, wearing the Spartans down until they broke and ran, at which point a number of them were slaughtered. Agesilaus returned home shortly after these events, but Iphicrates continued to campaign around Corinth, recapturing many of the strong points which the Spartans had previously taken, although he was unable to retake Lechaeum. He also campaigned against Phlius and Arcadia, decisively defeating the Phliasians and plundering the territory of the Arcadians when they refused to engage his troops.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the action}} in Ruhengeri, the RPF began {{to carry out a}} classic <b>hit-and-run</b> style guerrilla war. The FAR massed troops across the north of the country, occupying key {{positions}} and shelling RPF hideouts in the Virunga mountains. However, the mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all out assault. Paul Kagame's troops attacked the FAR forces repeatedly and frequently, keen to ensure that the diplomatic and psychological effect of the RPF's resurgence was not lost. Kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across the north of the country, to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place. This low intensity war continued for many months, both sides launching successful attacks on the other, and neither able to gain the upper hand in the war. The RPF made some territorial gains, including capturing the border town of Gatuna. This was significant, as it blocked Rwanda's access to the port of Mombasa via the Northern Corridor, forcing all trade to go through Tanzania via the longer and costlier Central Corridor. By late 1991, the RPF controlled 5% of Rwanda, setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory close to Mulindi, in Byumba province. Many Hutu civilians residing in areas captured by the RPF fled to government-held areas, creating a large population of internally displaced persons in the country.|$|E
5|$|In Mumbai and Aurangabad, police {{rounded up}} more than 400MNS workers. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, MNS workers went on a rampage {{following}} the arrest of Raj, smashing windows and windscreens of eleven state buses. Thirteen rioters were arrested. They also chopped off both hands of a Bihari hawker sleeping on the streets. He was severely beaten until he fell unconscious. When he gained consciousness the following day, {{he found himself in}} a hospital with both hands amputated. The injured, mainly hawkers, were treated at the Nashik Civil Hospital after they were beaten. Shops along Nashik Road closed down after the incident. Incidents of stone pelting on state-run buses were reported from the Nashik Road, Ambad, Ravivar Peth, and Gangapur areas. Bus services were severely curtailed and diverted via Nipani. In Amrawati, MNS workers blocked roads and pelted stones at buses, damaging several vehicles in the process. Though contingents of the Rapid Action Force and the Central Industrial Security Force were deployed {{in many parts of the}} state, the police could not control violence by the MNS who adopted <b>hit-and-run</b> methods of attack. More than 200activists of the MNS were arrested across Nashik. Many activists went underground and coordinated with party activists from undisclosed locations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} season premiere, {{one month after}} her wedding, Susan learns that she is pregnant. While looking into their medical {{histories}} for the baby's interest, Mike is forced to tell Susan that he lied about his father being dead. Susan visits Mike's father, Nick (Robert Forster), who is in jail for murder. Nick warns Susan that Mike is still troubled by demons of his past. With the stress of finances for the baby, Mike begins working overtime, despite an injury resulting from the <b>hit-and-run</b> over a year ago. He begins relying heavily on painkillers. Susan confronts Mike about his addiction, threatening to leave him {{if he does not}} enter rehab; he agrees to admit himself. After a devastating tornado hits Wisteria Lane, Bree, Orson, and their newborn, Benjamin, move into Susan's house temporarily. During his stay, Orson develops a sleep walking habit and unconsciously admits to running over Mike with his car. Susan feels extremely betrayed and Bree, unable to forgive Orson, asks him to move out. Shortly after, Susan gives birth to a boy, whom she names Maynard, after Mike's deceased grandfather.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} area of operations, the US 3rd Infantry Brigade was making slow progress, with the Viet Cong using <b>hit-and-run</b> and ambush tactics to inflict casualties on the Americans, before withdrawing into {{the sanctuary of}} their underground tunnels. On 9 January, the Americans located and destroyed a cache of medical supplies, a small hospital and {{a large amount of}} rice, as well as capturing 30 Viet Cong during a series of skirmishes. To the north, while 1 RAR searched the tunnel complex the American battalions of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade continued to sweep their area of operations, with a number of friendly fire incidents complicating their task. Both the US 1/503rd and US 2/503rd Battalions searched eastward toward the Saigon River and, although they continued to find supply caches and abandoned positions, they were involved in only minor skirmishes with the Viet Cong. Concealed in well-camouflaged ambush positions however, the communists inflicted a number of casualties on the Americans. Only one Viet Cong was killed during the fighting, bringing the total for the operation to just 22. Despite the large number of US troops involved they had experienced only limited contact to that point, and criticism of the operation consequently began to mount in the American media.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Susan is dismayed {{to learn}} that Karl has moved in with Edie. She begins dating her doctor, Ron McCready (Jay Harrington), who informs her {{that she has a}} {{wandering}} spleen and will need a splenectomy. When Susan learns that her health insurance will not cover the operation, Karl offers to remarry her for his medical benefits. They agree to keep their sham marriage a secret from Edie and Ron. While under anesthesia before her operation, Susan professes her love for Mike to Ron, which prompts Ron to break up with her. Soon after, Karl leaves Edie, as his love for Susan has resurfaced. Upon learning that Susan is the other woman, Edie intentionally sets Susan's house on fire. In this time of need, both Mike and Karl vie for Susan's affections. She chooses to rekindle her relationship with Mike and Karl signs the divorce papers. Susan and Mike then make plans to meet for dinner at nearby Torch Lake, where Mike plans to propose. On his way to dinner, Mike is a victim of a <b>hit-and-run</b> at the hands of Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), a dentist whom Susan had recently befriended.|$|E
5|$|T.C. Russell is {{the patriarch}} of the Russell family. He is {{characterized}} by his violent temper and hatred of Julian Crane for supposedly injuring him in a <b>hit-and-run</b> attack, and destroying his chances of becoming a professional tennis player. T.C. is initially portrayed as a harsh and unforgiving parent; he pushes Whitney to train to be a tennis champion, as he once wanted to be, and disapproves of her relationship with Chad Harris-Crane, feeling it is a distraction. He is also violent with Simone when she reveals she is a lesbian. After learning about Eve's past relationship with Julian and her responsibility for the car crash that ended his tennis career, T. C. files for divorce and has a brief romance and engagement to her adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. The show humanizes T.C. and softens his temper during his recovery from a stroke; his final storylines focus on his attempts to rebuild {{his relationship with his}} ex-wife and children. In 2007, he moves to New Orleans to help Whitney with her pregnancy and reconnect with Simone. T.C. does not appear in the show after its transition to DirecTV, and he is neither seen nor mentioned in the series finale.|$|E
5|$|The Moldavians {{made the}} first move by sending musicians {{to the middle of}} the valley. The sound of drums and bugles made Suleiman think that the entire Moldavian army awaited him there. Instead, the centre of the valley held the Székely forces and the Moldavian {{professional}} army, which were ordered to make a slow retreat when they encountered the enemy. Suleiman ordered his troops to advance and, when they made enough progress, the Moldavian artillery started to fire, followed by archers and handgunners firing from three different directions. The archers could not see the enemy for the fog, and, instead, had to follow the noise of their footsteps. The Moldavian light cavalry then helped to lure the Ottoman troops into the valley by making <b>hit-and-run</b> attacks. Ottoman cavalry tried to cross the wooden bridge, causing it to collapse. Those Ottoman soldiers who had managed to survive the attacks from the artillery and the archers, and who did not get caught in the marshes, had to confront the Moldavian army, together with the Székely soldiers further up the valley. The 5,000 Székely soldiers were successful in repelling the 7,000 Ottoman infantrymen. Thereafter, they made a slow retreat, as instructed by Stephen, but were later routed by the Ottoman sipahi, while the remaining Ottoman infantry attacked the Moldavian flanks.|$|E
