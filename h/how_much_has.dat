5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} games, the player character receives his first Pokémon, a choice between Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, from the region's local Pokémon scientist Professor Elm and then begins his journey to win the eight Gym Badges of the Johto region and then challenge the Elite Four and Champion to become the region's new Pokémon Master. Opposing him is his mysterious rival, a boy who stole {{one of the other}} Pokémon from Professor Elm and regularly challenges the player to test his strengths. The player also encounters the villainous Team Rocket, having reunited to seek out their previous leader Giovanni to return the group to their former glory. After the player defeats Team Rocket once and for all and defeats the Elite Four and Champion of the Pokémon League on Indigo Plateau, the player can then travel to the Kanto region from the previous games and challenge the Gym Leaders there, discovering <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> changed in the three years following the events of Red and Blue. After defeating the Kanto region's Gym Leaders, the player is allowed to enter the treacherous Mt. Silver area, home to very powerful Pokémon, and deep within Mt. Silver's caves is Red, the protagonist of Red and Blue, who the player can challenge for the most difficult battle in the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} gas needed on a dive {{depends on whether}} the scuba {{equipment}} to be used is open, semi-closed or closed circuit. Open circuit diving exhausts all respired gas to the surroundings, regardless of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> been useful to the diver, whereas a semi-closed or closed circuit system retains most of the respired gas, and restores it to a respirable condition by removing the waste product carbon dioxide, and making up the oxygen content to a suitable partial pressure. Closed and semi-closed circuit scuba sets are also known as rebreathers.|$|E
25|$|The {{global warming}} {{controversy}} concerns {{the public debate}} over whether global warming is occurring, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its effects will be, whether any action {{should be taken to}} curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions. Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States than globally.|$|E

25|$|Season eight {{addresses}} Roseanne's baby {{shower and}} the subsequent arrival of her son, Jerry Garcia Conner. (In a continuity error, the baby had been revealed {{to be a girl}} in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that after she fell pregnant she wished the Conners' baby to be the same gender as hers). The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone, including Mark, David, and Roseanne's mother, along to Walt Disney World. It is later revealed that one of the nights the clan was at Disney was also the night Darlene got pregnant. Darlene quickly decides she and David want to have the baby and the two get engaged. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for Darlene. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode it is revealed that he survives, as DJ saved his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan. Other subjects are DJ's Thanksgiving pageant, Darlene's wedding, and Dan's heart attack.|$|E
500|$|Day of the Tentacle: Remastered has {{received}} positive reviews, with the PC version having an aggregate review score of 87/100 tallied by Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the title as having not lost its charm since its initial release, but found {{some aspects of}} the remastering to be lackluster. Richard Corbett for Eurogamer found the game [...] "every bit as well crafted now as it was in 1993", but found the processes used to provide high-definition graphics from the original 16-bit graphics to making some of the required shortcuts taken in 1993 for graphics, such as background dithering and low animation framerates, more obvious on modern hardware. IGNs Jared Petty also found the remastered to still be enjoyable, and found the improvement on the graphics to be [...] "glorious", but worried that the lack of a hint system, as was added in The Secret of Monkey Island remastered version, would put off new players to the game. Bob Mackey for USgamer found that while past remastered adventure games have highlighted <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> changed in gamers' expectations since the heyday of adventure games in the 1990s, Day of the Tentacle Remastered [...] "rises above these issues to become absolutely timeless".|$|E
2500|$|Many Tax Court cases involve {{disputes}} over Federal income tax and penalties, often after an examination by the Internal Revenue Service of a taxpayer's return. After issuance {{of a series}} of preliminary written notices and a lack of agreement between the taxpayer and the IRS, the IRS formally [...] "determines" [...] the amount of the [...] "deficiency" [...] and issues a formal notice called a [...] "statutory notice of deficiency," [...] or [...] "ninety day letter". In this context, the term [...] "deficiency" [...] is a legal term of art, and is not necessarily equal to the amount of unpaid tax (although it usually is). The deficiency is generally the excess of the amount the IRS contends is the correct tax over the amount the taxpayer showed on the return—in both cases, without regard to <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> actually been paid.|$|E
