40|$|We present fully dynamic generic {{three-dimensional}} laboratory {{models of}} progressive subduction with an overriding plate and a weak subduction zone interface. Overriding plate thickness (TOP) is varied systematically (in the range 0 - 2. 5 cm scaling to 0 - 125 km) to investigate {{its effect on}} subduction kinematics and overriding plate deformation. The general pattern of subduction {{is the same for}} all models with slab draping on the 670 kmdiscontinuity, comparable slab dip angles, trench retreat, trenchward subducting platemotion, and a concave trench curvature. The narrow slab models only show overriding <b>plate</b> <b>extension.</b> Subduction partitioning (νSP⊥ / (νSP⊥ + νT⊥)) increases with increasing TOP, where trenchward subducting plate motion (νSP⊥) increases at the expense of trench retreat (νT⊥). This results from an increase in trench suction force with increasing TOP, which retards trench retreat. An increase in TOP also corresponds to a decrease in overriding <b>plate</b> <b>extension</b> and curvature because a thicker overriding plate provides more resistance to deform. Overriding <b>plate</b> <b>extension</b> is maximum at a scaled distance of ∼ 200 - 400 km from the trench, not at the trench, suggesting that basal shear tractions resulting frommantle flow below the overriding <b>plate</b> primarily drive <b>extension</b> rather than deviatoric tensional normal stresses at the subduction zone interface. The force that drives overriding <b>plate</b> <b>extension</b> is 5 %- 11 % of the slab negative buoyancy force.

30|$|The Ilizarov fixator was {{assembled}} over a peri-articular reference wire {{which was}} done by palpation of the transmalleolar axis or fibula head. This was helped {{by the use of}} a “sputnik” device—a long threaded rod connected at 90 ° by shorter threaded rods and placed on the tibial crest (Fig.  1 d). The patients had very little body fat which facilitated the use of surface anatomy by palpation. Furthermore, the use of four rods in each ring segment allowed visual assessment within the tibia to ensure an orthogonal placement of the rings by eye. A construct consisting of two rings orthogonal to each segment of the tibia was done and the two constructs connected. In fractures involving the very distal part of the tibia, where a construct of two rings could not be made owing {{to the size of the}} segment, a half-ring with <b>extension</b> <b>plates</b> on each side was applied to the calcaneum as a foot extension to bridge the ankle joint (Tables  2, 4).

A fibular osteotomy was performed as appropriate to aid acute shortening and compression of the non-union site and to stimulate limb blood flow [2]. In cases where acute shortening was not possible due to a large bony defect, a bone transport technique to fill the tibial defect was used [1, 7, 8].|$|R

40|$|It {{is thought}} likely that thermal {{thinning}} and/or diapirism {{can cause the}} extensional stress required for rifting. The rifting, however, will not occur unless the regional tectonic regime permits {{the sides of the}} rift to diverge. Whereas passive <b>plate</b> <b>extension</b> could cause rifting in isolation, the extension and rifting are likely to be localized where the lithosphere is weakest over an existing thermal anomaly. In those cases where asthenospheric diapirism occurs, which is essentially a response to thinning of the lithosphere by thermal thinning or <b>plate</b> <b>extension,</b> the effects of diapirism may completely mask the initiating mechanism. It is believed that anomalous heat transfer into the lithosphere, diapirism, and magmatism must all figure in rifting, along with a deviatoric stress field that will permit extension in a developing rift. Even though the models are useful in permitting idealized processes to be quantified and tested, better knowledge of lithosphere properties is considered necessary, in particular knowledge of mantle viscosity and its temperature dependence...|$|R
