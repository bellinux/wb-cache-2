40|$|We {{examine the}} role of {{business}} <b>interruption</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>in</b> business recovery following the Christchurch earthquake in 2011 in the short- and medium-term. In the short-term analysis, we ask whether insurance {{increases the likelihood of}} business survival {{in the aftermath of a}} disaster. We find only weak evidence that those firms that had incurred damage, but were covered by business interruption insurance, had higher likelihood of survival post-quake compared with those firms that did not have insurance. This absence of evidence may reflect the high degree of uncertainty in the months following the 2011 earthquake and the multiplicity of severe aftershocks. For the medium-term, our results show a more explicit role for <b>insurance</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of a disaster. Firms with business interruption insurance have a higher probability of increasing productivity and improved performance following a catastrophe. Furthermore, our results show that those organisations that receive prompt and full payments of their claims have a better recovery, in terms of profitability and a subjective ‘”better off” measure’ than those that had protracted or inadequate claim payments (less than 80 % of the claim paid within 2. 5 years). Interestingly, the latter group does worse than those organisations that had damage but no insurance coverage. This analysis strongly indicates the importance not only of good insurance coverage, but of an insurance system that also delivers prompt claim payments. As a first paper attempting to empirically identify a causal effect of insurance on business recovery, we also emphasize some caveats to our analysis...|$|R

Interruptions are also explored in less safety-critical workplaces, such as offices, where interruptions can induce stress, anxiety, and poorer performance.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{isolated}} a cDNA clone {{for part}} of the α 2 type IV collagen (pCIV- 2 - 176). Deoxynucleotide sequence analysis shows that this clone codes for 439 amino acids from the helical domain adjacent to the C-terminal globular domain of the α 2 (IV) chain. By aligning the deduced amino acid sequence of the α 2 (IV) chain with the published sequence for the α 1 (IV) chain, we find that all <b>interruptions</b> <b>in</b> the α 1 (IV) chain coincide with an <b>interruption</b> <b>in</b> the α 2 (IV) chain.
