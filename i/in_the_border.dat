5|$|A {{mixture of}} the Mari Lwyd and Wassail customs occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> town of Chepstow, South Wales, every January. A band of English Wassailers meet with the local Welsh Border Morris Side, The Widders, on the bridge in Chepstow.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of U.S. naval interdiction efforts in coastal waters, known as Operation Market Time, the trail had to do double duty. Materiel sent from the north was stored in caches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> regions that were soon retitled Base Areas, which, in turn, became sanctuaries for NLF and PAVN forces seeking respite and resupply after conducting operations within South Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} many nearby Washington Metro rail {{stations}} in neighborhoods that <b>border</b> Landover, including <b>the</b> Addison Road Blue Line station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bordering</b> town of Seat Pleasant, the Cheverly Orange Line station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bordering</b> town of Cheverely, the Capital Heights Blue Line station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bordering</b> town of Capital Heights, the Largo Blue Line station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bordering</b> unincorporated area of Largo, and the Deanwood Orange Line station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District of Columbia.

50|$|<b>The</b> annual <b>Border</b> Shepherds Show, a {{traditional}} agricultural show or fair featuring sheep farming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> area of England and Scotland, is {{held on the}} second Saturday of October. The Alwinton show is the last agricultural show of <b>the</b> season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> area. Traditionally, it {{marks the end of}} summer and the time for hill farmers to begin preparations for winter.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> years 1945-1975 Kujawy was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> of Bydgoszcz {{province}}. Włocławek province {{was created}} <b>in</b> 1975, and <b>the</b> {{western part of}} Kujawy remained in Bydgoszcz province. <b>In</b> 1999 almost <b>the</b> whole of Kujawy was joined to the Kujawy-Pomerania province. Furthermore, small parts of Kujawy were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> of Masovia (regions between <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of <b>the</b> province and Skrwa Lewa River) and Wielkopolskie province (Przedecz, Wierzbinek).|$|R
5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> regions of South Vietnam. All of these attacks were {{conducted}} by regimental-size NVA/NLF units, but unlike the usual hit-and-run tactics used by the People's Army forces, these were sustained and bloody affairs.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the next}} two decades, the western reaches of Mysore {{remained}} vulnerable to attacks by the Coorg army. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> district of Yelusavira, the Coorg and Mysore forces fought to a stalemate and, in the end, had to work out a tax sharing arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a lack of {{substantial}} archaeological or literary evidence to support the defence-in-depth theory. J.C. Mann points out that there is no evidence, either in the Notitia Dignitatum or in the archaeological record, that units along the Rhine or Danube were stationed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> hinterlands. On the contrary, virtually all forts identified as built or occupied in the 4th century on the Danube lay on, very near or even beyond the river, strikingly similar to the 2nd-century distribution.|$|E

5|$|In July 1861, Stevens {{secured the}} passage of an act to {{confiscate}} the property, including slaves, of certain rebels. In November 1861, Stevens introduced a resolution to emancipate all slaves; it was defeated. However, legislation did pass that abolished slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories. By March 1862, to Stevens's exasperation, the most Lincoln had publicly supported was gradual emancipation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Border</b> states, with the masters compensated by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|In September 1277 King Ottokar II held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> city of Opava {{a meeting}} of Polish princes. Sources doesn't specify either the exact date or the participants. Historians {{speculate}} only that they could be: Henryk IV Probus, Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black, Władysław of Opole with his sons, Henry III of Głogów and Przemysł II. Several political decisions were made during the meeting, most notably military actions against Germany.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the Manners, Etal Castle was managed by the Collingwood family, who {{gradually}} became the castle's hereditary constables, renting the demesne lands on the estate from the family as well. The castle was heavily involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> wars with Scotland, usually holding a garrison of 100 men and forming an important strategic defensive location, one step removed from the fortifications along the border itself.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May 2013, two rockets hit a Hezbollah area of Beirut {{injuring}} {{five people}} whilst another two rockets caused property {{damage to buildings}} in the al-Hermel district of Beirut. Syrian rebels have been blamed for the attack as they had promised to attack Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in retaliation for their helping the Syrian army particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> town of Al-Qusayr. Syrian rebels have also shelled al-Hermel previously.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{continued}} {{to maintain a}} single checkpoint <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> village of Perevi.

5|$|The US {{government}} {{was aware of}} these activities in Cambodia, but refrained from taking overt military action within Cambodia in hopes of convincing the mercurial Sihanouk to alter his position. To accomplish this, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized covert cross-border reconnaissance operations conducted by the secret Studies and Observations Group in order to gather intelligence on PAVN/NLF activities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> regions (Project Vesuvius). This intelligence data would then {{be presented to the}} prince in an effort to change his mind.|$|E

5|$|The borders {{between the}} four {{subspecies}} are not sharp, because the subspecies interbreed. Many {{studies have been}} performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> regions to assess the intermediate turtles, usually by comparing the anatomical features of hybrids that result from intergradation of the classical subspecies. Despite the imprecision, the subspecies are assigned nominal ranges.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union military strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E
5|$|Bojić's matrilineal line traces {{its origins}} {{to the town}} of Tetovo, in what is now {{northern}} Macedonia. His mother's family had fled the town in 1690 as part of the Great Serb Migration and settled in Bečkerek (modern Zrenjanin). Bojić's maternal grandfather, Jovan, had lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> town of Pančevo since he was a child, married and started a family there. Much like Bojić's father, he was a successful shoemaker, and in 1890 he offered to marry his only daughter to him. After initial disagreement over the price of the dowry, Bogojević gave the marriage his blessing and Bojić's parents were soon married.|$|E
5|$|By late 1915, British forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> {{areas of}} Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. Disease {{was a constant}} curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would {{foot the bill for}} the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916—the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Office—recruitment began in May.|$|E
