5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up {{so that it is}} unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E

Digital downloads of a track were included from 2004 onwards and from 2014 onwards BPI-certified awards (Silver, Gold and Platinum) and the weekly charts include audio streaming. In 2017, the OCC included streaming in their <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> million-seller and published a full list of the 311 songs which had achieved this. Certified awards can also include shipments (sales to trade). The OCC and Music Week regularly announce when a record becomes a million seller.|$|E

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them. There is neither a standard <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Ceres (2.77AU) is {{the largest}} asteroid, a protoplanet, and a dwarf planet. It has a {{diameter}} of slightly under 1,000km, and a mass large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801, and was reclassified to asteroid in the 1850s as further observations revealed additional asteroids. It was classified as a dwarf planet in 2006 when the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planet was created.|$|E
5|$|His {{interest}} in games {{led him to}} propose an early formal <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strategy, anticipating John von Neumann's more complete treatment {{of a few years}} later. Consequently, he is considered an early founder of modern game theory. As a result of his work on infinite games Steinhaus, together with another of his students, Jan Mycielski, proposed the Axiom of determinacy.|$|E

5|$|Ignosticism is {{the view}} that a {{coherent}} <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deity must be put forward before {{the question of the}} existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, the Roman Catholic Church, while {{supportive}} of ACA's objectives, voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that {{aspects of the}} mandate covering contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> religious organization violated the First Amendment right to {{free exercise of religion}} and conscience. Various lawsuits addressed these concerns.|$|E
5|$|Maupertuis' {{ideas were}} in {{opposition}} to the influence of early taxonomists like John Ray. In the late 17th century, Ray had given the first formal <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> biological species, which he described as being characterized by essential unchanging features, and stated the seed of one species could never give rise to another. The ideas of Ray and other 17th-century taxonomists were influenced by natural theology and the argument from design.|$|E

Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E
5|$|Some of them, such as Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris, were heralded in {{the popular}} press as the tenth planet, failing to receive {{widespread}} scientific recognition.

By this definition all of the elements in groups 3â€“11 are transition metals. The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.|$|E
5|$|The {{demarcation}} between carnivorous and protocarnivorous is blurred by {{the lack}} of a strict definition of botanical carnivory and ambiguous academic literature on the subject. Many examples of protocarnivorous plants exist, some of which are counted among the ranks of true carnivorous plants as a matter of historical preference. Further research into these plants' carnivorous adaptations may reveal that a few protocarnivorous plants do meet the more rigid <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> carnivorous plant.|$|E
