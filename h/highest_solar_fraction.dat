40|$|Abstract—In {{the current}} study, {{research}} on the performance characteristics of an adsorption cooling system supplied by solar energy is presented. The main task for the analyzed system was to ensure cooling load for the non-residential building in cold climate country. A 8. 0 kW adsorption thermal cooling system was studied. The system got heat produced by evacuated tube solar collectors. The parametric simulation study was carried using a TRNSYS (Transient Systems Simulation) program to {{determine the influence of}} various parameters on the system performance. The dependencies of collector slope and the total absorber area on solar fraction, discarded energy, coefficient of performance, seasonal performance factor were studied. The <b>highest</b> <b>solar</b> <b>fraction,</b> coefficient of performance and seasonal performance factor values were obtained if the collector slope was approximately 30 degrees and the absorber area was 16 m 2 for the analyzed cases. The total primary energy consumption of the system was examined for various cases of primary energy factor for auxiliary heat and consumed electricity. On the basis of the results, it was proposed the expression of total primary energy consumption. The obtained results could be used for the recommendation preparations for decision makers to select a small scale solar cooling adsorption system.

40|$|The {{importance}} of investigating cost reduction in {{materials and components}} for solar thermal systems is crucial at the present time. This work focuses {{on the influence of}} two different heat exchangers on the performance of a solar thermal system. Both heat exchangers studied are immersed helically coiled, one made with corrugated stainless steel tube, and the other made with finned copper tube with smooth inner surface. A test apparatus has been designed and a simple test procedure applied in order to study heat transfer characteristics and pressure drop of both coils. Thereafter, the resulting experimental data was used to perform a parameter identification of the heat exchangers, in order to obtain a TRNSYS model with its corresponding numerical expression. Also a representative small-scale combisystem model was designed in TRNSYS, in order to study the influence of both heat exchangers on the solar fraction of the system, when working at different flow rates. It has been found that the <b>highest</b> <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> is given by the corrugated stainless steel coil, when it works at the lowest flow rate (100 l/hr). For any higher flow rate, the studied copper coil presents a higher solar fraction. The advantageous low flow performance of stainless steel heat exchanger turns out to be beneficial for the particular case of solar thermal systems, where {{it is well known that}} low flow collector loops lead to enhanced store stratification, and consequently higher solar fractions. Finally, an optimization of the stainless steel heat exchanger length is carried out, according to economic figures. For the given combisystem model and boundary conditions, the optimum length value is found between 10 and 12 m...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an efficient and cost-effective heat storage {{is still one of}} the major technical challenges for the widespread use of solar thermal energy for space heating. Up to now solar heat has been stored mostly in well insulated water tanks. The volume of these tanks is as large as 3 m for relatively <b>high</b> <b>solar</b> <b>fractions</b> and up to 70 m for full solar coverage for a single-family house. Storage tanks of this size are expensive and space consuming. In new buildings, provisions can be made to accommodate large storage volumes but this type of system is not likely to become a standard heating system. For retrofitting, large storage volumes are often impossible because of its space requirements or simply the fact that large tanks cannot be brought into the building. Sorption heat stores are a promising approach to reach <b>high</b> <b>solar</b> <b>fractions</b> with relatively small storage volumes. A number of theoretical studies as well as laboratory tests have been performed in recent years (Welteroth and Mittelbach (2001), Núñez et al. (2003), Gartler et al. (2004)). The general functioning of the principle has been shown. The goal of the project described in this paper was to improve the system design in order to reduce system losses and to improve the overall performance of the system. A new prototype system has been designed and tested in the laboratory. A number of different materials have been suggested for use as adsorbent and working fluid (Núñez (2001)). In the underlying project, silica gel and water have been used as working pair. The reasons for choosing this material are that silica gel and water are environmentally harmless, relatively cheap (mass production) and that the temperature needed for almost complete desorption can easily be reached with standard flat plate collectors...|$|R

Regarding the preferred technology, the central receiver concept, although potentially more efficient then trough since it fits into a combined cycle plant- is neither technologically mature enough nor proven for commercial application. The Fresnel concept is in a similar development stage. The trough technology, used for the SEGS plants, is the only mature and proven technology ready for application today. The current trough plants use the solar steam to directly drive the turbine at 371 oC, due to the thermal oil limitations. This paper analyzes the option of further superheating the steam to 540 oC- the optimal temperature for commercial steam turbine.

There are methods for estimating the yearly angular irradiation distribution, but {{there is a lack of}} methods for describing the load and the storage in such a way as to enable optical design of season and load adapted collectors. This report describes two methods for estimation of solar system performance with relevance for season and load adaption. Results regarding attainable <b>solar</b> <b>fractions</b> as a function of collector features, load profiles, load levels and storage characteristics are reported. The first method uses monthly collector output data at fixed temperatures from the simulation program MINSUN for estimating <b>solar</b> <b>fractions</b> for different load profiles and load levels. The load level is defined as estimated yearly collector output at constant collector temperature divided be yearly load. This table may examplify the results:CollectorLoadLoadSolar Improvementtypeprofile levelfractionover flat plateFlat plateDHW 75 % 59 %Load adaptedDHW 75 % 66 % 12 %Flat plateSpace heating 50 % 22 %Load adaptedSpace heating 50 % 28 % 29 %The second method utilises simulations with one-hour timesteps for collectors connected to a simplified storage and a variable load. Collector output, optical and thermal losses, heat overproduction, load level and storage temperature are presented as functions of solar incidence angles. These data are suitable for optical design of load adapted solar collectors. Results for a Stockholm location indicate that a solar combisystem with a <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> around 30 % should have collectors that reduce heat production at solar heights above 30 degrees and have optimum efficiency for solar heights between 8 and 30 degrees...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{new concept}} for solar active houses is {{presented}} within this paper. In contrast to existing solar house solutions, the solar collec- tor heat gains are distributed in a temperature-optimized way to three different heat sinks – a significantly smaller storage tank, concrete floor elements directly {{fed by the}} solar circuit and a ground heat exchanger which also serves as the heat source of a heat pump, which is the backup heater. This new layout should reduce the today's usual extra system costs of solar houses by about 25 %. System simulations prove the functionality of the concept and show even <b>higher</b> <b>solar</b> <b>fractions</b> and energy savings as simulated for the existing solar active house concept. One of the main components in the new concept is the controller which has to decide which heat sink will be charged. A control strategy was developed which evaluates the potential outputs of the collector opera- ting to each heat sink. Simulations allow determining the optimal control parameters for this approach. While the thermal activa- tion is able to compensate the decreasing solar input to the smaller storage tank, {{the effects of the}} regeneration of the ground heat exchanger are significantly smaller. However, the regeneration avoids a long-term temperature decrease in the ground and may allow a reduction of the heat exchanger area...|$|R
40|$|LDAC (liquid {{desiccant}} air-conditioning system) {{is promising}} {{for reducing the}} energy consumption, and improving the indoor air quality. In this paper, the operation performance of LDAC with internally cooled/heated dehumidifier/regenerator was simulated and optimized. The cooling tower and solar collectors were employed as the cooling/heating source. Four nested iteration loops were developed and solved for system modeling. A typical commercial building in Hong Kong was selected as a case study, which air-conditioning load was obtained by Energy-plus. Results show that {{with the increase of}} solar collector area, the electricity consumption of AC (air-conditioning systems) system reduced by 11 - 35 % in original system, but only a part of dehumidification demand was handled with liquid desiccant ventilation, which led to a low chiller COP (coefficient of performance). By adding a cooling coil for the solution entering dehumidifier, the electricity saving effectively increased to 22 - 47 %, while the heat demand for regeneration also increased by 17 %. So, a heat exchanger between water leaving regenerator and solution leaving dehumidifier was introduced. With the lower thermal requirement (reduced by 20 %) and <b>higher</b> <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> (increased from 30 to 40 %), the saving further increased to 29 - 49 %, and the required collector area obviously reduced by 50 - 60 % for the similar energy saving purpose.

40|$|The {{energy demand}} for cooling is {{continuously}} increasing due to growing thermal loads, changing architectural modes of building, and especially due to occupants indoor comfort requirements resulting higher electricity demand notably during peak load hours. This increasing electricity demand is resulting higher {{primary energy consumption}} and emission of green house gases (GHG) due to electricity generation from fossil fuels. An exciting alternative to reduce the peak electricity consumption is the possible utilization of solar heat to run thermally driven cooling machines instead of vapor compression machines utilizing high amount of electricity. In order to widen the use of solar collectors, they should {{also be used to}} contribute for sanitary hot water production and space heating. Pakistan lying on solar belt has a huge potential to utilize solar thermal heat for heating and cooling requirement because cooling is dominant throughout the year and the enormous amount of radiation availability provides an opportunity to use it for solar thermal driven cooling systems. The sensitivity analysis of solar assisted heating and cooling system has been carried out under climatic conditions of Faisalabad (Pakistan) and its economic feasibility has been calculated using maximization of NPV. Both storage size and collector area has been optimized using different economic boundary conditions. Results show that optimum area of collector lies between 0. 26 m 2 to 0. 36 m 2 of collector area per m 2 of conditioned area for i eff values of 4. 5 % to 0. 5 %. The optimum area of collector increases by decreasing effective interest rate resulting <b>higher</b> <b>solar</b> <b>fraction.</b> The NPV was found to be negative for all i eff values which shows that some incentives/subsidies are needed to be provided to make the system cost beneficial. Results also show that <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> space heating varies between 87 and 100 % during heating season and <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> cooling between 55 and 100 % during cooling season which indicates a huge amount of conventional energy saving potential...|$|R
40|$|In Sweden, {{there are}} roughly {{half a million}} single family houses that use {{electric}} heating for both domestic hot water production and space heating. Since electricity {{is the most expensive}} energy source in Sweden, it is interesting to install a <b>high</b> <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>solar</b> thermal system to reduce the energy use in these houses. One of the most significant bottlenecks for deployment of solar heating technology is economic profitability due to high investment costs. During this investigation a system that retrofits existing domestic hot water heaters was developed. This has the potential to significantly reduce the investment costs regarding both material and installation. Three different collectors were also tested. Their suitability {{to be part of the}} retrofitted solar domestic hot water system was addressed. These were a one-axis tracking photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) concentrating hybrid and two stationary compound parabolic concentrating (CPC) collectors with the same geometry. One of the CPC collectors was a thermal collector while the other was a PV/T hybrid collector. The aim for PV/T concentrating hybrid collectors is to produce both heat and electricity at a lower cost than conventional alternatives. The CPC-thermal collector design aims to adapt the solar production to the yearly consumption profile in order to achieve a <b>higher</b> annual <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> without increasing the stagnation periods. Outdoor measurements were carried out to characterise the collectors. For the retrofitted system, several system configurations were theoretically analysed by means of simulation models using TRNSYS software. A prototype of the retrofitted system was built and the simulation model was revised and validated against measurements. The validated model was further used to optimize the performance of the system and to carry out a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, an add-on retrofitting unit that is able to connect solar collectors to existing hot water heaters was also designed and built. Measurement results showed that the efficiency values of the tracking concentrating PV/T hybrid are lower than those of conventional flat plate collectors and PV modules. The usable incident irradiation on the one-axis tracking concentrating surface is also lower than the usable irradiation incident on an optimally tilted flat surface. Even though the studied hybrid has potential for improvement, the combination of low efficiencies with low usable irradiation levels makes it difficult for concentrating PV/T hybrids to compete with conventional alternatives, especially in countries where the annual beam irradiation values are low. The geometry of the tested stationary CPC-PV/T hybrid collector was shown not to be the most appropriate for hybrid applications. The studied CPC-thermal collector system was found to achieve a <b>higher</b> annual <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> than a conventional flat plate collector system while making use of less absorber surface, one of the most expensive components in the collector. It is concluded that the CPC-thermal collector is adequate to be part of the retrofitting solar domestic hot water system in Swedish single family houses. The decrease in absorber area together with the increase in performance must compensate for the additional cost of extra materials such as reflectors, glass and frames. The investigation of the retrofit system showed that an annual <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> of 58 % can be achieved in Sweden when a 200 -litre hot water heater is retrofitted and 6 m 2 of flat plate collectors is used. The investment cost of the developed retrofit solution was estimated to be reduced by roughly one third compared with a conventional solar domestic hot water system. This means that the developed retrofit system achieves a comparable performance with conventional solar domestic hot water systems in single-family houses with a significant reduction in investment cost. The developed retrofitting solution is therefore considered to have the potential to become a competitive solution in the solar domestic hot water market...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{reliable}} {{solar thermal}} cooling and heating system with <b>high</b> <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> and seasonal {{energy efficiency ratio}} (SEER) is preferable. By now, bulky sensible buffer tanks are used to improve the <b>solar</b> <b>fraction</b> for heating purposes. During summertime when solar heat is converted into useful cold by means of sorption chillers the waste heat dissipation to the ambient is the critical factor. If a dry cooler is installed the performance of the sorption machine suffers from high cooling water temperatures, especially on hot days. In contrast, a wet cooling tower causes expensive water treatment, formation of fog and the risk of legionella and bacterial growth. To overcome these problems a latent heat storage based on a cheap salt hydrate has been developed to support a dry cooler on hot days, whereby a constant low cooling water temperature for the sorption machine is ensured. Therefore the need of a wet cooling tower is avoided and neither make-up water nor maintenance is needed. The same storage serves as additional low temperature heat storage for heating purposes allowing optimal solar yield due to constant low storage temperatures. Four pilot installations between 7 kW and 90 kW nominal cooling capacity were equipped with latent heat storages between 80 kWh and 240 kWh energy content. Annual in situ measurement data shows a positive effect on the {{seasonal energy efficiency ratio}} (SEER) for cooling up to 11. 4. Furthermore simulation results under different climatic conditions indicate raising efficiency up to 64 % compared to a system with solely dry re-cooling. Long-term test bench measuring data concerning performance and durability as well as a new approach for a state of charge detection for latent heat storages are presented as well...|$|R
