5|$|Several {{versions}} of Blade Runner have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews <b>in</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> Dallas in March 1982. Negative {{responses to the}} previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version. The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre. Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut. A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.|$|E
5|$|Despite its severe {{financial}} straits, by 1953, DuMont {{appeared to}} be {{on its way to}} establishing itself as the third national network. DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, but it could count on only seven primary stations – its three owned-and-operated stations ("O"), plus WGN-TV in Chicago, KTTV (channel 11) in Los Angeles, KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV) <b>in</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio. In contrast, ABC had a full complement of five O, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network (it was descended from NBC's Blue Network) from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty and a profit stream to subsidize television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while CBS and NBC had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters (the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off {{as a result of the}} United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. antitrust decision), but it was not until 1953 that the FCC approved the merger.|$|E

25|$|On July 14, 1994, Westinghouse Broadcasting (Group W) {{signed a}} {{long-term}} affiliation deal with CBS, {{part of which}} resulted in three Westinghouse-owned stations (WBZ-TV in Boston, WJZ-TV in Baltimore and KYW-TV in Philadelphia) becoming CBS affiliates. As a sidebar, a subsequent deal between NBC and a new joint venture between Group W and CBS was reached in November 1994, with CBS selling the channel 6 transmitter facility and license to NBC as compensation {{for the loss of}} Westinghouse-owned NBC affiliates KYW-TV and WBZ-TV. In return, Group W/CBS received the stronger channel 4 transmitter facility, license and cash as compensation for the loss of Philadelphia's WCAU-TV, which was being acquired by NBC. NBC also included two of its owned-and-operated stations, KCNC-TV <b>in</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> KUTV in Salt Lake City, in the trade agreement with Group W/CBS.|$|E

He played for the Dallas Stars Bantam Major team, scoring 33 points in 31 games. In the 2009 Bantam draft the Everett Silvertips selected Jones eleventh overall. He was projected to be a higher pick in the draft, but concerns that he would choose to play college hockey over the Western Hockey League (WHL) caused him to be selected lower. After being drafted Jones played another season in Dallas, with the Stars U-18 team before joining the NTDP.|$|E
25|$|Jim Levy, by 1882, {{has already}} built a {{reputation}} of having fought in at least 16 gunfights. In June 5, 1882, Levy had another argument with a faro dealer named John Murphy in Tucson, Arizona. The two agreed to have a duel in the Mexican border, but after hearing of Levy's exploits as a gunfighter, Murphy decided to ambush Levy instead. Together {{with two of his}} friends, Murphy ambushed Levy as he was leaving the Palace Hotel, killing him. According to Wright, the three co-defendants in Leavy's murder later escaped from the Pima County Jail and were later recaptured. Murphy and Gibson were found in Fenner, California living under assumed names and retried for the murder before being found not guilty. Moyer was captured <b>in</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to life in Yuma Territorial Prison, but was pardoned in 1888.|$|E
25|$|While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV {{switched}} to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive {{taxes on the}} proceeds from the deal. To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in late 1994. NBC traded KCNC-TV <b>in</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> KUTV in Salt Lake City (which NBC had acquired earlier that year) to CBS in return for WCAU, which for legal reasons would be an even trade—displacing their respective longtime network affiliates, KMGH-TV and KSL-TV. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W {{in return for a}} minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, NBC and CBS traded broadcasting facilities in Miami. The deal officially took effect at 12:30a.m. on September 10, 1995. The final NBC program aired on KYW-TV was a rerun of Saturday Night Live, which began at 11:30p.m. on September 9, 1995.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} season (ranked {{fifth in the}} ratings), Alexis marries Cecil on his deathbed and acquires his company, Colbyco. In the meantime, Adam Carrington (Gordon Thomson), the long-lost son of Alexis and Blake who had been kidnapped in infancy, reappears <b>in</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> almost starts an affair with Fallon, who is running Blake's hotel La Mirage before they {{discover}} they are siblings. Also introduced are Krystle's ex-husband, tennis pro Mark Jennings (Geoffrey Scott), and Kirby Anders (Kathleen Beller), the daughter of longtime Carrington majordomo Joseph (Lee Bergere). Kirby catches Adam's eye but weds Jeff after his divorce from Fallon. In {{the middle of the}} season, news that Steven has been killed in an accident in Indonesia comes to the Carringtons; he survives, but undergoes plastic surgery and returns to Denver (portrayed by Jack Coleman). In the third-season cliffhanger, Alexis lures Krystle to Steven's cabin and the two are locked inside while the cabin is set ablaze by an unseen arsonist (later revealed to be Joseph, who had meant for the fire to kill only Alexis and not Krystle).|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Westinghouse Broadcasting (Group W) {{signed a}} {{long-term}} deal with CBS, in which three Westinghouse-owned stations (one that was aligned with ABC and two that also were aligned with NBC) would become CBS affiliates, joining two other stations {{owned by the}} company that were already affiliated with that network. Westinghouse would later acquire CBS that August, turning all of the Group W radio and television stations into CBS owned-and-operated television and radio stations. One of the stations involved in the affiliation agreement was Philadelphia's longtime NBC affiliate, KYW-TV. CBS decided to sell off its longtime O in that market, WCAU-TV. This led to a deal that was struck on November 21, 1994 between CBS and NBC, in which CBS sold the channel 6 transmitter facility and license to NBC as compensation {{for the loss of}} KYW-TV and Westinghouse's other NBC affiliate, WBZ-TV in Boston. In return, CBS received the stronger channel 4 transmitter facility, license and cash as compensation for the loss of WCAU (KCNC-TV <b>in</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> KUTV in Salt Lake City were both purchased by, and ended up switching to CBS {{as a result of this}} deal).|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{building}} of the arena in the Meadowlands was to potentially lure a National Hockey League team to New Jersey. Governor Byrne was a member of an ownership group that was looking to do so, and in 1978 businessman Arthur Imperatore purchased the Colorado Rockies of the NHL and announced that he would be moving the team out of McNichols Sports Arena <b>in</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> relocating them to New Jersey. The NHL initially rejected the move as the arena was yet to be completed and, unlike the situation when the Nets moved, there was no arena in New Jersey at that time that would fit NHL standards as even a temporary home. Imperatore sold the team to Houston Astros owner Dr. John McMullen in 1982. When the arena was completed McMullen, who was a native New Jerseyan like Imperatore, announced that he had big plans for the team, including the long-planned move, and in the off-season the Rockies moved operations to New Jersey, where they became known as the Devils. The first NHL game played at Byrne Arena pitted the Devils against the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 5, 1982, and the game ended in a 3–3 tie. The next season, the NHL All-Star Game was hosted by the Devils at the arena.|$|E
