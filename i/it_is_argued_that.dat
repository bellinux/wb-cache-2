5|$|Creationists {{claim that}} {{evolution}} relies on {{certain types of}} evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> radiometric dating technique of evaluating a material's age based on the radioactive decay rates of certain isotopes generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. Radiocarbon dating based on the carbon-14 isotope has been particularly criticized. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> radiometric decay relies {{on a number of}} unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of uniformitarianism, consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as closed systems. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.|$|E
5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> these <b>were</b> worth preserving.|$|R
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> many {{structures}} <b>were</b> nonadaptive (functionless), so {{they could}} not have evolved under natural selection.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the final}} scene of the movie {{inspired}} {{the final scene}} in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.|$|R
5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{objections}} to evolution allege that evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the teaching of}} evolution degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters irreligion or atheism. These may be considered appeals to consequences (a form of logical fallacy), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory {{have nothing to do with}} its objective empirical reality.|$|E
5|$|Recent studies, {{based on}} the {{discovery}} of a penny of Eanred for which a date no earlier than c. 850 is proposed, suggest a very different dating for ninth-century Northumbrian kings. From this, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Eardwulf's second reign ended circa 830, rather than in the years soon after 810, and that the reigns of subsequent kings should be re-dated accordingly: Eanred from 830 to 854, Æthelred II from 854 to 862, Rædwulf in 858, and Osberht from 862 to 867.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not {{a decisive}} factor, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> freedom of {{communication}} falls under freedom of interstate intercourse.|$|R
50|$|He appealed {{against his}} {{conviction}} to the Court of Appeal of New Zealand with several arguments. First, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the trial judge, Judith Potter, did not properly instruct the jury {{on the law}} relating to insanity. Second, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> manslaughter should have been available to the jury as an alternative verdict to murder. On 7 September 2007 the Court of Appeal overturned Dixon's convictions and ordered a new trial.|$|R
50|$|Because of the territory's small size, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> rugby sevens {{would be}} more useful in {{promoting}} the game than 15-a-side.|$|R
5|$|Similarly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution {{is required to}} interpret the evidence. An {{example of this is}} the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> evolution and religion {{have one or}} more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular {{in recent years as}} the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E
25|$|<b>It's</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> this {{statement}} had implications on the Likud {{victory in the}} election. Following the elections, Netanyahu said he regretted the message.|$|R
50|$|At the BC provincial court, Goltz <b>was</b> convicted. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{provision}} violated the right against {{cruel and unusual}} punishment, but was rejected.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> human {{trafficking}} <b>was</b> fuelled by {{a demand for}} sex and that therefore a ban was necessary, and whether solicitation was offensive.|$|R
5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country may be able to skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns have been raised about the jobless nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule in the Congo. Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the reduction in the}} Congo was atypical and {{can be attributed to the}} direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate. Estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or mortality displacement) remain disputed but range between two and 13 million.|$|E
50|$|Further <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not {{unreasonable}} {{to assume that}} the telephone company would use electronic equipment to keep records of all telephone numbers dialed.|$|R
50|$|Section 204 {{does not}} violate {{the right to a}} fair trial. In S v Suliman, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does so violate; the court disagreed.|$|R
25|$|In 1997, a {{book was}} {{published}} that theorized Bartholomew Roberts was a woman transvestite. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Roberts' corpse <b>was</b> thrown overboard to conceal this fact.|$|R
25|$|The early mammals {{had lower}} body {{temperatures}} and thus their testes worked efficiently within their body. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> boreotherian mammals have higher body temperatures {{than the other}} mammals and had to develop external testes to keep them cool. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> those mammals with internal testes, such as the monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and rhinoceroses, have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes.|$|E
25|$|Special {{schools have}} been criticized. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> special {{education}} separates and discriminates against those who are disabled or different.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> life {{requires}} terrestrial planets like Earth and as gas giants lack such a surface, that complex life cannot arise there.|$|E
50|$|In an {{analysis}} of the effect of sanctions on South Africa by the FW de Klerk Foundation, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> not a leading contributor to the political reforms leading to the end of Apartheid. The analysis concluded that in many instances sanctions undermined effective reform forces, such as the changing economic and social order within South Africa. Furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> forces encouraging economic growth and development resulted in a more international and liberal outlook amongst South Africans, and were far more powerful agents of reform than sanctions.|$|R
25|$|Linking the {{political}} and intercommunal schism in Identity politics was criticized by conservative intellectuals. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Mizrahi identity <b>is</b> an anachronism which endangers the Israeli melting pot.|$|R
50|$|On appeal, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{payment for}} light and water, which were {{undertaken}} as separate obligations, {{could be counted}} as rent. The court {{said that this was}} incorrect.|$|R
25|$|In the {{sentences}} above ‘the element of result’ {{does not seem}} apparent. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the concrete result and the result phase should be distinguished from each other.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the 2002 {{version of}} the FMA would have {{severely}} affected the ability of heterosexual unmarried couples to seek some degree of legal protection and/or provisions.|$|E
25|$|A staple gimmick {{present in}} lucha libre since the 1950s is exótico, {{basically}} a gay character in drag. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the gimmick has recently attained a more flamboyant outlook.|$|E
50|$|Linking the {{political}} and intercommunal schism in Identity politics was criticized by conservative intellectuals. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Mizrahi identity <b>is</b> an anachronism which endangers the Israeli melting pot.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the use of}} cruise {{missiles}} by the US government increased the risk of nuclear war and that Canada's participation made Canada a more likely target.|$|R
5000|$|With his appointment, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> [...] "for {{the first}} time... Goa's Roman Catholic patriarch is a Goan". Prior to this [...] "the {{appointee}} for centuries was Portuguese." ...|$|R
