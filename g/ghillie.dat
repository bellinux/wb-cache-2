25|$|A mysterious duo {{known as}} the 'Bushman of Rahway' are {{reported}} to frequent the Rahway River Parkway disguised as talking bushes. Dressed in <b>ghillie</b> suits, the pair {{stand up and say}} 'Hi' to unsuspecting passers-by. Their actions have generated local and international controversy. While some find their prank humorous, local law enforcement have threatened them with arrest if caught.|$|E
25|$|Though {{less common}} among men's suits in the west, other jacket styles feature no lapels. Jackets with {{mandarin}} collars, also called stand collars, band collars or choker collars, include Nehru jackets and various military dress uniforms, {{such as the}} British Army and US Marine Corps. Turndown collars, also called Prussian collars and <b>ghillie</b> collars, were once common on military uniforms and on the Mao suit.|$|E

50|$|Born {{and raised}} in his {{hometown}} of Prestonpans, Alex was brought up in the same town that was made famous by the Jacobite battlefield of the Battle of Prestonpans and was surrounded by countless other historical sites in East Lothian. Using the rich history of his surroundings as inspiration, he has, through his song writing, tried to spread his interest in the Scottish history of his home. As a two-time winner of 'Burnsong', an international songwriting competition held to celebrate the works of Robert Burns, Alex has played in the Scottish Parliament Building, at Balmoral Castle for Queen Elizabeth II at her annual <b>Ghillie's</b> Ball and has travelled the world celebrating his Scottish heritage through song.|$|R
50|$|His only {{appearance}} in Monarch of the Glen was in series six, episode six. Jackie is an elderly {{good friend of}} Donald MacDonald and used {{to be part of}} Donald's car crew when they were young. Jackie came to Glenbogle in series six for his stag-do, but realises he is too old. Jackie, Donald and nineteen-year-old chef Ewan Brodie go to party at the <b>Ghillie's</b> Rest, but get a bit bored and end up at dancing at Meg Paterson's dancing class! Jackie started to torment Donald about not having a girlfriend or wife, {{and the fact that it}} was Donald who was the famous one, and that he wasn't a very good driver anyway. Ewan sorted Jackie out, and they all became friends again. Jackie left Glenbogle a married man.|$|R
25|$|The Highlander {{developed}} “as {{a necessary}} {{preparation for the}} management of the broad-sword… used in certain dances to exhibit their dexterity”; this included dancing over two naked swords which are laid across each other on the floor, some while a dancer moves nimbly around them. Dextrously placing the feet by a peculiar step in the intervals between crossed blades, as in the <b>Ghillie</b> Callum, has long been linked with dances before a decisive battle or as a victory dance. Legend has it that on the eve of battle the highland chief would call out the clan’s best dancers, who would dance the sword dance. If the dancers successfully avoided touching either blade, then it was considered an omen that the next day's battle would be in the clan’s favour. A more practical explanation behind the meaning of this dance {{can be found in the}} training halls of older styles of fencing, where students of the sword developed their footwork by following geometric patterns of crosses, squares and triangles marked out on the floor.|$|E

500|$|Olfactory {{camouflage}} {{is said to}} be rare; {{examples include}} <b>ghillie</b> suits, special garments for military snipers made from strips of hessian cloth, which are sometimes treated with mud and even manure to give them an [...] "earthy" [...] smell to cover the smell of the sniper.|$|E
500|$|Burnham's most {{accomplished}} soldiers during the Second Boer War were the Lovat Scouts, a Scottish Highland regiment he commanded, whom {{he described as}} [...] "half wolf and half jackrabbit." [...] Formed by Lord Lovat in 1899, this yeomanry unit {{was the first to}} wear <b>Ghillie</b> suits, a type of camouflage clothing developed to resemble heavy foliage. These scouts were well practiced in the arts of marksmanship, field craft, and tactics. After the war, the Lovat Scouts {{went on to become the}} British army's first sniper unit.|$|E
500|$|In the video, {{the members}} of OK Go are seen in a field wearing marching band garb. The uniforms were {{originally}} from Rochelle Township High School of Rochelle, Illinois. They begin to march, and as the song progresses, the band is joined {{by members of the}} University of Notre Dame's Marching Band many of whom rise up camouflaged in <b>ghillie</b> suits. [...] They are also joined in the final chorus by a children's choir cobbled together from two local South Bend preschools. [...] Like many of their other videos, the marching band video was shot in one take.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{principles}} can {{be applied}} for military purposes, for instance when a sniper wears a <b>ghillie</b> suit designed to be further camouflaged by decoration with materials such as tufts of grass from the sniper's immediate environment. Such suits were used as early as 1916, the British army having adopted [...] "coats of motley hue and stripes of paint" [...] for snipers. Cott takes {{the example of the}} larva of the blotched emerald moth, which fixes a screen of fragments of leaves to its specially hooked bristles, to argue that military camouflage uses the same method, pointing out that the [...] "device is ... essentially the same as one widely practised during the Great War for the concealment, not of caterpillars, but of caterpillar-tractors, [...] battery positions, observation posts and so forth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following her {{appointment}} to the commission, news of her personal eccentricities began to emerge after reporters discovered she was living out of a 28-foot motor home, which was parked on a lot in rural Virginia. Each morning she was chauffeured from her RV to the AEC offices in Germantown, Maryland, accompanied by her [...] Scottish deerhound <b>Ghillie,</b> and a miniature poodle named Jacques. Media reports commented on her unusual hosiery (white knee socks).|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} little in the scene which lay so {{peaceful}} on this April morning to recall the sanguinary history of the Glen. Its sides at present were covered with a thick growth of gorse, elderberry, egg-plants, and <b>ghillie</b> flower, while the woods about it were loud with {{the voice of the}} throstle, the linnet, the magpie, the jackdaw, and other song-birds of the Highlands.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Ghillie</b> shirt, {{also known}} as Jacobean or Jacobite, is an {{informal}} traditional shirt usually worn with a kilt. The term <b>Ghillie</b> refers to the criss-crossed lacing style made of leather as also seen on the <b>Ghillie</b> Brogue. <b>Ghillie</b> shirts {{are considered to be}} more casual than their shirt and waist-coat counterpart that is normally seen with the kilt. The <b>Ghillie</b> shirt existed before the kilt, with there being no documentation for kilts until 1575.|$|E
50|$|Many snipers use <b>ghillie</b> {{suits to}} hide and stay hidden. <b>Ghillie</b> suits vary {{according}} to the terrain into which the sniper wishes to blend. For example, in dry, grassy wasteland the sniper will typically wear a <b>ghillie</b> suit covered in dead grass.|$|E
50|$|An {{inherent}} {{problem with}} <b>ghillie</b> suits is internal temperatures. Even in relatively moderate climates, the temperature {{inside of the}} <b>ghillie</b> suit can soar to over 50 °C (120 °F).|$|E
50|$|Snipers {{with extreme}} {{requirements}} for infiltration and camouflage use a <b>ghillie</b> suit. The <b>ghillie</b> suit was originally developed by Scottish game wardens to better count game and catch poachers.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>ghillie</b> {{suit was}} {{developed}} by Scottish gamekeepers as a portable hunting blind. Lovat Scouts, a Scottish Highland regiment formed by the British Army during the Second Boer War, is the first known military unit to use <b>ghillie</b> suits. In 1916, Lovat Scouts {{went on to become}} the British Army's first sniper unit. The term <b>ghillie</b> references <b>Ghillie</b> Dhu, derived from gille, the Scottish Gaelic for [...] "servant" [...] or a [...] "lad". In English, this term was especially used to refer to those assisting in deer hunting, deer stalking or fly fishing expeditions in the Scottish Highlands.|$|E
50|$|High-quality <b>ghillie</b> {{suits are}} made by hand; most {{military}} snipers generally construct their own unique suits. Manufactured <b>ghillie</b> suits can be assembled from up to six pieces. Proper camouflage {{requires the use of}} natural materials present in the environment in which a sniper will operate. Making a <b>ghillie</b> suit from scratch is time-consuming, and a detailed, high-quality suit can take weeks or even months to manufacture and season.Ghillie suits can be constructed in several different ways. Some military services make them of rough burlap flaps or jute twine attached to a poncho. Hunting <b>ghillie</b> suits can be made of nylon and other artificial materials as well as the ones listed before. United States military <b>ghillie</b> suits are often built using either a battle dress uniform (BDU), or a pilot's flight suit or some other one-piece coverall as the base.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ghillie</b> shirts are {{traditionally}} used for dances or ceilidhs {{as they are}} light and spacious to allow for air to pass through. They {{do not need to}} be worn with any sort of tie. The Irish version of the <b>Ghillie</b> shirt is the Grandfather shirt.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} episode with Jessie, {{a group of}} Mackenzie dignitaries were invited by the landowner, Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch, to get {{together}} to hunt and capture the <b>Ghillie</b> Dhu. The team of five hunters congregated {{at the home of}} one of Mackenzie's tenants where they were provided with an evening meal before setting off on their mission to shoot the <b>Ghillie</b> Dhu. Despite searching extensively throughout the night, the hunters could not find their prey; according to Patricia Monaghan, a writer on Celtic mythology, the <b>Ghillie</b> Dhu was never seen again.|$|E

50|$|Although highly effective, <b>ghillie</b> {{suits are}} {{impractical}} for many situations where camouflage is useful. They {{tend to be}} very heavy and hot. Even in moderate climates, the temperature inside the <b>ghillie</b> suit can reach over 50 °C (120 °F). The burlap is also flammable, unless treated with fire retardant, so the wearer may be at increased risk from ignition sources such as smoke grenades or white phosphorus.|$|E
5000|$|According to folklorist and scholar Katharine Briggs the <b>Ghillie</b> Dhu was {{a gentle}} and kind-hearted {{mountain}} spirit, or a [...] "rather unusual nature fairy." [...] The <b>Ghillie</b> Dhu was an individual male modern day fairy described by Osgood Mackenzie, a Scottish landowner and horticulturist, {{in his memoirs}} that were published in 1921. The fairy was generally timid, yet he could also be [...] "wild".|$|E

50|$|<b>Ghillie</b> suits can be {{constructed}} in several different ways. Some services make them of rough burlap (of the hessian kind) flaps attached to a net punch. U.S. Army <b>ghillie</b> suits are often built using a pilot's flight suit, or some other one-piece coverall as the base. A full cover of rough webbing or fishnetting in a durable fabric is attached in irregular patterns designed to hide lines and blend in. Then, this is weathered using mud, by dragging it under or running over it with a car. When on location, {{as much of the}} local foliage as possible without restricting movement is applied to blend in. It is customary for the <b>ghillie</b> suit to be made by the sniper, rather than bought.|$|E
