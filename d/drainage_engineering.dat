50|$|Environment Secretary Owen Paterson {{visited the}} area on 27 January 2014, and after meeting local MPs, the Environment Agency and various {{community}} representatives {{the night before}} in Taunton, promised at a media-only press conference at North Moor pumping station that if a local water management plan could be developed {{over the next six}} weeks, he would approve it. Such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers Tone and Parrett, and possibly a later sluice near Bridgwater. There have been public protests about the river Parrett not being dredged in recent years. The expense of ongoing dredging continued to be debated, however the Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed that dredging would resume once it was safe. Jean Venables {{the chief executive of the}} Association of <b>Drainage</b> Authorities said <b>engineering</b> measures costing around £60 million, and including a permanent pumping station at Dunball could help to relieve future flooding.|$|R
50|$|During the 18th century, Newport, Rhode Island's wealthy merchants {{developed}} country agricultural estates in the outlying towns. Following the Civil War, with a romanticizing of rural, country and farm life by Andrew Jackson Downing and others, estate farms for the Newport summer colony became widespread. Some {{of these were}} “model” farms based upon the latest agricultural practice, engineering and technology. Ogden Farm is such a “model” farm, named after Edward Ogden of New York City and Newport (1808-1872), whose summer house was on Narragansett Avenue. After Edward Ogden’s death, the property {{became known as the}} Ogden Farm. In 1867 Colonel Waring settled there to manage the farm. At Ogden Farm, he introduced Jersey cattle into the United States and founded the American Jersey Cattle Club. Waring is known to have laid clay drainage pipe there for field improvement, some of which is still extant. Waring devoted himself to agriculture, cattle breeding and drainage until 1877, when <b>drainage</b> and sanitary <b>engineering</b> became his major preoccupation.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the closed {{drainage}} {{systems have been}} used extensively in the <b>drainage</b> <b>engineering</b> in Egypt especially in the oasis area. El-Wady El-Gdid and Marse Matroh governorates are examples of the regions of such applications. El-Zayat drainage lake of area 450 feddans in El-Wady El-Gdid governorate is surrounded from the north by series of hills {{while the rest of}} borders are earth–fill embankments. Due to the increase in population, the sustainability activities increased and consequently, the drainage water supplied to the lake increased results in the raising of water level which in turn deteriorates the earth embankment. In this research, geodetic control network in El-zayat drainage lake using Global Positioning System (GPS) was established to produce topographical maps and estimated the capacity of this lake at different levels. The rehabilitation of the embankments was also redesigned to cope with the new working conditions.

When such beaches lose popularity, it is often related to the loss of beach space, erosion or degradation of the surrounding environment. In the case of erosion or loss of beach space, beach nourishment is now accepted as the best solution. It provides the sand and profile that is required to reduce wave energy but also provides economic returns as additional area for social and economic activities are created.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] SOFTANK model optimally designs the watershed-based tank system by simulating field, tank, and groundwater balances. We applied this model to a small watershed consisting of six tanks (small reservoirs) in the semiarid region of India. We evaluated the existing tank system in this watershed and compared it to a one-tank system. Results showed that one tank at the outlet of the watershed would have been more beneficial [with benefit-cost (BC) ratio of 1. 80] than the existing six-tank system (with BC ratio of 1. 71). Finally, we performed the analysis for obtaining the optimal tank system for the watershed, and we found that the tanks for irrigation purposes are not economical for the small watershed. The groundwater source was enough for irrigation, so any additional investment in the tanks would be uneconomical. The results demonstrate the importance of the watershed-based tank system approach to design...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInstalling {{drainage}} systems in saturated soils decreases {{the level of}} the subsurface water table and enables the creation of groundwater reservoirs without gravity water – i. e. drainage retention capacity (DREC). DREC, developed by the hydraulic functions of a drainage system, can be defined as a groundwater reservoir, which is limited by soil surface and which occupies an intermediate position in the water table. It is shaped in a parabola form, above the drains. DREC mitigates the negative impact of hydrological extremes, e. g. floods or rainstorms. The purpose of this paper is, to present a methodology for determining DREC {{on the basis of the}} height of the water level, in the midway between the drains; with description of the use of DREC for estimation of the rate of potential flooding of the landscape surface; and to describe the application of DREC in a <b>drainage</b> <b>engineering</b> project commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic for water regime protection in the Krisak mountain meadow agricultural area, Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic. The results obtained from in-situ experimental testing confirmed that the equations that are presented in this paper can serve as a reliable tool for DREC approximation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBuilding sector {{accounted}} for more than 30 % of global energy consumption and the importance of energy-efficient buildings has been frequently highlighted. Tiejian Tower of Tianjin is a well-known intelligent and energy-efficient building. Based on its construction engineering BOQ (Bill of quantities), this paper employed the input-output analysis to study its construction and operating energy consumption in detail. The construction project was divided into six sub-projects, which were structure and decoration engineering (SD), electrical engineering (EE), water supply and <b>drainage</b> <b>engineering</b> (WD), fire protection engineering (FP), heating, ventilation and air conditioning system engineering (HVAC) and intelligent system engineering (IS). Combined with the operating energy consumption data, the performance of Tiejian was estimated from a life cycle perspective. The results show that the embodied energy consumption of construction engineering is quantified as 1. 14 E+ 15 J. The structure and decoration engineering (SD) contributes almost 80 % of the construction energy consumption while the energy-efficient equipment and materials contribute a relatively small proportion. The energy consumption of operation stage is quantified as 4. 25 E+ 13 J for a year which is much lower than conventional buildings. Though the energy inputs at the construction stage are higher than conventional buildings, the total energy consumption is much lower than conventional ones from a long term perspective...|$|E
40|$|Cover- {{collapse}} sinkholes {{are forming}} {{with increasing frequency}} under buildings. Analyses of sinkhole distribution in Beacon Woods, Florida, preliminarily indicate their occurrence is {{an order of magnitude}} greater in urban versus undeveloped areas, suggesting the structures themselves are enhancing the collapse process. The most likely causes are induced recharge via at least one of two sources. First, runoff and drainage from roads, structures, and impoundments that is not adequately dispersed will promote sinkhole development. Second, leaking water, sewer, and septic systems beneath or adjacent to a structure will also promote collapse. The process of cover-collapse from induced recharge is well understood. However, building codes generally do not require <b>drainage</b> and structural <b>engineering</b> practices that would reduce induced recharge and thus reduce the risk of collapse. This paper proposes engineering practices that measurably restrict the accidental discharge of municipal water through leaking subgrade drainage systems or the deliberate discharge of stormwater runoff, induced shallow groundwater recharge from retention ponds and septic drainfields, or heavily-irrigated land use. We recommend these practices be incorporated into building codes and ordinances to reduce induced sinkhole development in areas prone to cover-collapse...|$|R
40|$|The Shendong coal mine, {{located in}} mid-western China, has {{specific}} hydrogeological and mining conditions {{from which a}} water resources protection method has been developed. It is proposed that this method {{can be applied to}} other arid and semi-arid mining areas. Based on analysis of the hydrogeological structure, the characteristics of groundwater-producing fracture zones in overburden rocks, the stability of the key aquiclude, the hydrogeological structure of Shendong coal mine area can be classified into five types. Field measurements show that the unconsolidated sand aquifer above the coal seam is an aquifer with abundant groundwater. The key aquiclude between this aquifer and the coal seam has permeable fracture zones that will be disrupted by mining. To protect the water resources in the aquifer, we developed a protection method by pre-draining the water before mining, then transferring and storing it in a sandstone confined aquifer underlying the coal seam. The water can then be utilized by pumped it out from the confined sandstone aquifer. The paper describes hydrogeological conditions, <b>drainage</b> and storage <b>engineering</b> layout and the design of the abstraction and injection wells.
