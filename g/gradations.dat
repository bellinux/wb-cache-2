5|$|Various {{panoramic}} {{views of}} the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various <b>gradations</b> of alternating bands {{of light and shadow}} towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{has used}} many <b>gradations</b> of lens filter in the past, but {{declined}} to do so on Body of Lies. One obtains better finesse using the digital intermediate during post-production and does not risk losing light while selecting filters during expensive on-set time. The filmmakers strove for authenticity and realism in the images, and as such little colouration was added after, and the natural contrast of colours between the locations in Washington and Morocco were allowed to show through.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell across it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and <b>gradations</b> as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{conditions of the}} Nganasan <b>gradation</b> can {{be shown to be}} identical to <b>gradation</b> in Finnic and Samic; that is, radical/syllabic <b>gradation</b> according to syllable closure, and suffixal/rhythmic <b>gradation</b> according to a syllable being of odd or even number, with rhythmic <b>gradation</b> particularly well-preserved.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gradation</b> is the {{simplest}} for geminated (long) plosives. These are simply reduced to their short versions in the weak grade. This type of <b>gradation</b> is called quantitative <b>gradation.</b>|$|R
50|$|A dense <b>gradation</b> {{refers to}} a sample that is {{approximately}} of equal amounts of various sizes of aggregate. By having a dense <b>gradation,</b> most of the air voids between the material are filled with particles. A dense <b>gradation</b> will result in an even curve on the <b>gradation</b> graph.|$|R
5|$|Hu {{lived in}} Nanjing during the {{transition}} from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty. A Ming loyalist, he was offered a position at the rump court of the Hongguang Emperor, but declined the post, and never held anything more than minor political office. He did, however, design the Hongguang Emperor's personal seal, and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor's capture and death in 1645. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio, in which he practised various multi-colour printing and embossing techniques, and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise. Hu's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking, leading to delicate <b>gradations</b> of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Light or Consciousness descends {{through a}} series of stages, <b>gradations,</b> worlds, or hypostases, {{becoming}} progressively more material and embodied. In time it will turn around to return to the One (epistrophe), retracing its steps through spiritual knowledge and contemplation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gradation</b> {{patterns}} for single plosives are more varied and unpredictable. As a general rule, voiceless plosives become voiced sounds, {{but there are}} several special types. This kind of <b>gradation</b> is called qualitative <b>gradation.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractAggregate {{takes up}} 60 %∼ 90 % of total volume of {{concrete}}. Thus, concrete properties are highly affected by physical properties of its aggregate such as aggregate size distribution. With {{a view to}} achieve optimized <b>gradation,</b> there are various aggregate <b>gradation</b> tools or methods, such as, <b>gradation</b> curve, individual percent retained (IPR) curve, “ 8 - 18 ” band and combined fineness modulus (fineness modulus of total aggregate) etc. In this research, a comparative analysis of various tools and methods of aggregate <b>gradation</b> was performed {{through a number of}} trial mixes. Also a comparison of combined <b>gradation</b> and fractional (mixing fine and coarse aggregate) <b>gradation</b> is given. The workability, density and strength results from these concrete mixes are finally compared to propose a suitable aggregate <b>gradation...</b>|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} uniform <b>gradation,</b> a narrow <b>gradation</b> is a sample that has {{aggregate}} of {{approximately the same}} size. The curve on the <b>gradation</b> graph is very steep, and occupies a small range of the aggregate.|$|R
25|$|The Midrash Tadshe {{must not}} be {{confused}} with another baraita bearing the title Baraita de-Rabbi b. Jair, which deals with <b>gradations</b> of virtues, the highest of which causes its possessor to share in the holy spirit (comp. Soṭah, end, and parallels).|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{illustrated}} {{books of}} the time, Utamakura is devoid of accompanying text, and employs luxurious techniques such as embossing, the dusting of mica for a glittering effect, and bokashi, a technique by which <b>gradations</b> of colour are achieved by applying different amounts of ink to the printing block.|$|E
25|$|According to the first, all {{the parts}} are {{connected}} by a rhythmic convention which is determined by one of them. This—its position on the canvas matters little—gives the painting a centre from which the <b>gradations</b> of colour proceed, or towards which they tend, according as the maximum or minimum of intensity resides there.|$|E

25|$|The Tequila Sunrise is a {{cocktail}} made of tequila, orange juice, and grenadine syrup and served unmixed {{in a tall}} glass. The modern drink originates from Sausalito in the early 1970s, after an earlier one created in the 1930s in Phoenix, near Scottsdale. The cocktail is named for its appearance when served, with <b>gradations</b> of color resembling a sunrise.|$|E
25|$|According to this paradigm, Creation {{proceeds}} as {{an outpouring}} {{or even a}} transformation in the original Absolute or Godhead. The Supreme Light or Consciousness descends {{through a series of}} stages, <b>gradations,</b> worlds or hypostases, becoming progressively more material and embodied, before finally turning around to return to the One, retracing its steps through spiritual knowledge, contemplation and ascent.|$|E
25|$|A Peregrinus (plural Peregrini) was {{originally}} {{any person who}} was not a full Roman citizen, that is someone {{who was not a}} member of the Cives Romani. With the expansion of Roman law to include more <b>gradations</b> of legal status, this term became less used, but the term peregrini included those of the latini, socii, and provinciales, as well as those subjects of foreign states.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Bailey method {{put forward}} three very {{significant}} parameters CA, FAc and FAf, provided {{an effective way}} for the asphalt mixture <b>gradation</b> test, and it could evaluate the <b>gradation</b> of asphalt pavement core sample effectively. Based on the analysis of common <b>gradation,</b> the parameters of formula was revised, the application conditions of AC mixture and the parameter range for AC mixture was proposed, that based on the <b>gradation</b> which is standard recommended and the core samples in different pavement conditions. The results proposed theoretical basis for <b>gradation</b> examination correctly with the Bailey method...|$|R
50|$|Unlike its {{southern}} neighbor Southern Sami, Ume Sami has consonant <b>gradation.</b> However, <b>gradation</b> is more limited {{than it is}} in the more northern Sami languages, because it occurs only after long vowels or diphthongs. Consonants following a short vowel do not participate in <b>gradation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, <b>gradation</b> {{applies to}} {{words that were}} {{inherited}} from Proto-Finnic or the period after it. It is no longer fully productive, however, so that words that could gradate often dont. Only quantitative <b>gradation</b> is still productive and applied to new words, while qualitative <b>gradation</b> is mostly restricted to somewhat older words.|$|R
25|$|Semi-quantitative assays, i.e. assays {{that give}} the {{read-out}} in an approximate fashion rather than an exact number for the quantity of the substance. Generally they {{have a few more}} <b>gradations</b> than just two outcomes, positive or negative, e.g. scoring on a scale of 1+ to 4+ as used for blood grouping tests based on RBC agglutination in response to grouping reagents (antibody against blood group antigens).|$|E
25|$|These <b>gradations</b> of cost may {{be further}} {{illustrated}} {{by means of}} the following simple diagram (diagram I), which illustrates the steps leading from the material cost to the selling price. This diagram is an extension of the analyses of cost accounting, Nicholson presented in 1909. This type of visual analytics was presented earlier by Church (1901), and became more common in introductory textbooks; see for example Webner (1911), Kimball (1914), Larson (1916), and Newlove (1923).|$|E
25|$|There were no Dukes {{made between}} William the Conqueror and Henry II; they were {{themselves}} only Dukes in France. When Edward III of England declared himself King of France, {{he made his}} sons Dukes, to distinguish them from other noblemen, much as Royal Dukes are now distinguished from other Dukes. Later Kings created Marquesses and Viscounts to make finer <b>gradations</b> of honour: a rank something more than an Earl and something less than an Earl, respectively.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{relationship}} between <b>gradation</b> and proportion of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) and design <b>gradation</b> of recycled mixture, the authors discussed the influence of proportion of RAP on <b>gradation</b> adjustment of recycled mixture. And then, recycled mixture with 0 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 % of RAP were made, and Influence of proportion of RAP on high and low temperature performance, water stability and anti-aging performance of recycled mixture were discussed. The results and analysis indicate that <b>gradation</b> of recycled mixture would not be adjusted to aiming <b>gradation</b> if proportion of RAP was too big. With the increase of proportion of RAP, high temperature performance and anti-aging performance of recycled mixture enhanced, but low temperature performance and water stability decayed sharply. In practical application, reasonable proportion of RAP should be determined according to <b>gradation,</b> performance demand and economy of recycled mixture...|$|R

25|$|The inverse {{relationship}} between consonant <b>gradation</b> and medial lenition of stops (the pattern also continuing within the three families where <b>gradation</b> is found) is noted by Helimski (1995): an original allophonic <b>gradation</b> system between voiceless and voiced stops would have been easily disrupted by a spreading of voicing to previously unvoiced stops as well.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, a trend {{developed}} in the sunbelt regions of the United States around Courtyard houses, especially in California and Florida. Designers such as the Davis family and the Zwebell family developed houses that used Mediterranean architecture, using very carefully planned courtyards, they managed to create both a sense of community, safety and scale. Using various levels of private/public <b>gradations</b> these courtyard houses were so successful that they have been copied throughout sunbelt of the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{torture chamber}} {{was the final}} {{destination}} in a progression of four cell types during incarceration at the Palace of the Inquisition. The palace contained the Judgement Hall, {{the offices of the}} employees, the private apartments of the Grand Inquisitor and the detention cells adjacent to the apartments. The detention cell <b>gradations</b> started with the cells of mercy reserved mainly for rich transgressors who upon bequeathing all their property to the Inquisition were normally let go after a time of detention in the cells.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} works by Metzinger {{of the same}} period, there are {{elements}} to be found of the real world, e.g., a fan, windows, and feathers. The rest of the canvas consists {{of a series of}} geometric forms of greater or lesser abstraction, of convex and concave <b>gradations</b> that stem from the teachings of Georges Seurat and Paul Cézanne. The Divisionist brushwork, mosaic-like 'cubes', present in Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist phase (circa 1903 through 1907) have returned giving texture and rhythm to vast areas of the canvas, visible both in the figures and background.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gradation</b> affects many {{properties}} of an aggregate. It affects bulk density, physical stability and permeability. With careful {{selection of the}} <b>gradation,</b> {{it is possible to}} achieve high bulk density, high physical stability, and low permeability. This is important because in pavement design, a workable, stable mix with resistance to water is important. With an open <b>gradation,</b> the bulk density is relatively low, {{due to the lack of}} fine particles, the physical stability is moderate, and the permeability is quite high. With a rich <b>gradation,</b> the bulk density will also be low, the physical stability is low, and the permeability is also low. The <b>gradation</b> can be affected to achieve the desired properties for the particular engineering application.|$|R
40|$|Koivulehto and Vennemann have {{recently}} (1996) revived Posti’s theory (1953) which attributed Finnic consonant <b>gradation</b> to Germanic influence, {{in particular to}} the influence of Verner’s law. This theory disregards the major differences between Finnic and Saami <b>gradation</b> (cf. Sammallahti 1998 : 3) and ignores the similar <b>gradation</b> in Nganasan and Selkup (cf. Kallio 2000 : 92) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Gradation</b> {{is usually}} {{specified}} for each engineering application {{it is used}} for. For example, foundations might only call for coarse aggregates, and therefore an open <b>gradation</b> is needed.|$|R
