40|$|This master’s thesis {{examined}} {{the concepts of}} health found in visual bodily representations on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of Danish fitness magazines from 1981 to 2011. Furthermore it was examined whether the bodily concepts of health on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of the magazines were similar to or deviated from contemporary official concepts of health. On {{the basis of an}} examination of all Danish fitness magazines occurring during the period 1981 to 2011, 8 <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> were picked out representing 4 intersection periods. These were 1981 - 84, 1987 - 92, 1996 - 2000 and 2005 - 2011. These 8 <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> were analysed with the semiotic conceptual framework presented in Jostein Gripsruds book Mediekultur, Mediesamfund (Gripsrud, 2005). I found, that the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> from 1981 - 84 in general focused on health as an idyllic muscle oriented body project which had almost no resemblance to concurrent official concepts of health. After the groundbreaking introduction of iFORM in 1987, the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> however found common denominators with the official concepts of health in a growing individualization, risk-orientation and lifestylization in the visual body representations of health concepts. With the emergence of Aktiv Træning in 2008 another paradigmatic break could be discerned, in which the human body increasingly seemed to be replaced by technologies like pulse-watches and bike-computers, which reduced the concepts of health to cold numbers on displays without any visual connections to the human body in flesh and blood. Despite similarities between the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> and contemporary official concepts of health, the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> always appear to be one step ahead and use a more radical expression of their bodily concepts of health. The <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of the fitness magazines therefore seem to offer a little exclusive insight into the tendencies of forthcoming policies of health. Finally I must conclude, that despite the diligent selection of the 8 <b>front</b> <b>pages,</b> this master’s thesis cannot be seen an exhaustive examination of all Danish fitness magazines from 1981 - 2011. Further examination of this field is therefore needed...|$|R
