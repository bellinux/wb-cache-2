500|$|Wilders stated about Israel: [...] "I {{have visited}} many {{interesting}} {{countries in the}} Middle East – from Syria to Egypt, from Tunisia to Turkey, from Cyprus to Iran – but nowhere did I have the special feeling of solidarity that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>get</b> when I land at Ben Gurion International Airport." [...] Dutch public TV channel Nederland 2's daily news programme Netwerk reported that numerous American supporters of Israel financially supported Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) and openly approved of his message towards Islam and Islamic terrorism. Wilders told an audience during the report that [...] "We [...] are all Israel". He has also said [...] "Israel is the West's first line of defence" [...] against what he perceives {{to be a threat}} posed by Islam.|$|E
500|$|The British Academy of Film and Television Arts gave {{awards to}} Sylbert, Caglione and Drexler at the 44th British Academy Film Awards. Pacino, Canonero, editor Richard Marks, {{and both the}} sound design and visual effects {{departments}} received nominations. At the 48th Golden Globe Awards, Pacino and Sondheim (for both [...] "Sooner of Later (<b>I</b> <b>Always</b> <b>Get</b> My Man)" [...] and [...] "What Can You Lose") were nominated for their work, while Dick Tracy lost the Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy) to Green Card (1990) and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film to Ghost (1990).

500|$|Beatty hired Danny Elfman to compose/write {{the film}} score {{based on his}} {{previous}} success with Batman (1989). Elfman {{enlisted the help of}} Oingo Boingo lead guitarist Steve Bartek and Shirley Walker to arrange compositions for the orchestra. [...] "In a completely different way," [...] Elfman commented, [...] "Dick Tracy has this unique quality that Batman had for me. It gives an incredible sense of non-reality." [...] In addition, Beatty hired acclaimed songwriter Stephen Sondheim to write five original songs: [...] "Sooner or Later (<b>I</b> <b>Always</b> <b>Get</b> My Man)," [...] "More," [...] "Live Alone and Like It," [...] "Back in Business," [...] and [...] "What Can You Lose?". [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] and [...] "More" [...] were performed by Madonna, with [...] "What Can You Lose?" [...] being a duet with Mandy Patinkin. Mel Tormé sang [...] "Live Alone and Like It," [...] and [...] "Back in Business" [...] was performed by Janis Siegel, Cheryl Bentyne, and Lorraine Feather. [...] "Back in Business" [...] and [...] "Live Alone and Like It" [...] were both used as background music during montage sequences. [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] and [...] "Back in Business" [...] would be featured in the original 1992 production of the Sondheim revue Putting It Together in Oxford, England, and four of the five Sondheim songs from Dick Tracy (the exception being [...] "What Can You Lose?") were used in the 1999 Broadway production of Putting It Together.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} stay," [...] Briggs said, [...] "if it kills me. At least I will till Minervy's married. I don't {{care what the}} grub's like. <b>I</b> can <b>always</b> <b>get</b> a bite at the restaurant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and I {{have a big}} {{stake in}} the concern; and I haven't got used to {{spending}} money unnecessarily yet, I've been mighty glad to earn a couple dollars by working from sunup until dark, though <b>I</b> didn't <b>always</b> <b>get</b> it afterward. So have you." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sondheim {{has also}} written film music, {{contributing}} [...] "Goodbye for Now" [...] to Warren Beatty's 1981 Reds. He wrote five songs for 1990's Dick Tracy, including [...] "Sooner or Later (<b>I</b> <b>Always</b> <b>Get</b> My Man)" [...] by Madonna, which won the Academy Award for Best Song.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his nickname, Wold has said: [...] "because it's just true: <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>get</b> seasick". When he was ill on a ferry from Norway to Copenhagen, later in his life, a friend began playfully using the name and, despite Wold not rising to it for a while, it stuck. When {{asked about his}} name on British Sunday morning {{television}} show, Something for the Weekend, he replied, [...] "I just get sick on boats".|$|E
5000|$|... "I wish I {{could be}} as {{straightforward}} as you, but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> try to <b>get</b> along with everyone.", insinuating an overbearing attitude.|$|R
6000|$|Vane laughed. [...] "You and I {{have a big}} {{stake in}} the concern, and I haven't got used to {{spending}} money unnecessarily yet. I've been mighty glad to earn 2.50 by working from sun-up until dark, though <b>I</b> didn't <b>always</b> <b>get</b> it afterwards. So have you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} not," [...] exclaimed Little Joe. [...] "I like the winter, too. I {{have such a}} warm coat that I never get cold. There are always places where the water doesn't freeze. I can swim for long {{distances}} under ice and so <b>I</b> can <b>always</b> <b>get</b> plenty of food." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sondheim tried playwriting {{one more}} time, collaborating with Company {{librettist}} George Furth on Getting Away with Murder in 1996, but the unsuccessful Broadway production closed after 29 previews and 17 performances. His compositions have included {{a number of}} film scores, including a set of songs written for Warren Beatty's 1990 film version of Dick Tracy. One of Sondheim's songs for the film, [...] "Sooner or Later (<b>I</b> <b>Always</b> <b>Get</b> My Man)" [...] by Madonna, won him an Academy Award.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} February 2012, the Saxon State Commissioner for the Stasi files, Lutz Rathenow, made in the Tagesspiegel Klarsfeld {{contacts}} with the Ministry of State Security of the GDR on the subject. Klarsfeld had indeed supplied no reports and had also not been a player, but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>get</b> material from the GDR secret. They have also wanted. According to Rathenow, it [...] "already a reflection of how far served the Stasi legwork of Nazi Crimes elucidation and where it has harmed." [...] would require. He asked: [...] "Had such a secret trust has been applied also to the American CIA or the Federal Intelligence Service? Where it led politically by those who also blackmail made by permanent adoption of material? [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". And so I {{have a list of}} questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>get</b> an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sugar, my dear?" [...] one was saying. [...] "Why, I laid {{in nearly}} a hundredweight, and <b>I</b> can <b>always</b> <b>get</b> what <b>I</b> want now. The shopkeepers {{know that they have}} to have your custom after the war. It's only the people who can't afford to buy much at a time who are really inconvenienced." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Heaven!" [...] {{he said to}} himself, [...] "I {{have fallen}} in love with a black beauty at first sight--more in love than I have ever been before. It's awkward, but there will be compensations. So much the worse for Nahoon, or for Cetywayo, or for both of them. After all, <b>I</b> can <b>always</b> <b>get</b> rid of her if she becomes a nuisance." ...|$|R
6000|$|And, again, he ruminated: [...] "One thing that'll come handy in {{the country}} is that I know horses; that's a big start. <b>I</b> can <b>always</b> <b>get</b> a job at that--if it ain't at union wages. An' the other things about farmin' I can learn fast enough.--Say, d'ye {{remember}} that day you first told me about wantin' a horse to ride all your life?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Wilson {{works out}} [...] "about a third" [...] of the {{finished}} arrangement of a song as he's writing it, leaving the rest to studio experimentation. As he writes in 1990: [...] "Making an instrumental track is a whole experience. It starts after you have written a song. As I write a song, I write some of the instrumental piano and pluck some of the different notes for the arrangement. It's impossible to lay the whole arrangement on the piano but you play just {{enough to get the}} overall feelin’ of the record. It is an art in itself. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>get</b> that bigger picture of my records at my piano before I record them. I go in there prepared." [...] From the very beginning, Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener.|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{about the}} Australian federal election, 2007 at News Corporation's {{annual general meeting}} in New York on 19 October 2007, its {{chairman}} Rupert Murdoch said, [...] "I am not commenting on {{anything to do with}} Australian politics. I'm sorry. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>get</b> into trouble when I do that." [...] Pressed as to whether he believed Prime Minister John Howard should continue as prime minister, he said: [...] "I have nothing further to say. I'm sorry. Read our editorials in the papers. It'll be the journalists who decide that – the editors." [...] In 2009, in response to accusations by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that News Limited was running vendettas against him and his government, Murdoch opined that Rudd was [...] "oversensitive". Murdoch described Howard's successor, Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as [...] "...more ambitious to lead the world [...] than to lead Australia..." [...] and criticised Rudd's expansionary fiscal policies {{in the wake of the}} financial crisis of 2008 as unnecessary. Although News Limited's interests are extensive, also including the Daily Telegraph, the Courier-Mail and the Adelaide Advertiser, it was suggested by the commentator Mungo MacCallum in The Monthly [...] that [...] "the anti-Rudd push, if coordinated at all, was almost certainly locally driven" [...] as opposed to being directed by Murdoch, who also took a different position from local editors on such matters as climate change and stimulus packages to combat the financial crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Hilton {{starred in}} an MTV reality series, Paris Hilton's My New BFF, about her {{search for a}} new best friend; the series premiered on September 30, 2008. That day she {{introduced}} her song, [...] "My BFF" [...] (the show's theme song), on KIIS-FM with host Ryan Seacrest. The series was a hit; 1,200,000 viewers watched the premiere episode, and it averaged a 1.6 rating among viewers 12–34 in its Tuesday 10 p.m. slot (topping all other cable shows in the time slot). Hilton's next project was a Gothic rock musical, Repo! The Genetic Opera. She played Amber Sweet, the surgery- and painkiller-addicted daughter of a biotech magnate. Horror.com said: [...] "Not only is this by far Hilton's best role, she's actually got a grain of gravitas in the end". However, Jam! Movies called her a [...] "hopeless twit as an actress". Hilton said, [...] "Just getting a role like this offered to me was new to me because <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>get</b> offered a certain role just basically playing myself". She was nominated for the 2009 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for the role. The film, first screened at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International, began a limited release in the United States and Canada on November 7, 2008. Repo! had [...] "solid numbers" [...] for its opening weekend, grossing $51,600 gross in eight theaters. Around that time Hilton released her fifth fragrance for women, Fairy Dust, and broke up with Good Charlotte guitarist Benji Madden; they had begun a relationship early that year.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, Jane, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> knew we'd <b>get</b> {{a look at}} them hosses again--I shore knew," [...] Lassiter {{was saying}} in the same old, cool, {{careless}} drawl. But his clawlike hands shook a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Huck, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> {{reckoned}} we'd <b>get</b> it. It's {{just too}} good to believe, but we HAVE got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a rum thing," [...] Nat {{thought to}} himself, [...] "that <b>I</b> should <b>always</b> be <b>getting</b> into some scrape or other when I go ashore. This {{is the worst}} of all by a long way." ...|$|R

2500|$|Regarding her designs, {{she stated}} [...] "I didn't {{want to make}} clothes for kept women, I wanted to make clothes {{for people in the}} street, and Fitz and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> tried to <b>get</b> prices down, down to the bare minimum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mind the}} sleeping, father, but the waking {{is not so}} pleasant. However, I shall soon get {{accustomed}} to it, I suppose. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> did hate <b>getting</b> up in the dark, {{even when we were}} going out fishing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. The {{foreign agent}} of a prince, who should whisper a {{syllable}} against his master, would be recalled with disgrace; but the {{servant of the}} people is differently situated, since {{there are so many}} to be persuaded of his guilt. <b>I</b> could <b>always</b> <b>get</b> along with all the attacks that the Europeans are so fond of making on the American system, but those which they quoted from the mouths of our own diplomatic agents." ...|$|R
