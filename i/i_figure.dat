[...] <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> I have a month to work the way I want to, I'll be all right." [...] Clancy's comeback appeared to be on track in early November, as he was a close second among Miami receivers with 21 catches for 289 yards.

Nate Silver at Fivethirtyeight.com is now giving McCain a 3.7% chance of winning – pretty comfortable odds. Here's the way I look at it: If Obama wins, I'm in the flow and commenting on a phenomenon.

[...] "So my folks brought me piles of books from the Seattle Public Library," [...] he {{recalled}} in interview, [...] "and it was then I really learned to read and from that time on was voracious — <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> that accident changed my life.

2500|$|Rating it {{four out}} of five stars, Blender critic Ann Powers stated the album is [...] "Artfully structured, unapologetically explicit, Damita Jo is erotica at its friendliest and most well-balanced. This hour-plus of Tantric flow even erases the memory of Jackson’s clunky Super Bowl breast-baring." [...] Powers added [...] "Her lyrics, though hardly {{avoiding}} familiar sex talk, meld common exhibitionism with convincing intimacies. [...] Jackson brings bliss back to a subject that too many dirty-mouthed hotties have made tedious through overexposure." [...] The album was also considered a [...] "soul-baring, bedroom-eyed record" [...] which was [...] "swimming in pop hooks." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian rated Damita Jo {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Damita Jo's opening salvo is an object lesson in keeping things concise. Four tracks, each barely three minutes long, go hurtling past in a head-spinning blur of snapping rhythms, buzzing synthesized noise and oddly disconnected samples: cut-up vocals and glockenspiel on Strawberry Bounce, rattling tablas on Sexhibition. Elsewhere, there are impossibly lithe basslines - notably on All Nite (Don't Stop) and I Want You, an intriguing electronic reconstruction of an early 1970s soul ballad." [...] Petridis heralded the record as [...] "not only inventive, but brilliantly constructed," [...] with nagging hooks and [...] "explosive" [...] choruses. Calling pop a [...] "singles genre," [...] Power's said [...] "Damita Jos strike rate is remarkably high. It's triumphant stuff." [...] Warner Bros. Publications declared the album [...] "flirty, sensual, hot pop" [...] in [...] "traditional Janet style", adding [...] "The slow grooves blend together and the seductive vocals express passion." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said [...] "Damita Jo starts off bold - But as the album proceeds it gets realer, mostly whispered softcore by the second half even when it's love songs per se. Call me immature, but <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> there's never enough good sex in the world. In a culture inundated with dirty pornos, Damita Jo is good sex." ...|$|E
