Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Gopalakrishan wanted fresh faces {{for both}} the lead roles and he had written letters to various heads of colleges and {{universities}} for the auditions. However, he did not receive any response from anywhere. For the female lead, Gopalakrishnan approached Sharada, {{one of the most successful}} actresses of her time. She was acting in commercial films when Gopalakrishnan asked her to star in Swayamvaram. Sharada was initially reluctant to commit herself to an art film, but agreed when Gopalakrishnan narrated the complete story to her at Prasad Studios, in Chennai. The male lead for the film, Madhu, was an old friend of Gopalakrishnan and had expressed a desire to act in one of his films. By the time Gopalakrishnan finished his studies and returned from FTII, Madhu was already a star in Malayalam cinema. Gopalakrishnan then decided to cast him opposite Sharada. Mentioning about his experience working with Gopalakrishnan and Swayamvaram, Madhu recollected in an interview that [...] " [...] when Gopalakrishnan narrated the story of Swayamvaram, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be different." [...] Years later he also mentioned that he [...] "sometimes wished Prem Nazir had acted in Adoor's Swayamvaram. He might have won a Bharath award. But he was very busy those days." ...|$|E

Porter went on to praise the acting work of both B. J. Novak and Paul Lieberstein, {{as well as the}} writing of Mindy Kaling. TV Squad's Jay Black said that Michael summed up [...] "Night Out" [...] perfectly when he said [...] "Best. Night. Ever." [...] Black went on to praise both of the storylines, and the ability of the show to achieve success both in as well as out of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton building. Similar to Black's statements, Gretchen Hansen of Entertainment Weekly stated that Best. Night. Ever.' Oh, so true, Michael." [...] She also stated that [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be a good episode of The Office when I had two pages of scribbled notes before the first commercial break." [...] Hansen went on to praise both the acting and the writing of the episode as points that contributed {{to the success of the}} episode. Rachel Cericola, of TV Fodder, praised the writing of the episode by Mindy Kaling. She also praised the storyline of the episode that did not involve Michael and Dwight, saying [...] "The second plotline was its usual funny filler. However, it was Toby's revelation that made it all worthwhile." ...|$|E

When all my friends were playing outside I had to practice. I didn't go to all the school trips. But I was focused from a very young age. I grew up {{practicing}} at the Jerusalem tennis center.

2500|$|The role of Reverend Paul Coates {{was written}} with actor Arthur Darvill in mind, {{and was the}} first role cast. Darvill was offered a role in Broadchurch in April 2012 while filming [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", his final {{appearance}} on Doctor Who. Darvill accepted without knowing what role he was to play or having read any scripts. Only later did Chibnall tell Darvill that the role was that of a young Anglican priest struggling with alcoholism. Darvill says that, as Chibnall wrote the scripts, he would call Darvill and tell him what he was thinking of doing with the character of Coates. Chibnall's writing of the character was, in a way, collaborative: [...] "We talked a lot about the role of a vicar in a community like that and {{what are the implications of}} the circumstances that the town is put in," [...] said Darvill, [...] "and what that means for someone in that position and certainly the responsibility of having to be a spiritual guide, a point of comfort, a figurehead, especially being quite young." [...] Darvill was very interested in the way Coates always felt he was in the public spotlight (even in a private setting) and the burden that Coates felt in being a moral guide and trustworthy person. Darvill was also intrigued by the way Coates struggled to avoid letting his ego come into play once he became a spokesperson for the community, and the way Coates reacted when he became a police suspect. Darvill was also pleased that Chibnall said he would not permit any bad attitudes or diva-like behavior on the set.
