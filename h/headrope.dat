60|$|The little girl, {{after playing}} {{some time with}} the seaweed, had climbed into a small boat which lay {{at the edge of}} the {{advancing}} tide, and, leaning over the stern, watched the little waves as they ran up one after another. A few minutes after she had got into it, the rising tide floated the boat, and it drifted out a few yards, as far as its <b>headrope</b> allowed it. Ignorant of what had happened, the child was kneeling up at the stern, leaning over, and dabbling her hands in the water.|$|E
60|$|Ascending to {{the deck}} again, he slackened out the <b>headrope</b> {{attached}} to a heavy stone that served as an anchor; then he hauled on the rope ashore until he felt the stern touch the sand. Making fast the rope, he lowered himself down and waded to shore. Then he brought off the muskets and ammunition, pork and melons on his head, and lastly got the barrel of water alongside, put a sling round it, fastened the main halliards to it, and hoisted it on board. He was {{now in a position}} to make off, but still altogether inadequately provisioned for such a voyage as he meditated, and after some thought he determined to return on shore.|$|E
50|$|Nets were {{formerly}} {{all made}} by hand. They can be started {{from a single}} point, for round nets (such as purse nets, net bags, or hair nets), but square nets are usually started from a <b>headrope.</b> A line {{is tied to the}} <b>headrope</b> at regular intervals, forming a series of loops. This can be done using slipped overhand knots, as in the image above, or using other knots, such as clove hitches. Subsequent rows are then worked using sheet bends, as shown, or another knot (some nets, such as hammocks, may even be looped rather than knotted).|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} threats to sea turtles is the {{incidental}} capture as bycatch in marine commercial trawl fisheries. A gear-based approach has been suggested to reduce sea turtle bycatch levels in the summer flounder fishery (Paralicthys dentatus). Previous conservation experiments using a turtle excluder device (TED) in the summer flounder fishery resulted in a significant loss of the target species summer flounder, about 35 % on average. A topless-trawl design was proposed as an alternative gear design to mitigate sea turtle bycatch. Previous testing showed that a topless-trawl with a <b>headrope</b> length of 48. 7 m (160 ft) was effective at reducing sea turtle catch, but had a significant loss of target species, ranging from 51 - 74 % on average, compared to a traditional trawl net with a 19. 8 -m (65 -ft) <b>headrope.</b> In an effort to improve performance of the experimental trawl, {{a model of the}} 48. 7 -m (160 -ft) <b>headrope</b> trawl was evaluated at the flume tank at the Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland. This experimental net was optimally reconfigured with thirty 20 -cm (8 -in) plastic floats on the <b>headrope</b> and two restrictor lines. The 48. 7 -m (160 - ft) topless-trawl with 30 floats and two restrictor lines was tested in the summer flounder fishery in the summer of 2013 to assess its ability to catch summer flounder with two different float configurations. With the optimal float arrangement, the 48. 7 -m (160 -ft) <b>headrope</b> topless-trawl with two restrictor lines had a significant loss of target species (p= 0. 008), with 22. 7 % loss compared to a traditional trawl. With this same float arrangement, the topless-trawl had a 12 % loss of skate species (the majority of the catch) with no significance from zero (p= 0. 057). The experimental topless-trawl reduced the capture of all species overall, including the target species, summer flounder...|$|E
40|$|Common {{shrimp trawl}} designs {{employed}} in the southeastern United States shrimp fishery are the flat, balloon, semiballoon, jib, and super X- 3. Recent innovations in trawl design and rigging, including the twin trawl rigging and tongue trawl design, have improved the efficiency of shrimp trawling gear. A description of the construction techniques for the different designs indicate differences which affect gear performance. Measurements of horizontal spread and vertical opening for 76 trawl configurations indicate the relative efficiencies of the different designs. Maximum horizontal spreading efficiency was achieved by the "twin" and "tongue" trawl designs followed by the super X- 3, jib, balloon, and semiballoon designs. Designs having the greatest vertical openings were the tongue and flat trawl designs followed by the semiballoon. Maximum total gape dimension was demonstrated by the "Mongoose" tongue trawl. Comparison of trawl spreading efficiency and door area to <b>headrope</b> length ratio indicates that a range of 70 - 80 in square (per door) of door area is required for each foot of trawl <b>headrope</b> length for maximum efficiency with conventional trawl designs and 66 - 75 in square per foot of <b>headrope</b> for tongue trawl designs.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} {{production}} technology and relative efficiency of vessels harvesting banana and tiger prawns in the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), one of Australia’s largest and most lucrative fishing areas. It is based on an unbalanaced panel data set of 226 observations among thirty-seven vessels for the years 1990 - 1996 and employs a technique which specifies a stochastic frontier production function in order to decompose the variation among vessels in the harvest of prawns due to unbounded random effects beyond firm control from those that result in differences in technical inefficiency among fishing vessels in the industry. In other words, variations in maximum expected output can occure either as a result of stochastic effects (e. g., good and bad weather states), or from the fact that vessels in the industry may be operating at various levels of inefficiency due to mismanagement, poor incentive structures, less than perfectly competitive behaviour or inappropriate input levels or combinations. Estimation of this output frontier also provides key information on the relative importance of inputs in the production of banana and tiger prawns, output elasticities, returns to scale, possible variations in stock size and the economic performance of each fishing vessel, year to year. Likelihood ratio tests confirm that both stochastic effects and the extent of technical inefficiency matter, thus making traditional OLS estimates inappropriate. The level of technical inefficiency is shown to depend positively on gear <b>headrope</b> length and negatively on either the number of A-units or fuel expenditures. The point is especially relevant since A-unit restrictions over vessel size and engine power in the fishery during this period appear to have resulted in a substitution toward less efficient but unregulated inputs, such as gear <b>headrope</b> length. In this regard, the recent introduction of gear <b>headrope</b> length restrictions may be justified on two counts, both as a device to limit effor or tach and protect prawn stocks and as a way, given the final estimates in this paper, of improving economic performance by increasing the technical efficiency of vessels remaining in the industry. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that restrictions on an existing inefficient input may result in far smaller reductions in effort than projected, since the technical efficiency of vessels in the fishery will rise. With an increase in technical efficiency, gear-restricted fishing firms will harvest at points closer to their output frontiers. Moreover, with the removal of A-unit restrictions, ‘effort creep’ in the form of larger vessels and more powerful engines may more than compensate for any decrease in effort due to gear reduction. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} the first ex post {{estimates of the}} effects of input controls on technical efficiency in a fishery. Using individual vessel data from the northern prawn fishery of Australia for the years 1990 - 1996 and 1994 - 2000, stochastic production frontiers are estimated to analyse the efficiency impacts of input controls on engine and vessel size. The results indicate that technical efficiency is increasing in a measure of vessel size and engine capacity that was controlled by the regulator from 1985 to 2001, and decreasing in an unregulated input, gear <b>headrope</b> length. The study shows that fishers have substituted from regulated to unregulated inputs over the period 1990 - 2000 and technical efficiency has declined coincident with increasing restrictions on vessel size and engine capacity. The decline in technical efficiency indicates that the goal of the regulator to increase economic efficiency has not been realized. ...|$|E
40|$|The origin, development, and {{utilization}} of the skimmer net is reviewed along with other historical shrimp gears used in coastal Louisiana. The skimmer was developed to catch white shrimp, Penaeus setiferus, observed jumping over the cork line (<b>headrope)</b> of trawls being worked in shallow waters. A description of the gear is presented including basic components and various frame designs used by fishermen during its development. The advantages of skimmers over bottom trawls include: multiple use as both trawl and butterfly net (wing net), ease of deployment, increased maneuverability, reduction and greater survivability of bycatch, and ability to cover more area due to increased speed and continuous fishing capability. Disadvantages may include compromising vessel stability when stored upright on the deck, possible damage to water bottoms when improperly rigged, and limitation to a 12 -foot (3. 6 m) maximum depth due to size restrictions. The growing popularity of the skimmer net is evident by its introduction into North Carolina and inquiries from other southeastern Atlantic and Gulf coast states...|$|E

A total of 1249 squids from 4 to 34 cm mantle length was caught in 50 of the 66 effective trawls with a 28 m <b>headrope</b> net with steel bobbins on the groundrope. Squid catches were poor with a maximum of 7. 36 kg/h and 5 % of total catches in spring and less than 1. 26 kg/h and 1. 2 % {{on the rest of}} the cruises. Young squids under 10 cm ML were found on all cruises in depths less than 350 m and at 13 ºC to 17 ºC bottom temperatures.

40|$|Three {{aspects of}} a survey bottom trawl performance— 1) trawl {{geometry}} (i. e., net spread, door spread, and <b>headrope</b> height); 2) footrope distance off-bottom; and 3) bridle distance off-bottom—were compared among hauls by using either of two autotrawl systems (equal tension and net symmetry) and hauls conducted with towing cables of equal length and locked winches. The effects of environmental conditions, vessel heave, crabbing (i. e., the difference between vessel heading and actual vessel course over ground), and bottom current on trawl performance with three trawling modes were investigated. Means {{and standard deviations of}} trawl geometry measures were not significantly different between autotrawl and locked-winch systems. Bottom trawls performed better with either autotrawl system as compared to trawling with locked winches by reducing the variance and increasing the symmetry of the footrope contact with the bottom. The equal tension autotrawl system was most effective in counteracting effects of environmental conditions on footrope bottom contact. Footrope bottom contact was most inf luenced by environmental conditions during tows with locked winches. Both of the autotrawl systems also reduced the variance and increased the symmetry of bridle bottom contact. Autotrawl systems proved to be effective in decreasing the effects of environmental factors on some aspects of trawl performance and, as a result, have the potential to reduce among-haul variance in catchability of survey trawls. Therefore, by incorporating an autotrawl system into standard survey procedures, precision of survey estimates of relative abundanc...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{potential}} of a selective flatfish trawl to reduce bycatch of slope rockfish in the upper continental slope bottom-trawl fishery (250 – 500 m) on the U. S. West Coast. The trawl we tested differed from typical slope trawls {{in that it was}} a low-rise, two-seam trawl with a severely cut back <b>headrope.</b> We used an alternate haul, randomized block design to compare catches of the experimental trawl with those of a typical four-seam, high-rise trawl and to examine diel changes in catch rates for both trawls. The experimental trawl produced catches similar to the control trawl for all commercially valuable flatfish, except arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, which was reduced 24 %. Catches of most rockfish and roundfish were significantly reduced in the experimental trawl (50 – 94 % depending on species). However, the catches of darkblotched rockfish Sebastes crameri and redbanded rockfish S. babcocki were not reduced significantly in the experimental trawl. Nighttime catches were reduced 30 – 99 % for most rockfish species, the greatest reductions occurring in the experimental trawl. The large nighttime catch reduction for several rockfish species for both trawls along with no catch reduction in Dover sole Microstomus pacificus, suggests that fishing only at night may be a viable bycatch-reduction strategy for some rockfish species. The diel and depth-related variation in catch rates we noted for the selective flatfish trawl indicates that catches by this trawl may be especially sensitive to physical and environmental factors such as time of day, depth, or turbidity...|$|E
40|$|Survey {{standardization}} procedures {{can reduce}} the variability in trawl catch efficiency thus producing more precise estimates of biomass. One such procedure, towing with equal amounts of trawl warp {{on both sides of}} the net, was experimentally investigated for its importance in determining optimal trawl geometry and for evaluating the effectiveness of the recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) national protocol on accurate measurement of trawl warps. This recent standard for measuring warp length requires that the difference between warp lengths can be no more than 4 % of the distance between the otter doors measured along the bridles and footrope. Trawl performance data from repetitive towing with warp differentials of 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 20 m were analyzed for their effect on three determinants of flatfish catch efficiency: footrope distance off-bottom, bridle length in contact with the bottom, and area swept by the net. Our results indicated that the distortion of the trawl caused by asymmetry in trawl warp length could have a negative inf luence on flatfish catch efficiency. At a difference of 7 m in warp length, the NOAA 4 % threshold value for the 83112 Eastern survey trawl used in our study, we found no effect on the acous-tic-based measures of door spread, wing spread, and <b>headrope</b> height off-bottom. However, the sensitivity of the trawl to 7 m of warp offset could be seen as footrope distances off-bottom increased slightly (particularly in the center region of the net where flatfish escapement is highest), and as the width of the bridle path responsible for flatfish herding, together with the effective net width, was reduced. For this survey trawl, a NOAA threshold value of 4 % should be considered a maximum. A more conservative value (less than 4 %) would likely reduce potential bias in estimates of relative abundance caused by large differences in warp length approaching 7 m...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} {{flatfish}} in the Southern New England (SNE) area have been assessed as overfished {{and in need}} of rebuilding. These species have some common characteristics in terms of life history patterns, use of habitat, and distribution. Many are targeted species in directed fisheries; others are bycatch/discard species, especially in the small mesh fishery in SNE for squid, (Loligo pealeii), butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) and scup (Stenotomus chrysops); these species include summer (Paralichthys dentatus), winter (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), yellowtail (Limanda ferruginea) and windowpane (Scophthalmus aquosus) flounders. As a result, {{there is a need to}} find gear solutions to prevent capture. A modified fishing net (MFN) was designed using a standard bottom trawl squid net with the addition of 30. 5 cm (12 inch) extensions to the <b>headrope</b> and a 30. 5 cm (12 inch) drop chain between the sweep and the footrope. It was tested on its ability to reduce the capture of flatfish by creating a space between the sweep and the footrope. Initial testing to make adjustments to the sweep design of the modified fishing net was conducted at the flume tank facility at the Centre for Sustainable Aquatic Resources located at the Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland. ^ A catch characterization study was conducted aboard two commercial fishing vessels targeting squid using the 2 ̆ 2 side-by-side 2 ̆ 2 towing method comparing the standard fishing net (SFN) with the MFN. The nets were switched every two days and used an equal number of times on each vessel. Work was done over 12 months around Block Island Sound and Rhode Island Sound and consisted of 8 fishing days. Each fishing day consisted of six 40 minute tows. For each tow all flatfish were sampled or if necessary a sub-sample was taken following Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) protocols (NEFSC 2010). Catch included target species, (i. e. squid, butterfish, scup), flounder species (fluke, sand dabs, fourspot flounder (Paralichthys oblongus), winter flounder, yellowtail flounder) and skate (Leucoraja erinacea) which were weighed. Other appropriate bycatch was also sampled and weighed. When appropriate, flatfish species were measured and sorted into sublegal and legal sizes prior to weighing. ^ After checking for vessel effects, a paired t-test was used to test for differences between the combined mean weight (catch by species) per tow (in kilograms) of the SFN and MFN. Results show a significant difference between mean weights per tow for summer, winter, yellowtail, fourspot and windowpane flounders. There was no significant difference between mean weights captured by the SFN and MFN for all three target species. ^ The findings of this research indicate the 30. 5 cm (12 in.) drop chain trawl net design has the ability to reduce the capture of flatfish while retaining target species in the small mesh fishery of Southern New England. ...|$|E
