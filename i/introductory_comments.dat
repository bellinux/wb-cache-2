40|$|Abstract—An {{infinite}} grating of coated PEC cylinders is {{illuminated by}} a normally incident electromagnetic wave.

30|$|We {{have one}} last <b>introductory</b> <b>comment.</b> The strong {{aspects of this}} work are in the {{practical}} side: the local channel information (obtained via sounding in TDD mode) is adequate, and each cell site can construct its precoder and decoder locally without further information exchange among different cell sites and users. However, the practicality of the proposed approach may be reduced if some practical challenges faced {{in a large scale}} network (such as many antennas, a lot of users, channel estimation error, and block diagonalization error) cannot be properly addressed. Fortunately, the new developments on cloud-radio access network (C-RAN), massive MIMO, spatial user scheduling, etc., have addressed a lot of these practical issues and have helped to demonstrate the importance and timeliness of this work. These practical challenges and their possible solutions will be briefly discussed in the Conclusions section.|$|R

40|$|An {{anisotropic}} medium with hyperbolic dispersion relation and tilted optical axis {{has been found}} to support two asymmetric propagating waves within its volume. With careful selection of design parameters one can achieve perfect matching with free space and huge spatial oscillation for the transmitted wave.

Conducted by a wide constituency of distinguished critics, writers and journalists, the interviews offer a unique insight into the views and work of a remarkable array of acclaimed authors. They also chart a slow but certain cultural shift: those once seen as 'other' have not only won many of the establishment's most revered literary prizes but have also become central figures in contemporary literature, writing across and into all our real and imagined worlds. With an <b>introductory</b> <b>comment</b> by Susheila Nasta, editor of Wasafiri, this collection is essential reading for all those interested in contemporary literature.

30|$|Active and erupting volcanoes {{is an area}} of geosciences {{that has}} seen further {{development}} for the use of UAVs. Erupting volcanoes present numerous challenges to data collection. Sarah P. Williams wrote “In 1984, the volcano Mauna Loa erupted in Hawaii, sending ribbons of lava winding down its slopes. Geologist and former pilot David Pieri of the California Institute of Technology’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wanted to get measurements and observation of every part of the lava flow to predict its ultimate route and length. However, he only had one way to see the lava: with a helicopter. “I remember being so frustrated because you could only see what was right in front of you,” says Pieri. “It was a 22 -km lava flow {{and by the time we}} flew to the bottom, we had no idea what was going on at the top” (Williams, 2013). This <b>introductory</b> <b>comment</b> epitomizes the difficulties of working on active volcanoes, where researchers can often be at harm’s way (e.g. the Unzen killed the Kraft husband and wife during the 1991 – 1995 eruption and 41 other TV crews and scientists).|$|R

Most of the repertoire performed in the concert consisted of Perkins' classic rockabilly songs from the 1950s. It was directed by Tom Gutteridge.

KPL is in its tenth year of business, during which time we have carried out numerous studies – usually for publishers – on marketplace (author and librarian) attitudes towards scholarly information- and research-related issues. Our role is to gather, interpret and present data and to advise on their implications. In {{the past few years}} we have carried out a number of studies on Open Access commissioned by the JISC and by publishers. Some of these are referenced in the EC report discussed here. We have also worked with the European Commission’s Merger Task Force and the UK’s Competition Commission on merger and takeover moves by large academic publishers in Europe. We therefore have considerable expertise in the field and both a broad overview and detailed knowledge of the scientific publications industry. In the light of these things we offer the points below in response to the Study on the Economic and Technical Evolution of the Scientific Publication Markets in Europe – in particular, on the first recommendation (A 1) concerning public access to publicly-funded research results shortly after publication – based on information and data gathered during the course of our work. 1.
