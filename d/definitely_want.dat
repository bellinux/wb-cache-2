25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to be able to sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I {{have to be able to}} sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

500|$|Christian Louboutin {{said that}} he would {{dedicate}} his time to creating some [...] "scene-stealing designs for the single's video", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, after Joss Whedon, {{director}} of , announced that Hank Pym {{would not be}} Ultron's creator, Wright said Ultron was never {{a part of the}} story of Ant-Man, explaining that [...] "just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie". Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} support Cyrus' then newly launched, joint apparel line with Max Azria, sold {{exclusively}} by Walmart stores, an EP was chosen for release. [...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to be able to step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|E
500|$|... 2001 {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} year for Gugelmin. During the practice session for the race at Texas Motor Speedway, he crashed after he lost control in the second turn and hit the wall with a force of 66.2g, before a second impact with the wall which exerted a force of 113.1g. The event was eventually called off after drivers complained of dizziness, nausea and blurred vision, which were caused by the high g-forces experienced when driving at speed on the track. During the week before the race at Nazareth Speedway, Gugelmin's son, Giuliano, died from respiratory complications. Giuliano was quadriplegic and a lifelong sufferer from cerebral palsy owing to complications at birth. The PacWest team announced that Gugelmin would not be taking part in the race. Gugelmin's team mate at PacWest, Scott Dixon, won the race beating Kenny Bräck into second place. At the end of 2001, Gugelmin decided to retire from the sport, stating [...] "I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> {{to spend more time with}} my family. After those two big accidents, and Alex 's deal in Germany, I said, 'That's it. Forget it.'"

5000|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with Bleeding Cool, Galligan again spoke {{about a third}} film saying that [...] "Warner Bros. <b>definitely</b> <b>wants</b> it, Chris Columbus {{wants to do it}} because he’d like to undo the Gremlins 2 thing as he wasn’t thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to." [...] He claimed Gremlins 3 is being written by Carl Ellsworth.|$|R
500|$|Promotion {{began in}} January, with {{performances}} by Smith at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and appearances at {{the debut of}} the Oliver! 2009 revival. Smith also {{took part in a}} photoshoot for publicity and cover photos. According to writers for the Daily Mail, the cover photo was modified to give Smith [...] "a smile worthy of a model from a Colgate advert", due to her [...] "gappy teeth". Though generally critical of the move, the report conceded that it was better for Smith's teeth to be digitally straightened, rather than forcing her [...] "to endure a battery of dental surgery". A television advert and music video for [...] "River of Light" [...] were recorded to further publicise the release, and Smith also appeared on the cover of April's Classic FM Magazine. Further promotion in {{the weeks leading up to}} the release of Faryl included Smith appearing on Loose Women, The Paul O'Grady Show, BBC Radio 4, Radio Five Live and BBC Breakfast. She also appeared at the Children's Champion Awards and met then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street.

500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's {{going to happen in}} the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated that he would not be surprised if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun. [...] If I can have that experience in any genre, I'd take it." ...|$|E

500|$|Drake {{appears on}} Pink Moon {{accompanied}} {{only by his}} own carefully recorded guitar save for a single piano overdub on the title track. Wood later said: [...] "He was very determined to make this very stark, bare record. He <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be him more than anything. And I think, in some ways, Pink Moon is probably more like Nick is {{than the other two}} records." ...|$|R
5000|$|I <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{put more}} realism in it, more depth. God Hates Us All isn't an anti-Christian line as much as it's an idea I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to on a daily basis. One day you're living your life, and then you're hit by a car or your dog dies, so you feel like, [...] "God really hates me today." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Well I {{think we}} <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to speak to}} as many women as we could and all the pain and {{struggle}} that we go through as women to maintain this impossible standard of beauty. We wanted {{to give it a}} darker edge and take it there and not give you the Disney version of that struggle. And Beyoncé was more than willing to go that far with it. And I applaud her for that." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lea Salonga, Filipino {{singer and}} actress {{who has done}} various {{theatrical}} work, including Miss Saigon and several Disney's movies has also expressed her praise and respect towards Siti's vocal ability during her concert in Malaysia in 2010 where she sang one of songs made famous by Siti and 2 By 2, Tiga Malam during the closing ceremony of her concert. In 2011, another Filipino artist, Gary Valenciano during his visit in Malaysia has expressed her admiration of Siti's vocal ability. He commented, [...] "Based on what I've been told by the local media, I believe the best Malay song and the best vocal I've ever heard has to be Siti Nurhaliza's. If {{it was possible for}} me to meet her, I would <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to do a duet with her. If [...] were given a chance, I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to compose a song for her, that is if she wishes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parton said in 2010 {{that she}} would like to open more Dollywood parks in the future.

2500|$|On June 22, 2007, it was {{revealed}} that The Postal Service had begun work on a new album, though the specifics of the production and the release date were vague. [...] Gibbard stated, [...] "We're slowly starting. We're crawling right now, and whether that crawl turns into a walk remains to be seen. But we'll know more {{towards the end of the}} year. I've just been touring so much and trying to find time to make it happen and make our schedules line up." [...] Tamborello added, [...] "We're talking about wanting to finish an album by sometime next year, because we have to work with Death Cab's schedule and stuff.

50|$|From March until August 1945, Vietnam enjoyed {{what was}} called a “fake independence”. In the {{aftermath}} of the coup the Japanese most <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> to minimize internal change in Indochina----changes which would have adversely affected their military objectives. The Trần Trọng Kim Cabinet, from all evidence available, was only a government in name and ruled over no state in fact. The affairs of Indochinese were still {{in the hands of the}} Japanese.|$|R
60|$|As regards details Ruth <b>definitely</b> did <b>want</b> {{a bedroom}} of her own; a desire which {{her mother would}} have {{regarded}} as somehow immodest. She <b>definitely</b> did <b>want</b> shaving and hair-brushing kept in the background. She did not want Carl the lover to drift into Carl the husband. She did not want them to lose touch with other people. And {{she wanted to keep}} the spice of madness which from the first had seasoned their comradeship.|$|R
2500|$|Inspired by the {{production}} on Wrapped in Red, Clarkson wanted all the tracks on Piece by Piece {{to sound like}} its own soundtrack, while also wanting every song to have potential as a single. Taking inspiration from the soundtracks of the feature films Cruel Intentions (1999) and Love Actually (2003), she remarked: [...] "I love soundtracks and I love how you can tell, 'Oh, this {{should be in a}} soundtrack!' You can picture the movie. I <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> the orchestral elements going on and I <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> the intense factor going on." [...] Clarkson illustrated the album as a concept record telling a single [...] "awesome" [...] story, using different pieces of her character, leading her to name the album Piece by Piece. Citing the aspects of heartbreak and personal struggle as well as peace and empowerment in its lyrical content, she described the record as an album within an uplifting and reflective environment. She recalled: [...] "I'm 32 years old, I have pretty much run the gauntlet of pretty much every emotion you could possibly go through — especially being 19 [...] and being thrust into the industry, and growing up really quickly." ...|$|R
2500|$|On his Home Truths BBC {{radio show}} John once commented {{about his own}} death: [...] "I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to be buried, {{although}} not yet. I'm 61 on Wednesday—just a working day for me, I'm afraid—so actually I should have {{a mile or two}} left in me, but I do want the children to be able to stand solemnly at my graveside and think lovely thoughts along the lines of 'Get out of that one, you swine', which they won't be able to do if I've been cremated. I think I want 'Teenage dreams, so hard to beat' on my gravestone and every night at dusk the trumpeters of the 5th Battalion King's Shropshire Light Infantry to play Misty in Roots' 'Mankind' over the grave. Lovely." ...|$|E
2500|$|Man Chong {{gathered}} his subordinates and told them, [...] "Sun Quan knows that I have moved the {{troops out of}} Hefei. He'll <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> {{to put on a}} show of might so that he can brag about how powerful his army is. Although he doesn't have the courage to push further in and attack Xincheng, he'll definitely send his troops ashore just to show off how big his army is." [...] He then ordered 6,000 troops to lie in ambush in Hefei and wait for the Wu soldiers to come ashore. As Man Chong predicted, Sun Quan did order his troops to go ashore and put on a show of might. When that happened, the 6,000 troops in Hefei launched a sudden and fierce attack on them. Hundreds of Wu soldiers were killed while some drowned as they tried to flee back to their ships.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a spring}} 2014 {{interview}} with the BBC about the then forthcoming reissue of Led Zeppelin's first three albums, Page said he was confident fans would be keen on another reunion show, but Plant later replied that [...] "the chances of it happening [...] zero." [...] Page then told The New York Times that he was [...] "fed up" [...] with Plant's refusal to play, stating [...] "I was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, {{to be honest with}} you. I don't sing, so I can't do much about it", adding, [...] "I <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to play live. Because, you know, I've still got a twinkle in my eye. I can still play. So, yeah, I'll just get myself into musical shape, just concentrating on the guitar." ...|$|E

But later, when he has four kids, he might think, 'That was the shit.'" [...] Following the release of The Wraith: Shangri-La, Bruce and Utsler signed a new contract with Sony BMG's RED Distribution and launched the Psychopathic Europe record label.|$|R
5000|$|I <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{get better}} at writing, and those things {{happened}} simultaneously with trying to read better. I would write tons of stuff in my head, and forget. Some songs on Being There, I don't think I ever wrote any lyrics down ... To fight that, I started writing words on paper and making up melodies to go with them. By writing things down, and putting more words into my head, it put more words in my mouth when I turned on the tape recorder to sing.|$|R
2500|$|As with Settlers III, the {{buildings}} in the game were created using 3D Studio Max, with Adobe Photoshop used to create the textures. Each race was assigned their own specific artist, who worked on nothing except {{the buildings}} for that particular race. According to lead artist/co-designer/co-writer Torsten Hess, this was done [...] "so that {{the style of the}} buildings within a people is uniform." [...] However, there were certain overriding rules to which the individual artists had to adhere. One of the most important was a technique Hess had employed on Settlers III; after the textures were applied, they were [...] "dirtied" [...] so as to create a lived-in, real-world sense. Hess explains, [...] "rigid and straight edges should be avoided. Beautiful curves and moving lines are instead used to suggest life in the settlers world. For the textures, this means stronger colours, a slightly higher contrast than the figures, as well as a lot of detail and the use of many different colour families. We <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to avoid a sterile look. We also draw all the textures by hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} during their appearance at Rock in Rio in September 2017, Noodles and Holland {{talked about the}} new Offspring album, with the former commenting, [...] "We've got a few songs already done. We wanna do a couple more, and we <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to get something out soon. Our fans have waited long enough, I think, so we wanna get something in their hands that they can listen to and hold, and put in their ears." [...] Holland added that the album will [...] "for sure" [...] be released in 2018. In an October 2017 interview, however, Holland said, [...] "I think I want to do like an EP. It's kind of what people are doing these days and it makes for less time in between stuff. It has been five years for us {{so we have a}} few songs together and I'm hoping to get something out by early next year." [...] In the same month, bassist Greg K. mentioned a possible 2018 release date for the new Offspring album, and revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for the album's slow progress is because they have been working on songs here and there. He also stated that the band is no hurry to finish the album.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2009, Epic {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Norwood following {{the appointment of}} Amanda Ghost, making Human her only album with the label. A Los Angeles Times article later revealed Norwood's discontent {{with the success of}} the project the following year when asked about the commercial failure of Human: [...] "It was lacking my belief in it. It lacked my vision. Pretty much bottom line, if you don't believe in something it's not going to go," [...] she said. [...] "So do I believe that Human was as creative as Never Say Never and Full Moon? No, I do not. You <b>definitely</b> <b>want</b> to put something out that's like that. I felt at the same time I could have had much better songs and a much better set-up." [...] A statement she made during a 2010 interview with Out magazine turned out more harsh: [...] "To hell with that album! [...] Where I felt creatively it could've gone and the space I was in creatively, I needed everybody around me to be in that same space. It would've been a different album, but with the same inspiration and same blessing for other people. It would've been hotter music and a hotter look." ...|$|E
5000|$|Producer Simon Ffinch {{explained}} the game's storytelling philosophy: [...] "We {{were trying to}} put the player into the situation that the characters were in the movie Generations, but we wanted to let them do what they wanted to do, and have the situations deviate fairly far from the film." [...] Concerning the gameplay style, he commented, [...] "We <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> to teach players that violence isn't always the right solution, but we never wanted to water down gameplay by taking that option away from them." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I loved {{working in}} a team because {{swimming}} isn't considered a team sport," [...] Cole told an interviewer in 2013. [...] "I <b>definitely</b> <b>wanted</b> a new challenge because when you've been competing for a decade the increments of improvements are quite small. However, in wheelchair basketball I knew that I could make big improvements. I've been chosen for the women's national league team, which is great, so I'm actually getting somewhere, which is a surprise. But my heart is definitely in swimming and I think it always will be." ...|$|R
