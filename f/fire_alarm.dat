5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> went off the fire was already well established. After the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E

Specific accommodation has been adapted for wheelchair users, while some rooms have sensory <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> calls to alert those who are hard of hearing. Halls are divided into flats accommodating several students. Each flat has a number of single rooms with shared kitchen and dining facilities, and a central lounge.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{finds the}} two {{sitting at a}} table with the dead guard's revolver. Modell forces Mulder to play Russian {{roulette}} with him. Despite Scully's pleading, Mulder pulls the trigger first at Modell and then himself, the hammer falling on an empty chamber both times. Modell then makes him aim the gun at Scully. At the last instant, Scully sees a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> in a mirror and pulls it in desperation, breaking Modell's concentration. Mulder instantly switches his aim to Modell and pulls the trigger; the bullet is fired and Modell is severely wounded.|$|E
50|$|One tragic {{example of}} the {{consequences}} of continued false alarms was the Boland Hall Fire on January 19, 2000. Because of false <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> many students started ignoring the <b>fire</b> <b>alarms.</b> However, when an actual fire broke out, three students who ignored the <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> died and many others suffered injuries.|$|R

5|$|The {{major event}} of the second day (August 31, 1983) was the {{successful}} deployment of the INSAT-1B satellite, which took place at 7:48 UTC, with Challenger then maneuvering to avoid the firing of the booster motor forty minutes later. Other experimentation continued, though telemetry through TDRS was lost for around three hours, requiring manual intervention. A <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> sounded in the morning, indicating signs of {{a fire in the}} avionics compartment, but a second alarm remained silent and it was eventually determined to be a false alarm.|$|E
5|$|At school, Cartman begins farting fire, and Kyle unsuccessfully {{tries to}} {{convince}} his teacher, Mr. Garrison, to excuse him from class to find his brother. When Chef learns that Kyle's brother was abducted and sees a machine emerge from Cartman's anus, he helps the boys escape from school by pulling the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm.</b> Once outside, Cartman reiterates that his abduction was only a dream, when suddenly he is hit by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to I Love to Singa. Soon afterward, a spaceship appears. Kyle throws a stone and the spaceship fires back, propelling Kenny into the road. As he gets back up, he is trampled over by a herd of cows, but survives. A police car then runs Kenny over and kills him.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{fails to}} {{complete}} the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm.</b> The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E

5|$|Just {{two and a}} {{half months}} later, though, the MTA stated that it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems with the security and <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> systems were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E
5|$|Once Fletcher {{realizes that}} he has been used by Harlow's father, he teams with the Gunmen to help Harlow find the second bioterrorist. After a few false starts and chases, the Lone Gunmen corner the bioterrorist with only a few minutes before his virus is due to be released. They realize that they lack the time to destroy his virus-filled organ and {{therefore}} pull a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm,</b> causing large emergency doors to seal shut, simultaneously containing the virus and entrapping them with it. Their sacrifice earns them a final resting place in Arlington National Cemetery, where Fletcher, John Doggett, Monica Reyes, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), Harlow and Jimmy Bond (Stephen Snedden) pay their respects to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm,</b> hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

5|$|The £3million {{refurbishment}} by Fry, {{the most}} extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before, included an expanded foyer, improved lift and disabled access to the stalls and royal circle levels, complete refurbishment of the bars {{and the creation of}} The Jeremy Fry Bar, in the former cellars of The Garrick's Head pub, and redecoration of the auditorium. Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building, with new <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> systems, air-conditioning and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%. The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work.|$|E
5|$|The trains {{operate at}} a {{frequency}} {{of one to}} two minutes to five to ten minutes between 05:00 and 00:00, depending upon the peak and off-peak hours. Trains operating within the network typically travel at speed up to , and stop for about 20 seconds at each station. Automated station announcements are recorded in Hindi and English. Many stations have services such as ATMs, food outlets, cafés, convenience stores and mobile recharge. Eating, drinking, smoking and chewing of gum are prohibited in the entire system. The Metro also has a sophisticated <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system for advance warning in emergencies, and fire retardant material is used in trains {{as well as on}} the premises of stations. Navigation information is available on Google Transit. Since October 2010, the first coach of every train is reserved for women. However, last coaches are also reserved when the train changes tracks at the terminal stations in the Red, Green and Violet Lines. To make travelling by metro a smoother experience, Delhi Metro has launched its own official app for smartphone users,(iPhone and Android) that will provide information on various facilities like nearest metro station, fare, parking availability, tourist spots near metro stations, security and emergency helpline numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{nursing home}} was {{equipped}} with a manual and automatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system that is connected directly to the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> office of the Chicago Fire Department. The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated. The manual <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system consisted of two pull <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> boxes located on each floor and one <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> box located {{at the entrance of}} the building. The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the third floor, both stairways and in the storage closet. The automatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system also consisted of smoke detectors. On the third floor, three fire extinguishers and two public address loud speakers were installed.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Sikes was Captain of Hook and Ladder Co. No. 1, and Eustance Gibson was Captain of Excelsior Fire Engine and Hose Co. No. 2. Both were Civil War veterans, {{well known}} and {{respected}} early settlers. Many of the volunteer personnel composed of well known early settlers, merchants and professional men, many of whose descendants are living in Huntington today. In 1876 a night-watchman was hired at $3 per month {{to look after the}} station at night and sound the alarm in case of a fire. This was the first paid employee of the fire department. In 1879 J.W. Verlander became the first Fire Chief, and J.M. Boone became chief in 1880 until 1895. In 1881, four Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> Boxes were installed in the downtown area. These <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> boxes were maintained by the telephone company. The system kept growing, and in 1928 construction was completed on a new Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> System and <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> Headquarters were placed in operation in 1929, and remained in service until 7:32AM November 1, 1986. The Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> System served the City of Huntington faithfully for 105 years. There never was a loss of life or major disaster because of a system malfunction.|$|E
25|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> box is {{an outdoor}} device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system {{and were the}} main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood {{in the days before}} people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, {{the city}} built its first new fire station since 1926. The city's 100th {{birthday}} was commemorated when the Centennial Fire Station {{was placed in}} service on January 13, 1972, replacing the long-outmoded Central Fire Station. The Centennial Fire Station is still in service today. In 2004, a new station was opened that replaced St. Cloud station 4. The old station has been in service as a fire house for over 100 years. It now houses the traffic division for the City Of Huntington. The 1980s were tough for the department, several firefighters retired, and budget cuts forced the closure of several stations. The Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> System was deactivated and <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> Headquarters closed. (The Old <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> Headquarters has {{been converted into a}} fire museum today.) Dispatching was combined with the Police Department, marking the beginning of 911 emergency dispatching.|$|E
