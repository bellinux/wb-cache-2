25|$|In 1884, Bolivia {{signed a}} truce, the Treaty of Valparaiso, whereby Bolivia {{accepted}} the military {{occupation of the}} entire Bolivian coast. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904) ceded the complete region of Antofagasta to Chile. In return, Chile agreed to build the Arica–La Paz railway, a railroad connecting {{the capital city of}} La Paz, Bolivia, with the port of Arica, and Chile guaranteed <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> for Bolivian commerce through Chilean ports and territory.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{proposed}} Klaipėda Convention reserved extensive rights for Poland to access, use, and govern {{the port of}} Klaipėda. This was completely unacceptable to Lithuania, which had terminated all diplomatic ties with Poland over the Vilnius Region. The stalled negotiations were referred to the League of Nations. The three-member commission, chaired by American Norman Davis, prepared the final convention which was signed by Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and Lithuania in May 1924. The Klaipėda Region became an autonomous region under unconditional sovereignty of Lithuania. The region had extensive legislative, judicial, administrative, and financial autonomy and elected its own local parliament. The port of Klaipėda was internationalized allowing <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit.</b> The convention was hailed as a major Lithuanian diplomatic victory as it contained none of the special rights initially reserved for Poland and placed no conditions on Lithuanian sovereignty in the region. However, the convention severely limited {{the powers of the}} Lithuanian government and caused frequent debates on the relationship between central and local authorities. In the 1920s, the relations between Lithuania and Germany under Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann were rather normal. However, tensions began to rise after Adolf Hitler came to power. Weaknesses of the convention were exploited by Nazi Germany when it supported anti-Lithuanian activities and campaigned for reincorporation of the region into Germany, culminating in the 1939 ultimatum.|$|E
2500|$|... 1885: Panama (Colón): January 18 and 19, US {{forces were}} used to guard the {{valuables}} in transit over the Panama Railroad, and the safes and vaults of the company during revolutionary activity. In March, April, and May in the cities of Colón and Panama, the forces helped reestablish <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> during revolutionary activity (see Burning of Colón).|$|E
50|$|The {{convention}} merely {{reaffirmed the}} statute adopted {{few days earlier}} at a League of Nations conference held in Barcelona. Article 1 of the statute defined <b>transit</b> as movement <b>of</b> persons and goods from one sovereign state to another. Article 2 recognized the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> sovereign governments to make transit arrangements within their territories. Article 3 prohibited governments from demanding payments for transit rights, except for dues designated to cover operational expenses. Article 4 made compulsory for governments to apply equal transit dues to all persons, regardless of nationality. Article 5 permitted governments to prevent the entry into their territories of certain persons or goods for reasons of security. Article 6 permitted governments to refrain from granting transit permission to persons of states that were non-signatories of the convention. Article 7 permitted governments to deviate from {{the provisions of the}} statute in cases of national emergency, but required this be done for as brief period as possible. Article 8 allowed exceptions in times of war. Article 9 stated that none of its provisions can contradict obligations of states within the League of Nations. Article 10 stated that the statute shall replace all other transit agreements concluded prior to 1 May 1921. Article 11 permitted governments to grant greater <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> than provided in the statute, if they chose to do so. Article 12 permitted governments to postpone temporarily the applications <b>of</b> the <b>transit</b> provisions in case their territory or parts of it still suffered from the devastation caused by the First World War. Article 13 provided for resolution of disputes regarding interpretation through the Permanent Court of International Justice. Article 14 permitted governments to refrain from applying reasonable transit provisions to territories that were either under populated or lacking in proper arrangements of the rule of law. Article 15 stated that different arrangements shall apply in League of Nations mandated territories.|$|R
5000|$|The Act was {{promoted}} by Edward Cardwell, the President of the Board of Trade {{and chairman of}} the Select Committee responsible for the examination of the various amalgamation bills passing through Parliament. The Committee recommended that [...] "Parliament should secure <b>freedom</b> and economy <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> {{from one end of the}} kingdom to the other and should compel railway companies to give the public the full advantage of convenient interchange from one railway system to another", and so came about the Railway and Canal Act 1854.|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{suspension}} characterization <b>of</b> a rapid <b>transit</b> {{vehicle is}} performed with a multi-body dynamic model that represents full degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> a rapid <b>transit</b> vehicle. The effects of lateral suspension properties on passenger ride comfort and stability are investigated by variation of critical suspension parameters using {{design of experiment}} method. The critical suspension properties are obtained for the best values of car body lateral acceleration and car body lateral stroke. The tangent track time response of the car body verified the negligible effect of both lateral viscous dampers at primary suspensions and longitudinal anti-yaw dampers at secondary suspensions on the passenger ride comfort and stability <b>of</b> a rapid <b>transit</b> vehicle.|$|R
2500|$|Originally {{the curfew}} ran from 9:00pm to 6:00am That curfew was later revised {{to be in}} effect from 10pm to 5am, was {{extended}} twice, ended on 7 July, and was restarted again on 15 July. Amnesty International and the International Observation Mission stated that the curfew implementation is arbitrary, with curfew times announced on radio stations, changing randomly each day and between different regions of Honduras. On 1 July, Congress issued an order (decreto ejecutivo N° 011-2009) {{at the request of}} Micheletti suspending four constitutional guarantees during the hours the curfew is in effect. The [...] "state of exception" [...] declared on 1 July is equivalent to a state of siege, and suspended civil liberties including <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> and due process, as well as permitting search and seizure without a warrant.|$|E
5000|$|... #Article: Barcelona Convention and Statute on <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transit</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The Barcelona Convention and Statute on <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transit</b> is an International treaty {{signed in}} Barcelona on 20 April 1921; the treaty ensures <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> for various {{commercial}} goods across national boundaries. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 8 October 1921. It {{went into effect}} on 31 October 1922. the convention is still in force at present.|$|E
60|$|So {{far there}} is much to be said for the Treaty. <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> through <b>transit</b> is a not {{unimportant}} part of good international practice and should be established everywhere. The objectionable feature of the Commissions lies in their membership. In each case the voting is so weighted as to place Germany in a clear minority. On the Elbe Commission Germany has four votes out of ten; on the Oder Commission three out of nine; on the Rhine Commission four out of nineteen; on the Danube Commission, which is not yet definitely constituted, she will be apparently in a small minority. On the government of all these rivers France and Great Britain are represented; and on the Elbe for some undiscoverable reason there are also representatives of Italy and Belgium.|$|R
30|$|In this work, the {{suspension}} properties for a rapid transit rail vehicle are characterized with multi-body dynamic model of 31 degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> (dof). The model accounts for all suspension elements and their degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> a rapid <b>transit</b> vehicle. The lateral acceleration {{is used as}} the measure for the passenger ride comfort throughout this work. Lateral viscous dampers at primary suspensions and the longitudinal anti-yaw dampers at secondary suspension had negligible effect on the passenger ride quality, and hence, these two suspension elements are neglected in the final model. The remaining secondary lateral suspension properties are estimated by varying {{the suspension}} parameters while keeping the remaining other parameters the same and by simulating of responses of lateral stroke and lateral acceleration of the car body. Finally, the selected suspension parameters are checked against stability {{with the use of}} a 3 D multi-body dynamic model and the acceleration response <b>of</b> a rapid <b>transit</b> vehicle is obtained for the optimized suspension properties.|$|R
