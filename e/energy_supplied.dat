5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the <b>energy</b> <b>supplied</b> by their hips and knees, while Pistorius {{compensates}} with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Efficient <b>energy</b> <b>supply,</b> storage, and {{distribution}} are key technical challenges for design {{and operation of}} electronic systems. In particular, <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> is the most scarce resource and constraint for mobile embedded systems where the supply lifetime, cost, weight, size, and portability are major concerns. With the advent of newer electrical <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> and storage technologies, <b>energy</b> <b>supplies</b> with differing energy/power storage densities, cost, size, and recycling abilities are becoming available. Efficient system design requires an exact matching between the fluctuating load demands and the underlying energy resources. Combining the <b>energy</b> <b>supplies</b> in a hierarchical way creates a unique opportunity for efficient matching and variable load serving. Such a heterogeneous hybrid network of <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> components could address a variety of power needs and serve a much broader range of system loads with a high efficiency. This paper presents a Hierarchial Architecture of Heterogenous Electrical <b>Energy</b> <b>Supplies</b> (HierArcHEES) that can be tuned to different load demands. I...|$|R

40|$|The <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> model MESSAGE (Model for <b>Energy</b> <b>Supply</b> Systems and Their General Environmental Impact) is {{a dynamic}} linear {{programming}} (DLP) model which minimizes total discounted costs of <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> over a given time horizon. The main subject of the model is the balancing of demand for secondary <b>energy</b> and <b>supply</b> of primary <b>energy</b> resources via a menu of technologies. The most important model constraints reflect limits on the speed of buildup of technologies, the availability of indigenous and imported resources, and technological relationships. The model considers load regions for electricity demand, disaggregates resources into cost categories, and calculates environmental impacts of <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> strategies. The model output is used to describe scenarios of <b>energy</b> <b>supply.</b> These scenarios account for the physical flows of energy between primary energy and end use; shadow prices {{of supply and demand}} constraints; and environmental impacts of <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> paths, expressed as emissions and concentrations of pollutants...|$|R

30|$|The <b>energy</b> <b>supplies</b> on the DC side of VSCs include {{photovoltaic}} panels, fuel cells, ESs, gas turbines, wind turbines, {{among others}} [2, 7]. The VSCs with fuel cells or the ESs on the DC side {{are regarded as}} voltage-source supplied (VS) VSCs in this investigation. On the one hand, a DC/DC converter is always equipped with these <b>energy</b> <b>supplies</b> to stabilize the voltage of the DC capacitor. On the other hand, these <b>energy</b> <b>supplies</b> can provide sufficient energy for the VSC within {{a certain period of}} time. Those VSCs with photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, or gas turbines on the DC side are called power-source supplied (PS) VSCs in this paper. The wind turbine or gas turbine is connected to the VSC through a rectifier generally, and the stabilization of the DC capacitor voltage is in the charge of VSC itself. Though the photovoltaic panel is also connected to the VSC by a DC/DC converter, it cannot ensure adequate <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> for the VSC under variable loads owing to the random <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> of the photovoltaic panel. Therefore, VSCs with these <b>energy</b> <b>supplies</b> are called PS-VSC in terms of the <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> on the DC side.|$|R

25|$|Strobe lights usually use flashtubes with <b>energy</b> <b>supplied</b> from a capacitor, {{an energy}} storage device {{much like a}} battery, but capable of {{charging}} and releasing energy much faster. Recently, some strobe lights {{have been found to}} use rectified mains electricity and no capacitors at all. In a capacitor-based strobe light, the capacitor is charged up to around 300 V. Once the capacitor has been charged, a small amount of power is diverted into a trigger transformer, a small transformer with a high turns ratio. This generates the weak but high voltage spike required to ionize the xenon gas in a flash tube. An arc is created inside the tube, which acts as a bridge for the much bigger pulse to flow down later. Arcs present almost a direct short circuit, allowing the capacitors to quickly release their energy into the arc. This rapidly heats the xenon gas, creating an extremely bright plasma discharge, which is seen as a flash.|$|E

In the past decade San Diego–Tijuana has developed new cooperative strategies to make energy consumption more efficient and effectively supply energy. In 2000 Sempra Energy constructed a natural gas pipeline to provide energy to a thermal power plant in Rosarito; also the principle plant in Baja California. The region was able to reduce levels of air pollution substantially when the conversion to a natural gas fired electrical generation facility was completed. In the Baja California subregions, unleaded gasoline has also replaced leaded fuel as means for transportation, helping regional air quality.
