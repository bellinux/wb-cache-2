40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 mutants {{affected}} {{in the ability}} to degrade acyclic isoprenoids were isolated with transposon mutagenesis. The gny cluster (for geranoyl), which encodes the enzymes involved in the lower pathway of acyclic isoprenoid degradation, was identified. The gny cluster is constituted by five probable structural genes, gnyDBHAL, and a possible regulatory gene, gnyR. Mutations in the gnyD, gnyB, gnyA, or gnyL gene caused inability to assimilate acyclic isoprenoids of the citronellol family of compounds. Transcriptional analysis showed that expression of the gnyB gene was induced by citronellol and repressed by glucose, whereas expression of the gnyR gene had the opposite behavior. Western blot analysis of citronellol-grown cultures showed induction of biotinylated proteins of 70 and 73 kDa, which probably correspond to 3 -methylcrotonoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase and geranoyl-CoA carboxylase (GCCase) alpha subunits, respectively. The 73 -kDa biotinylated protein, identified as the α-GCCase subunit, is encoded by gnyA. Intermediary metabolites of the isoprenoid pathway, citronellic and <b>geranic</b> <b>acids,</b> were shown to accumulate in gnyB and gnyA mutants. Our data suggest that the protein products encoded in the gny cluster are the β and α subunits of geranoyl-CoA carboxylase (GnyB and GnyA), the citronelloyl-CoA dehydrogenase (GnyD), the γ-carboxygeranoyl-CoA hydratase (GnyH), and the 3 -hydroxy-γ-carboxygeranoyl-CoA lyase (GnyL). We conclude that the gnyRDBHAL cluster is involved in isoprenoid catabolism...|$|R
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} (FA) {{degradation}} pathway of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, was recently {{shown to be}} involved in nutrient acquisition during BALB/c mouse lung infection model. The source of FA in the lung is believed to be phosphatidylcholine, the major component of lung surfactant. Previous research indicated that P. aeruginosa has more than two fatty acyl-CoA synthetase genes (fadD; PA 3299 and PA 3300), which are responsible for activation of FAs using ATP and coenzyme A. Through a bioinformatics approach, 11 candidate genes were identified by their homology to the Escherichia coli FadD in the present study. Four new homologues of fadD (PA 1617, PA 2893, PA 3860, and PA 3924) were functionally confirmed by their ability to complement the E. coli fadD mutant on FA-containing media. Growth phenotypes of 17 combinatorial fadD mutants on different FAs, as sole carbon sources, indicated that the four new fadD homologues are involved in FA degradation, bringing the total number of P. aeruginosa fadD genes to six. Of the four new homologues, fadD 4 (PA 1617) contributed the most to the degradation of different chain length FAs. Growth patterns of various fadD mutants on plant-based perfumery substances, citronellic and <b>geranic</b> <b>acids,</b> as sole carbon and energy sources indicated that fadD 4 is also involved in the degradation of these plant-derived compounds.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 gnyRDBHAL cluster, which is involved in acyclic isoprenoid degradation (A. L. Díaz-Pérez, N. A. Zavala-Hernández, C. Cervantes, and J. Campos-García, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70 : 5102 - 5110, 2004), corresponds to the liuRABCDE cluster (B. Hoschle, V. Gnau, and D. Jendrossek, Microbiology 151 : 3649 - 3656, 2005). A liu (leucine and isovalerate utilization) homolog cluster {{was found in the}} PAO 1 genome and is related to the catabolism of acyclic monoterpenes of the citronellol family (AMTC); it was named the atu cluster (acyclic terpene utilization), consisting of the atuCDEF genes and lacking the hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) lyase (HMG-CoA lyase) homolog. Mutagenesis of the atu and liu clusters showed that both are involved in AMTC and leucine catabolism by encoding the enzymes related to the geranyl-CoA and the 3 -methylcrotonyl-CoA pathways, respectively. Intermediary metabolites of the acyclic monoterpene pathway, citronellic and <b>geranic</b> <b>acids,</b> were accumulated, and leucine degradation rates were affected in both atuF and liuD mutants. The alpha subunit of geranyl-CoA carboxylase and the alpha subunit of 3 -methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (α-MCCase), encoded by the atuF and liuD genes, respectively, were both induced by citronellol, whereas only the α-MCCase subunit was induced by leucine. Both citronellol and leucine also induced a LacZ transcriptional fusion at the liuB gene. The liuE gene encodes a probable hydroxy-acyl-CoA lyase (probably HMG-CoA lyase), an enzyme with bifunctional activity that is essential for both AMTC and leucine degradation. P. aeruginosa PAO 1 products encoded by the liuABCD cluster showed a higher sequence similarity (77. 2 to 79. 5 %) with the probable products of liu clusters from several Pseudomonas species than with the atuCDEF cluster from PAO 1 (41. 5 %). Phylogenetic studies suggest that the atu cluster from P. aeruginosa could be the result of horizontal transfer from Alphaproteobacteria. Our results suggest that the atu and liu clusters are bifunctional operons involved in both the AMTC and leucine catabolic pathways...|$|R

40|$|Green mould, blue mould {{and sour}} rot, {{caused by the}} fungi Penicillium digitatum, P. italicum and Geotrichum citri-aurantii, are postharvest {{diseases}} which cause significant losses to the citrus industry worldwide. Current control of the diseases raises some problems, such as development of fungicide resistance, concerns about residues harmful to humans, and also restrictions {{on the use of}} certain fungicides. Those problems have led to a need to develop alternative fungicides, including exploitation of some natural products such as essential oils. Application of the essential oil, citral (3, 7 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadienal) to control the fungi and the diseases was assessed in this study. In vitro, citral incorporated into agar at 2 %, 6 % and 15 % prevented germination of spores of the fungi, and no mycelial growth was observed by microscopic observation after 17 days of incubation. When citral was applied as a solution on agar, spore germination of P. digitatum and G. citri-aurantii was inhibited at concentrations of 6 % and 15 %. However, germination of P. italicum spores was not affected. Vapour of citral and its individual isomers, geranial and neral, generated from 6 and 15 % aqueous solutions, inhibited spore germination and growth of the three pathogens. Vapour generated from 15 % aqueous solutions of citral and geranial were fungicidal to P. digitatum and G. citri-aurantii, and fungistatic to P. italicum, while neral was fungicidal to G. citri-aurantii and fungistatic to the other two fungi. The result suggested that method of application and citral concentration affected the efficacy of citral in controlling the fungi. In the three methods of applications examined, citral was effective in controlling G. citri-aurantii, especially at high concentration. As an α, β-unsaturated aldehyde, citral may be degraded over time due to oxidative reactions, resulting in change in its composition, and this may affect its antifungal activity. Storage of citral may result in the oxidation of neral and geranial to produce neric acid and <b>geranic</b> <b>acid.</b> GC/MS results showed that neral, geranial, neric acid and <b>geranic</b> <b>acid</b> were detected, while the related compounds, nerol, geraniol, citronellal, citronellol and citronellic acid were not detected either for citral stored at 5 °C or at room temperature. At room temperature, geranial and neral content declined more quickly than at 5 °C. The effect of citral on the incidence of disease on fruit was studied by applying citral as a fumigant. Wounded oranges inoculated with spore suspension (10 ⁶ spores mL⁻¹) of the fungi were placed in 5 -litre plastic boxes, fumigated with 2, 6, or 15 % citral, and incubated at 5 °C or room temperature. Fumigation of oranges with citral in this closed system delayed the onset of sour rot at room temperature by 7 – 10 days and at 5 °C, by 13 – 30 days, suggesting that volatile citral controlled G. citri-aurantii on fruit as well as in vitro. The effects of fumigation with citral on green and blue mould were more variable. Fumigation delayed the onset of green mould and blue mould at 5 °C by 2 days at the higher concentrations (6 and 15 %) tested, while at room temperature, spoilage was not delayed even at the highest concentration tested. Measurement of citral in the headspace of boxes containing fruit and citral-soaked pads showed that the concentration above the fruit was higher than that measured below the fruit both at 5 °C and at room temperature. Phytotoxicity symptoms were observed on the upper surface of some fruit that was close to or in direct contact with the citral-soaked pad at concentrations of 6 % and 15 %, suggesting that phytotoxicity may have been associated with high volatile citral concentration. However, citral residue was not detected in oranges irrespective of treatment with citral, which suggested that little citral had penetrated into the peel. During storage the citral content decreased due to oxidation of geranial and neral to produce <b>geranic</b> <b>acid</b> and neric acid both at 5 °C and room temperature. This may have {{had an impact on the}} efficacy of citral against the pathogens. Findings may contribute to a better understanding of the efficacy of citral when applied to the pathogens in vitro and to the development of effective control methods when applied on fruit. The possibility of combining citral treatment with other commonly used practices is also worthy of consideration. For example, citral could be combined with heat treatment to increase the volatility of the citral. In addition, incorporation of citral in a wax formulation may allow a low concentration of citral to be used in direct contact with the pathogens on fruit. Fumigation of fruit with citral may offer potential as a means to control development of sour rot of oranges, and its effects on fruit quality, flavour and nutritional aspects require further investigation.

40|$|Phyllanthus watsonii Airy Shaw is an endemic plant {{found in}} Peninsular Malaysia. Although there are {{numerous}} reports on the anti cancer properties of other Phyllanthus species, published information on the cytotoxicity of P. watsonii are very limited. The present study was carried out with bioassay-guided fractionation approach to evaluate the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction capability of the P. watsonii extracts and fractions on human gynecologic (SKOV- 3 and Ca Ski) and colon (HT- 29) cancer cells. P. watsonii extracts exhibited strong cytotoxicity on all the cancer cells studied with IC 50 values of # 20. 0 mg/mL. Hexane extract of P. watsonii was further subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation and yielded 10 fractions (PW- 1 RPW- 10). PW- 4 RPW- 8 portrayed stronger cytotoxic activity and was further subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation and resulted with 8 sub-fractions (PPWH- 1 RPPWH- 8). PPWH- 7 possessed greatest cytotoxicity (IC 50 values ranged from 0. 66 – 0. 83 mg/mL) and was selective on the cancer cells studied. LC-MS/MS analysis of PPWH- 7 revealed the presence of ellagic acid, <b>geranic</b> <b>acid,</b> glochidone, betulin, phyllanthin and sterol glucoside. Marked morphological changes, ladder-like appearance of DNA and increment in caspase- 3 activity indicating apoptosis were clearly observed in both human gynecologic and colon cancer cells treated with P. watsonii especially with PPWH- 7. The study also indicated that P. watsonii extracts arrested cell cycle at different growth phases in SKOV- 3, Ca Ski and HT- 29 cells. Cytotoxic and apoptotic potential of the endemic P. watsonii was investigated {{for the first time}} by bioassay-guided approach. These result...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Monoterpenes {{present a}} large and {{versatile}} group of unsaturated hydrocarbons of plant origin with widespread use in the fragrance as well as food industry. The anaerobic β-myrcene degradation pathway in Castellaniella defragrans strain 65 Phen differs from well known aerobic, monooxygenase-containing pathways. The initial enzyme linalool dehydratase-isomerase ldi /LDI catalyzes the hydration of β-myrcene to (S) -(+) -linalool and its isomerization to geraniol. A high-affinity geraniol dehydrogenase geoA /GeDH and a geranial dehydrogenase geoB /GaDH contribute {{to the formation of}} <b>geranic</b> <b>acid.</b> A genetic system was for the first time applied for the betaproteobacterium to prove in vivo the relevance of the linalool dehydratase-isomerase and the geraniol dehydrogenase. In-frame deletion cassettes were introduced by conjugation and two homologous recombination events. Results Polar effects were absent in the in-frame deletion mutants C. defragrans Δ ldi and C. defragrans Δ geoA. The physiological characterization of the strains demonstrated a requirement of the linalool dehydratase-isomerase for growth on acyclic monoterpenes, but not on cyclic monoterpenes. The deletion of geoA resulted in a phenotype with hampered growth rate on monoterpenes as sole carbon and energy source as well as reduced biomass yields. Enzyme assays revealed the presence of a second geraniol dehydrogenase. The deletion mutants were in trans complemented with the broad-host range expression vector pBBR 1 MCS- 4 ldi and pBBR 1 MCS- 2 geoA, restoring in both cases the wild type phenotype. Conclusions In-frame deletion mutants of genes in the anaerobic β-myrcene degradation revealed novel insights in the in vivo function. The deletion of a high-affinity geraniol dehydrogenase hampered, but did not preclude growth on monoterpenes. A second geraniol dehydrogenase activity was present that contributes to the β-myrcene degradation pathway. Growth on cyclic monoterpenes independent of the initial enzyme LDI suggests the presence of a second enzyme system activating unsaturated hydrocarbons. </p...|$|E
40|$|Hydrosols are hydrodistillation {{products}} of aromatic plants. They contain less than 1 g/L of dispersed essential oils giving organoleptic properties. Hydrosols {{are subjected to}} microbial proliferation. Reasons for spoilage have {{to be found in}} the nature of substrates supporting growth and ofmicrobiological contaminants. The composition in essential oils and themicrobiota of 22 hydrosol samples of Citrus aurantium L. ssp. amara L. (orange blossom), Rosa damascena Miller (rose D.), and Rosa centifolia L. (rose C.) flowers were analyzed to determine the factors responsible for decay. The median concentrations in essential oils were 677 mg/L for orange blossom hydrosols, 205 mg/L for rose D. hydrosols, and 116 mg/L for rose C. hydrosols. The dry matter content of these hydrosols varied between 4. 0 mg/L and 702 mg/L, and the carbohydrate content varied between 0. 21 mg/L and 0. 38 mg/L. These non-volatile compounds were likely carried over during distillation by a priming and foaming effect, and could be used as nutrients by microorganisms. A microbial proliferation at ambient temperature and also at 5 °C has been observed in all studied hydrosols when stored in a non-sterile container. In contaminated hydrosols,maximal countswere about 7 log 10 CFU/mL,while the French pharmacopeia recommends a maximal total bacterial count of 2 log 10 CFU/mL. Neither yeast nor mold was detected. The isolated microbial population was composed of environmental Gram-negative bacteria, arranged in four major genera: Pseudomonas sp., Burkholderia cepacia complex, and presumably two new genera belonging to Acetobacteraceae and Rhodospirillaceae. Among those bacteria, Burkholderia vietnamiensis and Novosphingobium capsulatum were able to metabolize volatile compounds, such as geraniol to produce 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one or <b>geranic</b> <b>acid,</b> or phenylethyl acetate to produce 2 -phenylethanol. EO concentrations in hydrosols or cold storage are not sufficient to insure microbiological stability. Additional hurdles such as chemical preservatives or aseptic packaging will be necessary to insure microbial stability...|$|E
40|$|Phyllanthaceae {{species have}} been {{extensively}} used in folk medicine in most tropical and subtropical countries for thousand of years. However, there is a paucity {{of information on the}} cytotoxic properties of these plants. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the cytotoxic and apoptotic activity of crude methanol (CME), hexane (CHE) and ethyl acetate (CEE) extracts of the selected Phyllanthaceae species collected from different parts of Peninsular Malaysia, namely Phyllanthus niruri (dukong anak), P. pectinatus (Pokok Melaka), P. acidus (cermai), P. roseus (Labu Kuncing), P. watsonii and Baccaurea motleyana (rambai). Cytotoxic activities were screened using an in vitro assay system of growth inhibition against four human cancer cell lines, namely breast cancer cells (MCF 7), ovarian cancer cells (SKOV 3), epidermal carcinoma of cervix cells (CaSki), colon cancer cells (HT 29), and one normal lung fibroblast cells (MRC 5). CME and CEE of P. pectinatus (leaves) exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against SKOV 3 cells with IC 50 values of 4. 8 ± 1. 04 and 5. 8 ± 0. 76 g/ml, respectively. CEE of P. pectinatus (fruit) exhibited strong cytotoxicity on MCF 7 and CaSki cells with IC 50 values of 18. 1 ± 0. 66 and 19. 4 ± 0. 53 g/ml, respectively. CHE of P. watsonii exhibited strong cytotoxicity with IC 50 values of 7. 9 ± 0. 60, 5. 8 ± 0. 29, 6. 9 ± 0. 96 and 11. 8 ± 1. 61 g/ml on MCF 7, SKOV 3, CaSki and HT 29 cells, respectively. CEE of P. watsonii demonstrated the potent cytotoxicity with an IC 50 value of 3. 6 ± 1. 01 g/ml on CaSki cells, as well as on HT 29 and SKOV 3 cells with IC 50 values of 5. 1 ± 0. 36 and 5. 5 ± 0. 50 g/ml, respectively. CHE of P. watsonii was further subjected for bioassay-guided fractionation and yielded 10 fractions (PW 1 – PW 10). PW 4 – PW 8 portraying a stronger cytotoxic activity against MCF 7, SKOV 3, CaSki and HT 29 cells and was further subjected for bioassay-guided fractionation and this resulted in 8 fractions (PPW 1 – PPW 8). Cytotoxic activity of fraction PPW 7 on MCF 7, SKOV 3, CaSki and HT 29 cells were more active with IC 50 values of 0. 9 ± 0. 06, 0. 7 ± 0. 06, 0. 8 ± 0. 00 and 0. 8 ± 0. 10 g/ml. Cytotoxic activity of CME, CHE and CEE of P. watsonii and fraction PPW 7 were shown to be quite selective for cancer cells with selectivity index ranging from 4. 4 to 14. 6. Fraction PPW 7 was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis and six main compounds were identified. The compounds detected were ellagic acid, <b>geranic</b> <b>acid,</b> glochidone, betulin, phyllanthin and sterol glucoside. Marked morphological changes, ladder-like appearance of DNA and increment in caspase- 3 activity indicating of apoptosis were clearly observed in MCF 7, SKOV 3, CaSki and HT 29 cells-treated with cytotoxically active crude extracts of P. pectinatus (leaves and fruits), and P. watsonii, and fractions PPW 6 and PPW 7. It was also observed that CHE of P. watsonii arrested MCF 7, SKOV 3 and CaSki cells at G 0 /G 1 - S, S-G 2 /M and G 0 /G 1 - G 2 /M phases, and fraction PPW 7 arrested SKOV 3 cells at S and G 2 /M phases. Cytotoxic activity of endemic P. watsonii collected directly from Endau-Rompin Park, Johor against MCF 7, SKOV 3, CaSki and HT 29 cells were investigated for the first time. These results demonstrated that P. watsonii has strong cytotoxic effect by inducing apoptotic cell death, increasing caspase- 3 activity, and causing arrest of cancer cells at different growth phases. Hence, P. watsonii {{has the potential to be}} further exploited for the discovery and development for new anticancer pharmaceuticals...|$|E
40|$|Infochemicals play an {{important}} role in interactions between living organisms in aquatic environments. Although the presence of these chemical cues is confirmed in more and more systems, the chemical structures of the compounds involved remain predominantly elusive and the identification of these compounds is essential to advance the research on chemical communication. An overview of chemical cues involving Daphnia (either as producer or receiver) is given and the progress towards their isolation and structure elucidation is described (Chapter 1). Most of the research so far has concentrated on the elucidation of kairomones produced by predators of Daphnia (especially Chaoborus and several species of fish). Less study has been devoted to the isolation of the infochemical exuded by Daphnia that causes colony formation in its prey Scenedesmus. One of the main aims of this study was the isolation and identification of this chemical cue. Colony formation in Scenedesmus only occurs when unicellular populations are exposed to either Daphnia or water that had contained Daphnia. It was concluded that the responsible cue had a chemical rather than a mechanical nature, since filtered Daphnia water also showed the colony formation activity. This colony formation was the basis for the development of a bioassay (Chapter 2). A bioassay is a test that is used to measure biological activity (in this case colony formation) of chemical mixtures or biological parameters. Colonies are indicated by high values and single cells are indicated by low values. Unfortunately over time a gradual decline of the difference between negative and positive controls was observed and efforts were undertaken to determine the cause for this decline. Several conditions were investigated (such as time, temperature, algae strain, culture medium, location, incubator, Erlenmeyer size, bacterial growth and microevolution). Additionally some general properties of the kairomone (such as thermal decomposition, biodegradation and concentration) were tested. A correlation between any of the above mentioned factors and the gradual decline of the difference between negative and positive controls was not found. Given that the bioassay was performed under such highly variable and not strictly controlled circumstances, this particular bioassay seems to be rather robust. However this does not defer from the fact that the quality of the bioassay did decline over time. Until the variable is identified that is responsible for the observed decline in difference between positive and negative controls, more care should be taken to standardise as many variables as possible. Despite its drawbacks, a bioassay still remains the best option to guide isolations of bioactive compounds through controlled experiments as long as observed differences are statistically significant. To find the most suitable and practical method for the analysis of Daphnia test water several sample pre-treatment methods were compared (Chapter 3), such as liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction, stir-bar sorptive extraction, solid-phase disk extraction. A test mixture with ten known natural compounds differing in polarity (log K o/w between - 4. 34 and 3. 70) was used. The best method for small amounts of sample was either 'stirred' SPE or 'cartridge' SPE, but for large amounts of sample (sometimes up to 20 L) 'syringe' SPE was more suited. Consequently an SPE analysis protocol was developed that could elute the active compound in one fraction (Chapter 4). The experiments were performed with different concentrations of organic solvents and different sorbents (endcapped C 18, MF C 18, non-endcapped C 18, C 8, C 2, CN, ENV + and Oasis ® HLB). Endcapped C 18 was eventually chosen for further experiments (other sorbents did not perform better) and extracted with differing concentrations of methanol in water (50 %, 85 %) and pure methanol (100 %). The chemical cue was most often recovered from the 85 % aqueous methanol fraction, which indicates the cue is moderately non-polar. Biological activity was lost when active Daphnia water was partitioned at pH 12. 0 against ethyl acetate. The aqueous and organic layer were both inactive, either by inactivation of the kairomone by the basic conditions in the aqueous layer or possibly more than one compound is present with synergistic effects. At lower pH (2. 0 and 7. 0) biological activity was recovered from the organic layer. This could be an indication that the active compound contains an anionic group. Experiments performed with ion exchange materials (SAX, SCX and Amberlite IRA- 400) focused initially on the anion exchanger (SAX). However colony formation activity was recovered from the unretained fraction in contrast to what had been reported previously. This unexpected result prompted extraction with a cation exchanger (SCX). To exclude problems related to pH sensitive silica based sorbents, experiments were repeated on a resin based sorbent (Amberlite IRA- 400), however a similar result was obtained as with the SAX sorbent. No satisfying explanation was found for the presence of biological activity in the unretained fractions and absence from the retained fractions, but different counterions on the ion exchangers could play a role. The enriched extracts obtained by SPE (C 18) were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography. One fraction showed a significantly higher biological activity relative to the control ('Fraction C'). Further fractionation yielded three active fractions (C 2, C 3, C 6). This could be an indication that more than one compound is responsible for the activity. Several natural products were biologically inactive when screened in the bioassay. They were, ecdysterone and juvenile hormone III (important hormones in other Crustaceae), urea (proposed as kairomone in Daphnia - Scenedesmus system), and <b>geranic</b> <b>acid</b> (reference compound). Although an assumption was made to ignore possible synergistic or additive effects in these experiments, the possibility of synergism or additivity should not be ignored, given that most likely more than one active fraction is present. At this point, due to the lack of reproducible and significant results from bioassay-guided separations, another way to identify possible candidates for the role of kairomone had to be used. Daphnia and control water were first extracted using SPE and then analysed with chromatographic techniques. Chromatograms of biologically active extracts were then compared with chromatograms of non-active control extracts to determine and recognise unique peaks (i. e. peaks only present in active Daphnia test water extracts). In an attempt to maximise the available data on the unknown colony inducing compound(s) several techniques were applied simultaneously, such as gas and liquid chromatography (Chapter 5). Several small unique peaks were recognised in the silylated extracts of Daphnia test water with GC-MS analysis. Some of these were tentatively identified as dodecanol, azelaic acid, sebacic acid and veratroylformic acid, but they did not induce colonisation. HPLC detection was performed not only with ultraviolet spectroscopy but also with evaporative light scattering and by electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry to avoid overlooking compounds without a UV chromophore. LC analysis on four columns with different packings ensured that peaks were well separated on at least one column. Chromatograms with the best resolution were obtained on a C 18 column with an ACN- H 2 O gradient and UV detection. High noise levels reduced the usefulness of ELS detection. Several peaks unique to 90 % aqueous MeOH extracts of Daphnia test water were detected, but unfortunately not identified. Some of the recognised unique peaks (B, G, K) eluted in previously identified active regions ('Fraction C'). Especially peak B ([M-H] ¯ = 752. 8 ?, l max 227 nm) was present in high amounts and well separated from neighbouring peaks. Therefore this peak was further analysed by liquid chromatography-nuclear magnetic resonance. Peaks from several extracts were trapped onto one SPE cartridge. This way a sufficient amount of analyte could be transferred into the NMR probe to allow recording of a 1 -dimensional 1 H-spectrum. Unfortunately the spectrum did not lead to elucidation of the structure of peak B. One aliquot of this collected fraction was therefore analysed by high-resolution mass spectrometry and liquid-chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass-spectrometry to obtain an accurate mass, while another aliquot was checked for biological activity in a bioassay. Unfortunately analysis with HRMS was unsuccessful and analysis with LC-QTOF has not yet yielded results. The peak with a possible pseudo molecular mass of 752. 8 ([M-H] ¯) could not be detected. The other aliquot that was tested for biological activity in the bioassay showed significant differences between the negative control, positive control and peak B. This peak could therefore play a role in the induction of colonies in Scenedesmus, although it is still unclear whether it acts alone. Should peak B prove to be (partly) responsible for colony formation in Scenedesmus then the most important objective of this study has been partly reached, namely the isolation of kairomone(s) in the Daphnia - Scenedesmus system. This information will enable and facilitate research into the other objectives...|$|E
