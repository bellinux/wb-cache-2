50|$|The {{site was}} created when Thomas Neale {{laid out the}} Seven <b>Dials</b> <b>area</b> in 1692. By the 1970s the block was {{occupied}} by an ageing, densely-packed cluster of terraced houses surrounding a yard that had been completely filled with building extensions.

50|$|Traditionally, each {{central office}} could serve up to 10,000 {{subscriber}} numbers, {{resulting in a}} four-digit line or station number. Thus, the new numbering plan identified each telephone in the system with {{the combination of the}} area code, the central office code, and the line number, resulting in a closed telephone numbering plan with a ten-digit national telephone number for each telephone. The leading part of this address was the area code (three digits), followed by the seven-digit subscriber number consisting of three digits for the central office and four digits for the station. The intent was that subscribers should not have to dial an area code when making a local call or a call within their plan area, resulting in seven-digit <b>dialing.</b> <b>Area</b> codes were only required in ten-digit dialing when placing foreign area calls to subscribers in another state or numbering plan area.|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} {{proposition}} that ideology has effects on criminological beliefs, a telephone survey was conducted. The population sampled was all adults living in the Lincoln, Nebraska, <b>dialing</b> <b>area</b> who {{have at least one}} telephone in their home. A total of 225 interviews was completed. Based on past research showing class differences, ideology was conceptualized as two distinct variables [...] Social Ideology and Economic Ideology. Beliefs about the Causes of Crime and Beliefs about the Best Treatment of Criminals, seen as central to the field of theoretical criminology, were measured with Thurstone scales. Five background variables (Sex, Age, Social Class, Religious Orthodoxy, and Rural/Urban Origin) were included as control variables. ^ The principal hypotheses of this study were that Social Ideology and Economic Ideology have independent causal effects on Beliefs about the Causes of Crime and Beliefs about the Best Treatment of Criminals, and that Beliefs about the Causes of Crime has an independent causal effect on Beliefs about the Best Treatment of Criminals. The results of this study support all five hypotheses. The total effects (zero-order correlations) of each independent variable were all significantly different from zero, and inclusion of the background variables did not reduce the direct effects (standardized multiple regression coefficients) significantly. Social Ideology, especially, had strong total and direct effects on the criminological belief variables. ^ The effects of the background variables on the ideology variables, and especially on the criminological belief variables, were weak. Of all the background variables, only Sex had a significant direct effect on either of the criminological variables [...] females are more conservative in their beliefs about the causes of crime [...] but the relative size of this effect is small. The background variables, however, did explain significant amounts of the variations of the ideology variables. As hypothesized, Social Class has a positive direct effect on Social Ideology (the higher the Social Class, the more liberal the Social Ideology), and a negative direct effect on Economic Ideology (the higher the Social Class, the more conservative the Economic Ideology). Age also has strong direct effects on the two ideology variables (older people are more conservative on both), but Rural/Urban Origin, Religious Orthodoxy, and Sex had relatively small and inconsistent effects on the ideology variables. ...|$|E

50|$|Work {{with young}} women however {{was seen as}} less {{important}} because young women's needs at this time were seen as being centred on home making, which were already (supposedly) provided for in the home. This changed in 1878 when youth work pioneer Maude Stanley developed work with young women around the Five <b>Dials</b> <b>area</b> of London. She went on to establish the Girls Club Union.|$|R

5000|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, Saxons arrived in and around Brighton and the area became part of the Kingdom of Sussex. From around 827 Sussex was annexed by the neighbouring Kingdom of Wessex, which evolved into the Kingdom of England.

[...] Morris Angel's shop became popular with theatrical actors, who {{at that time}} had to purchase their own clothes and costumes for auditions and performances.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} broadsides {{that survive}} {{date from the}} early sixteenth century, but relatively few survive before 1550. From 1556 the Stationers Company in London attempted to force registration of all ballads and some 2,000 were recorded between then and 1600, but, since they were easy to print and distribute, {{it is likely that}} far more were printed. Scholars often distinguish between the earlier blackletter broadsides, using larger heavy 'gothic' print, most common up {{to the middle of the}} seventeenth century, and lighter whiteletter, roman or italic typefaces, that were easier to read and became common thereafter. [...] A centre of broadside production was the Seven <b>Dials</b> <b>area</b> of London.|$|R

50|$|In {{large cities}} with coexisting manual and <b>dial</b> <b>areas,</b> the {{numbering}} was generally standardized to one format. For example, {{when the last}} manual exchange in San Francisco was converted to dial in 1953, the numbers had for several years been in the format of JUniper 6-5833. JUniper 4 was automatic, but JUniper 6 was manual. To call JUniper 6 from JUniper 4, the subscriber dialed the number and it was displayed to the B-board operator at JUniper 6, and that operator would complete the connection manually. In the other direction, to call JUniper 4 from JUniper 6, the subscriber would lift the receiver and speak to the JUniper 4 operator who would in turn dial the JUniper 6 number.|$|R

40|$|The {{interface}} {{of public}} payphone equipment in Malaysia {{is comprised of}} the keypad <b>dial</b> <b>area,</b> the telephone receiver, coin or card insert-return areas, liquid crystal display (LCD) unit, and the main housing itself. As icons play {{a very important role}} in the user interaction and overall semantics of the payphone, this paper studies the design of public payphone icons in relation to its intended function. A survey was conducted to determine the public perception of icons presently found on payphones installed around the Malaysia. Subsequently, a new set of icon designs were proposed and evaluated for its effectiveness. This paper concludes with the discussion of the survey results and recommendations for improving the icon design that is capable of enhancing the usability of Malaysian public payphones...|$|R
50|$|The {{landed estate}} {{formally}} {{belonged to the}} Worshipful Company of Mercers which allowed building licences on what was open farmland to maximise their income in what was the burgeoning West End of the developing metropolitan area. The original layout of the Seven <b>Dials</b> <b>area</b> was designed by Thomas Neale in the early 1690s. The original plan had six roads converging, although this was later increased to seven. The sundial column was built with only six faces, with the column itself acting as the gnomon of the seventh dial. This layout was chosen to produce triangular plots, in order to maximise the frontage of houses to be built on the site, as rentals were charged per foot of frontage {{rather than by the}} square footage of properties.|$|R
