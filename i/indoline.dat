This method has determined that quinuclidone ranks among secondary and tertiary amines in terms of proton affinity. This high basicity is hypothesized to be due to the loss of electron delocalization when the amide bond is twisted—this causes misalignment of the pi orbitals, resulting in loss of electron resonance.|$|E

Cleavage of the acetyl group and ester hydrolysis with HCl in methanol resulted in formation of pyridone ester 12 with additional isomerization of the exocyclic double bond to an endocyclic double bond (destroying one asymmetric center). Subsequent treatment with hydrogen iodide and red phosphorus removed the tosyl group and hydrolysed both remaining ester groups to form diacid 13.

Saponification of the nitrile (2) to the corresponding acid (3) followed by Curtius rearrangement leads to isocyanate (5). Acidhydrolysis of the isocyanate leads directly to the <b>indoline</b> (6), no doubt by way of internal Schiff base formation fromthe intermediate amine. Methylation by means of trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate affords ternary iminium salt 7. Treatment of that reactive carbonyl-like functionality with diazomethane gives the so-called azonia salt 8 (note the analogy to the hypothetical oxirane involved in ring expansion of ketones with diazomethane).
