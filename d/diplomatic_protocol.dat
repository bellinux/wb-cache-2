About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg managed to save the lives of tens {{of thousands}} of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection.

25|$|The dignitaries {{were seated}} alphabetically {{according}} to the French spelling of their country's name and arranged according to <b>diplomatic</b> <b>protocol,</b> with Sovereigns taking precedence over elected heads of state and seated in the front row. The largest delegations were the Italian (sitting in the first honorary seats were the President of Italy and other high Italian dignitaries) and Polish ones. As such, Israeli President Moshe Katsav sat only two seats away {{from the president of}} Iran amidst strained relations. Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe defied a European Union travel ban to attend the funeral. Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian made an unprecedented appearance and was seated in the front row as the head of state of China, due to the existence of diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the Republic of China. The People's Republic of China was not invited to the funeral and protested to Italy for allowing Chen passage to the Vatican. Altogether, the Mass of Requiem was deemed at the time to be the largest gathering of heads of state in world history, exceeding the gathering at the state funeral of Sir Winston Churchill in London in 1965.

40|$|During {{the term}} of Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil as {{governor}} of New France (1703 - 1725), diplomacy involving the French and the Amerindian nations {{to the west of}} Montreal was conducted in accordance with <b>diplomatic</b> <b>protocols</b> of Amerindian origin. Diplomatic relations between the Amerindians and the French were predicated {{on the basis of a}} fictive kinship relationship, wherein the French governor assumed the Amerindian title Onontio and the role of a "father" to his Amerindian "children. " The forum for formal intercultural encounters was the council, an Amerindian institution that consisted of a structured dialogue between two parties, punctuated by the exchange of validating gifts. The diplomatic culture of the French made few inroads into the intercultural diplomacy of the period. Neither the Amerindian nor the French diplomats of the period acted as comprehensive cultural mediators during diplomatic encounters. Vaudreuil's corps of diplomatic agents was largely made up of military officers, seconded by interpreters. All of these agents were ethnic Frenchmen, although many interpreters benefited from intermarriage with synethnic and Amerindian women. Few agents cultivated long-term ties with Amerindian groups, or mastered Amerindian languages; those that did were to be found in the lower ranks of colonial society. In general, French agents were primarily interested in exploiting diplomatic ties with Amerindians in order to advance both French interests and their personal careers. French diplomatic agents adopted and learned to manipulate selected Amerindian <b>diplomatic</b> <b>protocols</b> in order to fulfill these goals. Although the French made extensive cultural adaptations in the realm of diplomacy, their motives were pragmatic, and their acculturation limited. The value and meaning with which they invested these alien diplomatic institutions were different form those the Amerindians accorded to the same forms. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

500|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny {{as early as}} 1970.

According to Time, [...] "There was some speculation in Moscow" [...] that if Brezhnev didn't succeed in removing Podgorny he would establish a Council of State modelled after institutions found in, for example, East Germany (Staatsrat), People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Socialist Republic of Romania. The post of Chairman of the Council of State would give Brezhnev the top state and party job in the USSR. Brezhnev's backers were unable, and didn't even try, to remove Podgorny {{from the head of}} state post at the 1970 Central Committee plenum. Brezhnev could count on only five votes, while another seven Politburo members were opposed to granting Brezhnev more power; removing Podgorny would in fact mean the end of the collective leadership.|$|E
500|$|The flag of Kosovo has a blue background, {{charged with}} a map of Kosovo and six stars. The stars are officially meant to symbolise Kosovo's six major ethnic groups: Albanians, Serbs, Turks, Gorani, Romani (often grouped with the Ashkali and Egyptians) and Bosniaks. Unofficially, the stars are {{sometimes}} said to represent the six regions, which according to Albanian ultra nationalist ideology, make up Greater Albania: Albania, Kosovo, western parts of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, parts of northern Greece, parts of Montenegro and Preševo Valley in southern Serbia. The flag of Kosovo resembles that of Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of colors and shapes used (white stars and yellow shape of the country on a blue field). The flag is unusual among national flags in using a map as a design element; the Flag of Cyprus is the only other to do so. The ratio of the flag was announced during the contest as 2:3, however {{with the passage of}} a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>protocol</b> law in Kosovo in April 2009, the ratio was set as 1:1.4 (5:7 when put in whole numbers). The colors and construction of the Kosovo flag have not yet been defined; however, an official government document does give the colors of the flag using CMYK.

It retained the name through French rule and independence in 1960. The name had long since been translated literally into other languages, which the post-independence government considered to be increasingly troublesome whenever its international dealings extended beyond the Francophone sphere.

Instead, he took the time to sail on the French navy's Mediterranean flagship, the cruiser Colbert, so that he could arrive in Quebec City, the capital city of the province of Quebec. There, De Gaulle was cheered enthusiastically, while the new governor general, Roland Michener, was booed by the same crowd when [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] was played at his arrival.

2500|$|In 912 Leo VI {{died and}} was succeeded {{by his brother}} Alexander, who set about {{reversing}} many of LeoVI's policies and reinstated Nicholas Mystikos as patriarch. As the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>protocol</b> of the time prescribed, SimeonI sent emissaries to confirm the peace in late 912 or early 913. According to the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes Continuatus, SimeonI informed him that [...] "he would honour the peace if {{he was to be}} treated with kindness and respect, as it was under emperor Leo. However, Alexander, overwhelmed by madness and folly, ignominiously dismissed the envoys, made threats to Simeon and thought he would intimidate him. The peace was broken and Simeon decided to raise arms against the Christians [...]" [...] The Bulgarian ruler, who was seeking a casus belli to claim the imperial title, took the opportunity to wage war. Unlike his predecessors, SimeonI's ultimate ambition was to assume the throne of Constantinople as a Roman emperor, creating a joint Bulgarian–Roman state. The historian John Fine argues that the provocative policy of Alexander did little to influence SimeonI's decision, as he had already planned an invasion, having taken into account that on the Byzantine throne sat a man who was unpopular, inexperienced and possibly alcoholic and whose successor, Constantine VII, was a sickly little boy, {{considered by many to be}} illegitimate. While Bulgaria was preparing for war, on 6June 913 Alexander died, leaving Constantinople in chaos with an under-aged emperor under the regency of patriarch Mystikos.|$|E
