40|$|Objective: Whole-body {{vibration}} (WBV) is {{a potential}} therapy for age-related loss of musculoskeletal competence. Vibration has improved bone in animal models but human evidence is limited. Relative efficacy of low versus high intensity WBV is also unknown. Our goal was to observe the effect of brief low (LoWBV) and higher intensity WBV (HiWBV) on risk factors for hip fracture in postmenopausal women. Design: We utilized an 8 -month randomized controlled trial design to examine the influence of twice-weekly LoWBV (15 mins, 30 Hz, 0. 3 g) or HiWBV (2 x 3 mins, 12. 5 Hz, 1 g) on anthropometrics, bone (whole body, hip, spine, forearm, <b>heel),</b> <b>muscle</b> (wall squat, chair rise), and balance (tandem walk, single leg stance). Physical activity, daily calcium and compliance were recorded. Effects were examined by repeated measures ANCOVA, controlling for age, height, weight, calcium, physical activity, compliance, and baseline values. Results: 47 women (71. 5 ? 9. 0 years) completed the trial. There were no between-group differences in any measure at 8 months, but within-group effects were evident. Controls lost bone at the trochanter (- 6 %, p= 0. 03) and lumbar spine (- 6. 6 %, p= 0. 02) while WBV groups did not. WBV subjects improved wall squat (up to 120 %, p= 0. 004) and chair rise performance (up to 10. 5 %, p= 0. 05). Conclusions: 8 months of twice-weekly WBV may reduce bone loss at the hip and spine and improve lower extremity muscle function. These changes may translate to a decreased risk of falls and hip fracture. Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|During gait phases, {{the point}} of initial contact (IC) between the foot and the floor is {{positioned}} outward {{with respect to the}} load line. Since typical heeled shoes are designed with the heel in the middle, the foot and the heel positions differ in {{the point of}} contact.

OBJETIVO: Estudar a influência da altura do salto do sapato na drenagem venosa dos membros inferiores, utilizando-se a pletismografia a ar (PGA). MÉTODO: Quinze mulheres, com idade média de 24, 6 anos, assintomáticas, utilizando calçados de tamanhos apropriados, foram examinadas em três momentos: descalças (0 cm), salto médio (3, 5 cm) e alto (7 cm). Apresentavam índice de massa corporal BACKGROUND: The {{influence of}} shoe heel height on venous function {{is still a}} controversial subject in the international literature. The importance of ergonomics for {{quality of life is}} a universally accepted factor, and situations that impair it, such as prolonged permanence in the supine position, shoe quality and workplace conditions may interfere with the individual"s health. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the influence of shoe heel height on lower limb venous drainage using air plethysmography. METHOD: Fifteen asymptomatic women with mean age of 24. 6 years, wearing shoes of appropriate size were examined in three different situations: barefoot (0 cm), medium heels (3. 5 cm) and high heels (7 cm). Body mass index was < 25 and the subjects were classified according to the CEAP International Classification based on clinical (C 0 or C 1), etiologic (Ep), anatomic (As) and physiopathological (Pr) criteria. The values of venous filling index (VFI), ejection fraction (EF) and residual volume fraction (RVF) were divided into three categories according to heel height and compared to one another by repeated means analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: EF was decreased and RVF was increased in the high heel group compared to the barefoot group (p < 0. 005). These parameters did not differ between the medium heel group and the other groups. VFI showed a similar behavior in the three situations evaluated. CONCLUSION: High <b>heels</b> reduce <b>muscle</b> pump function, as demonstrated by the fall in EF and increase in RVF, and their continued use may provoke venous hypertension in the lower limbs, possibly representing a predictive factor of venous disease symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis affects {{more than}} 27 million Americans and cost nearly $ 5700 per person annually. [1], [2] It {{commonly}} affects the knee joint {{and has been}} linked to work involving prolonged knee bending. [3], [4] In restricted vertical working heights such as low-seam coal mines and aircraft baggage compartments, workers are forced to assume stooped, kneeling, or squatting postures to perform work. In order to protect the knees in these postures, we must have an understanding of what the internal knee structures experience under these conditions. A finite element model is being developed to quantify the stresses and strains in the tissues in static kneeling postures. The accuracy of any finite element model is heavily dependent on the input parameters (i. e. forces and moments). Therefore, the objective of this work was to develop a 3 -D computational model which may be used to determine the net forces and moments applied to the knee joint during static kneeling. The developed model uses inverse dynamics to determine the net forces, net moments, and joint angles for subjects while kneeling near full flexion, kneeling on one knee, kneeling near 90 ° flexion, and squatting. Motion data, ground reaction forces, and pressures between the thigh and calf and <b>heel</b> and gluteal <b>muscles</b> were inputs into this model. Additionally the thigh-calf contact force, which was shown to be significant [5], and the heel-gluteus contact force, which had not been previously investigated, were inputs in this model. Data from two subjects were analyzed with and without the subject wearing kneepads. Kneeling near full flexion and squatting created sagittal joint moments 3 to 5 times larger than standing in one subject. Moments of this magnitude may be significant to cause cartilage damage. It was also found that the moments caused by the thigh-calf and heel-gluteus contacts act to extend the knee, thereby reducing knee moments in fully flexed postures...|$|R
40|$|Although {{walking is}} a {{constrained}} movement, there is {{variation in the}} muscle recruitment patterns. The processed wavelet-based electromyogram (EMG) [von Tscharner (2000) ] signals indicated that the task structure contained in walking doesn’t prescribe one single muscle activation strategy, and that multiple configurations of muscle activation can result in functionally equivalent postural control. By applying a principal component analysis approach, the intra-muscular analysis of EMG signals of healthy females while walking has shown that any activation pattern {{is a combination of}} (i) the group activation pattern used by all individuals, (ii) two common strategies – either a pre impact muscle activation or a post heel strike reaction – showing the subject-specific deviations and (iii) an unresolved, more random activation pattern. Suggestions that individuals have a constrained flexibility in how they balance their pre and post <b>heel</b> strike <b>muscle</b> activation. Especially at heel strike, where the human locomotor system is affected by irregular impact forces, controlled muscle activation strategies are essential for counteracting the destabilising forces and thus for keeping the joint stable [Hurley (1999) ]. The precisely timed co-activation of Mm. quadriceps femoris and M. semitendinosus is important for a mobile, but stable knee joint. A balanced activation of Mm. vastus medialis and vastus lateralis is furthermore required to control the translation of the patella [Mellor and Hodges (2005) ], and to maintain the dynamic stability of the patellofemoral joint. In addition to a high intra-muscular coordination found while walking, a significant inter-muscular interplay between muscles of the same muscle group and between muscles either located on the medial or on the lateral side of the knee has been found. Such an interaction showed that, in addition, to the within-muscle and within-muscle group controlling, there is a mechanism regulating the knee rotation and the fine tuning of muscles in order to control subtle changes in the interplay of structures surrounding the knee joint due to destabilising forces to gain a stable knee joint. The mechanism underlying neural control is complex, wherein typical temporal characteristics, such as rhythm at about 40 ms within the EMG signal or triggering to heel strike of peak activations while walking were structures occurring independent of the subject, muscle, task and condition. In {{view of the fact that}} individuals share these features, there seems to be good reasons that temporal features play an integral role within the neuromuscular control mechanism. Furthermore, the comparison between the EMG frequency spectra of sprint- and endurance trained athletes indicate that the EMG frequency spectra change systematically with training; thus the EMG signals mirror the functional state of a muscle as a component of the state of the individual and allow monitoring of training-related changes in muscles. The results of this thesis may be suggest that rhythm, synchronicity and neuromuscular activation strategies are brain-related features, which are quantifiable by combining waveletbased EMG signals with pattern recognition approaches. This approach provides a deeper insight into the muscular behaviour and the role of the neuromuscular control mechanisms in motor output, in general and between individuals. Further, it has increased the knowledge about the functional state of muscles that stabilise the knee joint. The various combinations in interactions of activation patterns of the thigh muscles surrounding the knee joint may be key functions to securing a stable knee joint before the occurrence of stressful events and may be a neuromuscular component of dynamic joint stability adapted to the subject-specific circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Meat and {{processed}} meats, {{depending on the}} animal species and anatomical element from which they were obtained, exhibit a varied fat content (most typically from 10 % to 80 % dry matter). Fats are relatively unstable food components. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of an addition of model brines on lipid oxidation rate in the selected beef element stored under aerobic conditions and in vacuum at a temperature of 5 &deg;C. Material and methods. Material for analyses comprised beef: rump cut (R) and the heel of round (L). Meat was cured (at 20 % in relation to raw material weight) with brine A, containing 1 % NaCl in total weight and brine B, containing 1 % NaCl and 0. 3 % sodium tripolyphosphate E 451 i (including 56 % P 2 O 5). Meat after being massaged was stored under aerobic conditions (T) and in vacuum (P) at a temperature of 5 &deg;C for 15 days. During storage of samples changes were determined in peroxide value (PV), contents of secondary fat decomposition products using the TBARS test as well as changes in pH value. Results. &nbsp; It was observed that with an extension of sample storage time peroxide value was growing gradually, but the dynamics of this growth varied. Samples coming from the rump cut muscle, stored in the atmosphere with unlimited access of oxygen, were characterised by slightly, but statistically significantly higher peroxide values in comparison to the other tested samples. The highest increase in the TBARS test value was observed in samples stored under aerobic conditions and coming from the <b>heel</b> of round <b>muscle,</b> irrespective of the type of applied brine. Conducted analyses showed that vacuum packaging of meat, in comparison to the storage of samples at unlimited access of oxygen, effectively slowed down the increase in the content of secondary oxidation products determined by the TBARS test. The greatest effect of vacuum packaging was observed for the heel of round in brine A. Conclusions. Vacuum packaging, in comparison to storage of experimental samples under aerobic conditions, delayed the increase in peroxide value and effectively slowed down the increase in contents of secondary lipid oxidation products. Statistically significant changes in pH values were observed in the heel of round, irrespective of the type of applied brine, stored under aerobic conditions...|$|R
