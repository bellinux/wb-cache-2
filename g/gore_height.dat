Four subjects, with breast and body types representative of Chinese females of age 24 - 40 years were studied while they performed activities either braless or wearing one of seven different sports bras representative of the range commercially available. The three-dimensional movement of the breasts was derived by videoing the motion of breast markers attached at six different breast positions using a Vicon 3 D motion analysis system. The breast displacement relative to the thorax was measured using a validated local "thorax-breast 3 D coordinate system". The results showed {{that there was a}} significant difference in breast displacement between the different breast markers. The bra samples generally achieved the greatest reduction in breast displacement in the medial-lateral direction. The reduction in breast displacement was positively related to the <b>gore</b> <b>height,</b> shoulder strap width, neckline height and side seam depth. The underlying mechanism of breast movement and bra support is also discussed. The study concluded that the most effective bras had the following features: compression type, short vest style, high neckline, slings, cross back, bound neckline, no centre gore, no wire, no cradle, no pad and a non-adjustable wide strap. This provides practical guidelines for bra designers and manufacturers to develop more supportive bras for women performing these physical activities. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
