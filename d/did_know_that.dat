25|$|While {{they may}} not have {{recognized}} the collusion of the C and N, Page and Rogers <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the larger railroads would surely attempt to block any effort to extend the Deepwater a great distance to reach any other major trunk lines, many of which such as the New York Central, Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad were also under common control of sorts (although it is not known if Page and Rogers realized or even suspected this). However, to their advantage, the Deepwater Railway charter already granted by West Virginia came to a location within a fairly short distance of the Virginia state line.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{reviving}} the rallying program, one of Hayes first accomplishments was to sign relatively unknown Scottish racing driver Jackie Stewart. Stewart was attending the 1964 British International Motor Show at Earl's Court, London, when Hayes approached him and later offered Stewart £500 to promote Ford products in 1965, {{along with the}} white Ford Zodiac that was the centrepiece of Ford's exhibit to drive that year. Stewart later commented: “I didn’t know who Walter Hayes was, but I <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> to have a contract with Ford Motor Company {{was a big deal}} with great opportunities for the future, even though I wasn’t yet aware that Ford would enter Formula One.” The relationship was to last forty years, and be so successful it was the model for other Formula One stars and motor manufacturers.|$|E

Documentary director D. A. Pennebaker, who filmed Dylan on his acoustic UK tour in May 1965, has said: [...] "I didn't know {{that he was going to}} leave acoustic.

[...] In some instances, the police responded that [...] "You can't arrest someone because you believe she is going to kill Andy Warhol," [...] and even asked Feiden [...] "Listen lady, how would you know what a real gun looked like?" [...] In a 2009 interview with James Barron of The New York Times, Feiden said that she <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Solanas intended to kill Warhol, but could not prevent it.

[...] A single TNT plant that Nichols had {{recently}} built in Pennsylvania had cost $128million. Nor were they impressed with estimates to the nearest order of magnitude, which Groves compared with telling a caterer to prepare for between ten and a thousand guests. A survey team from Stone & Webster had already scouted a site for the production plants. The War Production Board recommended sites around Knoxville, Tennessee, an isolated area where the Tennessee Valley Authority could supply ample electric power and the rivers could provide cooling water for the reactors. After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near Elza, Tennessee. Conant advised that it be acquired at once and Styer agreed but Marshall temporized, awaiting the results of Conant's reactor experiments before taking action. Of the prospective processes, only Lawrence's electromagnetic separation appeared sufficiently advanced for construction to commence.|$|E
500|$|McIlrath {{wrote the}} video treatment, and remarked how the band at first {{had no idea}} {{what they wanted to do}} for the video due to the song's unique sound. McIlrath <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> since [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] has simple lyrics, he wanted the video to {{replicate}} the song's easygoing feel. The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only a few months after the song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts. Looking back on the video, McIlrath said: [...] "Parts of it are kind of cheesy...but it captured where I was at when that song was written - it was written when I was living in a house with four roommates in a bedroom and we were all just trying to figure out what to do with our lives." ...|$|E

500|$|The Soviets {{never did}} get the {{detailed}} data required to redesign the ship's barbettes and magazines, but they <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the 380-mm barbettes was bigger in diameter {{than that of the}} 305mm turret as well as taller than the Russian turrets. So the barbette of turret number two had to be raised to clear turret number one and the height of the conning tower had to be raised to clear turret number two. Similarly the [...] anti-aircraft guns behind turret number three had to be raised as well. The new turrets required more electrical power which meant that the output of the turbo generators had to be increased to 1,300 kilowatts. All of these changes added over [...] to the ships' displacement and the sketch design was completed by 16 October 1940, as Project 69-I (Importnyi—Imported), even though they still lacked data for the turrets and their barbettes. This was presented to the State Defense Committee on 11 February 1941, but the design was not approved until 10 April when it ordered that the first two ships be completed with German guns while the others would continue to use the 305mm guns. The detailed design was supposed to be completed by 15 October 1941, but it was rendered pointless when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June.|$|E

Mitchell had auditioned in Albury in April, aged 16, and moved through the selection process to the final six before being eliminated in mid-October. In June 2009 Mitchell reflected on her time on Australian Idol: [...] "I was uncomfortable with elements of the show and unhappy about the compromises sometimes.

[...] Dean Hargrove, executive producer of the Perry Mason television films, said in 2006, [...] "I had always assumed that Raymond was gay, because he had a relationship with Robert Benevides for a very long time. Whether or not he had relationships with women, I had no idea. I <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I had trouble keeping track of whether he was married or not in these stories.

2500|$|Sigmund Freud {{used the}} name [...] "the Oedipus complex" [...] {{to explain the}} origin of certain neuroses in childhood. It {{is defined as a}} male child's {{unconscious}} desire for the exclusive love of his mother. This desire includes jealousy towards the father and the unconscious wish for that parent's death, as well as the unconscious desire for sexual intercourse with the mother. Oedipus himself, as portrayed in the myth, did not suffer from this neurosis – at least, not towards Jocasta, whom he only met as an adult (if anything, such feelings would have been directed at Merope – but there is no hint of that). Freud reasoned that the ancient Greek audience, which heard the story told or saw the plays based on it, <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Oedipus was actually killing his father and marrying his mother; the story being continually told and played therefore reflected a preoccupation with the theme.|$|E

2500|$|Guiteau {{felt that}} God {{told him to}} kill the president; he felt that such an act would be a [...] "removal" [...] {{as opposed to an}} assassination. He felt that Garfield needed to be killed to rid the Republican Party of Blaine. Borrowing $15 from a Mr. Maynard, Guiteau went out to {{purchase}} a revolver. He knew little about firearms, but <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he would need a large caliber gun. He had to choose between a [...]442 Webley caliber British Bulldog revolver with wooden grips or one with ivory grips. He chose the one with the ivory handle because he wanted it to look good as a museum exhibit after the assassination. Though he could not afford the extra dollar, the store owner dropped the price for him. He spent the next few weeks in target practice – the recoil from the revolver almost knocked him over the first time – and stalking Garfield. The revolver was recovered after the assassination, and even photographed by the Smithsonian in the early 20th century, but it has since been lost.|$|E
2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from the person you love and {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation all of us can relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I {{was trying to figure out}} the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy." [...] She said she [...] "thinks" [...] that 'What About Us' part means [...] "me and you getting together". She did point out that she <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the song was about [...] "making you happy" [...] and that the track was good for the summer and will get you on the dancefloor. Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's going to be a lot more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much. [...] "It's a fresh start for a new album as it's got that slight reggae vibe, but is still a dance pop record." ...|$|E
