5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy. Although he derided Marxists who adopted <b>ideas</b> <b>from</b> contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists, his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider <b>ideas</b> <b>from</b> the Russian revolutionary movement, {{including those of the}} Narodnik agrarian-socialists. He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.|$|E
5|$|English cuisine {{encompasses}} the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England.

5|$|The <b>Ideas</b> <b>from</b> the Deep {{team could}} not afford to leave their jobs to work on the game full-time, so they {{continued}} to work at Softdisk, spending their time on the Gamer's Edge games during the day and on Commander Keen at night and weekends using Softdisk computers. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist Adrian Carmack from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon removed from the group. <b>Ideas</b> <b>from</b> the Deep spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on Commander Keen, with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks.|$|E
5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god.

5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many <b>ideas</b> <b>from</b> his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower to feel like one.|$|E

5|$|Ilaiyaraaja {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string arrangements in Indian film music. This allowed him to craft a rich tapestry of sounds for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences. The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja's methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of <b>ideas</b> <b>from</b> a diversity of musical styles.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his mythopoeic compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.

Since the late 1970s, accounting professors have opined that the journal was sacrificing relevance for mathematical rigor, and by 1982, accounting researchers realized that mathematical analysis and empirical research were {{a necessary condition for}} articles to be accepted.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund {{appointed}} a Calvinist bishop {{as the only}} religious leader of the Romanians in his realm in November 1566.

Influenced by Dávid and Biandrata, John Sigismund became receptive to Anti-Trinitarian <b>ideas</b> <b>from</b> early 1567. With John Sigismund's support, Dávid published five books to promote his views, reproving for idolatry those who accepted the dogma of the Trinity.|$|E
