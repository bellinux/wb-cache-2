5|$|Al-Ma'mun {{chose to}} remain in Khurasan, however, rather than coming to the capital. This allowed the power vacuum which the civil war had fostered in the Caliphate's provinces to grow, and several local rulers sprang up in Jazira, Syria and Egypt. In addition, the pro-Khurasani {{policies}} followed by al-Ma'mun's powerful chief minister, al-Fadl ibn Sahl, and al-Ma'mun's espousal of an Alid succession {{in the person of}} Ali al-Ridha, alienated the traditional Baghdad élites, who saw themselves increasingly marginalized. Consequently, al-Ma'mun's uncle Ibrahim was proclaimed rival Caliph at Baghdad in 817, forcing al-Ma'mun to intervene personally. Fadl ibn Sahl was assassinated and al-Ma'mun left Khurasan for Baghdad, which he entered in 819. The next years saw the consolidation of al-Ma'mun's authority and the re-incorporation of the western provinces against local rebels, a process not completed until the pacification of Egypt in 827. Some local rebellions, however, notably that of the Khurramites, dragged on <b>for</b> <b>far</b> longer into the 830s.|$|E
5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision <b>for</b> <b>Far</b> Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial began}} in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley {{conducted}} his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies <b>for</b> <b>far</b> less than the prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument {{was that he was}} the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.|$|E

40|$|Co) Variance {{components}} and genetic parameters for economic traits in Iranian native fowls were estimated using multivariate animal model analysis with DFREML procedure. The data of four stations of native fowls breeding (Mazandaran: 49536, Esfahan: 23108, West Azarbaijan: 24890 and Fars: 30279) was containing records of {{cocks and hens}} collected during period of 1988 to 2006. The recorded traits were Body weight (at 8 weeks or 12 weeks), Age at first egg, egg number at 12 first weeks of production and mean egg weight between 28 to 32 weeks. The most estimated heritabilites, except egg number, were more than 0. 20. The highest heritabilites for all traits were related to Fars station, whereas most heritabilites in West Azarbaijan were less than other stations. The heritability for egg number was estimated 0. 099 ± 0. 018 for Esfahan to 0. 322 ± 0. 012 <b>for</b> <b>Fars.</b> The estimated heritabilities of body weight were medium to high and varied from 0. 228 ± 0. 014 for Esfahan to 0. 548 ± 0. 014 <b>for</b> <b>Fars,</b> While, the heritabilities of mean egg weight were high and ranged from 0. 223 ± 0. 021 for West Azarbaijan to 0. 638 ± 0. 013 <b>for</b> <b>Fars.</b> The heritability <b>for</b> age at first egg was estimated 0. 270 ± 0. 021 for Esfahan to 0. 520 ± 0. 014 <b>for</b> <b>Fars.</b> The most estimated genetic correlations, except between Body weight and Egg weight and between age at first egg and egg weight, were negative.
