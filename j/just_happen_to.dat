5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines of criticism. He {{pointed out that}} Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E

Cheerful reunions ensue with the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion, and new introductions are made to Ozma and the Hungry Tiger, a massive tiger who desires to eat fat babies, but is prevented from doing so by his conscience.|$|E
500|$|David McIntee, {{author of}} Beautiful Monsters: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to the Alien and Predator Films, asserts {{that part of}} the film's {{effectiveness}} in frightening viewers [...] "comes {{from the fact that the}} audience can all identify with the characters...Everyone aboard the Nostromo is a normal, everyday, working Joe just like the rest of us.

500|$|In {{his review}} for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Some films deal in plot truth; this one expresses {{emotional}} truth, the heart's search for saving wisdom, {{in some of}} the most luscious imagery since Malick's last film, the 1978 Days of Heaven". Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film four out of four stars. Writing in the Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan wrote, [...] "The Thin Red Line is a movie about creation growing out of destruction, about love where you'd least expect to find it and about angels – especially the fallen kind – who <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> be men".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{living in}} the countryside, Persona 4 {{characters}} were designed to look and sound [...] "normal" [...] and like [...] "modern high-schoolers", according to lead editor Nich Maragos. Initially, he wrote the game's cast as being [...] "more rural than was really called for". [...] "The characters aren't really ... They <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> {{live in a place}} that's not a major metropolitan area." [...] While interviewing members of Persona 4s development team, 1UP.com editor Andrew Fitch noted that the characters from the city — Yosuke and the protagonist — have [...] "more stylish" [...] hair than the other characters. Art director Shigenori Soejima used hair styles to differentiate between characters from the city versus the country. [...] "With Yosuke in particular, I gave him accessories, such as headphones and a bicycle, to make it more obvious that he was from the city." ...|$|E
500|$|Alex {{has been}} {{depicted}} {{as someone who}} is not afraid of expressing her sexuality, and as a flawed human being who takes charge of her own life. Chopra told Cosmopolitan: [...] "It's empowering in that way, which doesn't say that sexual freedom is what empowerment needs to necessarily be. It's extremely individual to each one of us. As for Alex, she happens to not care." [...] The character treats men as dispensable entities, similar to how men usually treat women. She does not treat men as if they are {{the most important thing in}} her life because she is more focused on her work, with men <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> come and go in her life. Chopra explained [...] "I think that's extremely empowering on her end. It may not be something I personally agree with or something I do, but I think different people have different individual choices that they make." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{and after}} the final debate, McCain {{compared}} Obama's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked [...] "Joe the Plumber" [...] {{as a symbol of}} American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency. McCain barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama, but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers. [...] McCain's rallies became increasingly vitriolic, with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African-American sentiment. After one female McCain supporter said she did not trust Obama because [...] "he's an Arab", McCain pointedly replied to the woman, [...] "No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> have disagreements with on fundamental issues." [...] McCain's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics. [...] Down the stretch, McCain was outspent by Obama by a four-to-one margin.|$|E
500|$|Boam and Cuse did {{not intend}} for the series to be {{historically}} accurate. Their aim was to create an action-adventure with a modern feel. Cuse told USA Today, [...] "We're not approaching this show {{as if we were}} doing a period piece. We see it as a contemporary program. Our characters <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The Indiana Jones movies were period pieces too, but you never thought of them that way." [...] Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, [...] "In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn't even once have to shoot his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering." [...] Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell [...] "isn't the next big television star, I'll eat my desk".|$|E

We're not like your average Christian band." [...] He explains that Christianity is the [...] "backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it's not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It's not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It's just normal life struggles." [...] Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for [...] "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, [...] "I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> be a Christian band that has different beliefs." [...] However, in an interview with Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that [...] "I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'" ...|$|E
