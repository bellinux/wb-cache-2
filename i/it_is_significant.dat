5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> {{that the}} only {{musician}} with whom he remained a close personal friend, Ignaz Moscheles, was of an older generation and equally conservative in outlook. Moscheles preserved this outlook at the Leipzig Conservatory until his own death in 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect is}} very small but {{measurable}} on Earth using the Mössbauer effect and was first observed in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> near a black hole, and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (see Sachs-Wolfe effect).|$|E
5|$|For a {{property}} {{to be eligible}} for the National Register, it must meet {{at least one of the}} four National Register main criteria. Information about architectural styles, association with various aspects of social history and commerce, and ownership are all integral parts of the nomination. Each nomination contains a narrative section that provides a detailed physical description of the property and justifies why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> historically with regard either to local, state, or national history. The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following.|$|E
60|$|Dampier paused, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> that {{he turned}} to Agatha with a deprecatory gesture.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> of her {{influence}} over {{him that he}} answered her calmly, although a storm of angry thoughts were struggling for expression within him.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} murmur of astonishment which, had the men been different, {{would not have been}} quite free from consternation, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> news.|$|R
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which {{makes it difficult for}} the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} a sacramental rather than {{educational}} purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel {{would have been}} left on the high altar {{of the church and}} removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> that the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.|$|E
5|$|The {{lease on}} Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was {{extended}} {{on an annual}} basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on other days. Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in the quarry gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway {{as long as he}} was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom. Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the Aberllefenni Slate Quarry purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway. On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{realities of the}} {{depression}} that ran from late 1873 into 1879, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> misjudgments on Gowen's part {{that led to the}} Reading Railroad's collapse in 1880.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{offering}} five to one he goes up. Any takers?" [...] {{said the}} first speaker; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> that, although most Westerners are keen at a bet, nobody offered.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 July: Newsday quotes Novak {{regarding}} {{his use of}} Plame's name: [...] "I didn't dig <b>it</b> out. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> given to me. They thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant.</b> They gave me the name, and I used it." ...|$|R
5|$|Manuscripts 1eap and 1rK Erasmus {{borrowed}} from Johannes Reuchlin. The {{rest of the}} manuscripts he {{borrowed from}} Dominicans. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> {{that he did not}} use the Codex Basilensis, which was held at the Basel University Library, and was available for him. Erasmus had three manuscripts of the Gospels and Acts, four manuscripts of the Pauline epistles, but only one manuscript with the Book of Revelation. In every book of the New Testament he compared three or four manuscripts, except the last book, Book of Revelation. Unfortunately, this manuscript was not complete, it lacked the final leaf, which contained the last six verses of the book. Instead of delaying the publication, on account of the search for another manuscript, he decided to translate the missing verses from the Latin Vulgate into Greek. He used an inferior manuscript of Vulgate with textual variant libro vitae (book of life) instead ligno vitae (tree of life) in Rev 22:19. Even {{in other parts of the}} Book of Revelation and other books of the New Testament Erasmus occasionally introduced self-created Greek text material taken from the Vulgate. F. H. A. Scrivener remarked, that in Rev 17:4 he created a new Greek word: ἀκαθαρτητος (instead τὰ ἀκάθαρτα). There is no such word in Greek language as ακαθαρτητος. In Rev 17:8 he used καιπερ εστιν (and yet is) instead of και παρεσται (and shall come). In Acts 9:6 the question that Paul asks at the time of his conversion on the Damascus road, Τρέμων τε καὶ θαμβὣν εἲπεν κύριε τί μέ θέλεις ποιῆσαι ("And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do?") was incorporated from the Vulgate.|$|E
25|$|Paleo{{magnetic}}s is {{the study}} of the planet's ancient magnetic field. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> to understanding magnetofossils, biomineralization, and global ecosystem changes.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{theoretical}} physics, the Casimir effect {{plays an}} important role in the chiral bag model of the nucleon; in applied physics, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> in some aspects of emerging microtechnologies and nanotechnologies.|$|E
60|$|Arnold {{sprang to}} his feet. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> that, {{after his first}} surprise, he spoke to Fenella with his head half turned towards his companion, and an {{encouraging}} smile upon his lips.|$|R
60|$|Dale's {{movements}} were quick and stern. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> that he chose his heavier rifle, and, mounting, {{with a sharp}} call to Pedro, he rode off without another word to the girls.|$|R
5000|$|The Foundation views {{this program}} {{as having the}} largest {{potential}} in terms of raising awareness. A national survey suggested that over 2/3rds of Canadians {{would be prepared to}} wear a pin recognizing Vimy Ridge Day. The same survey underlined that less than 1/3rd of Canadians recognized what Vimy Ridge <b>was</b> or that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant,</b> and of these a potentially large portion were not aware of the circumstances or why <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant.</b> The Foundation aims to have the pin recognized and worn by the majority of Canadians. The National Post newspaper dubbed the pin as [...] "April's Poppy".|$|R
25|$|Socially, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> that, {{initially}} {{built for}} the wealthy, Caves House became much more accessible over the years, especially after public motor transport became widely available, exemplifying the growth of social homogeneity in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Even without {{written record}} of his exploits, Bedle's {{reputation}} was known and shared by a public that was growing increasingly interested in cricket. As Bowen comments in his history, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> that he was remembered as {{the best player in}} England some forty years after his career ended.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} {{dead zone}} near {{the centre of}} the sea is also the focus of a mounting dispute between the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> for the global energy market because it may hold 25% or more of the world's undiscovered oil and gas resources.|$|E
50|$|Mad at the World is {{the first}} album from Christian rock band Mad at the World. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> for {{being one of the}} few Christian music albums to feature a synthpop sound.|$|R
50|$|On 2 April 1985, {{the church}} was {{registered}} by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place, with the registration number being 1855. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Mountfort's only surviving brick church.|$|R
50|$|In the succession, {{children}} of the empress were preferred over sons of secondary consorts. Thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> which quarters had preferential opportunities in providing chief wives to imperial princes, i.e. supplying future empresses.|$|R
25|$|Bedford School Chapel was {{completed}} in 1908 and is a Grade B listed building. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> as the last architectural accomplishment of George Frederick Bodley, a prominent Victorian architect {{who worked in the}} Gothic Revival style. Other notable buildings by Bodley include the chapels of Marlborough College and Queens' College, Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|Boniface {{was killed}} in an ambush by the Bulgarians on 4 September 1207, and his head was sent to Bulgarian Tsar Kaloyan. The loyal Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, who had {{followed}} him to the East, probably died with him: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> that he composed no planh (lament) in his memory.|$|E
25|$|Together with Guánica Light, Cardona Light is {{the western}} minor light which connects Cabo Rojo Light and Caja de Muertos Light and guides the {{entrance}} to a port that, during the course of last century, exported millions of pounds of sugar particularly to the United States. Architecturally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> that it is the only 6th order lighthouse with a cylindrical attached tower. Also, the original brick roof and firewood beams are practically intact.|$|E
60|$|Suspicion {{flashed on}} Grant; {{the man had}} led him {{to believe he was}} a {{stranger}} to the locality, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> that he should insist upon their stopping and harnessing the second team.|$|R
60|$|He {{followed}} her without a word. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> {{that his first}} impulse had been to shrink away from her as one dreading to receive a hurt. She seemed to notice it and smiled.|$|R
50|$|The Hindu Pantheon is {{illustrative of}} the Enlightenment concept of {{education}} of foreign cultures and religions; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> as <b>it</b> sought to dispel any European preconceptions that Hinduism was a largely primitive pagan religion.|$|R
25|$|In 1720, the Villasur {{expedition}} from Santa Fe met {{and attempted}} to parley with French- allied Pawnee {{in what is now}} Nebraska. Negotiations were unsuccessful, and a battle ensued; the Spanish were badly defeated, with only thirteen managing to return to New Mexico. Although this was a small engagement, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> in that it was the deepest penetration of the Spanish into the Great Plains, establishing the limit to Spanish expansion and influence there.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} ad-libbing (often {{laced with}} double entendre) of the presenters, including voice-over man John Blackman, soon attracted a cult following among {{younger and older}} viewers alike. The show's style was variously influenced by vaudeville, the American Tonight Show format, the Marx Brothers, The Goon Show and Monty Python. Somers was also strongly influenced by comedy duo Graham Kennedy and Bert Newton, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> that Carroll wrote for In Melbourne Tonight (IMT) for many years.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{criticism}} {{and the public}} response to it indicate a deepening level of dissent, not only within the kingdom's religious establishment, but also among the public. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> that the question was asked and answered in a public forum, and then reprinted in the media -- including the Arabic and English language newspapers. Similar questions of legitimacy will arise in coming months, with the kingdom's religious, political and perhaps military leaderships becoming the focal points for increasingly intense criticism.|$|E
60|$|The girl fancied {{that she}} {{understood}} him, but {{she wondered how}} far <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> that they should slide out into the flood of radiance together when he once more drove the light craft ahead.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> {{that nobody}} {{had asked the}} member of the Provincial Legislature to sit down, and he leaned {{on the arm of}} a big lounge as though he {{required}} support, and blinked at them.|$|R
5000|$|... "Thus, {{the black}} man, John Punch, became a slave unlike the two white indentured {{servants}} who merely had {{to serve a}} longer term. This was the first known case in Virginia involving slavery." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> documented.|$|R
