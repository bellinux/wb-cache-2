5|$|Winter knows from Yates that Irwin's {{ultimate}} goal is to raise the American flag upside down, a classic signal of distress. Irwin's men create havoc but ultimately are confronted by overwhelming numbers of guards, armed with live ammunition. Irwin orders the prisoners to stand down and elects to personally hoist the flag. After Winter's men, including Captain Peretz, disobey his orders and refuse to kill Irwin, Winter fatally shoots Irwin in the back as <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> flag.|$|E
5|$|Trevor {{eventually}} {{discovers that}} Michael set him and Brad up, and that Brad {{is not in}} jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> death vow but still hates Michael. Near {{the end of the}} game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit a friend that he hates, which Michael accepts. If the second option is chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death. If the first option is chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant. When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him. If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.|$|E
25|$|Śrīrāghavāvatārapratijñānam (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवावतारप्रतिज्ञानम्). Paraśurāma {{returns to}} the Mahendra {{mountain}} and contemplates on his past actions. He regrets his acts of rage and fury, and decides to perform penance to atone for the killings in his past. He starts meditating on the form of Rāma. With Sahasrārjuna killed and Paraśurāma putting down his weapons, Rāvaṇa's might is unchallenged and he terrorizes the whole earth – <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> Kailāsa mountain, torments the eight Diggajas, wins the kingdom of Indra and terrorizes everybody who performs Dharma. Unable to bear the menace of Rāvaṇa, Pṛthvī {{takes the form of}} a cow and goes weeping to the Sumeru mountain. Brahmā has a discussion with Pṛthvī and Śiva. Brahmā then goes to Sāketaloka to see Sītā and Rāma. He eulogizes Rāma in 31 verses (10.56–10.86), beseeching him to take an Avatāra to slay Rāvaṇa. Rāma assures him that he will be soon born as Rāma with his three Viṣṇu Aṃśas – the Viṣṇu in Kṣīrasāgara as Bharata, the Viṣṇu in Vaikuṇṭha as Lakṣmaṇa and Viṣṇu in Śvetadvīpa as Śatrughna. When Brahmā returns assured, Rāma requests Sītā to also take an Avatāra after his Avatāra. He then decides to be born as the son of Kausalyā in Ayodhyā.|$|E
60|$|The {{order was}} obeyed, and the ex-pirate stood swaying to and fro, and smiling with almost childlike delight. Presently <b>he</b> became solemn, <b>lifted</b> one leg, {{and set it}} down again with marvellous rapidity. Then <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> other leg with the same result. Then <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> staff, but had to replace it smartly to prevent falling forward.|$|R

500|$|For his {{portrayal}} of Rhys, Barber was included on the long list for the 2012 Most Popular New Talent Logie Award. Writers for TV Week branded Rhys a [...] "handsome doc" [...] and a [...] "selfish surgeon-to-be." [...] A writer for the Daily Record said Rhys was [...] "deserving of a slap" [...] for taking advantage of Karl's mistake with a prescription. The writer also called Rhys a [...] "chancer." [...] When Rhys tries to impress Martin, television critic Dianne Butler quipped [...] "And I see John Wood's in the show. He's a golf-playing doctor [...] whose leg is being humped by Rhys Lawson tonight. Rhys puts on a barbecue to try to oil his way into a surgical-training program, only there's a rat under the plate when <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> lid {{to put on the}} snapper. Vintage Neighbours." [...] Larissa Dubecki of The Sydney Morning Herald thought Rhys was [...] "dastardly", while the Herald Sun's Cameron Adams called him [...] "creepy" [...] for cyber stalking Erin. Adams later wrote [...] "dodgy doctor" [...] Rhys was threatening Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) status as the Erinsborough bad boy.|$|E
2500|$|When Basilio {{starts to}} gossip about Cherubino's obvious {{attraction}} to the Countess, the Count angrily leaps from his hiding place (terzetto: [...] – [...] "What do I hear!"). He disparages the [...] "absent" [...] page's incessant flirting and describes how he caught him with Barbarina under the kitchen table. As <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> dress from the chair to illustrate how he lifted the tablecloth to expose Cherubino, he finds ... the self same Cherubino! The count is furious, but is reminded that the page overheard the Count's advances on Susanna, something that the Count wants to keep from the Countess. The young man is ultimately saved from punishment by {{the entrance of the}} peasants of the Count's estate, a preemptive attempt by Figaro to commit the Count to a formal gesture symbolizing his promise that Susanna would enter into the marriage unsullied. The Count evades Figaro's plan by postponing the gesture. The Count says that he forgives Cherubino, but he dispatches him to his own regiment in Seville for army duty, effective immediately. Figaro gives Cherubino mocking advice about his new, harsh, military life from which all luxury, and especially women, will be totally excluded (aria: Non più andrai – [...] "No more [...] ").|$|E

6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "Well, now then, pull hard!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> {{window with}} a great effort; the polonaise comes free with a start, and she strikes violently against him.

6000|$|... "Yes, the ally!" [...] {{repeated}} Holmes, pensively.

6000|$|These {{and other}} reflections, while they crowded in {{whirlwind}} rapidity on his mind, wrought no alteration in the deadly purpose which they suspended. His delay in lighting the torch was the unconscious delay of the suicide, secure in his resolution ere <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> poison to his lips--when life rises before {{him as a}} thing that is past, and he stands for one tremendous moment in the dark gap between {{the present and the}} future--no more the pilgrim of Time--not yet the inheritor of Eternity! ...|$|E

60|$|Fanny, {{with the}} tea-tray, {{comes and goes}} without the Colonel's being aware of her presence. He merely knows that he has waved someone away. The {{fact is that the}} Colonel is engrossed in a rather undignified pursuit. He is {{listening}} avidly at the nursery door, and is thus discovered by another member of his family who has entered cautiously. This is Master Cosmo, who, observing the tea-tray, has the happy notion of interposing it between himself and his father's possible osculatory intentions. <b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> tray, and thus armed introduces himself.|$|E
