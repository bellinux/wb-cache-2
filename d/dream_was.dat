5|$|The <b>Dream</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} to mostly positive reception. While the <b>Dream</b> <b>was</b> praised for its solid and robust hardware design, {{the introduction of}} the Android operating system was met with criticism for its lack of certain functionality and third-party software in comparison to more established platforms, but was still considered to be innovative due to its open nature, notifications system, and heavy integration with Google's services.|$|E

40|$|Dreams {{and their}} {{meanings}} have challenged man {{for thousands of}} years. Numerous theories of dreams have had their day {{in the sun and}} then died. Among contemporary writers, certain assumptions seem to dominate. The major assumption <b>is</b> that <b>dreams</b> have some meaning. Stemming from this major premise, other assumptions or hypotheses have <b>been</b> advanced. 1. <b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> wish fulfillment. Alternatively, following Freud, <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> the guardian of sleep. 2. <b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> an attempt at problem solving. This has been particularly elaborated by French. 3. <b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> a manifestation of certain psychological processes of which the dreamer is totally unaware; that <b>is,</b> <b>dreams</b> spring from the unconscious. 4. The content of <b>dreams</b> <b>is</b> continuous with the content of the individual’s waking ideation and behavior (Adler). Or the opposite view has been advanced, namely that the content of the <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> reciprocal to the waking behavior...|$|R

In 2009, after performing to an enthusiastic crowd in Bolivia, A.B. decided to continue recording music.|$|E

Released on the HBO channel, it garnered 1.8 {{million viewers}} {{for the initial}} broadcast, becoming the largest audience for a documentary since Nielsen Media Research revised its method of measuring viewership in 2004. However, critical commentary towards Life Is But a <b>Dream</b> <b>was</b> mixed with divided opinions by critics.|$|E
5|$|Our dream {{began in}} the hearts of the {{students}} at Martin Luther King, Jr., Elementary School nearly ten years ago.

2500|$|Lucid <b>dreaming</b> <b>is</b> the {{conscious}} perception of one's state while dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have {{some degree of}} {{control over their own}} actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream. <b>Dream</b> control has <b>been</b> reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to control aspects of the <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> not necessary for a dream to qualify as [...] "lucid" [...] — a lucid <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> any <b>dream</b> during which the dreamer knows they <b>are</b> <b>dreaming.</b> The occurrence of lucid <b>dreaming</b> has <b>been</b> scientifically verified.|$|R
25|$|A <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> a {{succession}} of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. The content and purpose of <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> not fully understood, though they have been a topic of scientific speculation, {{as well as a}} subject of philosophical and religious interest, throughout recorded history. <b>Dream</b> interpretation <b>is</b> the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for an underlying message. The scientific study of <b>dreams</b> <b>is</b> called oneirology.|$|R
5000|$|Thoughts on <b>Dreaming</b> <b>was</b> a {{response}} to Andrew Baxter's Enquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul (1733), in which Branch refuted Baxter's argument that <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> the work of supernatural agents.|$|R
5|$|Pipe <b>Dream</b> <b>was</b> {{nominated}} for nine Tony Awards; it lost for best musical {{to the only}} other nominee, Damn Yankees. Alvin Colt was the sole winner, for Best Costume Design. Johnson {{died of a heart}} attack within a year of Pipe Dreams closing; Tyler died in an automobile accident during the same timespan. These tragedies convinced Traubel that there was a curse attached to Pipe Dream, and she began carrying good-luck charms when she performed.|$|E
5|$|Several {{aspects of}} Aronofsky's films have been controversial, most notably Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, and Black Swan. Requiem for a <b>Dream</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} set for release in 2000, but it met with {{controversy in the}} United States, being rated NC-17 by the MPAA due to a graphic sex scene. Aronofsky appealed the rating, claiming that cutting any portion of the film would dilute its message. The appeal was denied and the film's distributor Artisan Entertainment decided to release the film unrated.|$|E

The Orb also brought in jazz and house music singer Juliet Roberts and guitarist Steve Hillage.|$|E
50|$|Enkidu's {{interpretation}} is missing here, {{but as with}} the other <b>dreams,</b> it <b>is</b> assumed he puts a positive spin on the volcanic dream.

50|$|There {{were two}} types of dreams {{associated}} with medicine: prophetic and diagnostic. Prophetic <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> divine in origin and foretold good or bad tidings for the future. Diagnostic <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> {{a result of the}} soul telling what afflicted the body. If the <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> of normal everyday events, their body was healthy and in equilibrium. The farther from the norm, and the more chaotic the <b>dreams</b> <b>were,</b> the more ill the patient was. The treatments that were recommended addressed what the dreams showed, and attempted to set the body right through consumption of food that carried the correct humor characteristics.|$|R

5|$|Aronofsky's followup, the {{psychological}} drama Requiem for a <b>Dream,</b> <b>was</b> {{based on the}} novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. The film garnered strong reviews and received an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn's performance. The film also generated considerable controversy due to the graphic nature of several scenes, and was eventually released unrated. After writing the World War II horror film Below, Aronofsky began production on his third film, the romantic fantasy sci-fi drama The Fountain. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box-office, but has since garnered a cult following.|$|E
5|$|Between 1972 and 1975, {{what is now}} the B {{store in}} Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine <b>Dream</b> <b>was</b> the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975.

5000|$|The novel {{contains}} {{descriptions of}} at least twenty <b>dreams</b> that <b>are</b> recalled by Harriet, Monty, Blaise and Harriet's son David. These <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> disturbing and frightening, combining [...] "some mixture of horror or terror, grief and fascinated pity". The subject of <b>dreams</b> <b>is</b> also relevant to Blaise's work as a psychoanalyst.|$|R
6000|$|As a rule such <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> only {{mentioned}} {{after the}} event, {{and so are}} not worth noticing. Very often the <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> forgotten by the dreamer till he hears of or sees the event. He is then either reminded of his dream by association of ideas or he has never dreamed at all, and his belief that he has <b>dreamed</b> <b>is</b> only a form of false memory, of the common sensation of [...] "having been here before," [...] which he attributes to an awakened memory of a real dream. Still more often the <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> unconsciously cooked by the narrator into harmony with facts.|$|R

5|$|Pipe Dream is {{the seventh}} musical {{by the team}} of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II; it premiered on Broadway on November 30, 1955. The work is based on John Steinbeck's short novel Sweet Thursday—Steinbeck wrote the novel, a sequel to Cannery Row, {{in the hope of}} having it adapted into a musical. Set in Monterey, California, the musical {{tells the story of the}} romance between Doc, a marine biologist, and Suzy, who in the novel is a prostitute; her {{profession}} is only alluded to in the stage work. Pipe <b>Dream</b> <b>was</b> a flop and a financial disaster for Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E

5|$|Tucker: The Man and His <b>Dream</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in the United States on August 12, 1988, earning $3,709,562 in its opening weekend in 720 theaters. The film eventually grossed $19.65 million in US totals and was declared a box office bomb {{because it did not}} reimburse its $24 million production budget, despite positive reviews. Pocket Books published a novelization written by Robert Tine to coincide with the release of the film. Paramount Home Video released Tucker: The Man and His Dream on DVD in October 2000, which included audio commentary by Coppola, the 1948 promotional film Tucker: The Man and the Car (with optional commentary by Coppola), as well as a making-of featurette, Under the Hood: Making Tucker.|$|E
5|$|Amid this {{environment}} of intense internal pressure {{for the band}} to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record {{so far away from}} their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for Siamese <b>Dream</b> <b>was</b> quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened {{to the point where he}} contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $250,000.|$|E
5|$|Armin {{was once}} a troubled young man from Capital City, and finds himself in the Army. There, he met and befriended the real Sergeant Seymour Skinner, who became his mentor and helped him find meaning in his troubled life. Seymour told Armin that his <b>dream</b> <b>was</b> to become an {{elementary}} school principal after the war. Later, Seymour was declared missing and presumed dead. Armin took {{the news of the}} apparent death to Seymour's mother, Agnes. Upon meeting him, however, Agnes mistook him for her son, and Armin could not bear to deliver the message. He instead allowed Agnes to call him Seymour, and took over Seymour's life. Meanwhile, the real Seymour Skinner spent five years in a POW camp, then worked in a Chinese sweatshop for two decades until it was shut down by the United Nations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> also {{difficult}} to remember, {{with no more}} than 5% to 10% of dreams being remembered the following day. The parts of the <b>dream</b> that <b>are</b> retained the next day likely dissipate overnight. However, <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> not all negative and can have much to say about daily life. Broader possibilities for <b>dreams</b> can <b>be</b> presented by stressing their social aspect. Through this method dreams have a different, but equally important hold on psychoanalysis.|$|R
