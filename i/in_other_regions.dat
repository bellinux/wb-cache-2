McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>regions.</b> In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, {{many of which were}} failing.

5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while {{there appears to be}} no reproductive seasonality <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E

Commercial fishing for this species is prohibited in United States waters. They are protected in the Bahamas due to their significance to ecotourism, {{as well as in}} a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) off Brazil and elsewhere. However, enforcement against illegal fishing is lacking in some of these reserves, and many areas in which this species is abundant are not protected.|$|E
