5000|$|In a {{systematic}} review, published in 2003, of 23 randomized controlled trials, {{the authors found}} that [...] "stage based interventions are no more effective than non-stage based interventions or no intervention in changing smoking behaviour. However, it was also mentioned that stage based interventions are often used and implemented inadequately in practice. Thus, criticism is directed towards the use rather {{the effectiveness of the}} model itself. Looking at interventions targeting smoking cessation in pregnancy found that stage-matched interventions were more effective than non-matched interventions. One reason for this was the greater intensity of stage-matched interventions. Also, the use of stage-based interventions for smoking cessation in mental illness proved to be effective. Further studies, e.g. a randomized controlled trail published in 2009, found no evidence that a TTM based smoking cessation intervention was more effective than a control intervention not tailored to stage of change. The study claims that those not wanting to change (i.e. precontemplators) tend not to be responsive to neither stage nor non-stage based interventions. Since stage-based interventions tend to be more intensive they appear to be most effective at targeting contemplators and above rather than pre-contemplators. A 2010 systematic review of smoking cessation studies {{under the auspices of the}} Cochrane Collaboration found that [...] "stage-based self-help interventions (expert systems and/or tailored materials) and <b>individual</b> <b>counselling</b> were neither more nor less effective than their non-stage-based equivalents.|$|E
40|$|Patient {{education}} {{is an important}} part of asthma management. Individual {{education is}} usually used for this task. The object of this study was to assess whether another educational technique, educating patients in small groups, would be as effective and as acceptable as <b>individual</b> <b>counselling</b> in improving knowledge about asthma. A specially designed questionnaire was used to assess knowledge and other variables before and after education. Thirty-four patients were educated individually and 34 patients were educated in small groups. There were significant improvements in knowledge scores after both types of education. However group education took 4. 5 hours for 34 patients whereas <b>individual</b> <b>counselling</b> took 14. 25 hours for the same number. The results of this study suggest that educating patients in small groups is as effective as <b>individual</b> <b>counselling</b> in improving knowledge of asthma, is acceptable to patients and takes much less time...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effects of a low-intensity individual lifestyle intervention by a physician and compare this to the same physician intervention combined with an interdisciplinary, group-based approach in a real-life setting. Methods: The “Finnish Diabetes Risk score ” (FINDRISC) was used by GPs to identify individuals at high risk. A randomised, controlled design and an 18 month follow-up was used to assess the effect of <b>individual</b> lifestyle <b>counselling</b> by a physician (individual physician group, (IG)) every six months, with emphasis on diet and exercise, and compare this to the same <b>individual</b> lifestyle <b>counselling</b> combined with a group-based interdisciplinary program (individual and interdisciplinary group, (IIG)) provided over 16 weeks.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Literature on {{classroom}} management {{asserts that the}} best discipline is preventive, with studies on teacher variables such as empathy or enforcement of consequences, as well as student variables such as peers reporting positive behaviors with group contingencies, among others. However, there is little in the research that specifically targets regular classroom environments wherein large numbers of students simultaneously act out in highly frequent and disruptive ways as a large group, rather than just a few renegades. Written {{from the perspective of}} a veteran teacher as an ethnographic self-study, this research describes the phenomenon of a highly disruptive, regular education primary student group as a whole and teacher interventions attempted to influence group behavioral trends. Conducted in a natural, ongoing context to strengthen external validity, the purpose of this research is to add to the literature on {{classroom management}} and effective teacher interventions specifically addressing large groups of disruptive students with high-needs. Data was collected over the course of one school year and strategies from grounded theory and constant comparative analysis were used to describe and analyze the types of teacher interventions most frequently employed to affect whole-group behavioral trends. Interventions were analyzed and interpreted using choice theory from the field of psychology and by revisiting humanistic classroom management models proposed by Marvin Marshall (1998; 2004) and Thomas Gordon (1981) and relevant research on selected interventions of peer leaders, student choice, and <b>individual</b> <b>counsel.</b> Research questions were: 1) Given a highly disruptive collective primary student group of 24, what interventions were employed most often by a veteran teacher in attempts to co-create a more effective learning environment? 2) What were their levels of efficacy? The four main findings were: 1) There was evidence of incremental progress sprinkled with regressions, yet the data supports that student behavior did improve overall, both collectively and individually. 2) Various interventions were often employed simultaneously among the twenty-four distinct intervention categories identified in the data. 3) One of the least effective interventions for this group of students was teaching social skills curriculum in a whole group situation, especially for those students most in need of learning social skills. 4) Among the most frequently referenced teacher intervention categories for this group of students were: 1) peer leaders; 2) student choice, and; 3) <b>individual</b> <b>counsel.</b> This study offers strong evidence of improvement in student behavior and of the integrative nature of multiple interventions. The preponderance of evidence supports the success of implementing humanistic theories of classroom management to meet student needs for belonging and acceptance, power, and freedom through democratic, collaborative interventions to improve student behavior...|$|R
