40|$|Abstract. Real-time main-memory {{databases}} {{are useful}} in real-time environments. They are often faster and provide more predictable execution of transactions than disk-based databases do. The most reprehensible feature is the volatility of the memory. In the RODAIN Database Architecture we solve this problem by maintaining a remote copy of the database in a stand-by node. We use logs to update the database copy on the <b>hot</b> <b>stand-by.</b> The log writing is often the most dominating factor in the transaction commit phase. With <b>hot</b> <b>stand-by</b> we can completely omit the disk update from the critical path of the transaction, thus providing more predictable commit phase execution, which is important when the transactions need to be nished within their deadlines. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} policy-based {{automatic}} network configuration mechanism {{that makes the}} configuration of segmented networks inconsistency free. In our proposed mechanism, a policy describes what kind of events and configuration messages a network element wants to accept, and is registered on a central policy server by each network element in the initialization phase of the element. After the initialization, all events and messages are sent to the policy server, and the server forwards them to appropriate network elements considering the registered policy. As a result of introducing the policy server, network administrators have to do nothing to the policy to adjust them for the new network configurations, which expels the inconsistency. For instance, when a network element {{is removed from the}} network, an error message is generated by the peer of the element, is forwarded to a fault management server via the policy server, and a <b>hot</b> <b>stand-by</b> element is activated automatically. We made a proof-of-concept implementation composed of 9 Linux machines and 2 personal computers, and proved our mechanism through three scenarios, that is, an addition of a new AP Service Server, a removal of a failed AP Service Server and a takeover by a <b>hot</b> <b>stand-by</b> server, and an addition of a network segment composed of a firewall and a server...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{comprehensive}} {{mathematical model}} of full blast furnace with top gas recycling was established. The model consists of the calculation equations for gas composition of four zones (hearth, belly, lower shaft. top) in the blast furnace, the thermo-chemical balance model, the energy balance model of <b>hot</b> <b>stand-by</b> zone of the blast furnace and the shaft efficiency model. By using the model, the new process was calculated. The results show that coke rate and coal rate of the new process are both 200 kg/thm, fuel rate is decreased by 22. 8 % {{compared with that of}} conventional blast furnace. In addition, theoretical combustion temperature decreases with increasing hearth-recycle gas quantity. Increasing of hearth-recycle gas quantity by 10 m 3 /thm decreases theoretical combustion temperature by 10. 0 K. Furthermore, the model could be applied to calculate the operating parameters when the raw materials and fuel conditions are different, and the change laws of operating parameters under the same raw materials and fuel conditions could also be studied with this model...|$|E
