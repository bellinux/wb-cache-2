40|$|Saving is {{regarded}} in mainstream macroeconomics as a volitional relationship, like consumption. This paper argues that {{this view is}} incorrect. There is no independent volitional saving function. Since all goods produced are either consumption goods or investment goods, saving, defined as "income not consumed", is the accounting record of investment spending. Changes in the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> investment <b>produce</b> identical changes in saving, with no accompanying volitional change in saving behavior. "Saving" in economics should properly be termed "abstention" since it does not constitute transitive behavior. To understand saving behavior a Hicksian <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> income must be used, and capital gains and losses must {{be included in the}} <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> income.

40|$|Background: The {{measurement}} and <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> disability is difficult {{due to its}} objective and subjective characteristics. In Italy, three different perspectives have been developed during the last 40 years. These various perspectives have had an effect, not only on how to measure disability, but also on policies to improve the social integration of people with disabilities. Methods: This paper examines the various conceptual models behind the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> disability and {{the differences in the}} estimated number of persons with disabilities. In addition, it analyses in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, disability and health, the European and international initiatives undertaken to harmonize the <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> disability. Discussion: There are various bodies and central government agencies that either have management data or carry out statistical systematic surveys and disability surveys. Statistically speaking, the worst aspect of this scenario is that it creates confusion and uncertainty among the end users of this data, namely the policy makers. At international level the statistical data on disability is scarcely comparable among countries, despite huge efforts on behalf of international organisations to harmonize classifications and <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> disability. Conclusions: Statistical and administrative surveys provide information flows using a different definition and label based on a conceptual model that reflects the time period in which they were implemented. The use <b>of</b> different prescriptive <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> disability <b>produces</b> different counts <b>of</b> persons with disabilities in Italy. For this reason it is important to interpret the data correctly and choose the appropriate cross section that best represents the population on which to focus attention...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} used local produce {{as a way}} {{to investigate}} the construction and meaning of the local food environment by food retailers and consumers in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The research consisted of three components. First, the observed local food environment was defined through store surveys that were conducted in 193 food retail outlets and farmers’ markets in the Albuquerque study area. These surveys were performed in order to collect information, through signage and other advertising materials, about how retailers defined “local” produce. The subsequent qualitative text analysis on these materials allowed for several themes to emerge that characterized the observed local food environment. Spatial themes included natural, political, radial and conceptual boundaries, while embedded value themes included environmental, social, economic, cultural and quality values. Second, these resulting themes were combined into a Likert scale questionnaire that collected attitudes from consumers about local food in order to understand how the local food environment was perceived. Through the analysis of survey responses, consumers’ attitudes towards themes found in the observed local food environment were evaluated. Consumer questionnaire responses were given an overall score and then categorized based upon the stores at which the consumer bought produce. Third, consumer responses were linked back to their appropriate retailer category to conclude if attitudes about local produce were affected by where the respondent shopped for produce. Results indicate that there are many similarities between the retailer-defined and consumer-perceived <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> local <b>produce</b> through the use of spatial criteria and embedded values, but these definitions are variable and the motivations for retailers and consumers to define various criteria of “local” are different. Additionally, although consumers do not appear to receive information regarding meanings and <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> local <b>produce</b> exclusively through the retailers at which they shop, both retailers and consumers display a need {{to have some sort of}} defined space as “local”. However, despite this need to define a space as local, a stark absence of cartographic visualization was found within retail outlets to communicate the spatial meaning of local.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accurate {{reporting}} of complications following radiotherapy {{is an important}} part of the feedback loop to improve radiotherapy techniques. The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> toxicity is normally regarded as the maximum or peak (P) grade of toxicity reported over the follow-up period. An alternative definition (integrated longitudinal toxicity (ILT)) is proposed which takes into account both the severity and the duration of the complication. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this work, both <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> toxicity were used to derive dose-volume constraints for six specific endpoints of late rectal toxicity from a cohort of patients who received prostate radiotherapy in the MRC RT 01 trial. The dose-volume constraints were derived using ROC analysis for 30, 40, 50, 60, 65 and 70 Gy. RESULTS: Statistically significant dose-volume constraints were not derived for all dose levels tested for each endpoint and toxicity definition. However, where both definitions produced constraints, there was generally good agreement. Variation in the derived dose-volume constraints was observed to be larger between endpoints than between the two <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> toxicity. For one endpoint (stool frequency (LENT/SOM)) statistically significant dose-volume constraints were only derived using ILT. CONCLUSIONS: The longitudinal <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> toxicity (ILT) <b>produced</b> results consistent with those derived using peak toxicity and in some cases provided additional information which was not seen by analysing peak toxicity alone...|$|R

Integrating the various experimental and analytical methods that attempt this goal across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as careful <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> ‘complementarity’, <b>produces</b> novel insights and valuable lessons about new directions for research. (1) Experimental designs differ in temporal scale and whether standing stock or another ecosystem process was the response variable.

40|$|The use of {{high-rise}} terminals, or uptalk, {{continues to}} be a point of contention in the study of intonation. Researchers continually <b>produce</b> conflicting descriptions <b>of</b> it in an effort to define it, including conflicting explanations of its connotation or significance in conversation. These difficulties suggest that ToBI, the most frequently used system of annotation for intonation, cannot adequately describe the contour. The <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> uptalk <b>produced</b> using ToBI do not allow it to be distinguished from other contours, namely question intonation.
