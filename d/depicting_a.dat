Microsoft ended production of the Lumia 2520 the following month, meaning {{that there are no}} longer any Windows RT devices in active production. In July 2016, an image <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> number of cancelled Lumia devices was released, <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> prototype for a second Nokia tablet known as the Lumia 2020.|$|E

5|$|In 1835, Director of the United States Mint Samuel Moore {{resigned}} his post, and Robert M. Patterson {{assumed the}} position. Shortly after, Patterson began {{an attempt to}} redesign the nation's coinage. After Mint Chief Engraver William Kneass suffered a stroke later that year, Christian Gobrecht was hired as an engraver. On August 1, Patterson {{wrote a letter to}} Philadelphia artist Thomas Sully laying out his plans for the dollar coin. He also asked Titian Peale to create a design for the coin. Sully created an obverse design <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> seated representation of Liberty and Peale a reverse <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> soaring bald eagle, which were converted into coin designs by Gobrecht. After the designs were created and trials struck, production of the working dies began in September 1836.|$|E

5|$|The division's {{identification}} symbol was the Albanian double-headed eagle. Despite its short existence, a collar patch <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> goat-crested helmet was manufactured for the division {{but there is}} no evidence that it was ever used. Photographs exist of a machined-woven cuff band with the title Skanderbeg, but this was awarded to the 14th SS Volunteer Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the 7th SS Division in autumn 1944, and not to this division. Members of the cadre staff were photographed wearing an Albanian arm shield <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> black Albanian double-headed eagle on a red field. Many of the division's Muslim members wore traditional grey-coloured skull caps instead of the standard SS field cap. Others wore the traditional Albanian highlander hat, the Qeleshe.|$|E
5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> {{man in a}} costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of {{the subject of the}} painting is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and {{it may have been a}} self-portrait.|$|E

5|$|A large alcove {{close by}} in the garden, entered through a portal of grey Sussex marble, formed an amphitheatre that {{contained}} an effigy representing Truth crushing a mask, again probably the work of Roubiliac.

5|$|A {{tapestry}} copy of Picasso's Guernica <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> {{massacre of}} innocent {{women and children}} during the Spanish civil war is displayed {{on the wall of}} the United Nations building in New York City, at the entrance to the Security Council room, demonstrably as a spur to the conscience of representatives from the nation states. Albert Tucker painted Man's Head to capture the moral disintegration, and lack of conscience, of a man convicted of kicking a dog to death.|$|E
5|$|Aang's {{character}} was developed from a drawing by Bryan Konietzko, <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> bald {{man with an}} arrowlike design on his head, which the artist developed into {{a picture of a}} child with a flying bison. Meanwhile, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole, which he later combined with Konietzko's drawing.|$|E

5|$|All {{but one of}} {{the major}} iguana {{concentrations}} are either partially or fully protected by the Cuban government. Although no captive-breeding program exists within Cuba, the Centro Nacional de Areas Protegidas (the National Center for Protected Areas) has suggested it will explore this route in the future. In 1985 the Cuban government issued a commemorative peso <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> Cuban iguana on the head side of the coin in an attempt to raise awareness for this animal.|$|E
5|$|Another {{strikingly similar}} portrait, <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> woman also {{credited}} as Jane– although the costume differs slightly– was {{once owned by}} Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, but is now in an undisclosed private collection. Owing to similarities between the two works, Edwards suggests they are both copies of a lost original, perhaps completed by the same studio. A third copy, once owned by the English costume designer Herbert Norris, is known through records, although its whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|As {{the morning}} progressed {{and the light}} changed he would switch to {{sequentially}} later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> slightly different aspect of light. The process would be repeated {{over the course of}} days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.|$|E
5000|$|In the Chinese language, the {{character}} for [...] "left", , <b>depicts</b> <b>a</b> left hand attending to its work. In contrast, {{the character}} for [...] "right", [...] (yòu), <b>depicts</b> <b>a</b> right hand {{in relation to}} the mouth, suggesting the act of eating.|$|R
25|$|Some clay {{models of}} houses survive {{to give us}} an idea of what smaller {{dwellings}} were like. One <b>depicts</b> <b>a</b> round hut with a conical roof thatched in layers, while another <b>depicts</b> <b>a</b> rectangular house with rectangular doors and windows, a roof supported by beams that end in 'monkey heads', and a parapet and water spout on the roof. Both were found in Hawelti. Another <b>depicts</b> <b>a</b> square house with what appear to be layers of pitched thatch forming the roof.|$|R
50|$|Any point {{above the}} {{internal}} balance line (or curve) would have inflation, and any point below {{it would have}} unemployment.

5|$|Bombard weaponry: The oldest {{representation}} of a bombard {{can be found in}} the Chinese town of Ta-tsu. In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> demon holding a hand-held bombard. The muzzle seems to have a blast and flames coming from it which some believe is proof of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage {{is to be used}} for social mobility.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 a {{memorial}} {{to the men who}} died in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board, followed by a second in 2006, to honour the dead of both the 1901 and 1913 explosions. In October 2013, on the centenary of the tragedy, a Welsh national memorial to those killed in all Wales's mining disasters was unveiled at the former pithead, <b>depicting</b> <b>a</b> rescue worker coming to the aid of one of the survivors of the explosion.|$|E
50|$|Movies often <b>depict</b> <b>a</b> safe-cracker {{determining}} {{the combination of}} a safe lock using his fingers or a sensitive listening device to determine {{the combination of a}} rotary combination lock. Other films also <b>depict</b> <b>an</b> elaborate scheme of explosives and other devices to open safes.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} first aired in early 1994 was {{directed}} by Marc Ball.

This particular concept was an idea directly from Montgomery himself.|$|R
5000|$|Each game tile is 1.75 inches {{square and}} 2 {{millimeters}} thick.
