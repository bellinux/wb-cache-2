The announcement of Tetra was made on January 13, 2000, when she was four months old. It was thought that by producing identical primates, advances in human medical research could be made. A further four monkeys, cloned using this same technique were due to be born in May 2000.|$|E
50|$|Between {{the stages}} of {{fertilization}} and implantation, the developing human is a preimplantation conceptus. There is some dispute about whether this conceptus should no longer {{be referred to as}} an embryo, but should now be referred to as an proembryo, which is terminology that traditionally has been used to refer to plant life. Some ethicist and legal scholars make the argument that it is incorrect to call the conceptus an embryo, because it will later differentiate into both intraembryonic and extraembryonic tissues, and can even split to produce multiple embryos (identical twins), while others have pointed out that, as so-called extraembryonic tissues are really parts of the embryo's body that are no longer utilized after birth, much as milk teeth fall out after childhood, and as the process of the <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting</b> to form identical twins leaves the original intact, while generating a new embryo, rendering it no different from the process of cloning an adult human. However, the National Institutes of Health has made the determination that the traditional classification of pre-implantation embryo is still correct.|$|E

50|$|A more {{striking}} {{example of the}} use of polyembryony as a competitive reproductive tool is found in the parasitoid Hymenoptera, family Encyrtidae. The progeny of the <b>splitting</b> <b>embryo</b> develop into at least two forms, those that will develop into adults and those that become a type of soldier, called precocious larvae. These latter larvae patrol the host and kill any other parasitoids they find with the exception of their siblings, usually sisters.|$|R
50|$|Monoamniotic {{twins are}} {{identical}} twins that {{share the same}} amniotic sac within their mother’s uterus. Monoamniotic twins are always identical, always monochorionic and are usually termed Monoamniotic-Monochorionic ("MoMo") twins. They also share the placenta, but have two separate umbilical cords. Monoamniotic twins develop when an <b>embryo</b> does not <b>split</b> until after formation of the amniotic sac, at about 9-13 days after fertilization. Monoamniotic triplets or other monoamniotic multiples are possible, but extremely rare. Other obscure possibilities include multiples sets where monoamniotic twins {{are part of a}} larger gestation such as triplets, quadruplets, or more.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the present}} major {{limitations}} of seedling production of kopyor type coconut using embryo culture is that only one seedling can be produced from a single embryo. Therefore, {{we report on the}} development of a new breakthrough technique for the production of double seedlings from a single embryo. The technique consists of four steps, viz. (i) germination; (ii) incision; (iii) splitting; and (iv) recovery. A histological study was carried out on the development of the halved embryo into a new shoot. The best recovery process was obtained when the incised <b>embryo</b> was <b>split</b> into two and recovered into Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2 μM IBA and 15 μM kinetin. Following this protocol, an average of 56 shoots was successfully recovered from 30 zygotic embryos. The histological study also revealed that the meristem tissue of the halved embryo was able to produce a new meristem and primordial leaf. Most of the shoots then went on to produce normal seedlings and could be acclimatized successfully after having developed 2 or 3 leaves. This protocol is useful for routine seedling production of the kopyor-type coconut...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Genetically {{identical}} rhesus monkeys {{would have}} tremendous utility {{as models for}} the study of human disease and would be particularly valuable for vaccine trials and tissue transplantation studies where immune function is important. While advances in nuclear transfer technology may someday enable monkeys to be cloned with some efficiency, <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting</b> may be a more realistic approach to creating pairs of genetically identical monkeys. Although several different approaches to <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting,</b> including blastocyst bisection and blastomere separation, have been used successfully in rodents and domestic species for production of pairs and sets of identical offspring, efforts to create monozygotic twins in rhesus monkeys using these approaches have not met with similar success. Aggregation of split embryos with other types of blastomeres, such as tetraploid and developmentally asynchronous blastomeres, that could potentially increase their cell numbers and developmental competence without contributing to term development has been investigated as an alternative approach to creating monozygotic twin monkeys. The major challenges encountered with respect to the efficient production of monozygotic twins in rhesus monkeys and potential strategies to overcome these challenges are discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Blastocyst {{transfer}} is advocated {{to reduce the}} risk of multiple gestations in pregnancies by assisted reproduction. Nevertheless, there remains the rare inherit possibility of <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting</b> that can result in monozygotic twins leading to high-order multiples. Also, when a patient is found to have a higher gestation than the number of embryos transferred it calls into question the IVF facility’s competency and credibility. The case report presented such a rare phenomenon of <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting</b> and the clinical consequences precipitated from it. In the patient, two blastocysts were transferred 5 days after transvaginal oocyte retrieval. The pregnancy confirming hCG test did not predict high-order multiples in this case. Early ultrasonography documented trichorionic-quadramnionic gestation. Selective reduction of the monochorionic twins was done at 11 weeks. Dichorionic twin gestation continued uneventful until 22 weeks at which point the patient experienced preterm premature rupture of membranes with subsequent delivery. The pathology report confirmed trichorionic-quadramnionic gestation. The mode of splitting was different for the two embryos one leading to monozygotic dichorionic and the other to monozygotic monochorionic. Furthermore, the implantation was also apparently asynchronous with one implanted considerable later than the other. The first β-hCG value seemingly did not represent the entire initial implementation events otherwise the value would be higher carrying the early signal of high-order multiple...|$|E

40|$|Objective: In this study, we {{investigated}} the developmental potential of single blastomeres that {{were obtained from}} 4 -cell mice embryos that were split during the blastocyst stage. Materials and Methods: Imprinting Control Region (ICR) mice (age: 6 – 8 weeks), were superovulated and mated with a single fertile male of the same strain. We obtained 2 -cell embryos that were then cultured in 4 groups (× 4) with Human tubal fluid (HTF) supplemented with 12 % fetal bovine serum. When these embryos reached the 4 -cell stage, their zonae pellucidae were removed and every single blastomere was isolated by repeated pipetting with Ca/Mg 2 +-free medium. The isolated blastomeres (study group) and the intact embryos (control group) were then cultured to determine the blastocyst formation rate and quality. Results: We collected a total of 936 embryos from 524 morphologically intact, top-grade embryos in the 4 -cell stage from 80 stimulated mice. We used 356 of these embryos to isolate the blastomeres. The remaining 168 embryos were cultured as controls. A total of 1312 single blastomeres were obtained and cultured in vitro. Among these, 620 blastocysts were harvested from the original embryos compared with 136 blastocysts that were harvested from the control group. The overall blastocyst formation rate was 174. 2 % (620 blastocysts from 356 embryos) for the study group compared with 81. 5 % (136 blastocysts from 168 embryos) for the control group. The study group was 43. 3 % (268 of 620) top-grade blastocysts compared with 91 % (152 of 168) of the control group. Taken together, the percentage of top-grade blastocysts obtained per original embryo in the split group was 75. 4 % (174. 2 %× 43. 3 %) compared with 74. 2 % (81. 5 %× 91 %) for the control group. Conclusions: <b>Embryo</b> <b>splitting</b> can {{increase the number of}} blastocysts. However, the percentage of available top-grade blastocysts is the same compared with nonsplit embryos. <b>Embryo</b> <b>splitting</b> may not be a cost-effective technique for the generation of high-quality mouse blastocysts...|$|E

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the timing of twinning, we have {{examined}} a closely related event, X-chromosome inactivation, in female MZ twin pairs. X-inactivation patterns in peripheral blood and buccal mucosa were compared between monochorionic MZ (MC-MZ) and dichorionic MZ (DC-MZ) twins. Overall, the MC-MZ twins displayed highly similar X-inactivation patterns, whereas DC-MZ twins frequently differed in their X-inactivation patterns, when both tissues were tested. Previous experimental data suggest that commitment to X inactivation occurs when there are 10 - 20 cells in the embryo. Simulation of <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting</b> after commitment to X inactivation suggests that MC-MZ twinning occurs three or four rounds of replication after X inactivation, whereas a DC-MZ twinning event occurs earlier, before or {{around the time of}} X inactivation. Finally, the overall degree of skewing in the MZ twins was not significantly different from that observed in singletons. This indicates that X inactivation does not play a direct role in the twinning process, and it further suggests that extreme unequal splitting is not a common mechanism of twin formation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the birth}} of Dolly (the cloned sheep) in 1997, debates have arisen on the ethical and legal {{questions}} of cloning-for-biomedical-research (more commonly termed "therapeutic cloning") and of reproductive cloning using human gametes. Hong Kong enacted the Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance (Cap 561) in 2000. Section 15 (1) (e) of this Ordinance prohibits the "replacing of the nucleus of a cell of an embryo with a nucleus taken from any other cell," i. e., nucleus substitution. Section 15 (1) (f) prohibits the cloning of any embryo. The scope of the latter, therefore, is arguably the widest, prohibiting all cloning techniques such as cell nucleus replacement, <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting,</b> parthenogenesis, and cloning using stem cell lines. Although the Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance is not yet fully operative, this article examines how these prohibitions may adversely impact on basic research and {{the vision of the}} Hong Kong scientific community.

40|$|Administration (FDA) has {{concluded}} that meat and milk from clones of cattle, swine (pigs), and goats, and non-cloned offspring is as safe to eat as the food from conventionally bred animals. Researchers have been cloning livestock since 1996 to help {{improve the quality of}} herd and the meat and milk from these animals has now been proven to be safe. What are cloned animals? Cloned animals are biological copies of adult animals. They are like identical twins of adult animals. At a cost of about $ 20, 000 each to produce, clones are used for breeding—not for food. It may be the descendants of cloned cattle, pigs, and goats that are potential sources for meat and milk. How long has cloning been around? The technology to clone farm animals was developed more than 20 years ago, in the 1970 s. Early methods of cloning in the 1970 s involved a technology called <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting,</b> or blastomere separation. Embryos were split into several cells and then implanted into a surrogate mother for growth and development.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{attempts}} to identify {{risk factors for}} monozygotic (MZ) twinning following assisted conception. METHODS: Eighty-one MZ twinning pregnancies that occurred over a 7 -year period in our IVF/ embryo transfer programme were evaluated. These were compared with 4224 non-MZ pregnancies from the same period. RESULTS: The overall incidence of MZ twinning was 1. 88 % (81 / 4305) of all clinical pregnancies. A total of 63 % (51 / 81) of the MZ pregnancies included one or more other implantations as well. MZ twinning was unrelated to maternal age, paternal age, gonadotrophin dosage, peak estradiol and progesterone levels, number of oocytes collected, and number of embryos replaced. Patients with MZ twinning had signi®cantly more attempts at assisted reproduction than those with non-MZ multiple pregnancy. A logistic regression analysis suggested a role, albeit not emphatic, for the zona pellucida in MZ twinning. Twenty-four of the 65 MZ cases with known placentation were monoamniotic. This incidence far exceeds that seen following spontaneous conception (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of monoamniotic twinning is increased following IVF/embryo transfer. Zona pellucida disruption appears to increase the incidence of MZ twinning. However, the overall micromanipulation data together with the unexpected placentation data suggest that zona-mediated <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting</b> {{is not the only}} mechanism of twinning under arti®cial conditions.

40|$|Tremendous {{developments}} {{have been achieved}} {{in the field of}} assisted reproductive technology (ART) both in human and animals in the last two decades. In livestock including goats, the modern ARTs are being used for the improvement and preservation of livestock genetics and the enhancement of reproductive efficiency. The ARTs together with embryo technologies have facilitated the development of methods to transfer desired single genes or the entire genome from desirable individuals or embryos. Rapid advances in ARTs to manipulate embryos in the laboratory have permitted screening of embryos for genetic defects or highly desirable quantitative traits using molecular markers. The ARTs include artificial insemination, embryo transfer, estrus synchronization and superovulation, multiple ovulation embryo transfer, laparoscopic ovum pick-up, in vitro production of embryos, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, cryopreservation of sperm, cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos, sexing of sperm and embryos, <b>embryo</b> <b>splitting,</b> cloning and gene transfer and marker-assisted selection. The goat is an excellent model for all these ARTs and has been used extensively in both basic and applied research. The applications of these ARTs in goat enable to increase the rate of genetic progress, reduce generation interval, enhance production, help utilizing genetically important but biologically inferior individual, improve the management of infertile/sub-fertile buck/doe and eliminate reproductive diseases.
