5000|$|OpenVPN can be {{extended}} with third-party plug-ins or scripts, which can be called at defined entry points. [...] The purpose of this is often to extend OpenVPN with more advanced logging, <b>enhanced</b> <b>authentication</b> with username and passwords, dynamic firewall updates, RADIUS integration and so on. The plug-ins are dynamically loadable modules, usually written in C, while the scripts interface can execute any scripts or binaries available to OpenVPN. In the OpenVPN source code there are some examples of such plug-ins, including a PAM authentication plug-in. Several third-party plug-ins also exist to authenticate against LDAP or SQL databases such as SQLite and MySQL. There is an overview over many of these extensions in the related project wiki page for the OpenVPN community.|$|E

When CipherCard is placed over a touchscreen’s pin-pad, it remaps a user’s touch {{point on the}} physical token to a different location on the pin-pad. It hence translates a visible user password into a different system password received by a touchscreen, but is hidden from observers {{as well as the}} user. CipherCard <b>enhances</b> <b>authentication</b> security through Two-Factor Authentication (TFA), in that both the correct user password and a specific card are needed for successful authentication. We explore the design space of CipherCard, and describe three implemented variations each with unique capabilities.

5000|$|In Authentication, risk-based {{authentication}} is a non-static {{authentication system}} which {{takes into account}} the profile of the agent requesting access to the system to determine the risk profile associated with that transaction. The risk profile is then used to determine the complexity of the challenge. Higher risk profiles leads to stronger challenges, whereas a static username/password may suffice for lower-risk profiles. Risk-based implementation allows the application to challenge the user for additional credentials only when the risk level is appropriate. Machine authentication is often used in a risk based authentication set up. The machine authentication will run in the background and only ask the customer for additional authentication if the computer is not recognized. In a risk based authentication system, the institution decides if additional authentication is necessary. If the risk is deemed appropriate, <b>enhanced</b> <b>authentication</b> will be triggered, such as a one time password delivered via an out of band communication. Risk based authentication can also be used during the session to prompt for additional authentication when the customer performs a certain high risk transaction, such as a money transfer or an address change. Risk based authentication is very beneficial to the customer because additional steps are only required if something is out of the ordinary, such as the login attempt is from a new machine.|$|E

40|$|The {{online banking}} {{environment}} has grown tremendously {{over the past}} several years and will continue to grow as financial institutions continue to strive to allow customers to complete money transfers, pay bills, and access critical information online. During this same time, online banking has been plagued by Internet criminals and fraudsters attempting to steal customer information. Phishing, pharming, and other types of attacks have become well known and are widely used as a means for fraudsters to obtain information from customers and access online banking accounts. As a result, authenticating customers logging onto their online banking service has become a crucial concern of financial institutions. This research study portrays a clear picture of the need for <b>enhanced</b> <b>authentication</b> in online banking.

40|$|Death is {{an uncomfortable}} subject for many people, and digital systems are rarely {{designed}} {{to deal with}} this event. In particular, the wide array of existing digital authentication infrastructure rarely deals with gracefully retiring credentials in a uniform fashion. This research paper highlights an emerging paradigm: gracefully dealing with expired digital identities in a secure, privacypreserving fashion. It examines the confluence of modern browser technology, cloud services, and human factors involved in managing a person’s digital footprint while they live and retiring it when they die. We contemplate a potential approach to dealing with credentials after death by using cloud computing. We consider the reasons that such an approach may actually provide an opportunity for <b>enhancing</b> <b>authentication</b> security by frustrating identity stealing attacks. We note that this paper is not aimed at trivializing the real grief and loss that people feel, but rather an attempt to understand how security and privacy concerns are shaped by the end of life, with the ultimate goal of easing this transition for friends and family...|$|R

To protect data collection and control devices in IOT, first of all, ones shall ensure the authenticity of information source. To address the uncertainty problem of information sources in IOT, identity authentication technology is essential. In this study, we suggested an <b>enhanced</b> bidirectional <b>authentication</b> scheme that is suitable for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) communications among devices or between devices and control devices in an IOT environment. Specific improvement measures included three aspects: back-up terminals, a condition monitoring device to increase authentication properties, and an alarm mechanism. The <b>enhanced</b> bidirectional <b>authentication</b> protocol presented in this article has the characteristics of excellent performance in security and privacy protection, which could authenticate data contents, even positions and other data properties, and resist the replay or denial of service attacks; at the same time, it could overcome the defect of data asynchrony between the front end and the back end, providing users with excellent forward security. The simulation experiments showed that system reliability was greatly enhanced by adopting the proposed protocol...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{authenticate}} in Internet services has increased considerably {{over the past}} years. Every time the user wishes to access his web services, he has to prove his identity by providing his credentials. Therefore, knowledge based authentication methods (e. g. password) are inadequate, and bring in weaknesses in the security authentication chain. As a result, novel solutions are required to avoid the burden of repeated re-authentications and <b>enhance</b> <b>authentication</b> methods (e. g. strong authentication). In order to solve the first point, the research has investigated an existing solution called Single Sign On (SSO). SSO is a concept which exonerates the user from re-authenticating. There are different ways to provide SSO, and the research has chosen to study different Authentication Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI), on one side the Liberty Alliance project {{and on the other}} side the Shibboleth project. However these infrastructures do not improve the authentication process and consequently this paper has introduced a new component in the AAI architecture: the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) which brings a strong authentication capability. In order to create such a concept, the research has developed a novel framework where web services can interact with the SIM card {{to authenticate}} the user...|$|R
40|$|The user {{authentication}} scheme {{is a useful}} mechanism for verifying the legitimacy of a remote user over insecure network environments.

It uses an Extended Password Key Exchange Protocols [2] and elliptic-curve-cryptosystem based trust delegation mechanism to generate a delegation pass code for mobile station authentication, and it can effectively defend all known attacks to mobile networks including the denial-of-service attack. Moreover, the mobile station only needs to receive one message and send one message to authenticate itself to a visitor’s location register, and the model only requires a single elliptic-curve scalar point multiplication on a mobile device.
