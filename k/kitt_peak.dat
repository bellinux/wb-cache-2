5|$|Due {{to rising}} light {{pollution}} in Cleveland, a new station in Geauga County's Montville Township {{was established in}} 1950s. Named after Jason John Nassau, the station initially housed the Burrell telescope, which was later moved to <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak</b> National Observatory. Instead of Burrell the station was equipped with the 36-inch robotic telescope. In 2008 Nassau Station was sold to the Geauga Park District and subsequently incorporated into its Observatory Park.|$|E
5|$|James E. Rhoads, an {{astronomer}} at the <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak</b> National Observatory, analyzed the burst and determined {{that it was not}} strongly beamed. Further analysis by Frail and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by the burst was approximately 5×1050ergs (5×1043J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy was approximately 3×1050erg (3×1043J). This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|The 24-inch Burrell Schmidt Telescope was {{originally}} built in 1939 by Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio and was housed at the Taylor Road facility. It is currently housed at <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak</b> National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The telescope recently had its optics upgraded {{with a very}} wide field of view CCD array, {{which is much more}} sensitive than the photographic plates. It is the instrument used today by the Case astronomers.|$|E
5|$|These {{criteria}} {{restricted the}} field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble's 'continuous viewing zones' (CVZs)—the areas of sky which are not occulted by the Earth or the moon during Hubble's orbit. The working group decided {{to concentrate on the}} northern CVZ, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the Keck telescopes, the <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak</b> National Observatory telescopes and the Very Large Array (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University made a {{deal with}} the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) to build a new {{observatory}} at <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak</b> National Observatory to house the Burrell Schmidt. The telescope was moved from Ohio to Arizona in May 1979, and in 1980 the 36-inch reflector on Taylor Road was moved to the Nassau Station. This meant no further astronomical work was done at the Taylor Road facility, and as a result the faculty and resources of the original observatory were moved to the main campus of Case Western Reserve University in 1982. The Taylor Road facility was sold in 1983, was abandoned, and remained neglected until 2005 when it was sold to a couple who planned to convert the building into a residence. The plans stalled when its new owner was convicted of mortgage fraud and sent to prison in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The {{lands of}} the Nation are located within the Sonoran Desert in south central Arizona. The Nation's lands are located in areas {{of a series of}} {{parallel}} mountains and valleys. The vegetation is consistent with other areas on the Sonoran Desert. Saguaro cactus, Cholla, prickly pear, palo verde, velvet mesquite, whitethorn acacia, desert ironwood and willow are the dominant vegetation in the landscape. The landscape is interspersed with plains and mountains. These include the Quinlan and Baboquivari Mountains, which include <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak,</b> the <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak</b> National Observatory and telescopes as well as Baboquivari Peak.|$|E

25|$|Steve Mandel {{has also}} {{cooperated with the}} <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak</b> National Observatory Visitor Center, {{presenting}} educational Nightly Observer Program and Advanced Observer Program to the public. In 2004 he founded the Advanced Imaging Conference in San Jose, California, where about 250 amateur astronomers and manufacturers of astronomical equipment and software meet annually to discuss technology, imaging techniques and possibilities of scientific contributions. He created the so-called Hubble Award, given at the conference to an astronomer who {{made significant contributions to}} astrophotography.|$|E
25|$|Very large {{radio telescopes}} on Earth were also {{listening}} to Huygens 10-watt transmission using {{the technique of}} very long baseline interferometry and aperture synthesis mode. At 11:25 CET on January 14, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia detected the carrier signal from Huygens. The GBT continued to detect the carrier signal well after Cassini stopped listening to the incoming data stream. In addition to the GBT, eight of the ten telescopes of the continent-wide VLBA in North America, located at Pie Town and Los Alamos, New Mexico; Fort Davis, Texas; North Liberty, Iowa; <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak,</b> Arizona; Brewster, Washington; Owens Valley, California; and Mauna Kea, Hawaii, also listened for the Huygens signal.|$|E

500|$|Hurricane Norbert was {{described}} as [...] "big and ugly" [...] by meteorologists. Planes were advised to use caution while navigating in the area. The Mazatlan government marine operator warned shipping to exercise extreme caution from Jalisco to Baja California Sur. The Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center noted the possibility of heavy rains and flooding across portions of the Baja California Peninsula. Throughout Mexico, a combination of Norbert and several other storms left many people without a home and hotels nearly empty.

500|$|In 1987, {{astronomer}} David Jewitt, then at MIT, {{became increasingly}} puzzled by [...] "the apparent emptiness {{of the outer}} Solar System". He encouraged then-graduate student Jane Luu to aid him in his endeavour to locate another object beyond Pluto's orbit, because, as he told her, [...] "If we don't, nobody will." [...] Using telescopes at the <b>Kitt</b> <b>Peak</b> National Observatory in Arizona and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Jewitt and Luu conducted their search {{in much the same}} way as Clyde Tombaugh and Charles Kowal had, with a blink comparator. Initially, examination of each pair of plates took about eight hours, but the process was sped up with the arrival of electronic charge-coupled devices or CCDs, which, though their field of view was narrower, were not only more efficient at collecting light (they retained 90% of the light that hit them, rather than the 10% achieved by photographs) but allowed the blinking process to be done virtually, on a computer screen. Today, CCDs form the basis for most astronomical detectors. In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Luu later joined him to work at the University of Hawaii's 2.24m telescope at Mauna Kea. Eventually, the field of view for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be conducted far more rapidly. Finally, after five years of searching, Jewitt and Luu announced on August 30, 1992 the [...] "Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object" [...] Six months later, they discovered a second object in the region, (181708) 1993 FW.|$|E

[...] This discovery provided the first solid evidence that planet formation occurs throughout the galaxy. [...] From 1987 to 1989, he was a visiting senior scientist at NASA headquarters, where he {{played a major role}} in defining the future of infrared astronomy. [...] More specifically, he made major technical and programatic contributions to the Space Infrared Telescope, which was renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope after its launch in 2003, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, which consists of a large infrared telescope aboard an airplane, and 2MASS, which is an infrared all-sky survey. [...] After this administrative interlude, he went to the Gemini Observatory, where he became Project Scientist. [...] After Gillett's untimely death on April 22, 2001, the telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, was officially named the Fredrick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope.|$|E
