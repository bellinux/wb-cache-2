40|$|OBJECTIVE: Opposition {{to human}} {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) vaccination is common {{on social media}} and {{has the potential to}} impact vaccine coverage. This study aims to conduct an international comparison of the proportions of tweets about HPV vaccines that <b>express</b> <b>concerns,</b> the types of <b>concerns</b> <b>expressed</b> and the social connections among users posting about HPV vaccines in Australia, Canada and the UK. DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional design, an international comparison of English language tweets about HPV vaccines and social connections among Twitter users posting about HPV vaccines between January 2014 and April 2016 was conducted. The Health Belief Model, {{one of the most widely}} used theories in health psychology, was used as the basis for coding the types of HPV vaccine <b>concerns</b> <b>expressed</b> on Twitter. SETTING: The content of tweets and the social connections between users who posted tweets about HPV vaccines from Australia, Canada and the UK. POPULATION: 16 789 Twitter users who posted 43 [*] 852 tweets about HPV vaccines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportions of tweets <b>expressing</b> <b>concern,</b> the type of <b>concern</b> <b>expressed</b> and the proportions of local and international social connections between users. RESULTS: Tweets <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns</b> about HPV vaccines made up 14. 9 % of tweets in Canada, 19. 4 % in Australia and 22. 6 % in the UK. The types of <b>concerns</b> <b>expressed</b> were similar across the three countries, with concerns related to 'perceived barriers' being the most common. Users <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns</b> about HPV vaccines in each of the three countries had a relatively high proportion of international followers also <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The proportions and types of HPV vaccine <b>concerns</b> <b>expressed</b> on Twitter were similar across the three countries. Twitter users who mostly <b>expressed</b> <b>concerns</b> about HPV vaccines were better connected to international users who shared their concerns compared with users who did not <b>express</b> <b>concerns</b> about HPV vaccines.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behavioral}} determinants that underlie cancer patients’ intention to <b>express</b> <b>concerns</b> during a consultation. This information can be relevant to developing effective interventions for cancer patients. In this study, the integrative model of behavioral prediction (IMBP) is used as a framework to unravel the determinants of patients’ intention to <b>express</b> <b>concerns.</b> The objectives of this study are to examine which of the IMBP determinants (attitude, perceived social norm, and/or self-efficacy) are significantly related to intention and what content of these determinants can be targeted to effect a change in patients’ intention. An online survey based on the IMBP determinants was distributed. A total of 236 cancer patients and cancer survivors participated. The results of the survey showed that patients’ attitudes and perceived social norm were the most important determinants of their intention to <b>express</b> <b>concerns.</b> The largest change in patients’ intention might be achieved by targeting the affective attitude, referring {{to the extent to which}} patients believe that <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns</b> is (un) pleasant, and the social norm, referring to the extent to which patients feel (un) supported by significant others in <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns...</b>|$|R
