2500|$|Behn was a {{political}} writer of fiction and for the stage, and though not didactic in purpose, most of her works have distinct political content. The timing of Oroonokos publication must be seen in its own context {{as well as in}} the larger literary tradition (see below). According to Charles Gildon, Aphra Behn wrote Oroonoko even with company present, and Behn's own account suggests that she wrote the novel in a single sitting, with her pen scarcely rising from the paper. If Behn travelled to Surinam in 1663–64, she felt no need for twenty-four years to write her [...] "American story" [...] and then <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> and acute passion for telling it in 1688. It is therefore wise to consider what changes were in the air in that year that could account for the novel.|$|E
2500|$|Jordison's parents {{divorced}} {{when he was}} young. He and his two younger sisters stayed with their mother. His mother remarried {{and set up a}} funeral parlor where Jordison would occasionally help. Jordison has stated that he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> responsibility to be the man of the house. During this time, he formed the band Modifidious, in which he played drums. He later described them as [...] "total speed-metal thrash". The band helped Jordison break new ground, playing live as support to local bands including Atomic Opera, featuring Jim Root, and Heads on the Wall, featuring Shawn Crahan. He also played at a bowling center his family owned, on a night called [...] "Rock and Roll Bowl". After a multitude of lineup changes – including Craig Jones and Josh Brainard, who would reappear in Slipknot – the band released two demos in 1993: Visceral and Mud Fuchia.|$|E

60|$|Lucy <b>felt</b> on <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> sick at heart. She {{began to}} tremble a little, {{and it was only}} by great {{strength}} of will that she forced herself to go on. She was horribly frightened. Her mouth was dry, and when at last the words came, her voice sounded unnatural.|$|R
60|$|Philip <b>felt</b> on <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> {{sick with}} fear. He {{hurried to the}} house in which she lived. He was {{astonished}} that she was in Paris at all. He had not seen her for months and imagined she had long since returned to England. When he arrived he asked the concierge whether she was in.|$|R

60|$|Then {{it seemed}} that the bitter {{struggle}} between the good and the evil in her was done, and the evil had conquered. She <b>felt</b> on <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> curiously elated. It seemed no longer to matter that she deceived her faithful friends. She gave a bitter laugh, as she thought {{how easy it was to}} hoodwink them.|$|R
60|$|No {{reply was}} made. They were but {{two hundred yards}} away when there were two bright flashes from {{the stern of the}} brigantine, and a shower of bullets splashed round the boats. There were two or three cries of pain, and George Lechmere <b>felt</b> Frank give <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> start.|$|R

6000|$|She <b>felt,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> horror, {{that she}} might weep. She wished she had not stood up. She {{wondered}} wildly why she had stood up. No one spoke, and she was impelled to flounder on. [...] "Think of the mockery!" [...] she said. [...] "Think how dumb we find ourselves and stifled! I know {{we seem to have}} a sort of freedom.... Have you ever tried to run and jump in petticoats, Mr. Capes? Well, think what it must be to live in them--soul and mind and body! It's fun for a man to jest at our position." ...|$|R
60|$|The latter {{threw his}} head on one side, as he saw the pistol levelled. The action saved his life, for it was well aimed, and the bullet would have struck him full between the eyes. As it was, he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sharp <b>sudden</b> pain, as it grazed his cheek deeply. He sprang forward, and before the man could drop the pistol and change his sword from the left hand to the right, Desmond's weapon pierced his throat. At the same moment, Mike cut down one of his assailants with his sabre, receiving, however, a severe cut on the left {{shoulder}} from the other.|$|R
60|$|For {{the next}} month, {{occupied}} {{with my own}} affairs, I saw no one connected with this lamentable business, and my mind ceased to be occupied with it. But one day, when I was walking along, bent on some errand, I passed Charles Strickland. The sight of him brought back {{to me all the}} horror which I was not unwilling to forget, and I <b>felt</b> in me <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> repulsion for the cause of it. Nodding, for it would have been childish to cut him, I walked on quickly; but in <b>a</b> minute I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> hand on my shoulder.|$|R

6000|$|He {{faced her}} again. [...] "Miss Ross, I <b>felt</b> last night <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> {{desire to help}} you. I {{believed}} I {{had the power to}} help you--I don't know why--I'm not a healer." [...] He smiled for the first time. [...] "But I felt perfectly sure I could do you good. I feel that way now. I never had such a feeling toward any person before. It is just as strange to me as it is to you." ...|$|R
40|$|A 22 -year-old {{white male}} {{presented}} to the emergency department complaining of left-flank pain and dark-col-ored urine. According to the patient, 3 days earlier he had taken some “bad falls ” while practicing jujitsu and devel-oped mild left-flank soreness. Six hours prior to presenting to the emergency department, he had attended a second jujitsu practice session during which he attempted to per-form a throw on his opponent (Fig. 1). He fell awkwardly {{on his back and}} <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sharp, <b>sudden</b> pain in the left flank. The patient continued practice without informing the instruc-tor of his injury and was unconcerned until later in the evening when he experienced frequent urination with abnormal “deep red ” color, which prompted his decision to seek medical care. Vital signs were normal on admission. The patient’...|$|R
60|$|This, {{it seemed}} to Jimmy, was painfully evident, and though he {{contrived}} to hide it, a sense of dismay crept over him as he sat down. Tom Wheelock looked played out, and though his son was ready to take up his burden, he felt it would be heavy. He realized that through the compassion he <b>felt,</b> and then <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> fit of anger against {{the man who had}} crushed his father came over him. The color darkened a trifle in his face, but he put a restraint upon himself.|$|R

6000|$|Leaving {{the office}} with the bag slung over his shoulder, {{he stopped at the}} door of the dining-room, on the {{opposite}} side of the hall. His head <b>felt</b> strangely dull. <b>A</b> <b>sudden</b> suspicion that the feeling might show itself in his face, made him change his mind and pause before he ascended the stairs. There was a looking-glass in the dining-room. He went straight to the glass, and stood before it, studying the reflection of his face with breathless anxiety. [...] "Do I look stupid-mad?" [...] he asked himself. [...] "They won't let me be with her; they'll send me away, if I look stupid-mad." ...|$|R
6000|$|Running on {{in desperate}} haste, he fell upon {{it with his}} hunting knife; and then stopped, feeling strangely limp and breathless, with the long blade {{dripping}} in his hand. Now that the caribou lay dead before him, the strain {{of the last few}} minutes made itself <b>felt.</b> Surprised by <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> and unexpected opportunity when he was exhausted and weak from want of food, he had forced upon himself sufficient steadiness to shoot. It had cost him an effort; the short, fierce chase had tried him hard; and now the reaction had set in. For all that, he was conscious of a savage, exultant excitement. Here was food, and food meant life! ...|$|R
500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I <b>felt</b> all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|R

60|$|Overpowered with weariness both of {{body and}} mind, he flung himself down {{under the shade of}} some bushes that clothed the base of the wall above him. As he lay there--so still in his heavy {{lassitude}} that life itself seemed to have left him--one of the long green lizards, common to Italy, crawled over his shoulder. He seized the animal--doubtful for the moment whether it might not be of the poisonous species--and examined it. At the first glance he discovered that it was of the harmless order of its race, and would have flung it carelessly from him, but for something in its appearance which, in the wayward irritability of his present mood, he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> strange and <b>sudden</b> pleasure in contemplating.|$|R
60|$|Shot after shot {{struck the}} lugger, then Harry <b>felt</b> her give <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> lurch. There {{was a wild}} cry and the next moment she went down stern first. She was so nearly even with the water when she sank, that there was less {{downward}} suck than Harry had expected, and striking out with his feet his head was soon above the surface. The cord had kept the hatch {{within a couple of}} feet of him, and with some difficulty, owing to the buoyancy of the corks, he thrust himself and the girls under it. The tarpaulin was old and rotten, and the light penetrated in several places, and Harry could see that, in the position in which they were lying, the faces of both girls were above the water.|$|R
