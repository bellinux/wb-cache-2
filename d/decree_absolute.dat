He continued working as a judge while chairing the daily committee. The committee was appointed on 26 June 1946 and published its first report in July, which reduced the time between decree nisi and <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> from 6 months to 6 weeks. The second report was published in November, recommending that County Court judges should be appointed to try cases, and the final report was published in February 1947 recommending {{the establishment of a}} Marriage Welfare Service.

2500|$|Days {{before the}} <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> of divorce, letters patent were issued with general rules to {{regulate}} royal titles after divorce. Diana lost the style Her Royal Highness {{because she was}} no longer married to the Prince of Wales and instead was styled Diana, Princess of Wales. The Queen reportedly wanted to let Diana continue to use the style after her divorce, but Charles had insisted on removing it. As the mother of the prince expected to one day ascend to the throne, she was accorded the same precedence she enjoyed during her marriage. Prince William was reported to have reassured his mother: [...] "Don't worry, Mummy, I will give it back to you one day when I am King." [...] Almost a year before, according to Tina Brown, the Duke of Edinburgh had warned the Princess of Wales: [...] "If you don't behave, my girl, we'll take your title away." [...] She is said to have replied: [...] "My title is a lot older than yours, Philip." [...] Diana and her mother quarrelled in May 1997 after she told Hello! magazine that Diana was happy to lose her title of Her Royal Highness following her controversial divorce from Prince Charles. They were reportedly not on speaking terms with each other by the time of Diana's death.|$|E
60|$|Benham {{was the son}} of a schoolmaster. His {{father was}} {{assistant}} first at Cheltenham, and subsequently at Minchinghampton, and then he became head and later on sole proprietor of Martindale House, a high-class preparatory school at Seagate. He was extremely successful for some years, as success goes in the scholastic profession, and then disaster overtook him in the shape of a divorce. His wife, William Porphyry's mother, made the acquaintance of a rich young man named Nolan, who was recuperating at Seagate from the sequelae of snake-bite, malaria, and a gun accident in Brazil. She ran away with him, and she was divorced. She was, however, unable to marry him because he died at Wiesbaden only three days after the Reverend Harold Benham obtained his <b>decree</b> <b>absolute.</b> Instead, therefore, being a woman of great spirit, enterprise and sweetness, she married Godfrey Marayne, afterwards Sir Godfrey Marayne, the great London surgeon.|$|E

25|$|Barth's {{doctrine}} of election involves a firm rejection {{of the notion of}} an eternal, hidden decree. In keeping with his Christo-centric methodology, Barth argues that to ascribe the salvation or damnation of humanity to an abstract <b>absolute</b> <b>decree</b> is to make some part of God more final and definitive than God's saving act in Jesus Christ. God's <b>absolute</b> <b>decree,</b> if one may speak of such a thing, is God's gracious decision to be for humanity in the person of Jesus Christ. Drawing from the earlier Reformed tradition, Barth retains the notion of double predestination but makes Jesus himself the object of both divine election and reprobation simultaneously; Jesus embodies both God's election of humanity and God's rejection of human sin. While some regard this revision of the {{doctrine of}} election as an improvement on the Augustinian-Calvinist doctrine of the predestination of individuals, critics, namely Brunner, have charged that Barth's view amounts to a soft universalism, thereby departing from Augustinian-Calvinism.|$|R

50|$|In March 1933, an {{argument}} arose over irregularities {{in the voting}} procedure. The Social Democratic president of the National Council (the lower house of parliament) Karl Renner resigned {{to be able to}} cast a vote as a parliament member. As a consequence, the two vice presidents, belonging to other parties, resigned as well to be able to vote. Without a president, the parliament could not conclude the session. Dollfuss took the three resignations as a pretext to declare that the National Council had become unworkable, and advised President Wilhelm Miklas to issue a decree adjourning it indefinitely. When the National Council wanted to reconvene days after the resignation of the three presidents, Dollfuss had police bar entrance to parliament, effectively eliminating democracy in Austria. From that point onwards, he governed as dictator by emergency <b>decree</b> with <b>absolute</b> power.|$|R

5000|$|The {{paradoxical}} finding left doubts {{hanging over}} Dilke's respectability, and investigative journalist William Thomas Stead launched a public campaign against him. Two months later, in April, Dilke sought {{to reopen the}} case and clear his name by making the Queen's Proctor {{a party to the}} case and opposing the <b>decree</b> <b>absolute.</b> Unfortunately, Dilke and his legal team had badly miscalculated (his legal advice has been described as [...] "perhaps the worst professional advice ever given"). Though they had planned to subject Virginia to a searching cross-examination, Dilke, having been dismissed from the case, had no locus standi. As a consequence, it was Dilke who was subjected to severe scrutiny in the witness box by Henry Matthews. Matthews' attack was devastating, and Dilke proved an unconvincing witness. His habit of physically cutting pieces out of his diary with scissors was held up to particular ridicule, as it created the impression that he had cut out evidence of potentially embarrassing appointments. The jury found that Virginia had presented the true version of the facts and that the <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> should be granted.|$|E
