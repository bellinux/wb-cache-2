5|$|James Nesbitt and {{his agent}} {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of Murphy's Law. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, she offered him a script for Jekyll, suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde {{to be able to walk}} around in public without attracting attention.|$|E

Death has always been distasteful to people because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> frightening happening. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> unpleasant and painful topic that no one wants to talk about it and discussions do not easily surface. How are we ever to understand <b>it</b> if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> never discussed? Perhaps we will never understand it fully, but we can at least try to prepare ourselves and others...|$|R

25|$|When John Nathan-Turner {{became the}} show's {{producer}} in Baker's last year, the Fourth Doctor {{was the first}} to sport an item of clothing adorned with question marks as a motif, in this case, above the points on his shirt collars. His overall costume was redesigned, changing the colour focus from brown to red. Designer June Hudson later revealed in an interview that Nathan-Turner had even given her permission to remove the scarf altogether if she wanted to. Hudson opted to keep the scarf, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> iconic part of the character.|$|E
25|$|He made {{no attempt}} to direct this picture. He just sat in his {{director}}'s chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity {{for all of us to}} work together to make a difference. This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} that large centers like Cahokia faced was keeping {{a steady supply of}} food.

The depiction of the moral murkiness of American officials was unprecedented in Hollywood—especially in 1945, when the Allied victory ushered in an era of understandable but ultimately dangerous chauvinism in American life." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the {{foundation}} of the monastery of Tallaght by St. Maelruain in 769 A.D. we have a more reliable record of the area's early history. The monastery was a centre of learning and piety, particularly associated with the Céli Dé spiritual reform movement. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> important institution that it and the monastery at Finglas were known as the [...] "two eyes of Ireland". St. Aengus, an Ulsterman, {{was one of the most}} illustrious of the Céli Dé and devoted himself to the religious life. Wherever he went he was accompanied by a band of followers who distracted him from his devotions. He secretly travelled to the monastery at Tallaght where he was not known and enrolled as a lay brother. He remained unknown for many years until his identity was discovered by Maeilruain. They may have written the Martyrology of Tallaght together, and St Aengus also wrote a calendar of saints known as the Féilire of Aengus.|$|E
2500|$|While listing [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs", Louis Virtel of The Backlot {{ranked the}} song at number 25, writing {{that on the}} song [...] "Madonna's a lonesome troubadour {{defending}} her very being while invoking some tried-and-true country music imagery. The whole whirs and gyrates like a lasso, and it’s an unmistakable radio moment of the early 2000s." [...] Mark Graham of VH1 placed the song at number 20 on his [...] "53 Favorite Madonna Songs", in honor of her 53rd birthday, and Bill Lamb of About.com listed the track at number 34 on his [...] "Madonna's 38 Top 10 Pop Songs". Matthew Jacobs of Huffington Post listed [...] "The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles" [...] and [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] was picked as her 20th, with Jacobs writing that the song is [...] "one of the standouts from the 'Music' album," [...] noting that [...] "the country-inspired 'Don't Tell Me' thrived because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> unlikely follow-up to the electronic-infused title single." [...] In 2009, Pitchfork Media ranked the song at number 434 in their list of The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{expedition}} {{spent three}} days {{at the base of}} Pike's Peak to explore the Fontaine qui Bouille (now called Fountain Creek), which allowed the men to bathe before beginning their work, making studies and collecting samples of the local geology. On reaching the actual springs, the men compared the tastes of each spring, created lemon-flavored soda, and bottled pure spring water to later compare with city water. The afternoon of their last day was spent in the Garden of the Gods. The men enjoyed squeezing into a narrow cavern and reaching [...] "a vault about fifty feet long, ten feet high", which they examined by candlelight, and comparing the Garden's rock formations to recognizable shapes, including animals and [...] "a statue of Liberty, standing by her escutcheon, with the usual Phrygian cap on her head." [...] The men were so impressed by the landscape, that [...] "t was a great disappointment to some of our kind friends that our artist [...] did not choose the Garden of the Gods for a 'big picture.' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> interesting place in nature that they could not understand its unavailability for art." [...] Ludlow later surmised that, [...] "however impressive it might be outdoors, [...] was absolutely incommunicable by paint and canvas".|$|E

2500|$|The part of Liz Shaw {{was given}} to Caroline John who was {{recommended}} to the outgoing production team by James Cellan Jones. Although John had been working regularly on the stage (including at the National Theatre under Laurence Olivier), she was frustrated {{that she had not}} won any TV roles. According to several DVD releases in the Doctor Who series and interviews with the actress herself, taking dramatic steps, John had herself photographed in a bikini and sent the picture around to BBC producers. The photo ended up on Peter Bryant's desk and he offered her the part once they had met, without any formal audition or screen test. After appearing in the 25 episodes that made up the four stories of the seventh season, John left the programme because she was pregnant with her first child, and producer Barry Letts had already decided against renewing her contract. Letts and Terrance Dicks viewed the character as unsuccessful, feeling that she did not fill the companion's role of asking the Doctor for exposition and acting as an audience surrogate. In 1978, John expressed mixed feelings about her role as Liz, saying, [...] "I was excited at first to be a brainy girl, but all the directors wanted really was a sexy piece. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> effort looking glamorous on cold clay-pits and rubbish dumps. I enjoyed the series but found it restricting after a while." [...] John continued to appear at fan conventions from the 1990s onwards.|$|E
