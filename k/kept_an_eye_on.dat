At 7:00 pm, the emperor {{instructed}} Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty with two divisions of cavalry to march west to capture Montmirail, followed at 3:00 am by Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's division of Marmont's corps. Ney's Young Guard divisions would move {{in their wake}} at 6:00 am while Mortier's Old Guard would march directly from Sézanne to Montmirail. Jean François Leval's division was detached from Oudinot and ordered to march to Montmirail via La Ferté-Gaucher.

In the film, Pym was an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. until his wife Janet van Dyne shrunk to the Quantum Realm during one of their missions and discovered that the organization was trying to replicate his Pym Particle formula. After quitting, he builds his own company Pym Technologies, but is ousted as CEO by his former protege Darren Cross and his estranged daughter Hope van Dyne. Although they still <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Cross of any suspicious activity, Cross comes close to perfecting Pym's formula and plans to sell the Yellowjacket suit, Pym manipulated former thief Scott Lang into stealing the suit and eventually instructing Scott {{to be the new}} Ant-Man to stop Cross.

25|$|The {{main event}} was between Edge and John Cena for the WWE Championship. In this match, the {{stipulation}} {{was that if}} Edge got disqualified, he would lose the title to Cena. During the match, Cena used several blows and slams on Edge.

Edge took advantage and connected with chokeholds and a flying clothesline, but Cena was able to recover. Lita tried to interfere, but Edge warned her not to get him disqualified. Lita threw a steel chair into the ring, but Edge threw it back outside the ring, and Cena took advantage. Cena then applied the STFU on Edge. Lita tried to interfere again, but Edge warned her once again. Edge {{made it to the}} ropes, and while the referee told Cena to break the hold, Lita handed Edge a pair of brass knuckles. As Cena broke the hold, Cena put Edge on his shoulders again for the FU, but this time Lita jumped on Edge's back when Cena had Edge set up for the FU, and Lita was the recipient of the FU instead of Edge. Edge then jumped off of Cena's back and hit Cena {{in the back of the}} head with the brass knuckles to win the match and retain his championship.|$|E

The anxieties of the final years of the Nkrumah regime were relieved in 1966, by the coup that ousted Nkrumah. In the years that followed, as her children were abroad at boarding schools and universities, and her husband was active once more in Ghanaian politics and as an ambassador for the nation, she stayed mostly in Kumasi, providing the base from which he could travel out into the world, secure in the knowledge that Peggy was taking care of things on the home front. She <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the properties he had inherited from his grand-uncle. Despite her family's extensive political involvements, Peggy herself was not particularly interested in party politics. She supported her husband, of course. But her own contributions were through the wide range of social work she engaged in. Having learned Twi, the language of the Asante, she became interested in and knowledgeable about Akan art and folklore, as she acquired a major goldweight collection, began collecting and translating proverbs, and learned Ananse stories, many of them from her husband. For three decades, a visit to her house and her goldweight collection was {{one of the highlights of}} a visit to Ashanti for visitors interested in its art.|$|E

When Ruth insisted on taking batting practice despite his being both a rookie who did not play regularly, and a pitcher, he arrived to find his bats sawn in half. His teammates nicknamed him [...] "the Big Baboon", a name the swarthy Ruth, who had disliked the nickname [...] "Niggerlips" [...] at St. Mary's, detested.
