5000|$|Since around 2005, online <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> have {{provided}} {{an alternative to}} the traditional fee structure, claiming cheaper, fixed fee selling packages. These online <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> claim to give private property sellers the ability to market their property via the major property portals (the preferred medium used by traditional high street <b>estate</b> <b>agents)</b> for {{a fraction of the cost}} of the traditional estate agency. Online <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> claim that they can advertise a property as effectively as traditional <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> by using digital marketing techniques and centralising their back office operation to one location, rather than having physical offices in the town in which they are based. Online <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> normally cover the whole of the UK, therefore claiming to be able to reduce fees due to removing geographical boundaries that traditional <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> generally have. Lastly, online <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> often charge up front, instead of a traditional agent, who would normally charge nothing if the property is not sold ...|$|R
