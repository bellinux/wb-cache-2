5|$|In 1981 Icke {{became a}} sports {{presenter}} for the BBC's national programme, Newsnight, which {{had begun the}} previous year. Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on {{the first edition of}} the BBC's Breakfast Time, British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news for them until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week. In the summer of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted Grandstand, at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme. He also published his first book that year, It's a Tough Game, Son!, about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> into football.|$|E

25|$|Liberman et al. {{found that}} no 4-year-olds and only 17% of 5-year-olds {{were able to}} tap out the number of phonemes (individual sounds) in a word. 70% of 6-year-olds {{were able to do}} so. This might mean that {{children}} are aware of syllables as units of speech early on, while they don’t show awareness of individual phonemes until school age. Another explanation is that individual sounds do not easily translate into beats, which makes clapping individual phonemes a much more difficult task than clapping syllables. One reason why phoneme awareness gets much better once children start school is because learning to read provides a visual aid as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up words into their smaller constituents.|$|E
25|$|In season two, Wolf {{has been}} {{released}} on home detention. He {{has no intention of}} keeping to Cheryl's new rules on life. Judd is determined to tear him away from Cheryl, and attempts to entice Wolf to break his parole so that he is returned to prison. Wolf escapes home detention and Judd moves in, much to the horror of the children. Pascalle starts to date Pakistani doctor Bruce, Van finds {{the love of his life}} Aurora and Loretta starts to date much older man Hayden. Jethro shocks his mother when he reveals he is still a criminal and only doing law to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the law more successfully. The season ends on Wolf framing Judd for a robbery he committed.|$|E
25|$|The fourth-day of {{the battle}} was noted for the valour shown by Bhima. Bhishma {{commanded}} the Kaurava army to move on the offensive from the outset. While Abhimanyu {{was still in his}} mother's womb, Arjuna had taught Abhimanyu on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> and enter the chakra vyuha. But, before explaining how to exit the chakra Vyuha, Arjuna was interrupted by Krishna (other story: Abhimanyu's mother falls asleep while Arjuna was explaining her). Thus from birth, Abhimanyu only knew how to enter the Chakra vyuha but didn't know how to come out of it. When the Kauravas formed the chakravyuha, Abhimanyu entered it but was surrounded and attacked by a number of Kaurava princes. Arjuna joined the fray in aid of Abhimanyu. Bhima appeared on the scene with his mace aloft and started attacking the Kauravas. Duryodhana sent a huge force of elephants at Bhima. When Bhima saw the mass of elephants approaching, he got down from his chariot and attacked them single-handedly with his iron mace. They scattered and stampeded into the Kaurava forces killing many. Duryodhana ordered an all-out attack on Bhima. Bhima withstood all that was thrown at him and attacked Duryodhana's brothers, killing eight of them. Bhima was soon struck by an arrow on the chest and sat down in his chariot dazed.|$|E

25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers she knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and {{comes up with a}} plan to break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

[...] In 1974, Moon struck up a friendship with actor Oliver Reed while working on {{the film version of}} Tommy. Although Reed matched Moon drink for drink, he appeared on set the next morning ready to perform; Moon, on the other hand, would cost several hours of filming time. Reed later said that Moon [...] "showed me the way to insanity." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1970, Ramsey named Charlton in his squad of 22 for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. However, he favoured Labone over Charlton and only picked Charlton for his 35th and final England game in the 1–0 group win over Czechoslovakia at the Estadio Jalisco. England lost in the quarter finals to West Germany, and on the flight home, Charlton asked Ramsey not to be {{considered}} for international duty again. Charlton agonised over <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the news to Ramsey, and eventually said: [...] "Great times... absolute privilege... getting older... slowing down... not sure I am up to it any more... time to step down." [...] Ramsey listened, then agreed with him. [...] "Yes, I had reached that conclusion myself." ...|$|E

500|$|Lindsay Planer of AllMusic {{writes that}} Harrison carried out [...] "significant lyrical embellishments" [...] after debuting {{the song in}} 1968. On the {{released}} recording, he concludes with a statement on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the circle of repetition: [...] "When loss and gain {{and up and down}} / Become the same, then we stop going in circles." [...] Allison interprets this conclusion, and Harrison's worldview generally, as espousing the need to recognise the illusory nature of the material world, saying: [...] "All the multiplicity and diversity are in truth manifestations of the one hidden and divine reality … opposites are not opposites. To understand that up is down and that gain is loss is to be … on one's way to escaping from the material world." ...|$|E
500|$|Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter, with inner voiceover by Helen Mirren), decides {{she wants}} Artie (Kevin McHale) for her boyfriend, and asks {{him for a}} date. He later {{performs}} for her his idea for Will's proposal—a sexy mash-up of the songs [...] "Moves Like Jagger" [...] and [...] "Jumpin' Jack Flash"—but she informs him that their date also includes dinner. The glee club fears Artie will be raising Becky's hopes, but Artie tells them he had fun on the dinner date, {{and that they should}} examine their own prejudices about people with handicaps. However, when Becky tells Artie that she wants to have sex with him, he panics and asks Sue (Jane Lynch) for advice on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> off the relationship. She advises him to treat Becky like anyone else and tell her directly. Becky is disappointed, and is later comforted by Sue.|$|E
500|$|In 1933, Benchley {{returned}} to Hollywood, completing the short films Your Technocracy and Mine for Universal Pictures, <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Break</b> 90 at Croquet for RKO, and the lavish feature-length production China Seas for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, starring Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Wallace Beery, and Rosalind Russell; Benchley's character was slurring drunk throughout the movie. Upon completion, MGM invited Benchley {{to write and}} perform in a short production inspired by a Mellon Institute study on sleep commissioned by the Simmons Mattress Company. The resulting film, How to Sleep, was filmed in two days, and featured Benchley as both the narrator and sleeper, the latter a role Benchley claimed was [...] "not much of a strain, as [...] was in bed most of the time." [...] The film was well received in preview screenings, and promotions took over, with a still from the film being used in Simmons advertisements. The only group not pleased was the Mellon Institute, who did not approve of the studio mocking their study.|$|E
5000|$|... "Flow" [...] {{is defined}} as [...] "the rhythms and rhymes" [...] of a hip-hop song's lyrics and how they {{interact}} - the book <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Rap <b>breaks</b> flow down into rhyme, rhyme schemes, and rhythm (also known as cadence). 'Flow' is also sometimes {{used to refer to}} elements of the delivery (pitch, timbre, volume) as well, though often a distinction is made between the flow and the delivery.|$|R
5000|$|The book <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Rap <b>breaks</b> multisyllabic rhymes down extensively.

500|$|To explain <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> free of {{the prison}} and its institutions, Satin {{develops}} a [...] "psychocultural" [...] class analysis that reveals the existence of [...] "life-", [...] "thing-", and [...] "death-oriented" [...] classes. [...] According to Satin, life-oriented individuals constitute an emerging [...] "third force" [...] in post-industrial nations. [...] The third force is generating a [...] "prison-free" [...] consciousness consisting of androgynous attitudes, spirituality, multiple perspectives, a cooperative mentality, local-and-global identities, and an ecological outlook. [...] To transform prison society, Satin argues, the third force {{is going to have}} to launch an [...] "evolutionary movement" [...] to replace– or at least supplement– monolithic institutions with life-affirming, [...] "biolithic" [...] ones. [...] Some representative biolithic institutions are: deliberative democracy as an alternative to bureaucratic government, bicycles and mass transit as an alternative to the private automobile, and mediation as an alternative to attorney-centered law. [...] According to Satin, the third force will not have to overthrow capitalism, since Western civilization– not capitalism– is said to be responsible for the prison. [...] But the third force will want to foster a prison-free New Age capitalism through intelligent regulation and elimination of all subsidies.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after his}} {{departure}} from the British-Irish band One Direction, Zayn started working on his debut solo studio album; months later, on 22 July 2015, {{it was announced that}} Zayn was recording new music with record producer Malay Ho, after the producer posted a photo with the singer on his Instagram account. Malik's management team reached out to him because Zayn was a fan of his work with artists such as John Legend, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean. Later, Ho heard [...] "Pillowtalk" [...] and [...] "Fool for You" [...] before signing on to produce the record, and thought Malik's voice was [...] "incredible" [...] and agreed to work with him. The two recorded most of the songs in the Studio Suite at the Palms Casino Resort, inside Malik’s Beverly Hills Hotel room, {{and in the middle of}} the woods. As recalled by Ho, the work had a [...] "super creative, super free" [...] atmosphere. Zayn admitted that [...] "He’s just an amazing person. Like from the second I met him I just knew he was kind of different. He looks into every instrument in high detail and he understands <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> it down." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{complicated}} effects involved the [...] "Driller", a giant snake-like creature with an eel-like body and spinning rotator blades, knives and teeth. In Revenge of the Fallen, it took 72 hours per frame to fully render Devastator for the IMAX format, which is approximately a frame amount of 4,000. For the Driller, which required the entire render farm, {{it was up}} to 122 hours per frame. The most complex scene involved the Driller destroying a computer-generated skyscraper, which took 288 hours per frame. For said sequence, ILM relied on its internal proprietary physics simulation engine to depict the destruction of the building, which included breaking concrete floors and walls, windows, columns and pieces of office furnishings. ILM digital production supervisor Nigel Sumner explained: [...] "We did a lot of tests early on to figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the building apart exploring a lot of the procedural options. A building that's 70 feet tall – to go in and hand-score the geometry so when it fractures or falls apart – would be a time consuming laborious process. The floor of a building may be made of concrete. How does concrete fracture when it tears apart? The pillars would be made of a similar material but made of rebar or other engineering components. We'd look at how a building would blow apart and then choose the best tool to help achieve the properties of that during a simulation." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1977 Gulfton {{was a part}} of the Police District 18. During that year, out of {{the twenty}} police districts, it had the second highest rate of {{reported}} crimes after the North Side of Houston. Out of the districts it had the highest rates of fraud and suicide, the second highest rates in automobile theft, burglary, theft, and vandalism, the fourth highest rape rate, the fifth highest robbery rate, the eighth highest drug-related arrest and narcotic crime rate, and the 13th highest rate of murder, all of this was prior to the Hispanic immigration influx of the 1980s. Harry Hurt III of the Texas Monthly said that the density of the apartments and the conformity of the design made it easy for criminals to operate in the complexes; if a criminal figured out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> into one unit, he could break into all of them as they all shared the same design. In 1977 Hurt said that cocaine and quaaludes [...] "appear to be common" [...] in the apartments and that heroin [...] "is also found in the area occasionally, though not as frequently as in some other parts of town." [...] Hurt also stated that several area residents and ex-residents complained of theft. Around 1977, according to two accused rapists known in the area were the [...] "Blade" [...] rapist, the [...] "Beer Belly" [...] rapist, and the [...] "Jumper Cable" [...] rapist. Much of the crime in the 1970s was because Gulfton was predominantly inhabited with white single young men in their 20's.|$|E

Development economics needs the reform, not the IMF. He also notes that IMF loan conditions should be paired with other reforms—e.g., trade reform in developed nations, debt cancellation, and increased financial assistance for investments in basic infrastructure. IMF loan conditions cannot stand alone and produce change; they need to be partnered with other reforms or other conditions as applicable.|$|E
