5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical {{removal of a}} clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain. MRI scans, not as widely available, {{may be able to}} demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately, particularly with <b>ischaemic</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Binge {{drinking}} is {{also associated with}} strokes and sudden death. Binge drinking {{increases the risk of}} stroke by 10 times. In countries where binge {{drinking is}} commonplace, rates of sudden death on the weekend in young adults and middle aged people increase significantly. The withdrawal phase after an episode of binge drinking is particularly associated with <b>ischaemic</b> <b>stroke</b> as well as subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage in younger men. In individuals with an underlying cardiac disorder a binge on alcohol increases the risk of silent myocardial ischaemia as well as angina. Binge drinking has negative effects on metabolism, lipid profile, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, blood pressure and vascular tone and is associated with embolic stroke and acute myocardial infarction. Due to these risks experts believe that it is extremely important to warn people of the risks of binge drinking. Binge-drinking by people otherwise considered to be light drinkers is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems and [...] Binge drinking increases cardiovascular toxicity due to its adverse effects on the electrical conduction system of the heart and the process of atherothrombosis. Excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for an average of 80,000 deaths in the U.S. each year1 and $223.5 billion in economic costs in 2006.2 More than half of these deaths and three-quarters of the economic costs are due to binge drinking1 and 2 (≥4 drinks for women; ≥5 drinks for men, per occasion).|$|E

40|$|The stroke is {{the third}} cause of death and {{the main cause of}} {{disability}} in adults. 30 % of <b>ischaemic</b> <b>strokes</b> are cryptogenic. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common disease, mainly among older patients (pts) (9 % of people over 80). AF is an indipendent risk factor for stroke, and 15 % of <b>ischaemic</b> <b>strokes</b> are due to AF (25 % in older people). The cardioembolic risk is determinated by duration of AF and comorbilities: high risk pts are identified by risk score scales, in order to define who needs anticoagulation. Identification of pts with AF, symptomatic or not, is mandatory to prevent thromboembolism. Thrombo - embolic complications of asymptomatic AF (half of episodes are asymptomatic) are similar to symptomatic. Accuracy of methods for AF detection is higher if the monitored period is long, in particular for detection of asymptomatic AF. A careful identification of asymptomatic AF is mandatory to indicate the anticoagulation therapy in people with thromboembolic risk factor: in particular, pts with a previous stroke need to detect carefully potential arrhythmias in order to avoid relapses...|$|R

5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation.

Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, <b>ischaemic</b> <b>strokes,</b> and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes.

50|$|Five {{studies were}} {{published}} in 2010; three showed a weekend effect.

Similarly, in a larger US study (of 599,087 patients), Hoh et al., also found no difference in in-hospital mortality. Whereas Fang et al., in a Canadian study of 20,657 patients, reported that the all-cause 7-day fatality rate was higher in patients seen on weekends compared to weekdays (8.1% vs 7.0%), even after adjustment for age, sex, stroke severity, and comorbid conditions (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.25). Smith et al. carried out another (much larger) Canadian study with 1036 hospitals contributing 274,988 <b>ischaemic</b> <b>stroke</b> patients. Characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality were age, arrival mode (e.g., via ambulance vs other mode), history of atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, previous myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, history of dyslipidemia, current smoking, and weekend or night admission. In the Netherlands, Ogbu et al., studied 82,219 <b>ischaemic</b> <b>stroke</b> admissions to 115 hospitals.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Research {{over the}} last decade has {{recognized}} left ventricular hypertrophy as a risk factor for major cardiovascular events including stroke. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the best modality to quantify left ventricular hypertrophy, echocardiographic calculation of left ventricular mass index is a reasonable alternative. Methods We carried out a hospital based prospective study to identify the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, assessed using echocardiography, in patients presenting with <b>ischaemic</b> <b>strokes.</b> This is the first study that attempted to quantify this issue in a cohort of Sri Lankan patients. The study was carried out in the National Hospital of Sri Lanka over a period of 6 [*]months. Results A total of 55 patients (44 males, 80 %) (mean age: 62. 3, range: 48 – 82 [*]years) with <b>ischaemic</b> <b>strokes</b> were studied. Of them, only 38 could be mobilized to measure the height and weight to calculate the left ventricular mass index. Of the rest, only one person had the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Of the 38 patients evaluated, 29 (76. 3 %) had left ventricular hypertrophy while 19 (50 %) had severe hypertrophy. Discussion and conclusions The rates of left ventricular hypertrophy reported in similar studies in other countries vary between 25 - 62 %. Given the high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy reported in this study and its recognition as a risk factor for stroke recently, together with the availability of effective treatment for risk reduction, the cost effectiveness of population screening should be evaluated. Further studies are planned in this regard. </p...|$|R
