In the US, Eastman Kodak's Eastmancolor was the usual choice, but it was often re-branded with another trade name, such as [...] "WarnerColor", by the studio or the <b>film</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|E

50|$|A photo booth is a {{vending machine}} or modern kiosk that {{contains}} an automated, usually coin-operated, camera and <b>film</b> <b>processor.</b> Today, {{the vast majority}} of photo booths are digital. Traditionally, photo booths contain a seat or bench designed to seat the one or two patrons being photographed. The seat is typically surrounded by a curtain of some sort to allow for some privacy and help avoid outside interference during the photo session. Once the payment is made, the photo booth will take a series of photographs and the customer is then provided with prints. Older photo booth vending machines used film and involved the process of developing the film using liquid chemicals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Film {{radiography}} may {{be perceived}} as technology with environmental concerns, involving the application of chemicals and the discharge of drained waters with high silver levels. Ecological legislation concerning silver content of the wash water differs from country to country. GE Inspection Technologies now offers industrial radiographers several ways to address regulatory limits silver in drained waters. First, two brand new <b>film</b> <b>processors,</b> the Agfa NDT Si and M eco, are introduced to the NDT market. Both machines are equipped with Cascade Fixing Technology, which reduces silver content in the wash water and increases the ability to comply with stricter discharge standards. Next the new eco Film System is presented. This system is based on the new machines, specially adapted films and carefully developed new chemicals. Eco stands for ecological and economic performance. The customer can now process films in a very short cycle, saving money while increasing its ability to comply with environmental limits on discharges of silver into drained waters. This paper will also address other means to reduce the silver freight in the wash water...|$|R

While tasteful nudes are allowed in the main gallery, any sexually explicit photos are only allowed in the Xposed section.The Xposed section holds its own contests often with a kinky or suggestive theme.To be admitted as a member in the Xposed section you must submit a sexually explicit photo of yourself, and get three [...] "stamps of approval" [...] from current Xposed members. sometimes there is conflict when someone uploads porn and pretends it's a self-portrait, {{in order to avoid}} exposing themselves, it rarely works.|$|E
50|$|Smith had {{attended}} the Lumière programme in Leicester Square in March 1896 and {{spurred on by}} the films of Robert Paul, which played in Brighton for that summer season, he and local chemist James Williamson acquired a prototype cine cameras from local engineer Alfred Darling, who had begun to manufacture film equipment after carrying out repairs for Brighton-based film pioneer Esmé Collings. In 1897, with the technical assistance of Darling and chemicals purchased from Williamson, Smith turned the pump house into a film factory for developing and printing and developed into a successful commercial <b>film</b> <b>processor</b> as well as patenting a camera and projector system of his own.

5000|$|Due to Edison's lack of {{securing}} an international patent on his film inventions, similar devices were [...] "invented" [...] around the world. The Lumière brothers (Louis and Auguste Lumière), for example, created the Cinématographe in France. The Cinématographe {{proved to be}} a more portable and practical device than both of Edison's as it combined a camera, <b>film</b> <b>processor</b> and projector in one unit. In contrast to Edison's [...] "peepshow"-style kinetoscope, which only one person could watch through a viewer, the cinematograph allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple people. Their first film, Sortie de l'usine Lumière de Lyon, shot in 1894, is considered the first true motion picture. The invention of celluloid film, which was strong and flexible, greatly facilitated the making of motion pictures (although the celluloid was highly flammable and decayed quickly). This film was 35 mm wide and pulled using four sprocket holes, which became the industry standard. This doomed the cinematograph, which could only use film with just one sprocket hole.|$|E
5000|$|... 35 mm {{films are}} pulled, {{this means the}} end of the film is {{extracted}} from cassette. This can be done manually or by using a small machine that essentially uses tape to pull the film leader out of the cassette. In cases when {{the end of the}} film cannot be removed or if the film is damaged, the film can be removed using a dark bag or a dark box. A twin check number (a pair of stickers with a unique number) is put onto the film and the matching number onto the film processing envelope, so that after processing this film can be easily identified to the customers envelope. Films are spliced on the leader cards one or two at a time, to do this {{the end of the film}} is cut square, special chemical-resistant tape is used to attach the film to the leader card. The leader card(s) is/are then inserted into the <b>film</b> <b>processor</b> and are fed through the machine using sprockets in the card. The film goes through a developer, bleach, fix and stabilizer, then through a dryer. After the film is processed it is cut from the leader card and reunited with the processing envelope containing the customer details, and then from here the film goes forward for printing.|$|E

On 14 April 1985, a 10,000 sq ft 3-storied Sri Rama Nama block was opened by the then Vice President of India, R. Venkataraman. The same year, consultation on ENT, gynaecology, and psychiatry and weekly camps on ophthalmologic surgery were started. In June 1988, the hospital started expanding on an adjacent 1.7 acre land. On 14 September 1988, an in-patient wing with 20 beds and a major operation theatre were opened and general surgeries were conducted. On 11 October 1992, a 30,000 sq ft building with 100 beds was opened. In May 1993, maternity and childcare services began. In January 1995, the ophtholmic and geriatric blocks were opened and round-the-clock laboratory became operational. On 1 November 1997, Phaco emulsification unit was started. Elisa reader and ventilator facilities were added in 1998. On 12 February 1999, a haemodialysis unit and speech therapy and audiogram facility were opened. On 3 March 2000, a blood bank was opened.

40|$|Aim: A {{series of}} {{measurements}} in a pelvic anthropomorphic phantom was performed {{as part of}} the validation of the entire radiotherapy treatment chain. Two treatment planning calculation algorithms were used: the Pencil Beam (PB) and the Collapsed Cone (CC). The dose calculation algorithms of Radiotherapy Treatment Planning Systems (RTPS) were validated to ensure that the dose delivered to a treatment target was accurately predicted. An anthropomorphic phantom, designed and manufactured locally at the Pretoria Academic Hospital, was employed in this study. The phantom was fabricated with locally available materials as human tissue substitutes based on the attenuation coefficients, electron densities and effective atomic numbers. Materials: Pelvic anthropomorphic phantom, Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLD_ 100 chips), X-Omat V <b>film,</b> <b>film</b> <b>processors,</b> a densitometer and 6 MV and 15 MV linear accelerator photon beams with beam quality (TPR 20, 10) of 0. 674 and 0. 763 respectively. Results: Two treatment planning techniques were studied, a four field “box” and parallel opposed beams using a local cancer of the cervix protocol. Point doses calculated by the RTPS were compared with equivalent point dose values measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). Three dose regions emerged for the four field technique, those of low, intermediate and high dose gradient. The four field technique for 6 MV gave a dose deviation from - 4. 9...|$|R
