40|$|Sweat {{evaporation}} {{provides the}} primary avenue of heat loss during vigorous exercise in hot weather; therefore, sweat losses can be substantial. Besides containing water, sweat contains electrolytes that are lost through the excretion of bodily fluids. If not appropriately replaced, water and electrolyte imbalances (dehydration and hyponatremia) can develop and adversely affect and individual’s exercise performance and perhaps health (Sawka & Noakes, 2007). It {{is clear that}} hydration strategies have effect exercise performance in the heat. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the effects of different hydration methods on exercise performance in the heat. Method: 9 male participants ages 20 ± 2. 2 with a basic level of cycling ability completed a series of three 30 -minute sessions of cycling in 34 ˚C heat; followed by a 5 -minute average power test measuring average power output (APO) and total work done (TWD), during which they followed three hydration protocols. Participants <b>wore</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>suits</b> for the duration of the testing. A no water hydration protocol (NW); a forced drinking (F) protocol, participants consumed cups containing 200 ml on three occasions; and an ab libitum (AL) condition, participants consumed water when they chose. Baseline measures were taken pre and post sessions to determine hydration status; urine colour (UCOL), specific gravity (USG) and mass (M). Measures of thermal comfort (TC), thirst (T), rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and gut fullness (GF) were collected. Results: Exercise in heat influenced performance over the period of time by increasing measures such as heart rate, peripheral temperature, thermal comfort and gut fullness but caused no significant effect. The 5 -minute time trial found a significant decrease in performance; APO (p= 0. 0005), TWD (p= 0. 001). When partaking in the no water trial, performance was maintained in both the forced and ad libitum trials. No significant difference between groups was seen in any other measures, other than perception of thirst (p= 0. 055) during the 30 -minute sub maximal exercise. This indicates performance can be maintained through the ad libitum fluid ingestion protocol and still perform similarly to a participant maintaining a forced ingestion protocol, thus ad libitum is an effective hydration strategy...|$|R

40|$|A {{few years}} ago I was in Thailand to give a talk {{at a conference in}} Bangkok on the “post-Zionist {{performance}} of Israeliness ” among Israeli psytrancers in Thailand. I had the pleasure of meeting Robert A. Leonard, an American professor of forensic linguistics, {{who turned out to be}} an old friend of my doctoral advisor as well as a founding member and bassist of Sha Na Na, the rock and roll doo-wop group who (<b>wearing</b> satin gold <b>sweat</b> <b>suits)</b> opened for Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. When I asked Leonard “how does it feel when you’re making history?”, he responded that when people “make history”, they are usually too busy doing it to fully notice the magnitude of what they are achieving. Afterwards, what one recalls often overlaps and gets filtered through the authorized account of the event. This notion came to mind after reading Goa: 20 Years of Psychedelic Trance. This coffee table book, elegantly published and stylishly edited, ventures to capture and convey the romance and excitement that accompanied the expansions of Goa psytrance music and culture in the past few decades. Goa is an engaging book, lavished with original artwork and vivid photography depicting psychedelic trance events from across the globe and offering readers a portrayal of life in full HD. The forty-two chapters, over 500 color photos and a companion DVD featuring an “unreleased ” montage of Goa music and parties provide a well-informed account of the phenomenal Goa psychedelic trance social movement from its early days in Goa to its (r) evolutionary proliferation “right across the planet, going through every culture and social class as well as every spiritual, religious, political, sexual, musical, philosophical and economic orientation”(14). The period indicated in the sub-title (1990 – 2010) does not refer to specific dates or precise events, nor does it entirely account for ‘the story of psytrance’. Rather, during these two decades, the Goa movement underwent a process of formalizatio...|$|R

40|$|Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) {{athletes are}} weighed 24 h prior to competition. In order {{to compete in}} a lower weight class MMA athletes will often rapidly lose weight via dehydration. Despite the prevalence, there is {{currently}} no known published data examining the effects of acute dehydration on physiology and performance in mixed martial arts athletes. The present study aimed to examine: i) the effects of 5 % acute dehydration on performance (vertical jump, medicine ball throw, grip strength and repeated sled push) and physiology (body weight, haematocrit, urine specific gravity, serum osmolality and urine osmolality) of MMA athletes. A total of 14 MMA athletes between the ages of 18 and 40 y with at least 2 y of competitive experience were recruited. Participants performed a familiarisation session, followed by two experimental sessions including a control protocol (CONT) or a dehydration protocol (DHY) in a randomised order. During the DHY athletes cycled for 3 h in a heated chamber (40 ˚C and 30 % relative humidity) <b>wearing</b> a <b>sweat</b> <b>suit</b> in order to lose 5 % of their bodyweight (BW). Athletes then underwent a 3 h recovery period, during which they consumed fluids/food ad libitum. Athletes then performed a series of performance tests, including vertical jump, medicine ball throw, wrist grip and repeated sled push. A further 21 h recovery period was allowed before athletes performed the same tests. Prior to weight loss, immediately post weight loss, pre performance testing (3 h post weight loss) and 24 h post weight loss, urine and blood samples were collected and body weight was measured. A lower average speed during the repeat sled push (5. 65 ± 1. 3 km. h- 1) was observed 3 h post DHY compared with 3 h post CONT (6. 99 ± 0. 85 km. h- 1; P- 1) when compared with 24 h post CONT (7. 12 ± 0. 95 km. h- 1; P- 1 and 9. 14 ± 1. 1 km. h- 1 were observed 3 h post DHY/CONT and 8. 82 ± 1. 41 km. h- 1 and 9. 35 ± 1. 06 km. h- 1 24 h post DHY/CONT. A decreased time to fatigue and increased perceived exertion was also observed. The decrements in performance were observed at both 3 h and 24 h post DHY with the decrements still being present but not as large 24 h. When comparing measures of hydration in the DHY with CONT, significantly lower measures of hydration were observed 30 min post DHY and 3 h post DHY. None of the measured markers of hydration indicated athletes were dehydrated 24 h post DHY. The observations of this present study indicate that current weight loss practices in MMA and other combat sports may not be conducive to the best physical performance possible. Current practices should be reconsidered since performance was compromised even following 24 h of recovery. Future research should investigate possible physiological mechanisms behind the observed decrement in performance...|$|R

40|$|Background: To {{facilitate}} the monitoring {{of drug abuse}} by patients, a method was developed and validated for fast and highly selective screening for amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, methylphenidate, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, morphine, codeine, heroin, 6 -monoacteylmorphine, methadone, 2 -ethylidene- 1, 5 -dimethyl- 3, 3 -diphenylpyrrolidine, nicotine, and cotinine in PharmCheck sweat patches. The analysis of sweat patches would provide a noninvasive alternative matrix to urine or blood samples. Methods: The sweat patches were extracted during vigorous shaking for 10 minutes with 1. 5 mL of 20 mmol/L ammonium formate, pH 7, and methanol (50 %: 50 % vol/vol). The extracts were cleaned up by filtering through Whatman mini-Uniprep syringeless filter vials before injection. The method uses a single injection to detect and confirm all 16 drugs and metabolites within 9. 6 minutes. Results: The validated substances have a linear range of 3. 0 - 300 nanograms per patch, except for nicotine which has a linear range of 30 - 3750 nanograms per patch. Stabilities of all substances in <b>worn</b> <b>sweat</b> patches were validated {{at room temperature for}} 7 days and as a processed sample in the autosampler at 10 degrees C for 5 days. Only heroin was unstable, with high individual variability and reported bias and coefficient of variation of, respectively, - 30. 6 % and 22. 1 % in <b>worn</b> <b>sweat</b> patches at room temperature. The monitoring of ion ratios was added to the validation criteria. This resulted in analytical cutoff concentrations of 3. 0 and 60 nanograms per patch for nicotine with validated qualifier/quantifier ratios. All analytical cutoff concentrations were lower than the cutoff concentrations proposed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Conclusions: The method uses validated cutoff concentrations, qualifier/quantifier ratios, and a simple extraction without extensive sample treatment for the analysis of 16 drugs and metabolites with a runtime of 9. 6 minutes. This method was successfully applied for the analysis of 96 <b>worn</b> <b>sweat</b> patches to monitor patients for drug abuse. The results provided the physician or health-care professional with information about drug abuse and could be used to improve patient care with patient-specific therapy...|$|R
