5|$|The most noted of Bauer's {{pictures}} are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and gouache. When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed, since he needed both {{the speed of}} the aquarelle and the contrast and impasto that the gouache provided. These water-soluble, and <b>fast</b> <b>drying,</b> media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures until the last minute before deadline, something he was prone to do.|$|E
25|$|Painting {{either by}} roller or brush is more {{desirable}} for tight spaces; spray {{would be better}} for larger coating areas such as steel decks and waterfront applications. Flexible polyurethane coatings, like Durabak-M26 for example, can provide an anti-corrosive seal with a highly durable slip resistant membrane. Painted coatings are relatively easy to apply and have <b>fast</b> <b>drying</b> times although temperature and humidity may cause dry times to vary.|$|E
25|$|Hydration and {{hardening}} {{of concrete}} {{during the first}} three days is critical. Abnormally <b>fast</b> <b>drying</b> and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses {{at a time when it}} has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation. Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.|$|E

25|$|In October 2006 Dyson {{launched}} the Dyson Airblade, a fast hand dryer {{that uses a}} thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water, rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat.

60|$|It was dreadful! Jerry {{looked over}} to his house, {{of which he had}} once been so proud. He had built it with the doorway under water. He had felt {{perfectly}} safe there, because no one excepting Billy Mink or Little Joe Otter, who can swim under water, could reach him. Now the Smiling Pool had grown so small that Jerry's house wasn't in the water at all. Anybody who wanted to could get into it. There was the doorway plainly to be seen. Worse still, there was the secret entrance to the long tunnel leading to his castle under the roots of the Big Hickory-tree. That had been Jerry's most secret secret, and now there it was for all the world to see. And there were all the wonderful caves and holes and hiding-places under the bank which had been known only to Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter, because the openings had always been under water. Now anybody could find them, for they were plainly to be seen. And where had always been smiling, dimpling water, Jerry saw only mud. It was mud, mud, mud everywhere! The bulrushes, which had always grown with their feet in the water, now had them only in mud, and that was <b>fast</b> <b>drying</b> up. The lily-pads lay half curled up at the ends of their long stems, stretched out on the mud, and looked very, very sick. Jerry turned towards the Laughing Brook. There was just a little, teeny, weeny stream of water trickling down the middle of it, with here and there a tiny pool in which frightened trout and minnows were crowded. All the secrets of the Laughing Brook were exposed, just as were the secrets of the Smiling Pool. Jerry knew that if he wanted to find Billy Mink's hiding-places, all he need do would be to walk up the Laughing Brook and look.|$|E

50|$|Because of its {{elasticity}} {{and strength}} (stretching {{up to five}} times its length), spandex has been incorporated into {{a wide range of}} garments, especially in skin-tight garments. A benefit of spandex is its significant strength and elasticity and its ability to return to the original shape after stretching and <b>faster</b> <b>drying</b> than ordinary fabrics.|$|R
50|$|A further {{increase}} in the number of notes per sheet was realized in 1952 after breakthrough developments in the production of non-offset inks. Beginning in 1943, the BEP experimented with new inks that <b>dried</b> <b>faster,</b> therefore obviating the need to place tissues between sheets to prevent ink from offsetting to other sheets. The <b>faster</b> <b>drying</b> ink also enabled printed sheets of backs to be kept damp until the faces were printed, thereby reducing distortion caused by wetting, drying, and re-wetting of the paper (sheets needed to be dampened before each printing).|$|R
50|$|In recent years, water {{miscible}} {{oil paint}} {{has come to}} prominence and, to some extent, replaced traditional oil paint.

50|$|Rib chops from a pig are {{cut from}} the loin, or {{the back of the}} pig. A rib chop has a thin layer of fat around the outside. Since it is center cut, it {{contains}} little connective tissue, which makes it good for <b>fast,</b> <b>dry</b> heat methods, such as grilling and panbroiling. Unlike the loin chop, a rib chop is almost one muscle, which makes it cook more evenly.|$|R
5000|$|Application: Sansodor is {{a highly}} refined odorless mineral spirit {{that is used to}} dilute (thin) artists' oil paints and is also used to dilute oil media (linseed oils, alkyd media, etc.). To conform to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule in oil painting, Sansodor should be {{considered}} a [...] "lean" [...] medium (although, technically it is a thinner) and, therefore, used mostly in the initial layers of a painting. The addition of [...] "fat" [...] media like alkyd (<b>faster</b> <b>drying)</b> and linseed (slower drying) are progressively added into the subsequent layers of the painting in conformance to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule. Another guideline to follow is to use <b>faster</b> <b>drying</b> media (like alkyd) in the lower layers of the painting and use slower drying media (like linseed) in the later layers to ensure the bottom layers dry first. Although Sansodor can be used to reduce the viscosity of these media (thick media like stand oil and alkyds) to increase their flow, it should never exceed 50% of any oil paint medium mixture to ensure proper pigment bonding.|$|R
50|$|Before the 19th century, artists mixed {{their own}} paints, which {{allowed them to}} achieve the desired color and thickness, and to control the use of fillers, if any. While {{suitable}} media and raw pigments are available for the individual production of acrylic paint, hand mixing may not be practical because of the <b>fast</b> <b>drying</b> time and other technical issues.|$|E
50|$|Also, in the {{dispersion}} route (through evaporation {{of water}} and sintering of the PTFEs at 340°C) the mechanical pressing is skipped and the produced electrodes are very porous. With <b>fast</b> <b>drying</b> methods, cracks can form in the electrodes which can be penetrated by the liquid electrolyte. For applications with liquid electrolytes, such as the zinc-air battery or the alkaline fuel cell, the dry mixture method is used.|$|E

50|$|The {{quality of}} shea nuts and butter, {{both of which}} are also {{exported}} in large quantities from Burkina Faso, are basically dependent upon post harvest processing; in this process parboiling of shea nuts is carried out {{at the beginning of the}} season as it the eliminates germination and helps in <b>faster</b> <b>drying.</b> Better quality is obtained by sun-drying of the shea nut since smoking the nuts over a fire contaminates it with hydrocarbons.|$|R
50|$|Higher spin speeds, {{along with}} larger tub diameters, remove more water, leading to <b>faster</b> <b>drying.</b> If a heated {{clothes-dryer}} is used after the wash and spin, energy use is reduced if more {{water has been}} removed from clothes. However, faster spinning can crease clothes more. Also, mechanical wear on bearings increases rapidly with rotational speed, reducing life. Early machines would spin at only 300 rpm and, because of lack of any mechanical suspension, would often shake and vibrate.|$|R
