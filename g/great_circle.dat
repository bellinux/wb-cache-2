5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Circle</b> was {{surrounded}} by a ditch and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the north east and south west. There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the <b>Great</b> <b>Circle</b> is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} {{flight path}} was a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> route, {{which would have}} taken them across the English Channel, over the southwestern part of England and Ireland, across the Atlantic to Newfoundland, then south over Nova Scotia, to Boston, and finally to a water landing in New York.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{a number}} of other books and pamphlets, Wright {{translated}} John Napier's pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of logarithms from Latin into English. This was published after Wright's death as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius; Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland; and the English mathematician Richard Norwood, who calculated the length of a degree on a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> of the earth using a method proposed by Wright.|$|E
50|$|Projected into a sphere, {{the edges}} of a disdyakis triacontahedron define 15 <b>great</b> <b>circles.</b> Buckminster Fuller used these 15 <b>great</b> <b>circles,</b> along with 10 and 6 others in two other polyhedra to define his 31 <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> of the spherical icosahedron.|$|R
50|$|The 25 <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> {{can be seen}} in 3 sets: 12, 9, and 4, each {{representing}} {{edges of}} a polyhedron projected onto a sphere. Nine <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> represent the edges of a disdyakis dodecahedron, the dual of a truncated cuboctahedron. Four more <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> represent the edges of an cuboctahedron, and the last twelve <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> connect edge-centers of the octahedron to centers of other triangles.|$|R
50|$|The icosidodecahedron has 6 central decagons. Projected into a sphere, {{they define}} 6 <b>great</b> <b>circles.</b> Buckminster Fuller used these 6 <b>great</b> <b>circles,</b> along with 15 and 10 others {{in two other}} polyhedra to define his 31 <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> of the spherical icosahedron.|$|R
5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E
5|$|From the 8th century AD onward, astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century onward they were using spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation is essentially {{the conversion of the}} equatorial polar coordinates of Mecca (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its polar coordinates (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis is the line through the location and its antipodal point.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> route between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading {{to compensate for}} wind. Other modes will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the autopilot. Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{edges of}} this model form 10 central hexagons, and {{projected}} onto a sphere, represent 10 <b>great</b> <b>circles.</b> Buckminster Fuller these 10 <b>great</b> <b>circles,</b> along with 15 and 6 more from two other models to create the 31 <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> of the spherical icosahedron.|$|R
50|$|The 31 <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> {{can be seen}} in 3 sets: 15, 10, and 6, each {{representing}} {{edges of}} a polyhedron projected onto a sphere. Fifteen <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> represent the edges of a disdyakis triacontahedron, the dual of a truncated icosidodecahedron. Six more <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> represent the edges of an icosidodecahedron, and the last ten <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> come from the edges of the uniform star dodecadodecahedron, making pentagrams with vertices at the edge centers of the icosahedron.|$|R

5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a <b>great</b> <b>circle.</b> The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E
5|$|There are 58 {{scheduled}} monuments in Bath and North East Somerset. Some of {{the oldest}} are Neolithic including the Stanton Drew stone circles and several tumuli. The <b>Great</b> <b>Circle</b> at Stanton Drew {{is one of the}} largest Neolithic monuments ever built, and the second largest stone circle in Britain (after Avebury). The date of construction is not known but is thought to be between 3000 and 2000 BCE which places it in the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age. There are also several Iron Age hillforts such as Maes Knoll, which was later incorporated into the medieval Wansdyke, a defensive earthwork, several sections of which are included in this list. The Romano-British period is represented with several sites, most notably the Roman Baths and city walls in Bath. More recent sites include several bridges which date from the Middle Ages to the Palladian bridge in Prior Park Landscape Garden and Dundas Aqueduct which was built in 1805 which is the most recent site included in the list. The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the English Heritage data sheets.|$|E

25|$|The Gauss map of any convex {{polyhedron}} maps each {{face of the}} polygon to a point on the unit sphere, and maps each edge of the polygon separating a pair of faces to a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> arc connecting the corresponding two points. In {{the case of a}} zonohedron, the edges surrounding each face can be grouped into pairs of parallel edges, and when translated via the Gauss map any such pair becomes a pair of contiguous segments on the same <b>great</b> <b>circle.</b> Thus, the edges of the zonohedron can be grouped into zones of parallel edges, which correspond to the segments of a common <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> on the Gauss map, and the 1-skeleton of the zonohedron can be viewed as the planar dual graph to an arrangement of great circles on the sphere. Conversely any arrangement of great circles may be formed from the Gauss map of a zonohedron generated by vectors perpendicular to the planes through the circles.|$|E
