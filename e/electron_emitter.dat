30|$|However, {{it should}} be noted that {{cytotoxicity}} of Auger <b>electron</b> <b>emitters,</b> like other forms of radiation, can be influenced by the bystander effect, which is independent of the subcellular localization site of the radionuclide.

5000|$|The {{electron}} capture detector {{is used for}} detecting electron-absorbing components (high electronegativity) such as halogenated compounds in the output stream of a gas chromatograph. The ECD uses a radioactive beta particle (<b>electron)</b> <b>emitter</b> {{in conjunction with a}} so-called makeup gas flowing through the detector chamber. The <b>electron</b> <b>emitter</b> typically consists of a metal foil holding 10 millicuries (370 MBq) of the radionuclide [...] Usually, nitrogen is used as makeup gas, because it exhibits a low excitation energy, so it is easy to remove an electron from a nitrogen molecule. The electrons emitted from the <b>electron</b> <b>emitter</b> collide with the molecules of the makeup gas, resulting in many more free electrons. The electrons are accelerated towards a positively charged anode, generating a current. There is therefore always a background signal present in the chromatogram. As the sample is carried into the detector by the carrier gas, electron-absorbing analyte molecules capture electrons and thereby reduce the current between the collector anode and a cathode. The analyte concentration is thus proportional to the degree of {{electron capture}}. ECD detectors are particularly sensitive to halogens, organometallic compounds, nitriles, or nitro compounds.|$|E

50|$|Another {{solution}} to the indexing problem was introduced by David Goodman of New York University. He replaced the <b>electron</b> <b>emitter</b> of the Philco design with a new material that gave off x-rays. These were received by scintillators {{at the back of}} the tube, beside the guns. As the light speed was independent of power and essentially instant compared to the timing needed for the indexing, the new design allowed the elimination of the complex timing circuitry of the original design.|$|E
50|$|Cyclotron {{particle}} accelerators, linear {{particle accelerators}}, and Synchrotron particle accelerators can accelerate positively charged hydrogen ions until their velocity approaches {{the speed of}} light, and each individual ion has a kinetic energy range of 100 MeV to 1000 MeV or more. Then the resulting high energy protons can capture electrons from <b>electron</b> <b>emitter</b> electrodes, and be thus electrically neutralized. This creates an electrically neutral beam of high energy hydrogen atoms, that can proceed {{in a straight line}} at near the speed of light to smash into its target and damage it.|$|E
50|$|In {{electron}} emission devices, especially electron guns, the thermionic <b>electron</b> <b>emitter</b> will be biased negative relative to its surroundings.

40|$|We {{demonstrated}} previously {{that human}} B-cell lymphomas were effectively and specifically killed in vitro by an antibody to CD 74 (LL 1) linked to 111 In or other Auger <b>electron</b> <b>emitters.</b> This study {{was intended to}} more accurately compare the potency and specificity of 3 Auger <b>electron</b> <b>emitters,</b> 111 In, 67 Ga, and 125 I, and to evaluate b-particle emitters, 131 I and 90 Y. The unique property of LL 1 is its high level of intracellular uptake. Methods: Raji B-lymphoma cells were incubated with serial dilutions of the radiolabeled Abs for 2 d and then monitored for cell growth by 2 assays: a cell counting assay and a clonogenic assay. The uptake of radioactivity per cell was monitored at various time points, and the radiation dose was calculated using published S values for radioactivity located in the cytoplasm. Both specific and nonspecific toxicity were evaluated. Results: The b-particle emitters had considerably higher levels of nonspecific toxicity than the Auger <b>electron</b> <b>emitters,</b> but both 131 I and 90 Y, and particularly 131 I, still had high levels of specificity. Both of these results were consistent with dosimetry calculations. Relative to the delivered disintegrations per cell, 131 I and 67 Ga were the most potent of the radionuclides tested, with 125 I and 111 In being significantly weaker and 90 Y being intermediate. The high potency of 67 Ga, together with its low nonspecific toxicity, caused this radionuclide to have the highest specificity index. Conclusion: When deliv-ered by Ab LL 1, both Auger <b>electron</b> and b-particle <b>emitters</b> can produce specific and effective toxicity. The choice of the optimal radionuclide for therapy may depend on the ease and efficiency of labeling, the specific activity obtained, {{the nature of the}} tumor being targeted, and other factors, but the high specificity indices of the Auger <b>electron</b> <b>emitters</b> may be an advantage...|$|R
40|$|Diamond-based low-work {{function}} thermionic <b>electron</b> <b>emitters</b> are in {{high demand}} for applications ranging from electron guns and space thrusters to electrical energy converters. A key requirement of such diamond-based electron sources is hydrogen termination of the surfaces which can significantly reduce the emission barrier. However, at high temperatures (≤ 600 °C), terminated hydrogen begins to desorb causing degradation in thermionic emission performance. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine low-pressure hydrogen operating environments as a means to overcome this high-temperature performance limitation by enabling increased thermionic emission currents with improved stability at temperatures ≤ 600 °C. A series of isothermal and isobaric experiments were performed in both nitrogen and hydrogen gas environments to determine the performance enhancement. Diamond <b>electron</b> <b>emitters</b> in both the as-grown and hydrogenated states were characterized at temperatures of 600, 625, and 650 °C. An increase in thermionic emission current over vacuum operation was observed following the introduction of hydrogen. Upon evacuation of hydrogen to vacuum, the emission current decreased back to baseline levels. Further experiments in gas environments at a constant pressure (~ 5. 5 [*]×[*] 10 − 6 [*]Torr) were conducted at temperatures ranging from 700 to 900 °C. It was observed that the hydrogen environment promoted increased emission current while also enabling the diamond <b>electron</b> <b>emitters</b> to stably emit at increased temperatures compared with vacuum operation. Analogous experiments using nitrogen environments did not show any measurable performance enhancements, thus verifying that hydrogen is responsible for the observed effect.

5000|$|However, {{it is more}} {{difficult}} for the opposite (negative) end of the tether to eject free electrons or to collect positive ions from the plasma. It is plausible that, by using a very large collection area {{at one end of the}} tether, enough ions can be collected to permit significant current through the plasma. This was demonstrated during the Shuttle orbiter's TSS-1R mission, when the shuttle itself was used as a large plasma contactor to provide over an ampere of current. Improved methods include creating an <b>electron</b> <b>emitter,</b> such as a thermionic cathode, plasma cathode, plasma contactor, or field electron emission device.

50|$|An {{electrodynamic}} tether {{is attached}} to an object, the tether being oriented {{at an angle to}} the local vertical between the object and a planet with a magnetic field. The tether's far end can be left bare, making electrical contact with the ionosphere. When the tether intersects the planet's magnetic field, it generates a current, and thereby converts some of the orbiting body's kinetic energy to electrical energy. Functionally, electrons flow from the space plasma into the conductive tether, are passed through a resistive load in a control unit and are emitted into the space plasma by an <b>electron</b> <b>emitter</b> as free electrons. As a result of this process, an electrodynamic force acts on the tether and attached object, slowing their orbital motion. In a loose sense, the process can be likened to a conventional windmill- the drag force of a resistive medium(air or, in this case, the magnetosphere) is used to convert the kinetic energy of relative motion(wind, or the satellite's momentum) into electricity. In principle, compact high-current tether power generators are possible and, with basic hardware, tens, hundreds, and thousands of kilowatts appears to be attainable.|$|E

His first assignment at the T J Watson Research laboratory was to find a long life <b>electron</b> <b>emitter</b> to replace the tungsten wire filaments used in electron microscopes at the time. IBM had built the first billion bit computer store using an electron beam to write on photographic film and the relatively short lifetime of the tungsten filament sources was not acceptable. To solve this problem he developed the first practical electron guns that used LaB6 emitters. These emitters not only solved the lifetime problem, but also provided higher electron brightness than tungsten filaments, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s he built two new SEMs for examining surfaces that took advantage of this and produced higher resolution than previous SEMs (3 nm in the secondary electron surface mode) and then a short focal length instrument with 0.5 nm beam size. He used the second SEM to examine thin samples in the transmission mode and to examine solid samples using the high energy electron scattered {{from the surface of the}} sample, the electrons that had been called 'low-loss electrons by Oliver C Wells who had proposed their use in the SEM. Initially this high resolution low-loss mode was used to examine bacteriophage and blood cells in collaboration with researchers at NYU, and at the Veteran's Administration Hospital in New Jersey however, the bulk of his work was devoted to using the microscopes as tools to scribe things using the lithography techniques that were becoming familiar for making silicon chips.
