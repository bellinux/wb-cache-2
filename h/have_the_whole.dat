CCI co-counsellors may and do <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> range of personal relationships with other co-counsellors. However, new co-counsellors are encouraged not to develop new non-co-counselling relationships with other co-counsellors until they have more experience and experienced co-counsellors will often have people with whom they only have a co-counselling relationship. Teachers of co-counselling are strongly discouraged from having sexual relationships with people they have taught.|$|E

25|$|Operation of a {{staircase}} is more involved than a flight. Inexperienced boaters may find operating staircase locks difficult. The key worries (apart from simply being paralysed with indecision) are either sending down more water than the lower chambers can cope with (flooding the towpath, or sending a wave along the canal) or completely emptying an intermediate chamber (although {{this shows that}} {{a staircase}} lock {{can be used as}} an emergency dry dock).

It is unknown whether they are mourning over it and showing sympathy, or are just curious and investigating the dead body. Elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains. An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary Life on Earth shows this in detail - The elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, pause for several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.|$|E
500|$|New York's {{economy was}} tied to the South; by 1822 nearly half of its exports were cotton shipments. In addition, upstate textile mills {{processed}} cotton in manufacturing. New York had such strong business connections to the South that on January 7, 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood, a Democrat, called on the city's Board of Aldermen to [...] "declare the city's independence from Albany and from Washington"; he said it [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> and united support of the Southern States."

Three months later, this incredibly impressive screenplay showed up on our desks." [...] Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese. Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he was wary of copying [...] "the horror of biopics," [...] where there is simply an important event after important event.

[...] A few weeks later, he wrote to Maund again: with the royal charter in place, [...] "whatever [...] does now will not affect {{the fact that when}} there is a white occupation of the country our concession will come into force provided the English and not Boers get the country". On 29 October 1889, nearly a year to the day after the signing of the Rudd Concession, Rhodes's chartered company, the British South Africa Company, was officially granted its royal charter by Queen Victoria. The concession's legitimacy was now safeguarded by the charter and, by extension, the British Crown, making it practically unassailable.|$|E

Hunter claimed the additions made the video feel more realistic. For the video's primary filming locations, Carey had Louis Vuitton's flagship store on Champs-Élysées, {{one of the most}} prestigious avenues in Paris, shut down. When describing the experience filming in the boutique, Carey explained: [...] "Obviously, being able to take your pick of anything in the store and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> store shut down for you is every girl's dream.

500|$|Karen is {{voiced by}} American actress Jill Talley, {{who is also}} the wife of SpongeBob's voice actor, Tom Kenny. Talley uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Whenever Karen talks, her voice is mixed over {{electronic}} sound effects by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound. Her voice, which was more monotonous in earlier episodes, has been described as [...] "deadpan" [...] by the Associated Press. Some of Karen's conversations with Plankton are improvised between Talley and Lawrence. The latter described this improvisation as one of his [...] "favorite part of the voice over" [...] in 2009. He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, [...] "I always enjoy the back-and-forth. [...] start to actually overlap so much talking to each other that [...] have to tell us, 'hey, stop doing that, separate what you're saying!'" [...] Lawrence also feels that voicing the characters for so long has built a close relationship between the two actors.

500|$|While {{writing and}} {{recording}} for her debut album, Stefani cited her major influences as Club Nouveau, Lisa Lisa, Prince, New Order, The Cure and early Madonna and advised the producers and writers {{that she wanted}} a similar sound for the album. According to MTV's Jennifer Vineyard, musician and songwriter Linda Perry [...] "put Gwen in a headlock" [...] during a party after the Grammys and told her they could make beautiful music together"; however, Stefani felt scared and insecure about working with Perry. While recording at Perry's house, Stefani was initially insecure about her writing process and [...] "would go into another room to try to write some lyrics, {{and when she came}} back, Perry would already <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> song nailed." [...] After a writing session where [...] "What You Waiting For?" [...] was created, Stefani became less insecure and felt more comfortable when making songs. After working with other musicians, Stefani and Perry worked together on [...] "The Real Thing". On October 3, 2005, Interscope Records released the song as a promotional single exclusively in the Philippines. The label released a CD single, which featured the album version and a remix by Wendy & Lisa of the song.|$|E

500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E
