Osmoregulants were extracted using 80 % ethanol and separated on an NH 2 column using 0. 1 % formic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. Retention time repeatability was 0. 85, 1. 50, and 0. 93 % for mannitol, betaine and proline, respectively. The limit of detection (μmol) was 1. 43 × 10 - 4, 7. 81 × 10 - 5 and 1. 08 × 10 - 4 for mannitol, betaine and proline, respectively.

High yields of EGF in large amounts (10 mg) can be isolated reliably from the acid extract of the glands {{in less than}} 4 hr. The reverse-phase HPLC techniques used to purify the EGF initially yielded {{what appeared to be}} a single homogeneous EGF molecule. However, ion pairing reagents (e. g., <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid)</b> altered the chromatographic properties, revealing two distinct species: EGF-alpha and EGF-beta.

Separation of the iron(III) complexes was obtained using a polystyrene-divinylbenzene stationary phase. The retention and responses of ferrioxamine and ferrichrome were optimal when a gradient elution program with methanol and 0. 1 % (v/v) formic acid as the mobile phases was used. These conditions were also suitable for the retention and separation of the uncomplexed ligands. Retention of iron(III) rhodotoluate was improved when formic acid was replaced by the ion-pairing reagent <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 1 %).

40|$|Periodate {{oxidation}} of {{the toxins}} responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) yields fluorescent {{products that are}} useful for trace analysis by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Some toxins are oxidized to the same product, while others are transformed to a mixture of products; in ail cases, the products are too unstable to be isolated preparatively. A mobile phase containing <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> as an ion-pair agent was developed to improve compatibility with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis. Several LC/MS techniques were investigated: chemical ionization with the moving belt interface, atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization, thermospray, continuous-flow fast-atom bombardment, and ion-spray. Only LC/ion-spray MS was able to provide spectra of the oxidized products.

40|$|Soil {{contamination}} {{is still}} poorly understood and modeled {{in part because}} of the difficulties of looking inside the 'black box' constituted by soils. Here, we investigated the application of a recently developed 1 H NMR technique to 19 F NMR relaxometry experiments and utilized the results as inputs for an existing model. This novel approach yields 19 F T 2 NMR relaxation values of any fluorinated contaminant, which are among the most dangerous contaminants, allowing us to noninvasively and directly monitor their fate in soils. Using this protocol, we quantified the amount of a fluorinated xenobiotic (<b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> HFBA) in three different environments in soil aggregate packings and monitored contaminant exchange dynamics between these compartments. A model computing HFBA partition dynamics between different soil compartments showed that these three environments corresponded to HFBA in solution (i) between and (ii) inside the soil aggregates and (iii) to HFBA adsorbed to (or strongly interacting with) the soil constituents. In addition to providing a straightforward way of determining the sorption kinetics of any fluorinated contaminant, this work also highlights the strengths of a combined experimental-modeling approach to unambiguously understand experimental data and more generally to study contaminant fate in soils...|$|E

Extracts were subjected to reversed-phase high-pressure {{liquid chromatography}} (h. p. l. c.) employing solvent systems composed of aqueous acetonitrile containing trifluoroacetic acid or <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> as hydrophobic ion-pairing reagents. The volatile solvents facilitated the radioimmunoassay, bioassay in vitro and amino acid analysis of column fractions and permitted monitoring for u. v. absorbance at 210 nm. Isolated glandular parathyrin was found to be homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulphate/urea/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, to have an amino acid composition conforming to that of human parathyrin-(1 [...] 84) -tetraoctacontapeptide and to be bioactive in both renal adenylate cyclase and cytochemical bioassays. ODS-silica extraction permitted examination of large plasms samples by reversed-phase h. p. l. c., facilitating the resolution of the various circulating molecular forms of parathyrin according to their hydrophobic character.

Endogenously formed acrolein congeners are considered {{to play an important}} role in carcinogenesis. Our studies have demonstrated that acrolein congeners react with DNA components and form adducts with the guanine moiety. We have identified and characterized cyclic 1,N 2 -deoxyguanosine adducts, cyclic 7, 8 -guanine adducts, linear 7 -guanine adducts, 1,N 2, 7, 8 -bis-cyclic adducts, and 1,N 2 -cyclic, 7 -linear bis adducts. Both the reactivity of the acroleins toward nucleosides and their mutagenicity in S. typhimurium TA 100 decrease with increasing degree of alkyl substitution. Adducts are now available as reference substances for developing sensitive detection methods. Of the biomonitoring methods investigated for allylic and benzyl compounds, the detection of cysteine and histidine adducts isolated from hemoglobin seems to be the most sensitive. Gas chromatography with electron capture detection of <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives allows a detection limit in the femtomole range, HPLC-fluorescence detection of O-phthalic dialdehyde derivatives allows a limit in the picomole range, and detection of 9 -fluorenylmethyl-chlorofomiate derivatives allows a limit in the femtomole range...|$|E

Here, we present two methods based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for reliable measurement of water-soluble metabolites involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, {{as well as several}} other metabolites that reflect the metabolic status of the parasite including amino acids, carboxylic acids, energy-related carbohydrates, and nucleotides. A total of 35 compounds was quantified. In the first method, polar compounds were retained by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (amino column) and detected in negative mode using succinic acid- 13 C 4 and fluorovaline as internal standards.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{strategy is}} described for analyzing quaternary ammonium neuromuscular blocking agents {{in a wide}} variety of biological specimens in a forensic setting. Neuromuscular blocking agents such as succinylcholine, pancuronium, and tubocurarine, often used as paralytic agents during surgery, are occasionally suspected as paralytic poisoning agents involved in suspected homicide and suicide cases. Because suspicion in such cases can develop slowly, the age, nature, and quality of available specimens varies greatly. The compounds are challenging analytically because of their simultaneous precharged yet lipophilic character. An analytical strategy has been devised for extracting these compounds from complex matrices using a combination of a modified Bligh and Dyer liquid-liquid extraction (used in reverse) followed by reverse-phase ion pairing solid-phase extraction using <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> as an ion pairing reagent. Final analysis is by LC-MS/MS using a tandem quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time of flight instrument (Q-TOF) with repetitive product ion scanning at high resolution. Native and spiked specimens are compared for both quantitative and especially qualitative purposes. The method has been applied to a wide variety of fluid and tissue specimen types, including numerous specimens from exhumation autopsies. For most specimens, detection limits are in the 2 to 10 ng/g range. Succinylmonocholine has been demonstrated to be present at low levels in normal posthumous kidney and liver.

Endogenous carnitine is found in its free form or esterified with acyl groups of several chain lengths. Quantification of carnitine and acylcarnitines is of particular interest for screening for research and metabolic disorders. We developed a method with online solid-phase extraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to quantify carnitine and three acylcarnitines with different polarity (acetylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine, and palmitoylcarnitine). Plasma samples were deproteinized with methanol, loaded on a cation exchange trapping column and separated on a reversed-phase C 8 column using <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> as an ion-pairing reagent. Considering the endogenous nature of the analytes, we quantified with the standard addition method and with external deuterated standards. Solid-phase extraction and separation were achieved within 8  min. Recoveries of carnitine and acylcarnitines were between 98 and 105  %. Both quantification methods were equally accurate (all values within 84 to 116  % of target concentrations) and precise (day-to-day variation of less than 18  %) for all carnitine species and concentrations analyzed. The method was used successfully for determination of carnitine and acylcarnitines in different human samples. In conclusion, we present a method for simultaneous quantification of carnitine and acylcarnitines with a rapid sample work-up. This approach requires small sample volumes and a short analysis time, and it can be applied for the determination of other acylcarnitines than the acylcarnitines tested.

Despite the numerous analytical methods published, {{the demand for}} a simple, robust and cheap technique for their analysis still persists. Here, reversed phase (RP) liquid chromatography (LC) with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C 4 D) was explored {{for the first time}} as a possible method for separation and detection of various aminoglycoside (AMG) antibiotics which were taken as typical test compounds: tobramycin (TOB), spectinomycin, streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin A and kanamycin B. C 4 D was performed using a commercially available as well as a laboratory made cell. As ion-pairing reagents (IPR) four perfluorinated carboxylic acids were used: pentafluoropropionic acid, <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> nonafluoropentanoic acid (NFPA) and pentadecafluorooctanoic acid (PDFOA). 0. 125 mM NFPA-acetonitrile (ACN) (90 : 10) or 0. 125 mM PDFOA-ACN (70 : 30) as mobile phases were suitable to detect TOB with reasonable retention times. However, NFPA was preferred for practical reasons. Its applicable concentration range in the mobile phase was strongly restricted by loss of chromatographic performance at lower levels and excessive background conductivity at higher levels. Overall repeatability and robustness of the method were rather poor which was explained by the relatively low IPR levels. Selectivity between the tested AMGs was mainly influenced by the number of protonated amino groups per molecule making it impossible to separate compounds of equal net charges. Problems encountered with gradient elution, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and separation at high pH without IPRs are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Polyamines are key {{regulators}} of cell {{development and}} many plant responses to environmental challenges, however, their functions still remain unclear in complex interactions with other hormones and in biotic or abiotic stress. This {{lack of knowledge}} derives from the difficulties on measuring natural polyamines in plants. Here, we present a fast multiresidue method for putrescine (Put), 1, 3 -diaminopropane (DAP), l-ornithine, spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spn) measurements in plant samples. Polyamine determination {{is based on a}} perchloric acid extraction followed by a simple filtration procedure without previous derivatization. Polyamines are resolved by HPLC in a C 18 common column and quantified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. 13 C 4 -putrescine and 1, 7 -diaminoheptane standards were added prior to sample extraction to achieve an accurate quantification in a single run. Chromatography of polyamines presents poor retention when reverse phase C 18 common columns are used, because they are very polar compounds and contain several positive charges. To circumvent this problem ionic pairing technique has been used successfully with <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (HFBA) at 1 mM in the aqueous phase and 25 mM in the sample. Improvement of the signal depleted by HFBA has been achieved by adding 1 % of propionic acid to the aqueous and organic eluents. All together, gives a method accurate enough to determine polyamines in plants. To demonstrate the usefulness of the method it has been validated in Arabidopsis thaliana samples and polyamines have been determined in several genotypes that over express (35 S::ADC 2 line 3. 6) or are disrupted (adc 2) in the Arginine Decarboxylase 2 (ADC 2) gene. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|To this end, Tannu {{and colleagues}} used {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) 1 PAGE-based proteomic methods {{to compare the}} levels of soluble proteins in mitotic and fully differentiated C 2 C 12 mouse myoblasts (11). Although several notable alterations in protein abundance were uncovered, overall the proteome adaptations detected were surprisingly slight and less dynamic than widely assumed. Given that gel-based methods have limited sensitivity, modest overall dynamic range, and substantive detection biases (12, 13), {{it is likely that}} many of the proteome perturbations associated with the muscle differentiation program went undetected, particularly those associated with lower abundance proteins. Recent advances in alternative gel-free proteome profiling methods combining LC with ultrasensitive tandem MS-based peptide sequencing (LC-MS) offer a complementary and likely more effective experimental approach for examining global changes in protein expression as a function of development (14, 15). Here we report the results of an extensive LC-MSbased shotgun profiling analysis of alterations in protein expression in differentiating C 2 C 12 myoblasts {{as a function of the}} myogenic program. Striking changes were detected in the abundance of hundreds of proteins linked to cell adhesion, intracellular signaling, gene expression, metabolism, and muscle contraction, consistent with a substantive and highly dynamic biochemical remodeling of cell function. These data were broadly consistent with the predictions reported in a recent microarray-based study of myogenic gene expression by Tomczak et al.

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of the charged aerosol detector (CAD) was investigated using a diverse set of 29 solutes, including acids, bases and neutrals, over a range of mobile phase compositions, {{particularly with regard to}} its suitability for use in hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). Flow injection analysis was employed as a rapid method to study detector performance. CAD response was ‘quasi-universal’, strong signals were observed for compounds that have low volatility at typical operating (room) temperature. For relatively involatile solutes, response was reasonably independent of solute chemistry, giving variation of 12 – 18 % RSD from buffered 95 % ACN (HILIC) to 10 % ACN (RP). Somewhat higher response was obtained for basic compared with neutral solutes. For cationic basic solutes, use of anionic reagents of increasing size in the mobile phase (formic, trifluoroacetic and <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid)</b> produced somewhat increased detector response, suggesting that salt formation with these reagents is contributory. However, the increase was not stoichiometric, pointing to a complex mechanism. In general, CAD response increased as the concentration of acetonitrile in the mobile phase was increased from highly aqueous (10 % ACN) to values typical in the HILIC range (80 – 95 % ACN), with signal to noise ratios about four times higher than those for the RP range. The response of the CAD is non-linear. Equations describing aerosol formation cannot entirely explain the shape of the plots. Limits of detection (determined with a column for solutes of low k) under HILIC conditions were of the order of 1 – 3 ng on column, which compares favourably with other universal detectors. CAD response to inorganic anions allows observation of the independent movement through the column of the cationic and anionic constituents of basic drugs, which appear to be accompanied by mobile phase counterions, even at quite high solute concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} here {{deals with the}} development of a quantitative tool for the determination of the quaternary ammonium anticholinergic glycopyrrolate in human plasma samples. Mepenzolate was used as an internal standard. The plasma samples were subjected to a suitable sample clean-up consisting of a simple and relatively fast, two step liquid-liquid ion-pair extraction procedure. The chromatography, using the same volatile ion-pair reagent <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (HFBA), takes only 10 min. Relative standard deviation of retention times was never above 2. 26 % (n= 36). The method was fully validated based on the US FDA Bioanalytical Method Validation Guidance for Industry. As such, a quantitative ESI-LC-MS(/MS) (TOF mass spectrometry) method was optimized for the absolute quantification of glycopyrrolate in human plasma in a concentration range from 0. 101 to 101 ng/mL using a quadratic calibration function (R(2) = 0. 9995), y=- 2. 21 x 10 (- 4) (+/- 3. 93 x 10 (- 5)) xx(2) + 5. 85 x 10 (- 2) (+/- 5. 27 x 10 (- 3)) xx+ 4. 08 x 10 (- 3) (+/- 4. 82 x 10 (- 4)). For the three QC concentrations (QC(1) 0. 252, QC(2) 2. 52, and QC(3) 25. 2 ng/mL) and the LLOQ (0. 101 ng/mL), total precision was under 20 % (18. 0 % (n= 6) at the LLOQ) and maximum accuracy was 112 % (88. 9 % for the LLOQ, n= 6). Absolute matrix effect (maximum 133 %+/- 9. 59, n= 3), absolute recovery (better than 41. 8 %+/- 2. 22, n= 3), relative (inter-subject) matrix effect (maximum 10. 9 %+/- 1. 45, n= 4) and process efficiency (better than 45. 2 %+/- 5. 74, n= 3) too were assessed at the 3 QC concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Since vitamin B 6 is {{essential}} for normal functioning of the central nervous system, there is growing need for sensitive analysis of B 6 vitamers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This manuscript describes the development and validation of a rapid, sensitive and accurate method for quantification of the vitamin B 6 vitamers pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxic acid (PA), pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxamine 5 '-phosphate (PMP) and pyridoxine 5 '-phosphate (PNP) in human CSF. The method is based on ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) with a simple sample preparation procedure of protein precipitation using 50 g L(- 1) trichloroacetic acid containing stable isotope labeled internal standards: PL-D(3) for PL and PM, PN-(13) C(4) for PN, PA-D(2) for PA and PLP-D(3) for the phosphorylated vitamers. B 6 vitamers were separated (Acquity HSS-T 3 UPLC column) with a buffer containing acetic acid, <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> and acetonitrile. Positive electrospray ionization was used to monitor transitions m/z 168. 1 → 150. 1 (PL), 169. 1 → 134. 1 (PM), 170. 1 → 134. 1 (PN), 184. 1 → 148. 1 (PA), 248. 1 → 150. 1 (PLP), 249. 1 → 232. 1 (PMP) and 250. 1 → 134. 1 (PNP). The method was validated at three concentration levels for each B 6 vitamer in CSF. Recoveries of the internal standards were between 93 % and 96 %. Intra- and inter-assay variations were below 20 %. Accuracy tests showed deviations from 3 % (PN) to 39 % (PMP). Limits of quantification were {{in the range of}} 0. 03 - 5. 37 nM. Poor results were obtained for quantification of PNP. The method was applied to CSF samples of 20 subjects and two patients on pyridoxine supplementation. Using minimal CSF volumes this method is suitable for implementation in a routine diagnostic setting...|$|E
40|$|During {{preclinical}} drug development, {{a method}} for quantification of unlabeled compounds in blood plasma samples from treatment or pharmacokinetic studies in mice is required. In the current work, a rapid, specific, sensitive and validated liquid chromatography mass-spectrometric UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS method was developed for the quantification of the therapeutic compound RD 2 in mouse plasma. RD 2 is an all-D-enantiomeric peptide developed {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease finally leading to dementia. Due to RD 2 ’s highly hydrophilic properties, the sample preparation and the chromatographic separation and quantification were very challenging. The chromatographic separation of RD 2 and its internal standard were accomplished on an Acquity UPLC BEH C 18 column (2. 1  ×  100  mm, 1. 7  μm particle size) within 6. 5  min at 50  °C with a flow rate of 0. 5  mL/min. Mobile phases consisted of water and acetonitrile with 1 % formic acid and 0. 025 % <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively. Ions were generated by electrospray ionization (ESI) in the positive mode and the peptide was quantified by QTOF-MS. The developed extraction method for RD 2 from mouse plasma revealed complete recovery. The linearity of the calibration curve was in the range of 5. 3  ng/mL to 265  ng/mL (r 2  >  0. 999) with a lower limit of detection (LLOD) of 2. 65  ng/mL and a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 5. 3  ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of RD 2 in plasma ranged from − 0. 54 % to 2. 21 % and from 1. 97 % to 8. 18 %, respectively. Moreover, no matrix effects were observed and RD 2 remained stable in extracted mouse plasma at different conditions. Using this validated bioanalytical method, plasma samples of unlabeled RD 2 or placebo treated mice were analyzed. The herein developed UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS method is a suitable tool for the quantitative analysis of unlabeled RD 2 in plasma samples of treated mice...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{contain an}} {{enormous}} array of organic and inorganic components, the analysis for which may involve {{a wide range}} of methods. The focus {{of this study was to}} develop high performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis methods for the analysis of three classes of analytes: osmoregulants, minerals and amino acids. Firstly, this study explored the potential of capillary electrophoresis for the analysis of three very common osmoregulants (proline, glycine betaine and mannitol). A diverse array of methods has been reported for determining each of these analytes, however, the literature on osmoregulants and their analysis is quite disjointed and traverses both biological and chemistry fields. Therefore, a comprehensive review of this literature has been completed (Chapter 2). Considerably fewer methods are available for the simultaneous determination of these osmoregulants, compared to individual analysis. In chapter 3, a method is described for the simultaneous analysis of proline and betaine by capillary electrophoresis at low pH and specifically various cationic probes for the indirect detection of proline and betaine were explored. Sulfanilamide was identified as a suitable probe and was employed to quantify proline and betaine in spinach and beetroot. However, this method could not detect mannitol as it is not charged at low pH. In Chapter 4, a high performance liquid chromatography method for the simultaneous determination of all three osmoregulants is described. For separation, a NH 2 column with formic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase were used. The high performance liquid chromatography evaporative light scattering detection method was applied to determine osmoregulants in Stylosanthes guianensis, Atriplex cinerea and Rhagodia baccata plant extracts. A complementary method, using a C 18 column with <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> added to acetonitrile was used for verification of the analytes. Secondly, the potential for using capillary electrophoresis was investigated to simplify and shorten the complex sample preparation procedure. Chapter 5 describes a capillary electrophoresis method that allows direct injection from plant tissues. The experiments highlighted that uncontrolled hydrodynamic injection of sample on piercing of food sample resulted in non-reproducibility. The addition of hydroxypropylmethlycellulose to the background reduced the uncontrolled hydrodynamic injection up to 95 % for all of the analytes. The sample was injected electrokinetically and an imidazole buffer consisting of hydroxypropylmethlycellulose was used for separation. The issue of reducing the reliance on prior separation is also relevant to minerals, thus the developed capillary zone electrophoresis-UV method was applied for the direct injection of inorganic cations from apple, mushroom, zucchini, green bean and strawberries. The applicability of the method across fruit varieties was determined by analysing four apple varieties including red delicious, fuji, pink lady and royal gala. Thirdly, the potential of the direct injection method was explored for the analysis of amino acids in zucchini. As amino acids are present at low concentrations and lack a chromophore, a more sensitive detector, capacitively coupled contactless conductivity, and pre-concentration of amino acids using isotachophoresis (leading electrolyte = HCl, terminating electrolyte = hydroxyproline) was performed. The separation of amino acids was carried using acetic acid. For minimising uncontrolled hydrodynamic injection poly(ethylene oxide) was used. Using this method sensitive detection of amino acids was possible (Chapter 6). In short, the developed methods allow for quick, inexpensive, sensitive and efficient analysis of plant components...|$|E
40|$|Recently, several novel {{technologies}} have emerged with substantial benefits in toxicological analysis. These include {{the development of}} beadbased multiplex immunoassay (Suspension Bead Array, SBA), the use of reduced-volume centrifugal ion-exchange extraction (SpinSPE), and Ultra-Performance (TM) liquid chromatographic separation coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLC(TM) /MS n). This work sought to investigate the efficacy and practicality of these innovative approaches against a benchmark of established methods and instrumentation for the screening and confirmation of amphetaminetype substances. This study begins with a statistical survey of amphetaminetype substances encountered in an accredited forensic laboratory supporting the Australian Capital Territory and regional New South Wales. Over the 5 year period 2001 - 2005, {{it was determined that}} 6683 case submissions required presumptive screening for amphetamines. Of these cases, 1269 (19. 0 %) required confirmative analysis of amphetaminetype substances, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, MDEA, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phentermine. Such analytical needs were then used in comparative assessment of the novel and established methodologies, including examination of immunoassay specificity, extraction efficiency, chromatographic resolution, general resource efficiency, and total analysis time. Development of a beadbased immunoassay platform (SBA) for multiplex amphetamines analysis proved to be a complex task. Efforts to multiplex the amphetamine and methamphetamine immunoassay models into a single assay exhibited a significant degree of non-specific antibody cross-reactivity. However, the merits of the individual bead assays were demonstrated. Upon comparison with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for amphetamine or methamphetamine (ELISA), it was observed that the SBA models exhibited specificity comparable to that of the ELISA assays and linearity over a concentration range of toxicological relevance (0 - 1000 ng/mL amphetamine or methamphetamine). In addition, the results indicated the practical applicability of the individual SBA assays for an oral fluid matrix, and demonstrated significant reductions in the volumes of reagents required and length of time of analysis. Additionally, in an optimised multiplex system, the amount of sample required for screening could be reduced as the SBA technology theoretically permits analysis of up to 100 different drugs or metabolites from one volume of sample. The aspect of forensic sample conservation was further explored with investigation of reduced-volume extraction techniques, such as the application of centrifugal ionexchange extraction columns (SpinSPE). Following initial development, the SpinSPE technique was applied to the isolation of amphetaminetype substances from oral fluid and compared with a mixedmode SPE method for both extraction and resource efficiency. From the observed results, both extraction methods were demonstrated to be effective in the isolation of amphetamine, methamphetamine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, PMA, MDA, MDMA, MDEA, MBDB, and 2 CB from an oral fluid matrix with detection by <b>heptafluorobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> derivatisation (HFBTA) and GC/MS. The SpinSPE model demonstrated comparable efficacy with reduced sample volume (200 iOC, as well as significant reductions in the volumes of reagents required for column conditioning, washing, and elution. In addition, the linear working range (0 - 2000 ng/mL) and sensitivity of the method indicated the potential to further reduce sample volume. In the confirmative separation and identification of drug compounds, the technological advancement of UltraPerformance (TM) liquid chromatography (UPLC(TM)) has recently evolved from efforts to improve LC resolution, sensitivity, and time of analysis. In this research, UPLC(TM) coupled to mass spectrometry was demonstrated to be capable of rapidly identifying several amphetaminetype substances (phenylethylamine, amphetamine, phentermine, methamphetamine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, PMA, 4 MTA, MDA, MDMA, MDEA, MBDB) and ketamine in an analysis time of less than five minutes. In addition, UPLC(TM) /MS demonstrated a resolving power comparable to GC/MS with significantly reduced instrumental analysis time. This research reveals the promise of these new applications in advancing towards a more efficient and modernised systematic toxicological approach. The continued development and optimisation of SBA multiplex immunoassays will permit customisable systems capable of simultaneously detecting numerous compounds with antibodybased sensitivity and selectivity. In circumstances where low sample volumes are required for confirmation of drug use, such as in roadside saliva drug testing for driving under the influence offences, reducedvolume SpinSPE has been demonstrated to be a practical and effective alternative for sample preparation. In addition, a more streamlined procedure is further enhanced with the use of UPLC(TM) coupled to mass spectrometry for analyte separation and molecular identification. It is expected that illicit drug use will remain a significant public concern. With the continued desire for more rapid and comprehensive methodologies, further study of these and other innovative technologies will be of considerable future benefit to laboratories such as that serving the Australian Capital Territory region...|$|E
