To address the <b>end</b> <b>distortion</b> and frequency aliasing issues in conventional lifting wavelet transform, a Volterra series assisted undecimated lifting wavelet packet transform (ULWPT) is investigated for machinery incipient fault diagnosis. Undecimated lifting wavelet packet transform is firstly formulated to eliminate the frequency aliasing issue in traditional lifting wavelet packet transform. Next, Volterra series, as a boundary treatment method, is used to preprocess the signal to suppress the <b>end</b> <b>distortion</b> in undecimated lifting wavelet packet transform. Finally, the decomposed wavelet coefficients are trimmed to the original length as the signal of interest for machinery incipient fault detection.

40|$|Abstract — A joint {{source and}} channel coding {{approach}} for image transmission over a satellite based broadcast channel is proposed. A resolution scalable source is matched to a hierarchical constellation {{in order to}} achieve an adaptive decoding capability. An estimate of signal to noise ratio (SNR) is derived blindly at the receiver and is used to facilitate reception at lower information rate. The rate is reduced by switching to a lower level constellation from hierarchical QAM. This ensures graceful degradation in performance and guarantees service with lower resolution for channel under-going high AWGN noise. The simulation results suggest that, for very noisy channels, the end to <b>end</b> <b>distortion</b> so obtained is much lesser compared to decoding at full resolution.

Four hybrid topologies are considered with a hybrid load consisting of current source type and voltage source type nonlinear loads.

The suitability of the multiple feedback loop control scheme was also investigated. It was determined that the scheme is effective in the generation of sinusoidal and distortion components of compensating currents and voltages and hence suitable for active filtering application.

This scheme combines the channel optimized vector quantization (COVQ) and the adaptive M-ary optimized quadrature amplitude modulation (M-OQAM). The adaptive modulation, when designed to track the channel variations, yields a higher throughput by adapting certain parameters of the receiver and the transmitter to the channel variation. After a time delay, the transmitter knows the receiver estimate of the Partial Channel State Information (PCSI) via a feedback path. The PCSI {{is a result of}} a comparison between the estimate of the average Channel Signal to Noise Ratio (CSNR) and λ- 1 thresholds.

First, the configuration of approximating spline filter is investigated, which describes that this filter inherits all the merits of an ordinary spline filter e. g. no phase distortion and no <b>end</b> <b>distortion.</b> Then, the approximating coefficient selection is discussed, which specifies an important property of this filter-the convergence to Gaussian filter. The maximum approximation deviation between them can be controlled below 4. 36 %, moreover, be decreased to less than 1 % when cascaded.

40|$|In {{geometrical}} metrology, morphological {{filters are}} useful tools for the surface texture analysis and functional prediction. Although {{they are generally}} accepted and regarded as the complement to mean-line based filters, they are not universally adopted in practice due {{to a number of}} fatal limitations in their implementations —they are restricted to planar surfaces, uniform sampled surfaces, time-consuming and suffered from <b>end</b> <b>distortions</b> and limited sizes of structuring elements. A novel morphological method is proposed based on the alpha shape with the advantages over traditional methods that it enables arbitrary large ball radii, and applies to freeform surfaces and non-uniform sampled surfaces. A practical algorithm is developed based on the theoretical link between the alpha hull and morphological envelopes. The performance bottleneck due to the costly 3 D Delaunay triangulation is solved by the divide-and-conquer optimization. Aiming to overcome the deficits of the alpha shape method that the structuring element has to be circular and the computation relies on the Delaunay triangulation, a set of definitions, propositions and comments for searching contact points is proposed and mathematically proved based on alpha shape theory, followed by the construction of a recursive algorithm. The algorithm could precisely capture contact points without performing the Delaunay triangulation. By correlating the convex hull and morphological envelopes, the Graham scan algorithm, originally developed for the convex hull, is modified to compute morphological profile envelopes with an excellent performance achieved. The three novel methods along with the two traditional methods are compared and analyzed to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages. The end effects of morphological filtration on open surfaces are discussed and four end effect correction methods are explored. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and capabilities of using the proposed discrete algorithms...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{wireless}} communication industry grows tremendously and improve our life dramatically. Nowadays, as 3 G {{systems such as}} WCDMA, CDMA 2000 and TD-SCDMA become mature and goes into business, people start {{to concentrate on the}} reach of the next generation wireless communication systems. Next generation wireless communication systems are expected to provide high data rate and robust transmission so as to support new applications like high quality multimedia services and high speed data transfer. To meet the demands, we have to increase the operation band and/or increase the spectrum efficiency. Since spectrum is a precious resource in wireless communications, a number of new technologies are developed to enhance the spectrum efficiency such as multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO), cross layer scheduling, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(OFDM), joint source channel coding(JSCC) etc. Most of these technologies require channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) to enhance the performance. However, perfect CSIT is hard to obtain in practice. In FDD systems, {{only a limited number of}} bits(e. g. 6 bits for WiMAX [1]) can be allocated to carry the CSIT feedback, namely the limited feedback. Moreover, the feedback CSIT may not be error free due to the feedback channel noise. Hence the efficient utilization of the limited feedback bits and the robustness of the feedback design become important. In this Thesis, we focus on the following problems related to the design and analysis of wireless communication systems with limited CSIT feedback: optimal feedback design for MIMO-OFDM systems: We first consider error free limited feedback and propose a systematic design framework for MIMO-OFDM systems on frequency selective channels. We formulate the design problem into the classical vector quantization problem with a modified distortion metric. We find that with a small number of bits for CSIT feedback, there is significant capacity gain in the MIMO-OFDM systems. MIMO Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) with Limited Feedback: In non-ergodic channels where ergodic capacity cannot be achieved or in the applications where large delay can not be tolerated, Shannon’s source-channel separation theorem does not hold and the optimal performance (end to <b>end</b> <b>distortion)</b> requires a joint optimization of source and channel coding (JSCC). We shall study the system performance with error free limited feedback from this new angle of view. We focus on the design and asymptotic performance analysis of joint source channel coding for MIMO channels with limited CSIT feedback. We show that with a small number of feedback bits, the achieved distortion is already close to the optimal distortion with perfect CSIT. Capacity of Fast Fading MIMO Channels with Noisy Limited Feedback : We consider noisy limited feedback on MIMO system over fast fading channels where ergodic capacity can be achieved. We propose two robust limited feedback designs for MIMO adaptation and find that for large number of feedback bits Cfb, the MIMO capacity loss (due to noisy feedback) of the proposed robust design scales like O(Pe 2 −Cfb / t+ 1) for some positive integer t. Hence, the penalty due to noisy limited feedback in the proposed robust design approaches zero as Cfb increases. Adaptation for Slow Fading MIMO Channels with Noisy Limited Feedback: We consider noisy limited feedback on MIMO system over slow fading channels in chapter 6. To take into consideration of the potential packet errors, we optimize the system goodput (b/s/Hz successfully delivered to the receiver) with respect to a general model of limited feedback error. We show that the codebook design that maximizes the system goodput can be converted to an equivalent ”maximin” problem. Simulation results demonstrated the importance of taking the potential CSIT errors into the limited feedback design for robust performance in both cases. Multi-User SDMA Systems with Noisy Limited CSIT Feedback: We consider spatial-division multiple-access (SDMA) systems with one multiple antenna base station and a number of single antenna mobiles under noisy limited CSIT feedback. We proposed a robust noisy limited feedback design for SDMA systems. The solution consists of a real-time robust SDMA precoding, user selection and rate adaptation as well as an offline feedback index assignment algorithm. The index assignment problem is cast into a Traveling Sales Man problem (TSP). Based on the specific structure of the feedback constellation and the precoder, we derive a low complexity but asymptotically optimal solution. We show that the average system goodput scales as O(nT (1 −ϵ) / nT− 1 (Cfb − log 2 (Nn))) and O(nT · log 2 P) in the interference limited regime (Cfb < (nT − 1) log 2 P + log 2 Nn) and noise-limited regime respectively. Hence, despite the noisy feedback channel, the average SDMA system goodput grows with the number of feedback bits in the interference limited regime while in noise limited regime increases linearly with the number of transmit antenna and the forward channel SNR (log 2 P) ...|$|E

40|$|Stressed skin {{design has}} now been {{developed}} into an important tool for designing buildings. In developing stressed skin theory, {{it has been shown}} that the inherent inplane stiffness of the materials considered is of predominate importance in the distribution of lateral forces within a structure. The materials that have been incorporated in the theory so far are profiled steel and aluminium sheeting. Lately, work on multi-storey buildings has shown the advantage of using infill panels in the vertical plane to control the sway deflection of the building. No account, however, has been taken of the horizontal floors acting as diaphragms. Incorporating the floor into the sway analysis would clearly model the building more realistically. A typical floor construction commonly adopted in steel framed buildings is the composite slab. This consists of trapezoidally profiled steel sheeting fastened to the structure and overlain by concrete. Design formulae are derived for the shear strength and flexibility of the above floor construction and verified by experimental work. In the basic stressed skin concept the shear distortional flexibility of profiled sheeting has been shown to be dependent on the overall dimensions of the diaphragm, the shape of the profile and the fastener arrangement. At present the analysis considers a typical corrugation to lie within a large "field or corrugations" and so edge effects are neglected. A Finite Strip program has been written to analyse these fields of corrugations under the action of a shear flow and to investigate the effect of edge members on the shear flexibility. The large <b>end</b> <b>distortions</b> of the profiled sheeting, that arise as a result of the action of the shear flow on the profile, can cause failure of the sheeting and fasteners in this region. A study has been undertaken to investigate the possible failure modes, as a result of which three modes have been identified, namely, failure of the sheet / purlin fasteners, buckling of the profile web and a sideways collapse of the profile. Numerical expressions are developed for these failures and compared with experimental results...|$|R

In other words, the growth stress consists of two components, elastic and viscoelastic [4, 98, 99, 101]. The creation of a free surface, either due to cutting operations or to crack propagation, is equivalent to an instantaneous recovery, i.e., {{the release of the}} elastic component of growth stress. The resulting instantaneous recovery is followed by a delayed recovery caused by rearrangements of cell wall macromolecules, especially those belonging to the amorphous matrix. This interpretation is further confirmed by the amplifying effect of boiling or steaming on observed time-dependent phenomena, which is consistent with viscoelasticity being a thermally activated process. Researchers thus consider the delayed recovery to be caused by the release of viscoelastic components of growth stress [4, 101].|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{rate-distortion}} {{theory is}} focused on how to best encode a signal using as few bits as possible and incurring as low a distortion as possible. However, very often, the goal of transmission is to extract specific information from the signal at the receiving <b>end,</b> and the <b>distortion</b> should be measured on that extracted information. In this paper we examine the problem of encoding signals such that sufficient information is preserved about their pairwise distances. For that goal, we consider randomized embeddings as an encoding mechanism and provide a framework to analyze their performance. We also propose the recently developed universal quantized embeddings {{as a solution to}} that problem and experimentally demonstrate that, in image retrieval experiments, universal embedding can achieve up to 25 % rate reduction over the state of the art.
