25|$|Pope John Paul II Park Reservation: The Pope John Park Reservation is {{approximately}} 66 acres in size, {{and is also}} open year-round for the residents of Dorchester. In its earlier times it {{was used as a}} landfill and also a drive-in theatre. It also serves as a barricade between the Town of Dorchester, Boston and Neponset River waterfront. This park now gives residents various resources such as; Picnic facilities, soccer fields, play areas, paths for walking, and also spacious land to plant trees and shrubs. Unfortunately, it was not always like this. In May 2015, According to James W. Dolan, Pope John Paul Park Reservation was not the same as it used to be. The State Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is responsible for the park, is not really <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> <b>job.</b> The plants are either dead or overgrown. There are no gardens or trees that would catch anyone's eye and also no picnic tables or grills where families could gather around and do a cookout. Dolan states that he wants to see people of the community planting vegetables and tending flower beds in the park, paddling canoes in the river, and also a grove of trees so people could sit in the shade and look out at the river.|$|E

The discovery of the minigame caused California State Assemblyman Leland Yee to rebuke both Rockstar and the ESRB, arguing that the ESRB was not <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> <b>job</b> properly. US Senators Hillary Clinton and Joe Lieberman also expressed their disapproval. Rockstar initially claimed that the minigame {{was created by the}} mod community and was {{not a part of the}} original game. This was disproven when it was discovered that a third-party cheat device could be used to unlock the [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] scenes in console versions of the game. Following an investigation, the ESRB changed its rating from M to AO, setting a precedent that games can be re-rated due to the presence of pertinent content that exists on the game's disc, even if that content is programmed to not be playable without modification or unauthorized use of a third-party cheat device. Following the release of a version excluding the content, the rating was reverted to M.|$|E

500|$|In June 2012, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{brought forth}} controversial legislation, known as Bill 29, that reformed the province's Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The {{amendments to the}} act expanded the government's ability to deny access to information by keeping ministerial briefings secret, ignoring requests for information that cabinet ministers deem to be [...] "frivolous," [...] and barring the auditor general from a wider array of records. Deadlines to respond to requests were pushed back, and fees were increased from $15 to $25. The opposition leaders immediately condemned the bill and said they would team up to filibuster the bill. An expert on international access-to-information laws, Toby Mendel, called key changes to the act “breathtaking,” and said the province will rank lower than some third world countries with the new legislation. As well 75 people also assembled outside the Confederation Building to protest the bill. However, Newfoundland and Labrador's information commissioner, Ed Ring, said bill 29 was {{not a bad thing}} and that it would not stop the Access to the Information and Protection of Privacy Act from <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> <b>job.</b> Bill 29 led to a four-day filibuster in the House of Assembly, which eventually ended when the government invoked closure to the debate. NDP leader Lorraine Michael's accusation that the government was being racist, when referring to Mendel's criticism of the bill, was cited by the government as reasons to end debate.|$|E
