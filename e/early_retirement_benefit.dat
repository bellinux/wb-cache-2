Over the past 5 years, the party has experienced a continuous decline in voter share and is the smallest party in the Danish parliament as of 2012. The study uses three different theories to explain Det Konservative Folkeparti’s crisis: Kaare Ström’s theory ”A Behavioral Theory of Competitive Political Parties”, ”Hanne Marthe Narud’s theory ”Electoral Competition and Coalition Bargaining in Multiparty Systems” and Ole Borre’s theory ”Issue voting”. The study analyses Det Konservative Folkeparti’s actions {{before and after the}} Prime Minister’s 2010 - 2011 New Year’s speech. The study uses the ‘efterløn’-issue as case because it represents the coalition bargaining between Venstre and Det Konservative Folkeparti, as well as de konservative’s party strategy, in the years of 2001 - 2011. The study concludes that the Det Konservative Folkeparti’s political profile has been weakened due to its party strategy, which has focused on being policy- and office seeking rather than vote seeking. Det Konservative Folkeparti has prioritized the legislative arena rather than the electoral arena. The latter resulted in the lending of their issue ownership on the <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> issue (efterlønsissuet), to the party Venstre in the four days after the New Year’s speech. The study also reflects on other explanatory reasons for voter share decline: internal conflicts, politician scandals in the media, the decline of classic ideologies, and competition from other parties...|$|E

This Brief documents the health and financial status of people aged 62 – 64 who receive reduced Social Security benefits as retired workers, spouses, and widowed spouses.

About 25 percent are estimated to have health problems that substantially impair their ability to work.

About 12 percent of early retirees are estimated to meet the strict disability criteria for receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI).

30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{association}} between the motivation to work and health among adult workers, most studies concentrate {{on the relationship between}} health and the willingness to work until the official retirement age. These studies typically indicate that poor health encourages <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> (Heponiemi 2008; Harkonmäki et al. 2006; van den Berg et al. 2010 a), increases older workers’ intention to exit the labour market (Dwyer and Mitchell 1999; Siegrist et al. 2006; Wahrendorf et al. 2013) and is strongly associated with nullifying the question of whether one is willing to work until official retirement age (Nilsson et al. 2011). Although some studies also indicate that financial incentives, such as generous <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits,</b> increase the likelihood of <b>early</b> <b>retirement,</b> individuals seem to refrain from <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> during prosperous economic periods (Stattin 2005). However, health problems remain a stronger predictor of retirement plans than economic variables (Dwyer and Mitchell 1999). Because the following analyses concentrate on two relatively young cohorts of the German baby boom (born in 1959 and 1965)—generations that are currently approximately 50 years of age—economic incentives are irrelevant. No financial incentives to withdraw from the labour market before age 60 exist in Germany. However, the lack of personal financial resources might reduce individuals’ likelihood of withdrawing from employment for health reasons.|$|R

40|$|The {{populations in}} all industrialized {{countries}} are aging rapidly and life life expectancies are increasing. Yet older workers {{are leaving the}} labor force at younger and younger ages. In some countries, the labor force participation rates of 60 to 64 year old men have fallen by 75 % over the past 30 years. This decline magnifies population trends, further {{increasing the number of}} retirees relative to the number of people working. Together these trends have put enormous pressure on the financial solvency of social security systems around the world. Ironically, the provisions of the systems themselves typically contribute to the labor force withdrawal. This paper is a summary of the findings of the evidence in 11 industrialized countries. We distill the key conclusions drawn from the collective findings of the individual papers. It is clear there is a strong correspondence between the age at which benefits are available and departure from the labor force. Social security programs often provide generous <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> at young ages. Also, the provisions of these programs often imply large financial penalties on earnings beyond the social security <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> age. Furthermore, in many countries disability and unemployment programs effectively provide <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> before the official social security <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> age. We conclude that social security program provisions have contributed to the decline in labor force participation of older persons, substantially reducing the potential productive capacity of the labor force. It seems evident that if the trend to <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> is to be reversed, as will almost surely be dictated by demographic trends, changing the provisions of social security programs that induce <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> will play a key role. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of increasing the}} age at which Social Security benefits are first paid merits renewed scrutiny for at least three reasons: • a decrease in overall benefits would imply that those claiming reduced benefits before the 'full benefits age' may accept benefits that seem adequate when claimed but are insufficient when income earnings ends and savings are depleted; • life expectancy has increased; and • an enlarged labor force would increase potential national income and ameliorate projected future deficits. This paper examines differences in personal circumstances between those who retire and those who remain at work for pay at various ages. The findings, based on the Health and Retirement Survey, are that there are differences between these two groups, but they are rather small. Some who claim <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> before the full benefits age would face serious hardship if those benefits were no longer available, however. For that reason, if the age of initial eligibility is increased, consideration should be given to measures targeted on this group. The paper then goes on to consider back-up protections that might be provided to those who now claim <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> should the age of initial eligibility be increased. ...|$|R
30|$|The figures {{also reveal}} that {{respondents}} were relatively pessimistic {{in the first}} few months of the survey (May and June 2006). One explanation is the fact that the government largely abolished preferential tax treatment of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> in <b>early</b> 2006. Another reason may be that the Social Democrats announced their intention to reduce the eligibility or generosity of AOW benefits to cope with the increasing costs due to population ageing. In the months after that, these plans were weakened and other parties expressed disagreement, which is probably why respondents became less pessimistic over the summer of 2006. Respondents’ optimism rose until the general elections in November 2006. Shortly after that, several groups revitalized the discussion on increasing the AOW eligibility age and labour force participation of older workers, and pessimism increased. Particularly since late 2008, influenced by the budget problems caused by the crisis, government plans to change the AOW eligibility age took concrete form, and increasing pessimism seems perfectly justified.|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the low {{re-employment}} opportunities that workers above age 55 face in continental Europe, inefficient separations of older workers may generate a significant welfare loss for the economy. The economic literature therefore suggests eliminating any governmental policies that distort firing and retirement decisions. In this paper, I argue that even without any governmental distortions, there may still be inefficient destruction of older workers' jobs due to market-inherent contracting frictions that may arise due to asymmetric information. I demonstrate this in a two period model {{of the labor market}} where risk-averse workers choose their preferred wage contract from a restricted subset of the contract space. I find that an equilibrium with bilaterally inefficient layoffs of older workers emerges under certain conditions. These conditions are satisfied more easily if high outside options, such as <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits,</b> become available for the elderly. This prediction is consistent with empirical studies postulating that generous social security systems increase the incidence of being 'pushed' into <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> by the employer. On the other hand, training programs, wage subsidies, and employment protection are found to decrease the incidence of bilaterally inefficient layoffs...|$|R
