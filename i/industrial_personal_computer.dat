The first part in Configuration Management is Configuration Identification that usually determines the system’s final result. Therefore, Configuration Identification is critical t for the Configuration Management. According to the past research, there are three major means of Configuration Identification: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Expert Questionnaire & Fuzzy Logic, and Expert Evaluation. In work breakdown structure, there would be some subjective choices for identification items because of some personnel issues; the bringing of identification items may be affected by the filling condition of questionnaire.

Various Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques are used for inspection of such objects both during fabrication as well as in-service stages. Ultrasonic testing (UT) is a very popular NDT technique adopted in such applications. Flaw detection and thickness gauging are the main UT methodologies adopted in such inspections. Today, ultrasonic imaging systems are also available and such a system can be utilized for complete volumetric inspection of the desired tubes/pipes.

30|$|The {{traditional}} protection {{methods for}} {{the mold of}} the injection molding machine mainly include the low-voltage protection, setting the limit parameters, the current monitoring, setting the upper limit of the time, and so on [6, 7]. This type of methods requires the addition of sophisticated equipment, which will increase the cost {{and at the same}} time make the injection molding process complicated [8]. The machine vision inspection technology has the characteristics of non-contact, high precision, high efficiency, and so on. And its application to the protection of the injection molds has become the research hotspot at present [9, 10]. The integrated development environment for the image processing based on the machine vision is generally composed of an <b>industrial</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> for the operation of the integrated development environment model for the image processing and a set of image acquisition and control equipment which is used as the bridge between the <b>industrial</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> and the injection molding machine [11]. In the aspect of the integrated development environment model for the image processing, the host computer interactive interface is used to set the region of interest. And the difference image of the image to be measured and the template image is obtained by the background subtraction method. Subsequently, threshold segmentation and binarization are carried out. And then the statistics of the black points in the binary image is carried out to determine whether there is residue. In the same way, the host computer interactive interface is used to set the region of interest. Subsequently, the light compensation and the image alignment algorithm are used to perform the preprocessing. And then differential operation is carried out on the binary image of the image to be measured and the binary image of the background image. Finally, in accordance with the threshold value, it is determined whether there is residue. Through the gray feature matching algorithm, filter preprocessing is carried out on the image. And the canny operator is used to extract the geometric contour features of the mold and then carry out the template matching. Image background subtraction detection algorithm is used to carry out the similarity calculation through the template matching algorithm [12, 13]. The region of interest is identified by means of template matching. And the similarity judgment is carried out on the template of the gray level co-occurrence matrix and the detection image. The above algorithm in the literature requires an <b>industrial</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> hardware environment with relatively large memory and high main frequency to meet the real-time and precision requirements of the image detection. The cost of such equipment is high, and there is certain limitation in the popularization and application. The visualized mold protection based on image processing has become a new direction of exploration. In the literature, TQ 2440 is used to build a visual mold protection platform. The mold protection algorithm makes use of the background subtraction method, which, however, does not take into consideration the error caused by the image shift that is generated due to the mechanical vibration in the actual applications. The mold monitoring system based on TMS 320 DM 6473 adopts the basic anomaly detection algorithm and the template matching algorithm based on the dual detection of the local binary pattern anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm is complicated and the setting conditions are excessively ideal [14]. In recent years, the digital image technology has attracted great attention and achieved considerable development. It has been widely used in various fields. The research on the image technology has been carried out in universities, research institutes, and companies, which is increasingly deepened and carried out in a systematic manner. Great attention is paid to the inheritance of knowledge and algorithm reuse [15 – 21], the pursuit of high efficiency, and low cost. Therefore, it is necessary to provide an environment with powerful support for the learning, research, and development of the image algorithm.|$|E
30|$|The {{integrated}} {{development environment}} for the visualized image processing designed in the paper adopts the visual hardware platform, which has overcome the defects that the image detection systems in the injection molding production are mainly operated in the <b>industrial</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer.</b> The Moore nearest neighbor model is adopted to highlight the residues to be detected, {{and at the same}} time adapts to the feature of small memory in the visualization platform. And a kind of support vector machine algorithm based on the pixel value statistics is put forward. The experimental results show that both the real-time performance and the precision rate of the {{integrated development environment}} model based on the fusion of the Moore nearest neighbor model for the visual image processing are superior to those of the traditional image processing methods. On the other hand, the insufficiency of the algorithm is mainly due to the poor detection effect of the images acquired under the individual illumination abnormal conditions. In the next step, the optimization of the algorithm requires the solution to the problem of the photometric compensation for such images, so that the system performance can further meet the actual demands in the injection molding production.|$|E
