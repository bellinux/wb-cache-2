5|$|In Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, {{with the}} Texas Rangers leading the game 7–5, and leading the series by 3 games to 2, Freese came to bat {{in the bottom}} of the ninth with two out and two men on base. With a count of one ball and two strikes, Freese hit a two-run triple off Neftalí Feliz just out of the reach of Nelson Cruz to tie the game and send it to extra innings. In the 11th inning, again with two strikes, Freese hit a game-winning lead-off, walk-off, solo home-run to deep center field (420feet), to send the World Series to its first Game 7 since 2002. Freese joined Jim Edmonds, the man he was traded for, as the only players in Cardinals history to <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> extra-inning walk-off home run in the postseason. He joined Aaron Boone (2003), David Ortiz (2004) and Hall of Famers Carlton Fisk (1975) and Kirby Puckett (1991) as the only players to <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> extra-inning walk-off home run when their team was facing postseason elimination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the rules}} of baseball, aside from the rare case of {{interference}} or obstruction, a batter who puts a ball into play and safely reaches first base is ruled to have reached {{in one of three}} possible ways: a <b>hit,</b> <b>an</b> error, or by fielder's choice. Fielder's choice is primarily discussed in rules 10.05 and 10.06, and it generally occurs when it is judged that a batter-runner would have been put out had the defense chosen to do so.|$|E

50|$|For Team Liffey, Matt <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> perfect {{drive and}} Andy <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> stellar long iron shot to 7 feet, and Mark made the eagle putt. Then it was Team Straffan's turn. Joe also <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> perfect drive, and Julien <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> decent {{approach}} to 30 feet. Nina's eagle putt missed short right, so Team Straffan makes a birdie but they lose the challenge, and Team Liffey has a 1-0 lead.|$|R

5|$|On 9 July 1918, U-10 <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> Italian mine near Caorle in the {{northern}} Adriatic Sea at position , and was beached with heavy damage. Although she was looted by Austro-Hungarian Army troops, she was later towed to Trieste for repairs, which remained unfinished at war's end; all of the 13 crew personnel were saved. U-10 was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped at Pola by 1920. U-10 sank no ships in her Austro-Hungarian service.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled {{backward into}} the Woodley Park – Zoo / Adams Morgan station and <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backward into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the tour with Dashboard Confessional, {{relationships}} between the band members continued to decline. The band's live shows had deteriorated, and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times. Matt Pryor's wife had recently given birth to their first child, and being away from his family had made him irritable and standoffish. After the Honda Civic tour ended, the band embarked on their world tour, including stops throughout Europe, Japan and Australia. However, their live performance <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> all-time low, with Pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies {{ended the}} month with a five-game series, {{continuing}} into June, against the New York Mets. Although Buchanan's second major-league {{start in the}} series opener was a quality start, the Phillies offense managed one run for a 4–1 loss. The last two games of May went 14 innings apiece, with the Phillies winning the first and losing the second. In the first game A. J. Burnett threw seven innings and allowed five runs, after which six relievers threw a combined seven scoreless innings. Ruiz had four hits and Brown had four RBIs; Reid Brignac hit a walk-off RBI single to left field in the 14th inning, scoring Byrd for a 6–5 win. The next night, after the Phillies fell behind 4–0, Howard hit a seventh-inning three-run home run; {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, Brown <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> RBI single to tie the game and send it into extra innings. In the 14th inning David Wright <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> RBI single to take the lead, which the Mets' bullpen held to win 5–4.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, {{but quickly}} {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing at it, but a bullet <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car.

5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E

5000|$|Going {{into the}} last game of the 1977 season Perlozzo's teammate, Rod Carew, had 99 RBIs. Perlozzo started the game at shortstop in place of Roy Smalley, and just as Perlozzo was about to bat {{for the first time}} in the game, manager Gene Mauch grabbed him by the arm and said, [...] "I want you to go up there and <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> triple, right now, this at-bat. You <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> triple, understand?" [...] Perlozzo did <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> triple, and Carew <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> single to gain his 100th RBI of the season.|$|R
5|$|Chappell's {{aggressive}} approach suited limited-overs cricket: {{he scored}} his runs at a strike-rate of 77 runs per hundred balls. The timing {{of his career}} limited him to 16 ODI matches, but he appeared {{in a number of}} historic fixtures such as the first ODI (at the MCG in 1971), the first World Cup final (at Lord's in 1975) and the first day/night match (during WSC, at VFL Park in 1978). He passed fifty in half of his innings with a top score of 86 at Christchurch in 1973–74. In his final season of international cricket, he scored 63 not out (from 65 balls) against the West Indies at the SCG to win the player of the match award; five days later he <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> unbeaten 60 from 50 balls in his penultimate ODI appearance, against England. As captain, he recorded six wins and five losses from 11 matches. He is also credited to have hit the first ever six in an ODI match (which is in fact the first ODI match ever played).|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2007 season, Sánchez {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Giants' organization (behind only Tim Lincecum) by Baseball America. Sánchez made the Giants' roster out of spring training. He struggled in his first fourteen games, however, and was sent down to Fresno on May 21 when Russ Ortiz came off the disabled list. Sánchez returned to the majors on June 6 when, coincidentally, Ortiz got hurt again. On June 13, {{he picked up his}} first major league <b>hit</b> (<b>an</b> RBI double) in a 7–4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 4, he was placed on the disabled list with a strained rib cage, but he was reactivated on July 18.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{struggled}} in two warm-up matches against Tasmania before the Australians left for England, and despite winning both fixtures, {{it was not}} to be a happy tour on the field. In the first match on English soil, against East Molesey, Bill Johnston, Australia’s leading wicket-taker in 1948, broke down with a serious knee injury. Hassett {{struggled in}} the opening first-class matches in England, passing 40 only once in six innings. In the last match before the Tests, against Sussex, he <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> unbeaten 108. Australia's progress before the Tests was constantly curtailed by bad weather. Of the six first-class matches that Hassett played, three did not reach the second innings, although Australia did manage two victories.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, the Pacific War {{between the}} Empire of Japan and the Allies entered its fourth year. The Japanese fought fiercely, {{ensuring}} that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The 1.25million battle casualties that were incurred by the United States in World War II included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred {{during the last year}} of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> all-time monthly high of 88,000 {{as a result of the}} German Ardennes Offensive. In the Pacific, the Allies returned to the Philippines, recaptured Burma, and invaded Borneo. Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in Bougainville, New Guinea and the Philippines. In April 1945, American forces landed on Okinawa, where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|Jeter {{decided to}} play {{exclusively}} as the designated hitter in the final series of his career, at Fenway Park in Boston, so that his final memories of playing shortstop would be at Yankee Stadium. The Red Sox honored Jeter with a pregame ceremony including Red Sox retired stars Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Fred Lynn, Luis Tiant and Rico Petrocelli, the Boston Bruins' Bobby Orr, New England Patriots receiver Troy Brown and the Boston Celtics' Paul Pierce, while many Boston fans at Fenway Park loudly cheered for Jeter {{and gave him a}} standing ovation. In his final at-bat, he <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> RBI infield single against Clay Buchholz, before being substituted for pinch runner Brian McCann; he received an ovation from the Red Sox fans as he exited the field.|$|E

LeMond suffered a concussion and was left with no memory of the incident. According to Associated Press, a Plymouth police report says LeMond left the road, hit a fence and shrubs, and then <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> embankment before ending up in the backyard of a home. LeMond may have lost consciousness before the accident, according to his wife Kathy, and he suffered a compression fracture in his back and would have to wear a brace for three months.

5|$|Levels {{include a}} variety of {{anthropomorphic}} vegetable enemies, such as potatoes and squash, each with different movement patterns and attacks. Levels can also include hazards, such as water or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Unlike the previous game, Keen can not shoot enemies with a raygun; instead he collects small pellets throughout the levels called flower power to throw at enemies. If an enemy is hit, they transform into a passive, intangible flower for a limited time, while pellets that do not <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> enemy can be retrieved by the player. The player can also find food items {{in the form of}} sweets throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded if the player earns enough points, as well as figures of Keen that grant an extra life. Placed throughout the levels are collectible bombs, which the player must use at least twelve of in order to defeat the final boss of the game.|$|E
5|$|On July 31 at AT Park, in a 3-1 {{win over}} the Washington Nationals and in support of fellow {{rotation}} mate Matt Cain's one hundredth career win, Bumgarner pinch-hit for him after Cain threw five no-hit innings on ninety-three pitches. Bumgarner would <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> opposite-field leadoff double off the bricks, becoming the first Giants pitcher to record a pinch-hit double in a pitch-hitting appearance since Ray Sadecki did so in , according to CSN Bay Area. The Giants inserted pinch-runner and another fellow rotation mate Jeff Samardzija, who would score later in the inning, marking the first occurrence in a San Francisco Giants game that a pinch-hitting pitcher reached base, was substituted for by a pinch-running pitcher, and scored a run.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E
