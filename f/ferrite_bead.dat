50|$|<b>Ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> {{are one of}} the {{simplest}} and least expensive types of interference filters to install on preexisting electronic cabling. For a simple ferrite ring, the wire is simply wrapped around the core through the center, typically five or seven times. Clamp-on cores are also available, which attach without wrapping the wire: this type of ferrite core is usually designed so that the wire passes only once through it. If the fit is not snug enough, the core can be secured with cable ties or, if the center is large enough, the cabling can loop through one or more times. Small <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> can be slipped over component leads to suppress parasitic oscillation.|$|R

50|$|Passive {{measurement}} of an electrically small antenna requires a quarter-wavelength RF choke or <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> {{to be added}} to the end of the feeding coaxial cable to limit or prevent the current from flowing onto the surface of the cable.

The quarter-wavelength choke are narrow-band and the ferrite beads are lossy at higher frequency greater than 1 GHz. These techniques are not without problems; the quarter-wavelength choke technique allows currents to travel up to 0.25 wavelengths from the antenna and increases the effective size, whereas the lossy choke (e.g. <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead)</b> technique introduces losses that should be considered.|$|E

Conversely, if there are other sources of EMI, such as household appliances, the bead prevents the cable from acting as an antenna and receiving interference from these other devices. This is particularly common on data cables and on medical equipment.|$|R

Twelve types of small size FBs from three manufacturers were used to evaluate their robustness under soldering stresses and at high surge current spikes associated with transients in tantalum capacitors.

A special {{design of the}} thermometry system with high resolution (0. 005 degrees C) and fast data-acquisition (all channels within 320 ms) together with a pulsed power technique allows assessment of specific absorption rate (SAR) information in patients along catheter tracks. A disadvantage of thermocouple thermometry, EM interference, is almost entirely eliminated by application of absorbing <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> around the probe leads. We investigated the effect of remaining disturbance on the temperature decay after power-off, both experimentally in phantoms and in the clinic, and with numerical simulations. Probe and tissue characteristics influence the response time tau dist of the decay of the disturbance. In our clinical practice a normal pulse sequence is 50 s power-on, 10 s power-off: a response time longer than the power-off time results in a deflection of the temperature course at the start. Based on analysis of temperature decays correction of temperature is possible. A double-pulse technique is introduced to provide an initial correction of temperature, and fast information about accuracy. Sometimes disturbance with a relatively long response time occurs, probably due to a bad contact between probe, catheter and/or tissue.

40|$|P 1 P 8160 A is a {{versatile}} low jitter clock generator and spread spectrum frequency modulator {{designed to reduce}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) at the clock source, allowing system wide reduction of EMI of down stream clock and data dependent signals. The device allows significant system cost savings by {{reducing the number of}} circuit board layers <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads,</b> shielding and other passive components that are traditionally required to pass EMI regulations. P 1 P 8160 A modulates the output of a PLL in order to “spread ” the bandwidth of a synthesized clock, and more importantly, decreases the peak amplitudes of its harmonics. This results in significantly lower system EMI compared to the typical narrow band signal produced by oscillators and most frequency generators. Lowering EMI by increasing a signal’s bandwidth is called ‘spread spectrum clock generation’. P 1 P 8160 A accepts an input from either a 27 MHz fundamental Crystal or from an external reference clock and generates a 100 MHz Spread Spectrum clock.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{significant}} improvements for {{measurements of the}} radio-frequency (RF) radiation properties of small antennas have been proposed and investigated. The main focus is on electrically small antennas as used in mobile communications systems. The methods proposed and evaluated in this thesis allow the minimisation of the dimensions of measurement chambers, and the methods also allow pattern measurements with a minimised error from the RF feed cable and thus lower measurement uncertainty. The first {{two parts of the}} work relate to measurements performed in especially small chambers. The aim is to provide an alternative measurement environment to large, fully anechoic chambers in the special case of small antenna calibrations. The use of small chambers such as GTEM cells and small anechoic chambers is proposed. Both options have been constructed and investigated by both simulations and measurements. The results show that a GTEM cell allows the reliable measurement of the radiation pattern and 3 -dB bandwidth of small antennas with a low directivity and a dynamic range of less than 20  dB. A small anechoic chamber with the largest dimension of 2. 5  m was built during the work for this thesis. The results obtained when measuring the 3 -D radiation pattern, efficiency and the gain of a small handset antenna in that small anechoic chamber show further that far-field measurements in such a small anechoic chamber does not result in greater measurement uncertainty than results obtained in conventional large anechoic chambers. Finally, the influence of the RF feed cables on the radiation characteristics of a small antenna under test has been reduced by a novel method. This method is based on a multi-frequency balun that efficiently suppresses the propagation of leakage and parasitic currents on the shielding of the RF feed cable. The effect of the balun has been thoroughly investigated by means of computer simulations and measurements with a prototype. Both the far field and the near field have been analysed to yield a comprehensive set of figures of merit, showing that the presented balun decreases the measurement uncertainty much better than other commonly used measures against cable effects, such as <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads.</b> The balun cannot only be used in radiation-pattern measurements in large or small anechoic chambers, but also in radio-channel measurements, in near-field scans and in Standard Absorption Rate (SAR) measurements. reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>ferrite</b> core or <b>bead</b> can {{be added}} to an {{inductor}} to improve, in two ways, its ability to block unwanted high frequency noise. First, the ferrite concentrates the magnetic field, increases inductance and therefore reactance, which impedes or ‘filters out’ the noise. Second, if the ferrite is so designed, it can produce an additional loss in the form of resistance in the ferrite itself. The ferrite creates an inductor with a very low Q factor. [...] This loss heats the ferrite, but normally it is a negligible amount of heat. While the signal level is large enough to cause interference, or undesirable effects in sensitive circuits, the energy blocked is typically quite small. Depending on the application, the resistive loss characteristic of the ferrite {{may or may not be}} desired.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{tendency}} of faster data rates and lower power supply voltage in the integrated circuit (IC) design, Simultaneously Switching Noise (SSN) and ground bounce become serious concerns for designers and testers. This noise can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI). It propagates through the power/ground planes on the printed circuit board (PCB) and it can couple to the nearby circuit affecting the performance of other devices. This noise results in antenna currents into connected cables and it can also increase the edge radiation from the PCB. In mixed signal systems it leads to sensitivity degradation or radiofrequency (RF) interference issues of radio-frequency circuits. This research work is focused on how to mitigate noise and reduce EMI by means of structuring the power plane of a PCB with Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) structures. A novel concept for ultra-wide-bandwidth suppression of SSN is proposed and implemented. This method consists of applying EBG cells with different stop bands creating noise isolation over a wide frequency region. The thesis starts with a general description of Power Distribution Network (PDN) of a PCB. It discusses the main challenges modern PCB designers are facing. Power and ground planes which are symmetric in shape and size create a resonating waveguide structure, an ideal path for SSN propagation. The mechanism of noise generation and propagation through the PDN and general approach of PDN noise reduction is discussed. Typically used methods include placement of EMI passives such as decoupling capacitors and <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> and via stitching. The drawback of these methods is the limited frequency bandwidth they can cover, and the need to integrate additional components. Reduction of SSN noise by means of EBG was intensively studied over the last decades. However, most of the structures are effective only in a limited frequency band. Often they are embedded in a PCB as a separate layer or require extra vias which increase the manufacturing cost. In this work a new type of planar EBG structures was proposed as a means to avoid the generation and propagation of common-mode currents due to SSN in the power plane of PCBs, and thereby reducing their radiated emissions. The EBG also have beneficial effects on the differential-mode noise in PDN due to the SSN. To guide the design of EBGs for SSN reduction, several modelling techniques of the EBG structures based on results achieved with full-wave electromagnetic simulations by means of CST Microwave Studio and transmission matrix analysis are used. The dispersion diagram of the proposed EBG structure is validated by insertion loss measurements of the prototype boards. It was shown that a power plane structure is needed only locally for circuitry decoupling by creating a low impedance current path. The effect of different PDN designs such as power plane, power track and 2 single-cell EBG structures and different sized cells EBG on the noise reduction in PCB with active components was investigated. Some high permittivity materials were implemented as a PCB substrate to create a large power-ground plane capacitance, and its effectiveness to reduce EMI was investigated. Many researchers have investigated the effect of EBG using passive elements only. In this thesis not only the passive elements behaviour is discussed, but a design with active components was used too. The reduction in radiated electromagnetic fields and common mode currents of PCB with active components and various PDNs was studied. An equivalent circuit of active boards with a PDN was created with a SPICE circuit simulator. The proposed new EBG structure behaves as a wideband low pass filter reducing EMI. The key result of the work presented in this thesis is that by applying EBG structured power plane and supporting each individual electronic module on the board by its own power patch interconnected by - relatively- thin traces, instead of standard power ground plane couples which are identical and parallel to each other, can reduce SSN, common mode noise and radiated emission of the PCB...|$|R
