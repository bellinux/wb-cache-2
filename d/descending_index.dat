40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{computing}} Voronoi cells for spatial objects whose lo-cations are not certain has been recently studied. In this work, we propose {{a new approach}} to compute Voronoi cells for the case of objects having rectangular un-certainty regions. Since exact computation of Voronoi cells is hard, we propose an approximate solution. The main idea of this solution is to apply hierarchical ac-cess methods for both data and object space. Our space index is used to efficiently find spatial regions which must (not) be inside a Voronoi cell. Our object index is used to efficiently identify Delauny relations, i. e., data objects which affect the shape of a Voronoi cell. We develop three algorithms to explore index structures and show that the approach that <b>descends</b> both <b>index</b> structures in parallel yields fast query processing times.

40|$|Coarctation of the aorta {{may develop}} during fetal life and impair {{quality of life}} in the adult because upper body {{hypertension}} and aneurysm formation in the descending aorta may develop. We used our computational model of the young adult arterial circulation, incorporated aorta coarctation over a range from 0 to 80 % and evaluated the effects in terms of forward pressure (P (+)) and backward pressure (P (-)). Predictions at several sites proximal and distal to the coarctation using an impedance-based waveform separation method (WSA) and the time-domain technique of wave intensity analysis (WIA) yielded comparable outcomes. A large reflected backward compression wave was seen proximal to the coarctation. Both techniques, WSA and WIA, gave the same results in terms of P (+) and P (-). A <b>descending</b> <b>index</b> (DI) was formulated as the difference between peak systolic pressure and valve closure pressure, divided by the pulse pressure. DI increased with stenosis severity for mild to moderate aortic coarctations that did not yet cause evident hypertension.

40|$|Objective: We {{wanted to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of stent placement using the coaxial technique with a stiff, long introducer sheath in patients with technical failure using an angiographic catheter for the obstructions proximal to the descending colon. Materials and Methods: Self-expandable metallic stent placement was attempted under fluoroscopy-guidance in 77 consecutive patients who had malignant colorectal obstruction. Stent placement was performed using an angiographic catheter and a guide wire. If the angiographic catheter could not be advanced over the guide wire into the obstructive lesions proximal to the descending colon, then a 6 -Fr introducer sheath was used. The technical success rate, the clinical success rate and the complications were analyzed. Results: Successful stent placement was achieved in 75 of 77 patients (97 %). The angiographic catheter failed to advance into the obstructive lesions of 11 patients (M:F = 7 : 4; mean age, 65. 5 years) whose lesions were {{at the level of}} the splenic flexure or transverse colon. Therefore, the coaxial technique was implemented in all these 11 patients using a 6 -Fr stiff introducer sheath and then the stent placement was successful. There were no complications related to the use of a stiff introducer sheath. Clinical success, which was defined as relief of clinical obstructive bowel symptoms, was obtained within 24 hours in all of patients. Conclusion: The coaxial technique using a stiff introducer sheath can increase the technical success of fluoroscopy-guided, self-expandable metallic stent placement in patients with colonic obstruction proximal to the <b>descending</b> colon. <b>Index</b> terms: Colon; Stent; Intervention; Fluoroscop...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether evolving techniques of aortic arch reconstruction used during the Norwood procedure decreased the incidence of postoperative aortic arch obstruction. MethodsOur technique for aortic arch reconstruction in patients undergoing the Norwood procedure has evolved from using an allograft patch (classic group, n = 26) to primary connection of the pulmonary artery and arch (autologous group, n = 20). More recently, {{we have used a}} novel technique involving coarctation excision, an extended end-to-end anastomosis {{on the back of the}} arch, and a counterincision on the anterior descending aorta to sew in an allograft patch for total arch reconstruction (interdigitating group, n = 33). Cardiac catheterizations performed before stage II palliation were reviewed for aortic diameters at multiple levels in 79 infants (median age, 4. 2 months). Aortic arch obstruction was defined as a ratio between the diameters of the arch anastomosis and the <b>descending</b> aorta (coarctation <b>index)</b> of less than 0. 7. ResultsOverall, 15 (19 %) children had aortic arch obstruction. All 15 required aortic intervention (balloon angioplasty, n = 12; surgical patch angioplasty, n = 2; both, n = 1). Aortic arch obstruction rates for the classic, autologous, and interdigitating groups were 46 % (n = 12), 15 % (n = 3), and 0 %, respectively (P >. 001). ConclusionReconstruction of the aortic arch with excision of ductal and coarctation tissue is associated with lower aortic arch obstruction rates in patients undergoing the Norwood procedure.

40|$|In {{this article}} we analyze the impact of aortic arch repair on the {{development}} of aortic obstruction when using a Norwood procedure. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 included patients who underwent neoaortic plasty performed by using bovine pericardial patches (group 1, n = 6). Group 2 consisted of patients, whose arch was repaired with autologous tissues only, without using bovine pericardial (group 2, n = 12). The groups were comparable by demographic data. To measure the aorta, we used cardiac catheterization data obtained before stage 2 of hemodynamic correction. Angiographic measurements were carried out at the level of distal anastomosis and <b>descending</b> aorta. Coarctation <b>index</b> (CI) was calculated as the ratio between distal anastomosis on neoaorta and descending aorta. Occurrence of aortic obstruction in groups 1 and 2 was 50 % (n = 3) and 16. 7 % (n = 2) respectively (p = 0. 137). The aorta at the level of distal anastomosis was greater in group 2 if compared with group 1. Differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. CI for groups 1 and 2 were 0. 730. 16 and 0. 90. 18 respectively (p = 0. 08). When comparing patients with the obstruction of the aortic arch and without it, the presence of ductus arteriosus tissue was found out to be associated with stenosis (p = 0. 019). The authors believe that the complete excision of coarctation tissue is {{one of the keys to}} prevention of postoperative aortic arch obstruction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the extent of atherosclerosis in coronary and iliac arteries in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or familial combined hyperlipidemia, using intravascular ultraound imaging. Background. Intravascular ultrasound imaging provides cross-sectional tomographic views of the vessel wall and allows quantitative assessment of atherosclerosis. Methods. Forty-eight nonsmoking, asymptomatic patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or familial combined hyperlipidemia underwent intravascular ultrasound imaging of the left anterior descending coronary, left main coronary and common iliac arteries. Angiography showed only minimal or no narrowing in these vessels. Intravascular ultrasound images obtained during catheter pullback underwent morphometric analysis. Plaque burden was expressed as the mean and maximal intimal index (ratio of plaque area and area within the internal elastic lamina) and as the percent of vessel surface covered by plaque. Results. Intravascular ultrasound detected plaque more frequently than angiography in the left anterior descending (80 % vs. 29 %, respectively), left main (44 % vs. 16 %) and iliac arteries (33 % vs. 27 %). Plaque burden was higher in the left anterior <b>descending</b> (mean intimal <b>index</b> [±SD] 0. 25 ± 0. 16) than in the left main (0. 11 ± 0. 16, p < 0. 001) and iliac arteries (0. 02 ± 0. 04, p < 0. 001). Angiography detected lumen narrowing only in coronary arteries with a maximal intimal index ⪰ 0. 42 (left anterior descending artery) and ⪰ 0. 43 (left main artery). The area within the internal elastic lamina increased with plaque area in the left anterior descending (r = 0. 82, p < 0. 001) and left main arteries (r = 0. 53, p < 0. 001). By stepwise multiple regression analysis, the strongest predictor for plaque burden in the left anterior descending artery was the level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and total/HDL cholesterol ratio for the left main artery. Conclusions. In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and familial combined hyperlipidemia, extensive coronary plaque is present despite minimal or no angiographic changes. Compensatory vessel enlargement and diffuse involvement with eccentric plaque {{may account for the}} lack of angiographic changes. Levels of HDL cholesterol and total/HDL cholesterol ratio are far more powerful predictors of coronary plaque burden than are low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in these patients with early, asymptomatic disease...|$|R
