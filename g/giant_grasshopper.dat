50|$|The {{largest of}} this widespread, varied complex of insects are the giant wetas of New Zealand, {{which is now}} split among 12 species. The largest {{of these is the}} Little Barrier Island giant weta (Deinacrida heteracantha), the largest {{specimen}} was weighed at 71.3 g, one of the largest insects weights ever known. These heavyweight insects can be over 9 cm long. The largest grasshopper species is often considered to be the Australian <b>giant</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Valanga irregularis), which ranges up to 9 cm in length. The American eastern lubber grasshopper (Romalea guttata) can allegedly range up to 10 cm in length. However, the greatest grasshopper sizes known, to 12 cm, have been cited in the South American <b>giant</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Tropidacris violaceus). The longest members of this order (although much lighter than the giant wetas) is the katydid Macrolyristes corporalis of Southeast Asia which can range up to 21.5 cm with its long legs extended and can have a wingspan of 20 cm.|$|E

5000|$|The Hollywood Reporter {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, {{noting that the}} [...] "first of many unintentional laughs in Dario Argento's Dracula 3D comes on the opening credits" [...] and [...] "this is a tired rehash that adds little to the canon aside from such outré touches as having Drac shapeshift into a swarm of flies or a <b>giant</b> <b>grasshopper</b> in one howler of a scene." [...] Variety also gave the film a negative review, stating, [...] "director Argento half-heartedly mixes schlocky 3D f/x with one-dimensional characters for a near-two-hour joke that {{ought to have been}} funnier." ...|$|E

5000|$|Born in the Swiss town of Wohlen, Sforza {{started his}} career in his {{hometown}} club FC Wohlen. He was signed by FC Aarau in 1989, where he impressed commentators and fans alike. Sforza's precocious talent was soon noticed, and he was signed by Swiss <b>giants</b> <b>Grasshoppers</b> Zurich one year later. He represented Grasshoppers during three successful seasons, also setting a record for the club as the youngest player to make his debut in the Swiss League. He won the 1991 Swiss Super League championship with the club, and made his national team debut in August 1991. In 1993, after winning the [...] "Swiss footballer of the Year" [...] award, he moved abroad to Germany to play for 1. FC Kaiserslautern.|$|R
50|$|König {{began his}} career with FC Nitra in 1991 but never played any games at the club and moved to FC Spartak Trnava in 1993. He {{impressed}} during his two season at Spartak and was noticed by ŠK Slovan Bratislava whom he signed for in 1995. He went on to play over 100 matches for Slovan over five seasons and earned {{his place in the}} Slovak national team. In 2000, he signed for Swiss <b>giants</b> <b>Grasshopper</b> Club Zürich but failed to make his mark in the first-team and left to join rivals FC Basel he played just one season and went on to play for FC Concordia Basel on loan and FC Zürich before leaving Switzerland for Turkey's Elazığspor in 2003.

5000|$|Jay Curtis {{hosted the}} show as Sal U. Lloyd, a play on the word celluloid. Bruce Mueller played [...] "The Other Guy" [...] and would often dress up as The Mummy, A Lion Tamer, and the Network Producer. Curtis and Mueller wrote and {{produced}} the show. Fred Stern was a constant contributor and served as the shows musical director. Stern chose popular music that was added to scenes for comic punctuation. As an example, during the film Beginning of the End, <b>giant</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> are attacking Chicago, scientists decide to use the grasshopper mating call to lure the creatures into Lake Michigan but instead of the mating call coming from a boat loudspeaker, the audience hears At the Hop by Danny and the Juniors and the monsters hop in and drown. San Diego radio announcer Gary Cocker appeared on the show many times. Guests included Whoopi Goldberg, Richard Simmons, and J. Michael Straczynski. The show was done so cheaply, the producers would tape over the same reels, thus erasing the previous episode. In the show, Curtis and Muellers microphone cords are easily visible, {{but it is the}} poor production quality that makes the show more humorous.|$|R
50|$|Mites, Pauropoda, Isopoda and Collembola {{inhabit the}} island.The most studied insect orders are Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Psocoptera, Odonata, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Dermaptera.

There are 521 species of Lepidoptera, with 197 endemic (38%), notably the butterfly Montrouzier's swallowtail (Papilio montrouzieri), Graphium gelon, Polyura gamma, Paratisiphone lyrnessa, Austroypthima petersi and a sphinx moth Compsulyx cochereaui.|$|R
5000|$|Jean Henri Fabre first {{appears in}} the {{beginning}} of the first episode, when he attempts to steal the [...] "Immortal Beloved." [...] He rides a <b>giant</b> mechanical <b>grasshopper</b> and can control bees and other insects to use as weapons. Like the insects he studied, juvenile Fabres are shown moulting from one form to another, growing from child to adult in a few days. Two Fabres are shown in the series; the first Fabre apparently dies by crashing into a Tokyo office building, but actually moulted and escaped, taking the form of a child until he fights and is killed by Drake Anderson within the I-Jin base.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Yomiko Readman {{gets her}} hands on an {{ultra-rare}} German first edition book, [...] "die Unsterbliche Liebe" [...] (or [...] "The Immortal Beloved"). The book is dusty and dirty, but has sheet music handwritten in its pages, in the margins and on the blank pages {{in the back and}} front. Almost immediately she is attacked by a superhuman-like clone of Jean Henri Fabre riding a <b>giant</b> mecha <b>grasshopper.</b> He tries to steal her book, but she fights back and wins, exhibiting a superhuman ability to manipulate paper. A man in a suit walks up to her moments later, asking [...] "The Paper" [...] to accompany him. We learn that Yomiko is an agent of the British Library special operations division, a group tasked to locating and protecting rare books worldwide.|$|R
