40|$|The paper {{presents}} an analytical {{model for the}} prediction of the substrate temperature in vacuum web coaters. The model {{is based on the}} theory of heat transfer between a continuously moving workpiece and a stationary source, or sink, of energy. The investigation concerns the Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) of a metal layer on a polymer film by means of thermal evaporation, but many aspects apply equally well to sputtering and electron beam evaporation. The contributions to the specific heat load on the web are quantified, and the influence of the heat exchange between the film and the <b>cooling</b> <b>drum</b> is discussed in detail. After satisfactorily comparing the predictions with available literature results, the model is used as a guideline for a series of experimental tests aimed at determining the influence of the operating conditions on the final quality of the products obtained from vacuum deposition of thick metal layers on thin polymer substrates. The experimental results demonstrate the influence of the mechanical traction of the web on the thermal conductance between the film and the <b>cooling</b> <b>drum...</b>|$|R
40|$|When a {{gas turbine}} engine is shut down it will develop a {{circumferential}} thermal gradient vertically across the compressor due to hot air rising from the cooling metal components and pooling at the top. As the hot compressor rotor <b>drum</b> <b>cools</b> and contracts {{in the presence of}} this thermal gradient, it does so non-uniformly, and therefore will bend slightly, in a phenomenon known as rotor bow. Starting an engine under bowed conditions can result in damage, representing a risk to both airworthiness and operational capability. This research has developed a numerical approach involving 3 D unsteady conjugate heat transfer computational fluid dynamics one-way coupled to finite element analysis using simplified analogue models to conduct a parametric study into rotor thermal bow. The research has also developed a technique for studying rotor thermal bow experimentally, which also serves to partially validate the numerical approach. Through the conduct of a Plackett-Burman screening test, this research has found that of all the geometric, environmental, and operational parameters which define the simplified gas turbine models, diameter, length, and case wall thickness were the most influential, with diameter and length being significantly more influential than any other parameters. Further detailed analysis of these top three parameters was conducted using the same numerical technique applied to a quasi-random Sobol' sequence, allowing the design space to be interpolated using kriging. These detailed results confirmed that the rotor thermal bow phenomenon is largely dominated by bending member stiffness; however, the effect of diameter is non-linear, as increasing diameter will increase stiffness, but also increase the vertical temperature difference - two competing effects. This research has also investigated and discussed the operational impacts of rotor thermal bow, and outlined existing and possible mitigation strategies in addition to those fundamental design considerations which flow from the parametric study...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the rates of cooling of vehicle brake drums and discs. Thermocouples were inserted in the drums and discs and in the wheel hubs and their outputs fed via slip ring units to meters mounted inside the vehicle. The drums or discs were heated to a uniform temperature of 30 O 0 - 40 OcC by drag braking and the rate at which they cooled measured while the vehicle was driven at constant speed. Measure-ments were made at various speeds in the range 0 to 90 mile/h. From the log (temperature) against time plot a cooling coefficient b, was determined. It is shown that at a vehicle speed v the quantity b, can be expressed in the form b, = bo +KVO. ~ where b, represents the loss of heat to the hub and K is a constant depending on {{the size and shape of}} the drum or disc. Values of these constants have been determined on a variety of cars having discs and drums varying from 7 in to 11 in diameter and on a lorry fitted with 16. 75 in diameter <b>drums.</b> <b>Cooling</b> rates are shown to depend on shape and size of the disc or drum. Results show that the cooling rates of front brakes are about 20 per cent higher than the rear brakes and that front discs cool about 25 per cent more quickly than the corresponding drum size recom-mended for the same vehicle. The cooling rate of front discs did not change when wire wheels were fitted instead of solid wheels. Ventilated discs and solid discs were also compared. The effect of fitting dust shields on disc brakes is shown to reduce the cooling rates by about 30 per cent. The effect of otherwise disturbing the air flow was studied...|$|R

While recording in Hollywood, the band members bought cheap turntables from Amoeba Music and listened to many vinyl records for inspiration, including albums by The Beat and The Plimsouls. Armstrong cited as inspiration the music of The Kinks' Ray Davies, The Pretty Things' S.F.
