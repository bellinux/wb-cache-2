5|$|John Verbruggen {{was one of}} the {{original}} rebels and had been offered a share in the actors' company, but became disgruntled when his wife Susanna, a popular comedian, was not. For Rich, it was a stroke of luck to get Susanna and John back into his depleted and unskilled troupe. John's availability to play Loveless remained precarious, however. In September, when The Relapse had still not been staged after six months of trying (probably because Rich was still parleying with Cibber about his availability as Lord Foppington), John was still complaining about his <b>employment</b> <b>situation,</b> even getting into a physical fight over it at the theatre. This misbehaviour caused the Lord Chamberlain to declare his contract void {{and at the same time}} order him to stay with the Patent Company until January 1697, to give Rich time to find a replacement. The original Loveless was thus finally guaranteed for an autumn season run of The Relapse. Since the loyal Verbruggen couple always moved as a unit, Susanna's services were also assured.|$|E

40|$|Sweden {{adopted a}} new {{anti-discrimination}} legislation 2009, DiskL, which aim to prevent {{direct and indirect}} discrimination in matters of employment and occupation. According to directives and practices from EU, pregnant workers are entitled a special protection from discrimination during <b>employment</b> <b>situations.</b> The purpose of this essay is to study the legal protection for pregnant workers in <b>employment</b> <b>situations</b> and also analyze whether male workers have similar protection when they plan parental leave. Both regulations from the EU-law and the Swedish law are presented and discussed. This because Swedish discrimination legislation is largely influenced by the EU-law. The study confirms that pregnant workers have a strong legal protection against discrimination through directives from the EU and DiskL. Employers must include this protection in <b>employment</b> <b>situations.</b> If hiring a pregnant worker implicates costs for employers, {{it is still not}} an accepted reason not to follow the regulation. The protection for a pregnant worker is always considered more important than an employer's financial loss, independent if the employment is fixed-term or permanent. The study also shows that male workers are protected against unfair treatment in <b>employment</b> <b>situations</b> according to 16 § föräldraledighetslagen. However, the protection of male workers is not as strong as the protection from discrimination of pregnant workers in <b>employment</b> <b>situations.</b> ...|$|R
