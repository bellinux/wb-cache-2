40|$|Many {{billions of}} dollars each year are spent in pursuit of {{economic}} and social development goals. The field of program evaluation aims to measure the efficacy of these programs and allocate funds to achieve optimal results. However, current research on program design and evaluation tends to focus on determining causality through complex statistical methods, neglecting intermediate measures of data, such as network metrics. Similarly, research in computational social science has focused on generating hypotheses and validating theory rather than economic development applications. This thesis develops a novel technique for using computational social science to design and evaluate social and economic programs. A framework for program design and evaluation using network metrics is presented, along with two case studies that illustrate the use of this technique. In the first, we consider Start-Up Chile, an economic development program whose goal is to foster networks between Chileans and international entrepreneurs, using network metrics to evaluate its ability to facilitate connection between Chilean and non- Chilean entrepreneurs. Second, an agent-based model for designing <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incubators</b> is developed, with novel conclusions for more efficient design of economic development programs. </p...|$|R

This paper investigates a methodology {{for assessing the}} potential for success of new ventures set up {{at an early stage}} by engineering students via an evaluation of the entrepreneurial personalities of engineering students. The survey of 215 students of Manufacturing Engineering indicates particular traits have a strong predictive impact on the proclivity towards the different 'idea factors on innovation' suggested by Goldenberg et al. [1999]. In particular, 'risk-taking propensity' and 'need to achieve' are two critical characteristics that significantly influence the selection of 'success-intended' idea factors whereas 'external locus of control' influences the selection of 'failure-intended' idea factors. The findings have important implications for researchers, business incubators, and policy makers inside and outside universities.

40|$|Although {{incubators}} {{have become}} one of the most prominent instruments to stimulate the emergence and growth of start-ups, questions are being raised about their effectiveness. One major obstacle to evaluate the effectiveness of incubators is that the incubator remains a ‘black box’: the extant literature focuses on the inputs and outputs of the incubator, while neglecting the process in between. This dissertation aims to ‘unpaint’ the black box by exploring the practices and mechanisms that underlie the incubation process. This dissertation starts with a series of qualitative studies to inductively identify practices through which incubators facilitate access to resources, learning and networking. Data consists of a total of 281 interviews with entrepreneurs and incubator managers. To explore the role of the incubator’s context, data was collected in different regions (Europe, Silicon Valley, Australia, Israel and the greater Boston area). After these qualitative studies, this dissertation tests which of the three incubation mechanisms (i. e. access to resources, learning and networks) are most important in the incubation process. First, the importance of these mechanisms as perceived by entrepreneurs perceive is explored through a Discrete Choice Experiment. Then, the influence of these mechanisms on start-up performance is tested. Overall, the findings identify networking a key, yet underappreciated, mechanism of the incubation process. The incubator’s networks contribute to start-up performance by enabling start-ups to access missing resources, to efficiently acquire market, business and technological knowledge, to gain legitimacy and to overcome challenges in the <b>entrepreneurial</b> ecosystem. <b>Incubators</b> use a variety of practices to facilitate such networks, both between start-ups and between start-ups and other actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Paradoxically, entrepreneurs may not perceive the value of these networks. Entrepreneurs may be ‘unconsciously incompetent’, as they are not aware of the gaps in their start-up’s resource base that the incubator’s networks can address. Further, building networks takes time; entrepreneurs may prioritize activities that yield immediate value. This creates a mismatch between the services that start-ups want from an incubator and the services that start-ups need to succeed. Policy makers should be careful to see that inexperienced entrepreneurs make poor policy advisors since they are unable to adequately recognize their needs. Incubator managers need to actively stimulate entrepreneurs to take advantage of the incubation process; they can use the practices outlined in this dissertation as a practical guideline This dissertation challenges the dominant discourse on the incubation process. Incubators are often seen as a ‘safe haven’ that protects start-ups when they are most vulnerable. This dissertation shows that incubators not only act as a safe haven, but also as a ‘pressure cooker’. Incubators provide pressure to stimulate entrepreneurs to make use of the incubator’s resources, to provide the shock that is necessary to trigger higher order learning and to create peer pressure in the networks of the start-up community...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Business Administration)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. In both {{developed}} and developing countries, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) create employment opportunities and can therefore improve the standard of living. The South African Government have embarked {{on a number of}} initiatives in support of SMEs. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the SEDA Technology Programme (STP) have a number of assistance programmes that are being implemented in support of SMEs. Although there have been many varied studies on business incubators, there is still a need for research to determine the importance of entrepreneurial skills for the development of successful incubators. Business incubators are essentially organisations that assist to increase survival rates of innovative start-up companies and support the <b>entrepreneurial</b> process. <b>Incubators</b> provide resources and services to entrepreneurs, including working space or physical offices, technical expertise, management mentoring, assistance in compiling an effective business plan, shared administrative services, technical support, business networking, advice on intellectual property and sources of financing, markets as well as strict admission and exit rules, which are designed to ensure that the incubator concentrates its efforts in helping innovative and fast-growth business start-ups that are likely to {{have a significant impact on}} the local economy. This therefore reduces the start-up capital and overhead costs, and allows the entrepreneur to focus on his/her core business whilst receiving operational support and hand-held coaching. The incubator concept supports the clients’ development journey to ensure business sustainability and growth. The main objective of the study is to determine the role that business incubators play in filling entrepreneurial-skills requirements for SMEs in the Cape metropolitan District. The population of this study comprised all the business incubators on the data base of one of the organisations that promotes SME development strategies and programmes in the Cape Metropolitan Area (CAM). All of the five business incubators that were registered on the database of a local organisation, known as Traction, during the course of the investigation, were deemed suitable for the study and therefore comprised the sample, which promotes SMEs’ development. The study utilises a mixed approach of quantitative and qualitative methods to collect data. From a quantitative point of view, questionnaires are utilised, while face-to-face interviews is used as a qualitative method. A maximum of seventy questionnaires is administered to incubated SMEs, 28 questionnaires were returned and all qualified for data analysis. This amounts to a 40 % response rate. To complement the survey questionnaire, five face-to-face interviews were conducted with business incubators. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was utilised to analyse the quantitative data, whereas qualitative data was analysed by means of content analysis and the results for both methods were presented in the format of figures, tables and charts...|$|R
