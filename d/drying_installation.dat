Drying of a chip and of a stem without bark could be successfully described with a diffusion equation for a plane sheet and a cylinder, respectively. Drying of a stem with bark could be successfully described as drying of a stem without bark surrounded by a thin layer (bark) with a much lower diffusivity. Compared to a chip, a stem without bark dried approximately 10 times slower from fresh state to equilibrium moisture content, mainly due to the larger diffusion distance of the stem. A stem with bark dried approximately 10 times slower than a stem without bark due to the low diffusivity of the bark...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Spray drying is {{used for}} the {{manufacture}} of many consumer and industrial products such as instant dairy and food products, laundry detergents, pharmaceuticals, ceramics and agrochemi-cals. During spray drying, agglomerates of powder particles are formed, which determine the instant properties of the powder. Agglomeration during spray drying {{is considered to be a}} difficult process to control. The main cause of this is the complex interaction of the process variables: the atomization process, the mixing of spray and hot air, the drying of suspension droplets and the collision of par-ticles which might lead to coalescence or agglomeration. As a consequence, agglomeration during spray drying is operated by trial-and-error. In an EC-sponsored project, named the EDECAD pro-ject and co-ordinated by NIZO food research, an industrially validated computer model, using Com-putational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology, to predict agglomeration processes in spray drying machines is developed. An Euler-Lagrange approach with appropriate elementary models for dry-ing, collision, coalescence and agglomeration of the dispersed phase is used. The main result of the EDECAD project is a so-called “Design Tool”, which establishes relations between the configura-tion of the <b>drying</b> <b>installation</b> (geometry, nozzle selection), process conditions, product composition and final powder properties.

A solar <b>drying</b> <b>installation</b> for waste-water sludge in Füssen, Germany, designed by Thermo-System ® and the University of Hohenheim, has been used to collect data for the establishment of a drying-rate function. In this solar dryer, wet sludge is uniformly spread over a concrete floor under a greenhouse-like transparent cover. The sludge is intermittently mixed by means of a autonomous robot (electric mole®), while the air under the cover is ventilated (horizontally) and mixed (vertically) by electric fans. Data of evaporation rate, environmental conditions and control operations were collected over three drying cycles. Evaporation rate via sludge sampling and via vapour balance across the structure compared favourably, justifying the use of the hourly vapour-balance data to develop linear regression and non-linear neural network (NN) models to predict the evaporation rate. The most important predictors of evaporation turn out to be (1) outdoor solar radiation (2) outdoor air temperature, and (3) the ventilation flux. The dry solids content of the sludge is next in importance, but could not be quantified with confidence over the domain, for lack of sufficient data.

Convective drying in chamber driers is the presentday dominant technique for wood desiccation. Nevertheless, available scientific literature on the subject does not place high emphasis {{on the issue of}} gas flow structure inside the drier installations and, in particular, in the clearance between horizontal rows of stacked saw timber. Whereas, the air flowing between horizontal rows facilitates wood heating and moisture removing from the boundary layer. The present article studies aerodynamics of the experimental timber drying test stand at the A. V. Luikov Heat and Mass Transfer Institute of NAS of Belarus. The timber drying test stand geometry structure is complicated, which is why aerodynamics valuation of the drier agent in the chamber involves the software system ANSYS Fluent 14. 5. For that end, the researchers developed the convective drier installation geometrical model. A physico-mathematical simulation was developed for sawn timber convective drying aerodynamics in the timber drying test stand of the Heat and Mass Transfer Institute. Based on the computations made, the drier agent flow configuration was analyzed, stagnant pockets identified. It was found that the timber drying test stand was not operating within its optimal aerodynamic conditions. The drying chamber optimal aerodynamic conditions determination includes accounting for an additional canal between the chamber rear wall and the timber stack, absence of the screen above the stack, and presence of the screen between the floor and the stack.

40|$|AbstractFor {{carbon dioxide}} capture and storage (CCS), various {{specifications}} of the water content in CO 2 have been given. These specifications range from 40 to 500  ppm. Unfortunately, little has been published on the rationale behind these concentration limits. The present lack of clarity on the dryness requirements is undesirable, because eventually, we must come to a water content standard for CCS that ensures cost-efficient CO 2 transport. The work presented here aims at analyzing CO 2 transport to provide some basic input for this standard. CO 2 captured from power plants always contains moisture. The water can be removed {{to a certain extent}} at the capture plant, but a small amount of water will remain. When the water is in solution in the CO 2, there is no problem, but free water combined with CO 2 is very acidic. The corrosive nature of wet CO 2 poses a threat to the transport system integrity. Economical considerations lead to the use of regular carbon steel, which is commonly used for most pipelines. Corrosion resistant steel would inhibit corrosion, but it would be prohibitively expensive to build CCS pipelines with this type of steel. On one hand, using regular carbon steel requires corrosion tests to quantify the destructive effects of free water in case it is present in the CO 2. On the other hand, the occurrence of free water must be excluded as much as possible. No free water anywhere in the CO 2 transport system would be the most straightforward way of protecting it. Drying captured CO 2 costs both money and energy and reduces flexibility in the CCS chain, so a water concentration limit should not be more stringent than necessary. A quick overview of the solubility of water in CO 2 is given to enable a discussion of the operational limits of the CCS transport chain. For normal operation, the pressure range of dense phase CO 2 in a pipeline transmission system is between 85 and 150 bars onshore and between 85 and 200 bars offshore. The lower limit is determined by the critical point of CO 2 (73, 8 bars for pure CO 2, somewhat different for CO 2 with impurities). A pressure of 85 bars ensures the CO 2 remains in the dense phase in case of a temporary shutdown. The upper limits of 150 and 200 bars are chosen with regard to safety and economical optimization. Expected CO 2 characteristics in the transport network include a minimum temperature of 0  °C (onshore) or 4  °C (offshore) and a maximum temperature of over 30  °C immediately after a compressor. This leads to a water solubility of at least 1500 ppm during normal operation. Commissioning of a CO 2 pipeline and blowdown scenarios are discussed. The relation between the CO 2 conditions during planned blowdowns and the water content should be investigated. Unplanned blowdown could involve a rapid decompression and temperature drop, for which there are no validated models available. Therefore {{it is difficult to determine}} the right water concentration limit. It was found that for a good technical and economical basis for determining the required water concentration limit some questions remain to be answered. Cost data of <b>drying</b> <b>installations</b> are needed. It should be found out what are acceptable blowdown conditions as a function of water concentration. Some thermodynamical issues are brought up as well. Finally the impurities present in the captured CO 2 will need to be taken into account. Although in the USA, no serious problems seem to have surfaced with around 500 ppm water in CO 2, several research questions need to be addressed to arrive at a sound and cost efficient water concentration limit. This work is carried out within CO 2 EuroPipe, an EU research project under the 7 th Framework Programme. This project, which runs for 2, 5 years, until November 2011, aims at paving the road towards large-scale, Europe-wide infrastructure for the transport and injection of CO 2 captured from industrial sources and low-emission power plants...|$|R
