40|$|In this chapter, an {{asymmetric}} DSGE {{model is}} built {{in order to}} account for asymmetries in business cycles. One {{of the most important}} contributions of this work is the construction of a general utility function which nests loss aversion, risk aversion and <b>habits</b> <b>formation</b> by means of a smooth transition function. The main idea behind this asymmetric utility function is that under recession the agents over-smooth consumption and leisure choices in order to prevent a huge deviation of them from the reference level of the utility; while under boom, the agents simply smooth consumption and leisure, but trying to be as far as possible from the reference level of utility. The simulations of this model by means of Perturbations Method show {{that it is possible to}} reproduce asymmetrical business cycles where recession (on shock) are stronger than booms and booms are more long-lasting than recession. One additional and unexpected result is a downward stickiness displayed by real wages. As a consequence of this, there is a more persistent fall in employment in recession than in boom.

40|$|Introduction and AimsBreakfast is {{the most}} {{important}} meal that {{plays an important role in}} adolescents’ health. Eating breakfast caused to increasing the diet quality and preventing chronic diseases. This study examines not having breakfast and some related demographic factors in 14 - 18 years old adolescents of Sanandaj. Materials and MethodsIn this study, 553, 14 - 18 years old students of Sanandaj’s high schools were selected randomly. Providing a checklist, demographic and anthropometric information of all participant were collected. Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 16 software, Chi-square test and t-test. Results 41 (7. 5 %) of teens didn’t have eat breakfast, and 59 (10. 7 %) had breakfast one or two days a week. Breakfast consumption was significantly higher in boys than girls (P < 0. 001). The results showed that the level of parental education was correlated with eating breakfast by adolescents (P < 0. 05). There was no significant relationship between body mass index in adolescents with eating breakfast (P = 0. 16). Breakfast consumption declined with age in adolescents (P < 0. 003). ConclusionBreakfast consumption in adolescents is influenced by demographic factors. Parents’ high level of education, as well as higher employment levels influences the perseverance of having breakfast in adolescents during the week. Thus, parents play a decisive role in <b>habits</b> <b>formation</b> of eating breakfast in their teens. * Corresponding Author: Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Department of Nutrition, Children Growth and Development Research Center.

This longitudinal and cross-sectional study aimed to analyze {{the effectiveness of a}} motivational activity program for oral hygiene <b>habits</b> <b>formation</b> after motivation and without constant reinforcement. Materials and Methods: The sample was constituted of 26 children (mean 6 years old) from a Public Kindergarten School in Ponta Grossa, PR, Brazil. Data were collected applying a test-chart, with figures reporting the process of dental health/illness. Some figures were considered positive to dental health (dentist/Cod 1, toothbrush/Cod 3, dentifrice/dental floss/Cod 6, fruits/vegetables/Cod 7 and tooth without caries lesion/Cod 8) and negative on dental health (sweets/Cod 2, bacteria/Cod 4, tooth with caries lesion/Cod 5). The figures presentation occurred in three different stages: First stage - figures were presented to children without previous knowledge; second stage - following the motivational presentation, and third stage - 30 days after the first contact. Results: On the first stage, most children select good for the figures considered harmful to their teeth (Cod 2 - 88 %; Cod 4 - 77 % and Cod 5 - 65 %). On the second stage, there was a lower percentage: 23 % (P < 0. 0001), 8 % (P < 0. 0001), and 23 % (P = 0. 0068) related to the Cod 2, 4, and 5. On the third stage, the results showed again an association with the good choice to these figures considered harmful (Cod 2 - 85 %, Cod 4 - 65 % and Cod 5 - 54 %) similar the results obtained on the first stage.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{capacity}} expansion {{investment decisions}} on the provision of municipal sewerage are the central aspects of this analysis. The purpose is to present a methodology, utilizing a dynamic demand and supply model of sewerage, for recommending a set of values for the investment and pricing decision variables. The outcome of the investment decisions is an economically efficient time sequence of capacity expansions. The pricing decisions involves a departure from an economically efficient set of user charges, i. e. from marginal cost pricing. The model consists of a cost function, i. e. amount of capacity and variable operating factors used per period times price; a set of production process equations transforming influent to effluent water quality standards; {{and a set of}} factors affecting influent, cost, and production. The factors taken into consideration are: Economies of size in capacity expansion costs, technological change, inflation, deterioration of capacity and economic life of capacity, discounting to present value, time horizon of model, changes in effluent water quality standards, and changes in the flow of influent due to an increase in users, price elasticity of the flow of influent and changes in water consumptive <b>habits,</b> <b>formation</b> of substitutes through technological change, as well as rainstorm drainage and infiltration. It is the investment decisions on timing of capacity expansions and mix of capacity types in each expansion which are of concern. These investment decisions must be considered simultaneously with those on economic amortization of capacity expansion costs and economic life of capacity, as well as use of, variable operating factors in the production process. Furthermore consideration for pricing in terms of user charges is given. By simultaneously solving a set of necessary marginal conditions associated with the investment decision variables and use of variable operating factors, the timing of capacity expansions and mix of capacity types in each expansion may be derived. With the existence of several capacity types, several variable operating factors, numerous feasible times for a capacity expansion, and a set of complex equations representing the production process; the use of a simulation analysis is imperative. Formulation of a simulation model should be {{on the basis of the}} equations developed in this analysis. Though the values of the decision variables resulting from a Simulation analysis may not be optimal, i. e. minimize present value cost subject to a production output constraint, the present value cost for a set of feasible time sequence of capacity expansions may be compared under various influent, cost, and production conditions...|$|R
