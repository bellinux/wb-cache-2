40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes a}} comparative {{exploration of the}} use of some metadiscourse resources in a small corpus of texts from popular scientific magazines in English and Italian, namely Scientific American (henceforth SA) and Le Scienze (henceforth LS). Scientific popularization is a meeting point of different discourse communities with their own needs, intentions and modes of communication (see Calsamiglia 2003, Myers 2003, Gotti 2005, 2013). Metadiscourse (cf., among others, Crismore and Farnsworth 1990, Crismore, Markkanen, Steffensen 1993, Hyland 1998, 2005) can be modulated and can modulate communication in different ways, as it covers a variety of linguistic elements which are aimed at organizing the text for its readers – the interactive dimension – and at engaging them in exposition and argumentation – the interactional dimension (see Hyland 2005). Recent research (e. g. Neff and Dafouz 2008, Musacchio and Ahmad 2009, Musacchio and Palumbo 2010, Suau 2010, Masi 2013) has indeed pursued comparisons of metadiscourse devices associated with scientific discourse domains and genres of popularisation in different languages to appraise the extent of cross-linguistic correspondence and avoid, for example, inappropriate translations. 	Special attention is here devoted to both interactive and interactional devices of metadiscourse, i. e. the representation of scientific and non-scientific ‘actors’ (cf. Calsamiglia 2003, Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) through a range of acts of reporting as evidentials, i. e. the most explicit form of inclusion of other-discourse/voice in one’s discourse, as well as through a selection of self-mention and engagement markers lending themselves to quantitative along with qualitative evaluation. Altogether, the variety of <b>items</b> <b>under</b> <b>analysis</b> can be viewed as representing the three axes (third person reference vs. I/we vs. you) for the construction and evaluation of the roles of different identities (including text producer and implied target receiver) in scientific popularisation. Language diversification, then, is here tackled both from the intra-linguistic standpoint of the different construction of identities within a form of media discourse, and from a cross-linguistic viewpoint, i. e. the extent to which such constructions differ in the two language samples in question, in the attempt to ultimately detect possible preferential metadiscourse strategies that are specific to each language represented in the corpus. The macro-analytical background presupposed by the works here referred to (in particular Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) is that of Critical Discourse Analysis, although the implications of the present research are also relevant for the perspective of Language Variation (and, to some extent, for Translation too) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with synchronic variation as the reflection and residue of language change. The empirical focus is the negation system of Fɛʔfɛʔ. The leading question is whether there exists a roadmap leading from the wild variation observed in Fɛʔfɛʔ to languages which like Modern English make use of a dedicated marker of negation. The thesis advocated is that language change is {{the means by which}} the Fɛʔfɛʔ type of languages can be related to the Modern English type. The argumentation builds on cross-generational variation within Fɛʔfɛʔ, on data from related languages, and on data from languages with historical records. From a Saussurean perspective, synchronic and diachronic phenomena do not in any way relate to each other. However, diverging from Saussure, Labow (1965) launches the apparent-time approach that builds on synchronic variation as a screen into diachronic change. Hence, it becomes possible to disclose the dynamic tendencies embedded in the synchronic system, thus relegating ‘the antinomy between synchrony and diachrony to the periphery as seen from the English, French, Cairese, and Welsh data explored in this thesis. From a Fɛʔfɛʔ internal perspective, I offer a comparative analysis taking into consideration the variation attested between teenagers and elderly speakers. In this regard, we observe that sì and si̍… bα̍ are invading the negation system, thus forcing the exit of older markers. Moreover, when the present adult generation is interposed between teenagers and elderly speakers, we observe between the three generations a subtle continuum bringing together archaic and innovating patterns peacefully co-existing within the overall speech community. Building on the parallelism between the Fɛʔfɛʔ data and the data from languages with historical record, I propose for Fɛʔfɛʔ an analysis of the same nature as the one advocated to account for similar kinds of variation across language families, namely, a Jespersen Cycle (JC) analysis. However, I do not embrace the standard version of the JC which implicitly postulates that the <b>items</b> <b>under</b> <b>analysis</b> are discrete entities stemming from discontinuous periods of time, with each time frame bringing its own marker as it goes. Rather, I perceive in cross-generational variation a miniature reflection of different periods of time imbricated into each other {{in the form of an}} undisrupted continuum. Hence, an item may span two or more generations and overlap with other items innovated in later generations. Moreover, this corroborates the facts observed in the present and past states of languages with historical records discussed, thus raisings for the parametric enterprise the challenge of addressing the situation of language internal variation that pervades across language families against the background of the standardly well accepted view that variation equals parameterization. Immediately related to this is the need to capture co-existing variants originating from different periods on a single clausal structure. I address this question after proposing a relative chronology for the co-existing markers attested in today’s Fɛʔfɛʔ. The broadly comparative approach adopted to sort out the Fɛʔfɛʔ data constitutes an inspiration for the analysis of languages that don’t have written records from previous generations...|$|E

40|$|Objetivou-se validar um modelo de comunicaÃÃo nÃo-verbal para o atendimento de enfermagem Ã clientela cega, segundo o referencial teÃrico de E. T. Hall (1986). Trata-se de um estudo metodolÃgico, desenvolvido no LabCom_SaÃde do Departamento de Enfermagem da UFC, no perÃodo de outubro de 2007 a junho de 2008. Foram selecionados 15 cegos e 15 enfermeiros para comporem cada grupo, treinado e nÃo-treinado e ambos tiveram as mesmas caracterÃsticas. Os cegos foram contatados por meio da AssociaÃÃo dos Cegos do Estado do CearÃ e os enfermeiros a partir dos Centros AcadÃmicos. A fase de coleta de dados do grupo nÃo-treinado deu-se durante o mÃs de abril de 2008, por meio de {{consulta}}s. Estas ocorreram dentro do LabCom_SaÃde e os dados foram coletados por meio de filmagens. O primeiro passo para a construÃÃo do modelo foram os estudos realizados acerca da teoria de Hall (1986). Subdividiu-se a consulta de enfermagem em quatro etapas denominadas etapas do cuidado. Em cada etapa de cuidado sÃo orientadas as aÃÃes do enfermeiro, descreve-se a aÃÃo e como deve ser desenvolvida tal aÃÃo. A etapa do cuidado 1 refere-se Ã organizaÃÃo do ambiente para desenvolver a Consulta de Enfermagem. Na etapa do cuidado 2 o enfermeiro deve receber o paciente na entrada do consultÃrio para introduzi-lo no ambiente onde serÃ realizada a consulta e deve cumprimentÃ-lo e informar a localizaÃÃo dos mÃveis e objetos. JÃ a etapa do cuidado 3 aborda o desenvolvimento da CEnf propriamente dita. A etapa do cuidado 4 constitui-se a Ãltima etapa do modelo de comunicaÃÃo nÃo-verbal e enfoca a finalizaÃÃo da consulta e o encerramento da comunicaÃÃo com o paciente. ApÃs ser construÃdo, o referido modelo foi submetido Ã validaÃÃo aparente e de conteÃdo. Foi analisado por trÃs especialistas em comunicaÃÃo nÃo-verbal, por ser um nÃmero jÃ adotado em pesquisas anteriores. As sugestÃes incluÃdas no modelo se referiram Ã abrangÃncia, forma de apresentaÃÃo e representatividade do conteÃdo. Em seguida, iniciou-se a segunda etapa de validaÃÃo, por meio da qual o modelo foi submetido Ã testagem. Os enfermeiros e concludentes foram treinados de acordo tanto com as tÃcnicas de comunicaÃÃo pertinentes Ã utilizaÃÃo da comunicaÃÃo nÃo-verbal quanto em relaÃÃo Ã utilizaÃÃo do modelo com cegos. Quanto Ã coleta dos dados, foi realizada mediante o uso de trÃs cÃmeras filmadoras que registraram toda a consulta de enfermagem entre a enfermeira, o cego e o acompanhante, quando este estivesse presente. Para a anÃlise dos dados das filmagens foram escolhidos outros trÃs juÃzes, enfermeiros e estudantes do Programa de PÃs-GraduaÃÃo em Enfermagem, do nÃvel mestrado e doutorado, da UFC. Eles foram treinados em relaÃÃo Ã utilizaÃÃo do instrumento de anÃlise da comunicaÃÃo nÃo-verbal do enfermeiro-cego (CONVENCE) e do instrumento de validaÃÃo do modelo. Pelo fato deste estudo ser duplo cego, os juÃzes nÃo eram informados acerca de qual grupo, controle ou experimental, eram realizadas as anÃlises. Os dados coletados foram inseridos em planilha eletrÃnica com a utilizaÃÃo do programa SPSS, versÃo 14. 0, e analisados em freqÃÃncia absoluta por meio de tabelas univariadas. Para se analisar a associaÃÃo entre as variÃveis e os enfermeiros nos grupos controle e experimental, foram empregados os testes qui-quadrado (&# 967; 2) e o mÃximo de verossimilhanÃa. Cumpriram-se as normas que regulamentam pesquisas em seres humanos, conforme a ResoluÃÃo 196 / 96 do MinistÃrio da SaÃde. Ao se comparar as aÃÃes da etapa do cuidado 1 entre o grupo treinado e nÃo-treinado, observa-se que o grupo treinado obteve resultado excelente (p< 0, 0001) em quatro dos cinco itens avaliados. Somente o item âtemperaturaâ apresentou proporÃÃo aproximadamente igual na escala. Na Tabela 3, ao se comparar as aÃÃes da etapa do cuidado 2 entre os grupos, observa-se que o treinado obteve resultado excelente (p< 0, 05) em todos os itens avaliados. Portanto, houve associaÃÃo estatisticamente significante em todas as aÃÃes. Em relaÃÃo aos resultados obtidos pela Tabela 4, observam-se resultados excelentes (p< 0, 05) em oito dos nove itens avaliados do grupo treinado em relaÃÃo ao grupo nÃo-treinado na etapa do cuidado 3. Apenas o item referente a âseguir o roteiro da CEnfâ ficou prÃximo ao valor do teste, ressaltando que esta aÃÃo obteve forte indicador de associaÃÃo. Os dados da Tabela 5 mostraram tambÃm resultados excelentes (p< 0, 05) do grupo treinado em relaÃÃo ao grupo nÃo-treinado nas trÃs das quatro aÃÃes desenvolvidas na etapa do cuidado 4. Conforme se percebe na Tabela 6, todos os itens contribuem para a confiabilidade interna do Modelo de ComunicaÃÃo NÃo-Verbal Enfermeiro-Cego. Conclui-se com este trabalho a necessidade de implementaÃÃo prÃtica tanto por parte dos enfermeiros como dos estudantes de enfermagem deste Modelo de ComunicaÃÃo NÃo-Verbal com o paciente cego para tornar o cuidado efetivo e afetivo, especialmente com aqueles que necessitam compreender e serem compreendidos em sua vida cotidiana. Confirma-se a hipÃtese de que o Modelo de ComunicaÃÃo NÃo-Verbal Enfermeiro-Cego Ã eficaz na consulta de enfermagem a pacientes cegos. The {{goal was}} to validate a non-verbal communication model for nursing care delivery to blind clients, based on the reference framework by E. T. Hall (1986). This methodological research was developed at the LabCom_SaÃde research lab of the Nursing Department at CearÃ Federal University between October 2007 and June 2008. Fifteen blind people and 15 nurses were selected for each group, i. e. trained and non-trained, both with the same characteristics. The blind were contacted through the CearÃ State Association of the Blind (ACEC) and the nurses through the Academic Centers (CAs). In the non-trained group, data were collected in April 2008 through consultations. These took place inside the LabCom_SaÃde and data were collected through movie recordings. The studies carried out about Hallâs theory (1986) represented {{the first step to}} construct the model. The nursing consultation was subdivided in four phases, which were called care phases. In each phase, orientations are given for the nurseâs actions and the action is described, as well as how this action should take place. Care phase 1 refers to the organization of the environment to develop the Nursing Consultation (CEnf). In care phase 2, the nurse should receive the patient at the entry of the consultation room to introduce him/her into the environment where the consultation will take place, greet the patient and inform where furniture and objects are located. Care phase 3 addresses the development of the CEnf itself. Care phase 4 constitutes the final phase of the non-verbal communication model and focuses on how to end the consultation and close off communication with the patient. After its construction, the Model was submitted to face and content validation. It was analyzed by three specialists in non-verbal communication specialists, a number already adopted in earlier studies. The suggestions included in the model referred to range, presentation form and content representativeness. Next, the second validation phase started, through which the model was tested. The nurses and blind people were trained in terms of the communication techniques that are important in the use of non-verbal communication as well as the use of the Model with blind people. Data were collected with the help of three film cameras that recorded the entire nursing consultation among the nurse, the blind and the companion, if present. To analyze the movie data, three other judges were chosen, who were nurses and students from the Graduate Nursing Program at CearÃ Federal University, masterâs and doctoral level. They were trained on how to use to nurse-blind non-verbal communication analysis instrument (CONVENCE) and the model validation instrument. As this was a double-blind study, the judges were not informed about which group â control or experimental - they were analyzing. The collected data were inserted in an electronic worksheet, using SPSS software, version 14. 0, and analyzed as absolute frequencies through univariate table. To analyze the association between the variables and the nurses in the control and experimental groups, the chi-square (&# 967; 2) test and the maximum likelihood estimation were used. Guidelines for research involving human beings were complied with, in accordance with Resolution 196 / 96 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The comparison between care phase 1 actions in the trained and non-trained group showed that the trained group obtained excellent results (p< 0. 0001) on four of the five <b>items</b> <b>under</b> <b>analysis.</b> The only exception was the âtemperatureâ item, with an approximately equal proportion on the scale. Table 3 shows that, when comparing care phase 2 actions between the groups, the trained group obtained an excellent result (p< 0. 05) on all items under evaluation. Hence, statistically significant associations were found for all actions. As to the results obtained in Table 4, excellent results are observed (p< 0. 05) on eight of the nine items assessed for the trained group in comparison with the non-trained group in care phase 3. Only the item related to âfollowing the CEnf scriptâ remained close to the test value, highlighting that this action obtained a strong association score. Data in Table 5 also showed excellent results (p< 0. 05) for the trained group in comparison with the non-trained group for three of the four actions developed in care phase 4. As observed in Table 6, all items contributed to the internal reliability of the Nurse-Blind Non-Verbal Communication Model. Through this research, it is concluded that nurses and even nursing students need to implement this Non-Verbal Communication Model with a view to effective and affective care, especially for patients who need to understand and be understood in their daily life. The hypothesis is confirmed that the Nurse-Blind Non-Verbal Communication Model is effective in nursing consultations with blind patients...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho trata da descrição e análise da concordância de número no sintagma nominal, tendo como amostra de fala a Língua Portuguesa da classe baixa da comunidade urbana de Rio Branco (Estado do Acre), sob a perspectiva da Sociolingüística Variacionista, aliada a alguns aspectos do Funcionalismo lingüístico. Após a fundamentação teórica, procedeu-se à descrição e à análise da variável lingüística Saliência fônica, subdividida em três dimensões: Processos morfofonológicos de formação do plural, Tonicidade e Número de sílabas dos itens lexicais singulares. Além disso, foram analisadas as variáveis Posição linear dos elementos no SN, Classe gramatical, Marcas precedentes e Contexto fonético/fonológico seguinte. Quanto às variáveis sociais, foram observados Sexo e Grau de escolarização, sendo este distribuído em três níveis: analfabetos, de 1 a à 4 a e de 5 a à 8 a séries. Os resultados obtidos foram comparados com os de outras Ccinco investigações sobre o mesmo tema, a fim de se detectarem generalidades a respeito do comportamento do fenômeno em estudo no Português do Brasil. O fenômeno lingüístico, ora analisado, comporta-se como sincronicamente variável. A oposição presença/ausência de marcas formais de plural nos elementos flexionáveis do SN, correlacionada com as variáveis lingüísticas e sociais, indica uma tendência na direção de garantir a informação de plural no primeiro elemento do SN, e de reduzir significativamente as flexões nominais nos demais elementosThis work {{deals with}} the {{description}} and analysis of number agreement in the noun phrase (NP) {{in a variety of}} Brazilian Portuguese, based on a corpus of recorded oral speech of lower class inhabitants of the city of Rio Branco (the capital of Acre - a Brazilian state in the Amazon). It follows the Quantitative Sociolinguistics model of data processing combined with some aspects of the linguistic functionalistic theory. The introduction of the theoretical framework within which theinvestigation is developed is followed by the description and analysis of the linguistic variable Phonetic Saliency comprising three main dimensions: Morphophonological processes in plural formation the tonic accent Position, and Number of syllables of the lexical item in its singular form. Besides these dimensions, other linguistic factors are considered, such as, the phonetic/phonological Environment after the item, the linear Position of the constituents of the NP, the grammatical Class, and the plural Marks preceding the <b>item</b> <b>under</b> <b>analysis.</b> The social variables studied were Sex, individual Performance, and level of Schooling, subdivided in three categories: (a) illiterate, (b) one to four years of primary school instruction, and (c) one to four years ofhigh school instruction. The results of the analysis were then compared with those of tive other studies on the same subject in order to fmd out possible generalizations concerning the behavior of nominal agreement in Brazilian Portuguese. The correlation of linguistic and social variables with the formal marking of plural in the NP shows that agreement in the NP in Brazilian Portuguese is a case of synchronic variation rule, favoring the tendency to guarantee the presence of plural indication in the first constituent of the NP, and to significantly reduce the nominal inflection marks in the other element...|$|R
