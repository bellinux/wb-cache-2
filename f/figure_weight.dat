40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to report on a study that {{examined}} the effect of working memory training (using the n-back task) on fluid intelligence (Gf). Recent research by Jaeggi and colleagues (2008; 2010) found that training in a visualspatial n-back task resulted in gains on two different matrix reasoning tests of fluid intelligence (compared to participants who did no task). The present study replicated and extended these results by testing the fluid intelligence construct using {{a different type of}} fluid intelligence test, and employing an ‘active’ rather than ‘no-contact’ control group to account for motivational effects on intelligence test performance. Fifty eight participants were involved and their fluid intelligence was assessed pre-training using the <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). Participants were randomly assigned to two groups (experimental or active control), and both groups did a training task on their home computer for 20 days, for 20 minutes a day. The experimental group trained using a single n-back task whilst the control group completed general knowledge and vocabulary questions. After training, participants were retested using the <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> subtest. Participants’ <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> scores were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The results of this analysis revealed {{no significant difference between the}} training groups in terms of performance on the <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> subtest, suggesting that the n-back task was not effective in increasing fluid reasoning ability. These findings were in contrast to those of Jaeggi et al. (2008) and Jaeggi et al. (2010) and suggested that differences between the working memory group and control group found in these studies were likely the result of placebo/motivational effects rather than the properties of the n-back task itself...|$|R

40|$|Background Sedentary {{behaviour}} {{has been}} linked to deleterious health effects. While improved health markers after standing in comparison to sitting conditions have been reported by other studies, the current evidence regarding the effect of these conditions on cognitive performance is incomplete. No studies thus far have attempted to compare the difference between sitting and standing in regards to Perceptual Reasoning performance. Objective To determine the effects of sitting and standing on Perceptual Reasoning performance throughout a simulated working day. Methods A repeated-measures cross-over design was used, with 30 healthy participants between 18 and 50 years who were age and sex matched. Participants were assigned to either standing or sitting conditions while performing a cognitive test battery three times during a 7. 5 hour testing day that included three tasks of Perceptual Reasoning (Block Design, <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> and Matrix Reasoning). The two testing days were split into Morning, Midday, and Afternoon testing sessions and were counterbalanced across seated and standing conditions, separated by at least a seven day washout period. Results There were no significant main effects found between sitting and standing conditions in any of the Perceptual Reasoning tasks. Performance across the day, however, did improve significantly in the speed of Block Design performance and the accuracy of the <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> tasks. Performance across the day for the Matrix Reasoning task, however, was variable. In addition, the participants’ perception of their own fatigue increased significantly over each session as the day proceeded. Conclusion This study found no difference in participants’ Perceptual Reasoning performance between sitting and standing, and mixed results in terms of performance across the day (7. 5 hours of testing), although fatigue increased as the day proceeded. The results support the use of standing desks in the workplace given no detriment to performance whilst standing was found.

Despite the serendipity of the two men's styles, Colletta would later be criticized, with good reason, for compromising Kirby's artistic vision by eliminating much of the detail that the artist put into his work.

40|$|IntroductionDriving is {{a complex}} {{activity}} that requires motor, visuo-perceptual, behavioral and cognitive abilities, which all could be affected after stroke. There is no correlation between cognitive assessment and on-road test, which is {{the gold standard for}} driving assessment [1]. Few studies have so far been conducted on simulator-based assessment interest in the specific context of stroke [2]. PurposeThe main aim of our study is to evaluate the contribution of driving simulator, in addition to cognitive assessment. Material and methodIt is a retrospective study, involving patients with supratentorial stroke, for global assessment before driving again, including: cognitive assessment (Trail Making Test, Rey-O complex figure, WAIS IV <b>figure</b> <b>weights,</b> Stroop test, BEC 96, the Bells Test), simulator-based assessment after commands adjustment (reaction time, driving control [speed, path], driving behavior) and medical assessment. Statistical analysis between cognitive assessment and driving simulator results are performed using a multiple linear regression model. ResultsForty-three patients, admitted in our ward between 2010 and 2013 for driving assessment were included: 33 with ischemic stroke, 8 with hemorrhagic stroke (right hemisphere for 23 patients, left for 18). Statistical analysis is currently in progress. DiscussionDriving simulator allows, compared to on-road test, a safe assessment with possible standardization procedures. Characterizing cognitive elements useful to predict inability to drive, in particular those giving {{a false sense of security}} and which should encourage to further exploration on simulator driving or on-road test, is important to optimize the management...|$|R

40|$|Subjects rated 12 {{female body}} shapes {{with respect to}} their {{physical}} attractiveness, {{and the extent to which}} they would be expected to possess various personality characteristics. The shapes were varied using 3 levels of overall weight and 4 levels of body shapeliness. The sample was modified to control for socioeconomic factors and results are based on 297 undergraduates from Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic racial backgrounds. Loglinear analyses revealed that men and women, regardless of racial background, rated shapely underweight females as most physically attractive, sexy, and ideal for a woman, followed by normal <b>weight</b> <b>figures</b> of similar proportion. African Americans, women in particular, judged the shapely normal <b>weight</b> <b>figures</b> more favorably than the other subjects. Multidimensional scaling and subsequent frequency analyses showed that those figures judged as most attractive, sexy, and ideal were also expected to be fairly emotionally stable, and most successful and interpersonally competitive, but least faithful, kind, and family-oriented. Overweight female shapes, while rated as least physically attractive, sexy, and emotionally stable, were expected to be most family-oriented, kind, and faithful. Shapely normal <b>weight</b> <b>figures</b> were judged to be attractive and sexy, and were assumed to possess a moderate amount of the personality traits in question. The results suggest that Caucasian and Hispanic subjects prefer shapely underweight women, while African Americans, particularly women, find shapely underweight and shapely normal weight women to be physically appealing. African American women also rate shapely normal weight women favorably with respect to personality traits. This perceptual difference may help inoculate them from developing eating disturbances and account for the low prevalence rate of eating disorders in African Americans compared to women of other racial backgrounds. It is suggested that future research identify those beliefs, values or behaviors that seem to inoculate African American women from developing eating disorders. Once identified, mental health professionals may facilitate their development in those women who are likely to have eating problems...|$|R
