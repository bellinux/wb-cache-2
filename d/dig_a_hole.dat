25|$|Shi Yan Ming {{was born}} Duan Gen Shan in Zhumadian in Henan Province, China, on Chinese New Year's, February 13, 1964, {{the year of}} the Dragon, the seventh of nine children. His father grew up in a family so poor that they were {{essentially}} homeless, and begged for food door to door. Duan's father, who never went to school, slept under a wood-burning stove, or would <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> in a stack of wheat for warmth. Despite these hardships, he taught himself to be a very literate reader, writer and calligrapher. Duan's mother's family was slightly better off financially. As was typical, she was not educated either, had her feet bound, and was raised solely to be a mother and housewife. Duan's parents eventually acquired jobs for the Chinese government under Mao, and worked underground as telex operators.|$|E
500|$|Brine mining: Around 500 BCE, {{the ancient}} Chinese dug {{hundreds}} of brine wells, {{some of which}} were over 100 meters (330 feet) in depth. Bamboo towers were erected, similar in style to modern-day oil derricks. Bamboo was used for ropes, casing, and derricks since it was salt resistant. Iron wedges were hung from a bamboo cable attached to a lever on a platform constructed atop the tower. The derricks required two to three men jumping on and off the lever that moved the iron wedge pounded into the ground to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> deep enough into the ground to hit the brine.|$|E
500|$|Some Chinese died on {{the banks}} of Bitter Creek as they fled, others near the {{railroad}} bridge as they attempted to escape Chinatown. The rioters threw Chinese bodies into the flames of burning buildings. Other Chinese immigrants, who had hidden in their houses instead of fleeing, were murdered, and then their bodies were burned with their houses. Those who could not run, including the sick, were burned alive in their camp houses. Many of the Chinese who were burned in their houses apparently tried [...] "to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> in the cellar to hide themselves. But the fire overtook them when about half way in the hole, burning their lower limbs to a crisp and leaving the upper trunk untouched." [...] One remaining Chinese immigrant was found dead in a laundry house in Whitemen's Town, his home demolished by rioters.|$|E

500|$|Several poems from Yoko Ono's 1964 book Grapefruit {{inspired}} Lennon {{to write}} the lyrics for [...] "Imagine"—in particular, one which Capitol Records reproduced on the back cover of the original Imagine LP titled [...] "Cloud Piece", reads: [...] "Imagine the clouds dripping, <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> in your garden to put them in." [...] Lennon later said the composition [...] "should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it—the lyric and the concept—came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of Grapefruit." [...] When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon told Sheff that Dick Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind [...] "Imagine".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that any Israelite rendered unclean by a nocturnal emission had to leave the Israelites military camp, bathe in water toward evening, and reenter the camp at sundown. The Israelites were to designate an area outside the camp where they might relieve themselves, and to carry a spike to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> and cover up their excrement. As God moved about in their camp to protect them, the Israelites were to keep their camp holy. A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here.|$|E

In February 1998, three men accused of sodomy were taken to the base of a mud and brick wall, which was then toppled over onto them by a tank. A similar death sentence for two men occurred in March 1998. Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Hassan, was reported to say, [...] "Our religious scholars are not agreed on the right kind of punishment for homosexuality. Some say we should take these sinners to a high roof and throw them down, while others say we should <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> beside a wall, bury them, then push the wall down on top of them." [...] Prior to Taliban rule, the supposedly [...] "Islamic" [...] punishment of having walls toppled onto homosexuals was not precedented.|$|E
