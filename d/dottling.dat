50|$|<b>Dottles</b> are {{generally}} considered troublesome because they lessen the time one may spend smoking a bowl. <b>Dottles</b> can also give a sour taste to the smoke {{as it is}} approached by the hot ember. If <b>dottle</b> is not promptly removed after smoking using a pipe tool, the pipe may eventually give a foul taste to any tobacco smoked in it. When this happens, pipe sweetening is required.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dottle</b> is the {{remaining}} plug of unburnt tobacco and ashes {{left in the}} bottom of a tobacco pipe when it has been smoked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I no tell ye? I'm ga'en <b>dottle,</b> I think. It was a glove, a woman's glove, {{in a bit}} paper. Ay, though she's sittin' still she's near frantic." ...|$|R
50|$|In the Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes had a {{habit of}} drying out all the <b>dottles</b> from the day's pipes on a corner of his mantelpiece to be smoked the {{following}} morning.|$|R
50|$|The reamer is a flat {{instrument}} {{shaped like}} a dull pen-knife blade or a flattened spoon, used to scrape ash and unburned tobacco (<b>dottle)</b> off the sides and bottom of a pipe.|$|R
5000|$|Some pipes are {{designed}} to specifically lessen or prevent the formation of <b>dottle</b> and excessive moisture. The most common are the calabash pipe, the [...] "Dry System" [...] pipes made by Peterson, and aluminum-stemmed pipes from Falcon and Kirsten.|$|R
40|$|The fossil pollen {{contents}} {{found in}} the charred <b>dottle</b> residue from 20 clay pipe bowls recovered from a cesspit at a house in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (which was owned and used by the artist Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn), were collected and studied. The clay pipes date from approximately the same period when Rembrandt {{lived in the house}} and used the cesspit. We believe that some of the pollen in the <b>dottle</b> residue may have come from the tobacco, some possibly from airborne sources at Rembrandt’s house and/or from debris in the cesspit in which the pipes were discarded. The results are compared with a similar study of pipe <b>dottle</b> from Native American clay pipes conducted more than 25 years ago. We also briefly review the origin and spread of domestic tobacco in an effort to determine potential sources of the tobacco imported and used in the Netherlands during the lifetime of Rembrandt and the period when he occupied the house. The pollen content of modern brands of commercial pipe tobacco is studied and the potential for using pollen found in tobacco products as evidence in forensic circumstances is reviewed...|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable design from the Kapp and Peterson factory was Peterson's famed 'Dry System' pipes, {{patented}} in 1894. Featuring a small reservoir intended to collect moisture before it reaches the smoker, the 'System Pipe' is designed to create a drier and cooler smoke and discourage the formation of <b>dottle.</b> The System Pipe is still a consistent top seller for Peterson.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dottle</b> can be {{produced}} by different factors. The primary cause of an excessive amount of <b>dottle</b> is a tightly packed or otherwise improperly packed pipe, where the tobacco has been improperly prepared or is compressed and will not burn properly. A second possible cause can be the excessive moisture content of the tobacco and the tobacco being smoked too quickly. This can result in tobacco that is too wet to burn. Rapid or hard draws on the pipe can and will produce an excessively hot ember in the bowl causing the moisture content of the tobacco to vaporize and then condense in bottom of the bowl and in the draft hole, preventing the tobacco from burning properly. A third contributor {{to the creation of}} <b>dottle</b> is propylene glycol or [...] "PG". This innocuous preservative used primarily in aromatic tobaccos can keep the moisture content high in pipe tobaccos even after drying. Smoking the pipe too fast can also produce a foul tasting liquid that collects {{at the bottom of the}} bowl and in the draft hole resulting in [...] "pipe gurgle"; this can be inadvertently tasted. Pushing a pipe cleaner down the stem can remedy this problem to a point. Another possible cause of pipe gurgle can be a [...] "wet smoker"; that is, a pipe smoker that pushes some saliva down the stem and into the bowl. Excessive saliva can be a factor but is rarely the cause of a [...] "wet smoke" [...] or pipe gurgle.|$|R
50|$|The ash and {{the last}} bits of {{unburned}} tobacco, known as <b>dottle,</b> should be cleaned out with a suitable pipe tool. A soft or bristle pipe cleaner, which may be moistened with strong spirits is then run through the airways of the stem and shank to remove any moisture, ash, and other residue before the pipe is allowed to dry. A pipe {{should be allowed to}} cool before removing the stem to avoid the possibility of warping it.|$|R
60|$|Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, {{lounging}} {{about his}} sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which {{was composed of}} all the plugs and <b>dottles</b> left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected {{on the corner of}} the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is {{a pretty}} state of things!" [...] said the traveller. [...] "Dying for a smoke; only one match left; and that certain to miss fire! Was there ever a {{creature}} so unfortunate? And yet," [...] thought the traveller, [...] "suppose I light this match, and smoke my pipe, and shake out the <b>dottle</b> here in the grass--the grass might catch fire, for it is dry like tinder; and while I snatch out the flames in front, they might evade and run behind me, and seize upon yon bush of poison oak; before I could reach it, that would have blazed up; over the bush I see a pine-tree hung with moss; that, too, would fly in fire upon the instant to its topmost bough; and the flame of that long torch--how would the trade-wind take and brandish that through the inflammable forest! I hear this dell roar {{in a moment with}} the joint voice of wind and fire, I see myself gallop for my soul, and the flying conflagration chase and outflank me through the hills; I see this pleasant forest burn for days, and the cattle roasted, and the springs dried up, and the farmer ruined, and his children cast upon the world. What a world hangs upon this moment!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{children}} used {{to fling}} stones at Grinder Queery because {{he loved his}} mother. I never heard the Grinder's real name. He and his mother were Queery and Drolly, contemptuously so called, and they answered to these names. I remember Cree best as a battered old weaver, who bent forward as he walked, with his arms hanging limp as if ready to grasp the shafts of the barrow behind which it was his life to totter uphill and downhill, a rope of yarn suspended round his shaking neck, and fastened to the shafts, assisting him to bear the yoke and slowly strangling him. By and by there came {{a time when the}} barrow and the weaver seemed both palsy-stricken, and Cree, gasping for breath, would stop {{in the middle of a}} brae, unable to push his load over a stone. Then he laid himself down behind it to prevent the barrow's slipping back. On those occasions only the barefooted boys who jeered at the panting weaver could put new strength into his shrivelled arms. They did it by telling him that he and Mysy would have to go to the [...] "poorshouse" [...] after all, at which the grey old man would wince, as if [...] "joukin" [...] from a blow, and, shuddering, rise and, with a desperate effort, gain the top of the incline. Small blame perhaps attached to Cree if, as he neared his grave, he grew a little <b>dottle.</b> His loads of yarn frequently took him past the workhouse, and his eyelids quivered as he drew near. Boys used to gather round the gate in anticipation of his coming, and make a feint of driving him inside. Cree, when he observed them, sat down on his barrow-shafts terrified to approach, and I see them now pointing to the workhouse till he left his barrow on the road and hobbled away, his legs cracking as he ran.|$|R
