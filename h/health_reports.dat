2500|$|India's {{cultural}} view {{of elderly}} care {{is similar to}} that of Nepal's. Parents are typically cared for by their children into old age, most commonly by their sons. It should be noted that in these countries, elderly citizens, especially men, are viewed in very high regard. Traditional values demand honor and respect for older, wiser people. India is facing the same problem as many developing nations in that its elderly population is increasing tremendously, with a current estimate of 90 million over the age of 60. [...] Using data on health and living conditions from the India's 60th National Sample Survey, a study found that almost a quarter of the elderly reported poor <b>health.</b> <b>Reports</b> of poor health were clustered among the poor, single, lower-educated and economically inactive groups.|$|E

However media reports claim that the United States Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) had found asbestos in four talc samples tested in 2000. The Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health subsequently wrote to the news reporter, stating that [...] "In fact, the abbreviation ND (non detect) in the laboratory report – indicates no asbestos fibers actually were found in the samples", and multiple studies by both mineral studies laboratories and biological cell studies do not report asbestos.

2500|$|Because of the {{strongly}} oxidizing {{properties of}} ozone, ozone {{is a primary}} irritant, affecting especially the eyes and respiratory systems and can be hazardous at even low concentrations. The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and <b>Health</b> <b>reports</b> that: [...] "Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations." [...] To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 μmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and NIOSH has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 μmol/mol. Work environments where ozone is used or where {{it is likely to}} be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL. Continuous monitors for ozone are available from several suppliers.|$|E

This study aims at exploring the role of media in informing health policies in Lebanon, identifying the factors influencing <b>health</b> <b>reporting</b> and investigating the role of evidence in health journalism and the quality of <b>health</b> <b>reporting.</b> It also identifies strategies to enhance the use of evidence in health journalism and improve the quality of <b>health</b> <b>reporting.</b> Media analysis was conducted to assess the way media reports on health-related issues and the quality of reporting using a quality assessment tool. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with 27 journalists, researchers and policymakers to explore their perception on the role of media in health policymaking and the factors influencing <b>health</b> <b>reporting.</b> In addition, a validation workshop was conducted. Out of 1, 279 health-related news articles identified, 318 articles used certain type of evidence to <b>report</b> <b>health</b> issues 39. 8 % of which relied on experts' opinions as their source of evidence while only 5. 9 % referenced peer-reviewed research studies. The quality of <b>health</b> <b>reporting</b> was judged to be low based on a quality assessment tool consisting of a set of ten criteria. Journalists raised concerns about issues impeding them from referring to evidence. Journalists also reported difficulties with the investigative health journalism. Policymakers and researchers viewed media as an important tool for evidence-informed health policies, however, serious concerns were voiced in terms of the current practice and capacities. Our study provides a structured reflection on the role of media and the factors that influence <b>health</b> <b>reporting</b> including context-specific strategies that would enhance the quality and promote the use of evidence in <b>health</b> <b>reporting.</b> In the light of the political changes in many Middle Eastern countries, findings from this study can contribute to redefining the role of media in strengthening health systems...|$|R
