When Milk arrived, he found Lira had hanged himself. Already prone to severe depression, Lira had attempted suicide previously. One of the longest notes he left for Milk indicated he was upset about the Anita Bryant and John Briggs campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of these}} and other successes, Lowe was {{authorized}} to build four additional balloons and the needed inflation equipment. However, Lowe's initial successes proved difficult to recreate in field conditions, and aside from limited successes, such as at the Battle of Seven Pines, the utility of the Balloon Corps was limited. In addition, jurisdictional squabbles arose between Lowe's civilian command and the military officers under whom he worked. By early 1863, Lowe had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of dealing with military minutia and left the Corps, returning to civilian research. The Balloon Corps fell to the command of less-capable individuals and was eventually eliminated in August 1863.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of God of War, Kratos had been serving the gods for ten years and had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of his service and nightmares. When he confronted his patron Athena, she advised {{him that if he}} killed the rampaging Ares, the gods would forgive his sins. With this selfish motive, he again agreed, and after finding and using Pandora's Box, he was successful. Despite being freed of Ares' influence, {{including}} the Blades of Chaos, Kratos was forgiven but was not relieved of his nightmares. A dissatisfied and despairing Kratos tried to commit suicide but was saved by Athena, who guided him to Olympus. Awarded the Blades of Athena, Kratos became the new God of War.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Sophia's birth, Briggs had {{achieved}} a high standing within his profession. Nevertheless, he considered retiring from the sea to go into business with his seafaring brother Oliver, who had also <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of the wandering life. They did not proceed with this project, but instead each invested his savings in a share of a ship: Oliver in Julia A. Hallock, and Benjamin in Mary Celeste. In October 1872, Benjamin took command of Mary Celeste for her first voyage following her extensive New York refit, which was {{to take her to}} Genoa in Italy. He arranged for his wife and infant daughter to accompany him, while his school-aged son was left at home with his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{pre-production}} {{on the third}} series began, Bullen had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of writing the series single-handedly and believed all the stories that could be told had been told. ITV were keen {{to increase the number}} of episodes per series to 20 but Granada refused, though did agree to add two more, bringing the total to eight. A writing team of five was assembled, overseen by Bullen. Four of the scriptwriters were deemed not good enough and they parted company with Granada. David Nicholls remained and scripted four of the eight-third series episodes; Bullen wrote the other four and his interest in the series was revived.|$|E
5|$|After a {{prolonged}} power struggle, Khrushchev was finally ousted {{from his post}} as First Secretary in October 1964, charged with the failure of his reforms, his obsessive re-organizations of the Party and Government apparatus, his disregard for Party and Government institutions, and his one-man domineering leadership style. The Presidium (Politburo), the Central Committee and other important Party–Government bodies had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of Khrushchev's repeated violations of established Party principles. The Soviet leadership also believed that his individualistic leadership style ran contrary to the ideal collective leadership. Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his posts as First Secretary and Premier respectively, and Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko, and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny), were also given prominence in the new leadership. Together they formed a functional collective leadership.|$|E

2500|$|The metaphor [...] "Indian Summer" [...] {{is often}} used by journalists, biographers, and music critics to {{describe}} Strauss's late creative upsurge from 1942 {{to the end of}} his life. The events of World War II seemed to bring the composer—who had <b>grown</b> old, <b>tired,</b> and a little jaded—into focus. The major works of the last years of Strauss's life, written in his late 70s and 80s, include, among others, his Horn Concerto No. 2, Metamorphosen, his Oboe Concerto, and his Four Last Songs.|$|R

I wear white clothes in the depth of winter in my home, but I don't go out in the streets in them. I don't go out to attract too much attention. I like to attract some, and always I would like to be dressed so that I may be more conspicuous than anybody else.|$|R
5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 {{professional}} seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar {{announced his}} retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets {{in the first}} round, they lost four games to one {{in the second round}} of the playoffs to the Suns. Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout, and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy. Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes. Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.|$|E
5|$|The Queen lavished {{upon her}} {{favourite}} the royal manor of Woodstock {{and the promise}} of a fine palace commemorative of his great victory at Blenheim; but since her accession her relationship with Sarah had become progressively distant. The Duke and Duchess had risen to greatness not least because of their intimacy with Anne, but the Duchess's relentless campaign against the Tories (Sarah was a firm Whig), isolated her from the Queen whose natural inclinations lay with the Tories, the staunch supporters of the Church of England. For her part, Anne, now Queen and no longer the timid adolescent so easily dominated by her more beautiful friend, had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of Sarah's tactless political hectoring and increasingly haughty manner which, in the coming years, were to destroy their friendship and undermine the position of her husband.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the eighth}} season of Stargate SG-1 was {{intended}} to be the last, the producers finished it with the defeat of the Goa'uld and Replicators. When the Sci Fi Channel renewed the series, however, the producers had <b>grown</b> creatively <b>tired</b> of writing endings. Having had good experiences with the first season of Stargate Atlantis, the producers hence decided to revamp the series in more fronts than just adding new characters by introducing new villains and new missions. Thus they considered the beginning of Season 9 as the pilot of a new show.|$|R

5|$|When {{the game}} starts, Kratos has been serving the gods for ten years. He kills the Hydra {{on behalf of}} Poseidon, but he has <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of his service and suffering. He summons Athena, who states that if Kratos {{performs}} one final act—the murder of Ares—he will be forgiven for killing his family. Ares is waging war on the city of Athens out of hatred and jealousy of his sister Athena, who assigns Kratos to destroy Ares because Zeus has forbidden divine intervention. Athena guides Kratos to the war-torn Athens. After a strange encounter with a gravedigger who encourages him to continue his task, Kratos battles his way to Athens's oracle, finds her, and learns {{that the only way}} to defeat Ares is with Pandora's Box, a mythical artifact that grants the power to kill a god.|$|E

Contrary to popular assumption, they were not lured away by higher pay—rather, each man had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of both the temperamental, domineering Pulitzer and the paranoid, back-biting office politics which he encouraged.|$|E
25|$|The Liberals were {{defeated}} in 1905 after {{over thirty years}} in power. The party had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> and arrogant in government and became increasingly cautious. As well, a growing anti-Catholic sectarian sentiment hurt the Liberals, particularly in Toronto where {{they were unable to}} win a seat from 1890 until 1916. The Liberals continued to decline after losing power, and, for a time, were eclipsed by the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO) when the Liberals were unable to attract the growing farmers' protest movement to its ranks.|$|E

In addition, JFA had <b>grown</b> <b>tired</b> of Troussier's clashes with the media while the players were frustrated with his micromanagement. In contrast, Zico commanded respect from reporters and urged players to express themselves on the pitch.|$|E

Accordingly, he got into the sleigh that was brought out by and by, and enjoyed the struggle with the half-tamed team, which stood with ears laid back, prepared for conflict. Oats had been very plentiful, and prices low that season. Winston, who knew at least as much about a horse as Lance Courthorne, however, bent them to his will, and the team were trotting quietly through the shadow of a big birch bluff a league from town, when he heard a faint clip-clop coming down the trail behind him. It led straight beneath the leafless branches, and was beaten smooth and firm, while Winston, who had noticed already that whenever he strayed any distance from the hotel there was a mounted cavalryman somewhere in the vicinity, shook the reins.|$|R

The small booklet contained the stories The Tinderbox, Little Claus and Big Claus, The Princess and the Pea and Little Idas Flowers. He published a total of sic booklets with Fairy Tales Told for Children in the period 1835-1842, followed by New Fairytales published in the period 1843-1848. Andersen also wrote the novels O.T. and Kun en Spillemand (1837) and completed The Improvisatore while he lived at Nyhavn 20. In his diary, he describes an episode where he suddenly felt cold while working on The Improvisator. When {{he opened the door}} to the neighbouring room, he found out that his land lady and the maid had opened the windows and poured water on the floor, so that her four children could slide on it when the water froze.

Mankind surrenders at the United Nations headquarters, with the representative of Zero One stating [...] "your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh, and a new world awaits you.

The machines, having won a Pyrrhic victory, turn to the defeated humans, and begin utilizing the bio-electric, chemical and kinetic energy of the human body. While the machines were more than capable of generating power from alternative power sources, the collective sedation of humankind was a final act of mercy to keep the humans down without outright destroying them.|$|R
