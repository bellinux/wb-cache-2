5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> toward {{increasing}} half-lives for {{the heavier}} isotopes; thus the heaviest three known isotopes, 267Sg, 269Sg, and 271Sg, {{are also the}} longest-lived, having half-lives in minutes. Some other isotopes in this region are predicted to have comparable or even longer half-lives, with the longest-lived predicted isotope being 272Sg {{which is expected to}} have a half-life of about an hour. Additionally, 263Sg, 265Sg, 265mSg, as well as the predicted 268Sg have or should have half-lives measured in seconds. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives measured in milliseconds, {{with the exception of the}} shortest-lived isotope, 261mSg, with a half-life of only 92microseconds.|$|E
5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E
5|$|Within the Heathen {{community}} of the United States, gender roles are based upon perceived ideals and norms found in Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular as they are presented in Old Norse sources. Among male American Heathens there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> toward hypermasculinized behaviour, while a gendered division of labor—in which men are viewed as providers and women seen as being responsible for home and children—is also widespread among Heathens in the U.S. Due to its focus on traditional attitudes to sex and gender—values perceived as socially conservative in Western nations—it {{has been argued that}} American Heathenry's ethical system is far closer to traditional Christian morals than the ethical systems espoused in many other Western Pagan religions such as Wicca.|$|E

5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt objects {{are composed of}} a mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. One possible explanation for this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.|$|E

25|$|Another {{connection}} between feminism and veganism is the parallel {{of violence against}} women or other minority members and the violence against animals. Animal rights activists closely relates animal cruelty to feminist issues. This connection is even further mirrored as animals that are used for breeding practices are compared to human trafficking victims and migrant sex workers. Hamilton points out that violent “rapists sometimes exhibit behavior {{that seems to be}} patterned on the mutilation of animals” suggesting there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> between the violence towards rape victims and animal cruelty previously exhibited by the rapist.|$|E

25|$|Cetacean bycatch is {{increasing}} in intensity and frequency. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> {{that is likely}} to continue because of increasing human population growth and demand for marine food sources, as well as industrialization of fisheries which are expanding into new areas. These fisheries come into direct and indirect contact with cetaceans. An example of direct contact is the physical contact of cetaceans with fishing nets. Indirect contact is through marine trophic pathways where fisheries are severely reducing fish stocks that cetaceans rely on for food. In some fisheries, cetaceans are captured as bycatch but then retained because of their value as food or bait. In this fashion, cetaceans can become a target of fisheries.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} in animacy is rudimentary, generally being made {{only in the}} nominative case, and the same noun is sometimes attested in both animacy classes. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> towards distinguishing fewer cases in the plural than in the singular. The ergative case is used when an inanimate noun {{is the subject of}} a transitive verb. Early Hittite texts have a vocative case for a few nouns with -u, however, the vocative case was no longer productive by the time of the earliest discovered sources, being subsumed by the nominative in most documents. The allative was subsumed in the later stages of the language's development by the dative-locative. An archaic genitive plural -an is found irregularly in earlier texts, as is an instrumental plural in -it. A few nouns also form a distinct locative without any case ending at all.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the taxes mentioned above, the cantons are free to introduce others. Several cantons levy an inheritance tax (Erbschaftssteuer / Imposta di successione) and a gift tax (Schenkungssteuer / Imposta di donazione), although there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> towards abolishing those. Moreover, the cantons are required by federal law {{to levy a tax}} on the profit from the sale of real estate (Grundstückgewinnsteuer / impôt sur les gains immobiliers / Imposta sugli utili immobiliari). Most also levy a tax on the value of the property sold (Handänderungssteuer / impôt sur les mutations / Tassa di mutazione) so as to discourage speculation in real estate. Taxes are also frequently levied on the ownership of dogs and motor vehicles, on lotteries, on the sale of tickets to public entertainments, or on overnight stays in certain tourist destinations.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{centralised}} {{decision-making and}} approvals {{at the state}} level, which are characteristic of the Indian civil service, affect the management of {{water supply and sanitation}} services. For example, according to the World Bank in the state of Punjab the process of approving designs is centralised with even minor technical approvals reaching the office of chief engineers. A majority of decisions are made in a very centralised manner at the headquarters. In 1993 the Indian constitution and relevant state legislations were amended in order to decentralise certain responsibilities, including water supply and sanitation, to municipalities. Since the assignment of responsibilities to municipalities is a state responsibility, different states have followed different approaches. According to a Planning Commission report of 2003 there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> to decentralise capital investment to engineering departments at the district level and operation and maintenance to district and gram panchayat levels.|$|E

500|$|Whereas in the past, cows {{were kept}} in small herds on family farms, grazing {{pastures}} and being fed hay in winter, nowadays there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> towards larger herds, more intensive systems, the feeding of silage and [...] "zero grazing", a system where grass is cut and brought to the cow, which is housed year-round. In many communities, milk production {{is only part of}} the purpose of keeping an animal which may also be used as a beast of burden or to draw a plough, or for the production of fibre, meat and leather, with the dung being used for fuel or for the improvement of soil fertility.

500|$|Wormshill {{includes}} two farms: Yew Tree Farm (dairy farming) {{at the south}} end of the village, and Norwood Farm (fruit and other crops) at the north end. A third farm, Home Farm appeared on late 19th and early 20th centuries Ordnance Survey maps in the centre of the village. This farm is no longer in use, but some outbuildings remain. Wormshill at one time included a blacksmith's shop, which is recorded on Ordnance Survey maps until 1898. [...] According to the 1831 Census, 40 of the 48 adult males in the village were employed in the agricultural sector. Census records from the mid-to-late 19th century show a marked increase in the construction of new homes, representing the largest growth in the village for the next 100years; however, the 1901 Census still described the majority of workers as [...] "labourers and servants". The population spike between 1821 and 1901 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> typical to the general growth in the need for physical labour from parishes in the Kent downland agricultural region in the 19th century which was followed in the early 20th century by the increasing mechanisation of farming activity. Although the farms continue to employ from the village, as of 2008 Wormshill is largely a dormitory village, with residents employed in nearby towns or commuting to London. The socio-economic classification of Census 2001 indicated that the most common occupations were [...] "lower managerial and professional occupations" [...] (21.9 percent) and [...] "small employers and own account workers" [...] (15.2 percent).|$|E
