25|$|Willi-Peter Stoll (12 June 1950 – 6 September 1978) was an RAF {{member who}} was one of the men {{directly}} involved with the kidnap of Hanns-Martin Schleyer. He was said to have changed mentally after the event, and he became depressed and withdrew from the RAF. On 6 September 1978, Stoll was having <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Chinese restaurant in the Red Light District in Düsseldorf when he was approached by police. He drew his gun and a shoot-out followed that resulted in Stoll's death.|$|E
500|$|The Boy Scouts of America {{are quite}} {{particular}} {{about how and}} when the Scout uniforms and insignia {{may be used in}} film and other portrayals; and for that reason, most films and television productions made in the US utilize [...] "ersatz" [...] Scouting organizations. Examples of this include the [...] "Order of the Straight Arrow", portrayed in the King of the Hill cartoon series, and the [...] "Indian Guides" [...] depicted in the 1995 Chevy Chase film, Man of the House. One exception to this policy is the Walt Disney movie Follow Me, Boys! with Fred McMurray portraying a Scoutmaster of a rural troop. [...] It was released to theaters in 1966 and re-released in 1976. Another is the final scene of The Sopranos television show, where Tony Soprano sits down to <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> restaurant. At another table, several Cub Scouts, in full uniform, are seated.|$|E
500|$|Rotheram {{commanded}} Lapwing for {{the next}} two years, operating with the Channel Fleet and capturing several small French prizes. In 1802 Rotheram returned to reserve ashore during the Peace of Amiens. This retirement lasted until 1804, when Rotheram was recalled up to service as flag captain of HMS Dreadnought, a second rate ship of the line that flew the flag of Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Collingwood and Rotheram had a poor relationship, Collingwood commenting by letter to his brother that [...] "He [...] is a man of no talent as a sea officer, and of little assistance to me." [...] Nevertheless, when Collingwood moved to HMS Royal Sovereign in October 1805 as second-in-command of the fleet under Lord Nelson blockading the Franco-Spanish fleet in Cadiz, he brought Rotheram with him. Nelson was aware of the personal conflict between the men, and invited both Collingwood and Rotheram to <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> partially successful effort to reconcile them.|$|E

60|$|So Bullfinch {{approached}} the coffee-room door, and melodiously pitching his voice {{into a bar}} where two young ladies were keeping the books of the Temeraire, apologetically explained that we wished to order <b>a</b> little <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> hour, {{and that we were}} debarred from the execution of our inoffensive purpose by consignment to solitude.|$|R

500|$|Alpha Kappa Alpha {{celebrated its}} centenary with a year-long {{commemoration}} in 2008. The celebration {{coincided with the}} sorority's biennial Boulé. Internationally, some Alpha Kappa Alpha members began marking the festivities by making a pilgrimage to Howard University from January 12 to January 15, 2008. The activities included sorority members financially donating $1 million in scholarship funds to Howard University, contributing libraries for Middle School for Mathematics and Science and Asbury Dwelling for Senior Citizens, and unveiling a digital version [...] of the entire Ivy Leaf publication. In addition, sorority undergraduate and graduate members who were not available to attend ceremonies in Washington, D.C., held celebrations in local cities. On July 11 to July 18, 2008, Alpha Kappa Alpha held their 63rd Boulé. A town hall meeting with the public, a unity march {{in conjunction with other}} NPHC members, and a concert featuring R Grammy Award winning singer Patti LaBelle were some of the events which occurred at the centennial Boulé. On July 17, 2008, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority set a Guinness World Record when 16,206 members set a record by having the largest-ever silver service sit-down <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> convention.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{below the}} {{constellation}} of top restaurants, there were a dozen others that offered excellent food at less extravagant prices, including the historic Ledoyen, next to the Champs-Elysées, where the famous painters had a table during the Salon; others listed in a guidebook for foreign tourists were the cafés Brébant, Magny, Veron, Procope and Durand.

2500|$|The hotel's full-service Pro Shop {{offered an}} {{instructional}} program called the [...] "Golf Studio", which {{was conducted by}} professionals for players of any age and playing level. The resort provided a restful atmosphere with pleasant views from the guest rooms. The Golf Resort was known for the Magnolia Room restaurant with its signature dessert, French Fried Ice Cream. The Magnolia Room, later the Trophy Room, served breakfast, lunch and <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large, open room complete with a high-timbered ceiling with live entertainment.|$|E

2500|$|After Contessa Brewer {{left the}} show, Imus {{went on a}} tirade, saying, [...] "With that fat ass she's got, she wouldn't be one of 'em," [...] Imus said on the air, [...] "That skank has to spend three hours with makeup in the morning." [...] The tirade was {{allegedly}} tied to comments overheard from Contessa's calling Imus [...] "a cantankerous old fool" [...] at a 2005 <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> restaurant {{when she was still}} a newsreader. During a show a producer also made fun of poet Maya Angelou.|$|E
2500|$|His personality, {{externally}} at least, was cold, dignified, and grave. Some {{of those}} who knew him best say that he was in reality warm-hearted but the characteristics that made an impression on every one were his reserve and his austerity; in general he was an object of respect rather than of affection; he had none of the weaknesses that make men lovable. As deeply religious as any of his Puritan ancestors, he was most broadly tolerant of the beliefs of others. His conception of civic duty was Roman, but he was ever willing to oppose even the State in defending what he regarded as the constitutional and legal rights of the individual. He was frugal {{to such a degree that}} on one occasion when traveling as governor with his staff, instead of partaking of a sumptuous <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dining car specially provided for them, he rode in a coach and ate a sandwich which he had brought from home. With this frugality he combined a generosity even more marked. Part of his life was lived in the days of high hats. Such hats, when they became old, were usually donated to the missionaries. To quote from one who for many years served with Judge Baldwin on the committee of a missionary society, [...] "He used to turn in his old high hat at the shop for fifteen cents, but he would give $1,500 to the committee for missions." [...] He was unyielding where a principle was involved; but in matters of mere policy he had the remarkable ability, once he was outvoted, to make the policy of the majority his own even though he had strenuously opposed it.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1997 {{the public}} were shocked by {{allegations}} that Haughey had embezzled money {{destined for the}} Fianna Fáil party, taxpayers' money taken from government funds earmarked for the operation of a political party, {{and that he had}} spent large portions of these funds on Charvet shirts and expensive <b>dinners</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> top Dublin restaurant while preaching belt-tightening and implementing budget cuts as a national policy.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Now, {{our plan}} shall be this,' says Bullfinch, with his {{forefinger}} at his nose.
