5|$|Poohsticks is a sport first {{mentioned}} in The House at Pooh Corner, a Winnie-the-Pooh book by A. A. Milne. It {{is a simple}} sport which may be played on any bridge over running water; each player drops a stick on the upstream side of a bridge and the one whose stick first appears on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> is the winner. The annual World Poohsticks Championships have been held at Day's Lock on the River Thames in the UK since 1984.|$|E
25|$|It is {{well known}} that in Venezuela, Internet has {{slowdown}} problems on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side,</b> because CANTV's links are saturated, due to high demand and low investments.|$|E
25|$|In LMP markets, where {{constraints}} {{exist on}} a transmission network, {{there is a}} need for more expensive generation to be dispatched on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> of the constraint.

40|$|We studied shocks in {{a coastal}} {{boundary}} current with zero potential vorticity. By coastal boundary current, we mean a semigeostrophic light fluid flow over an infinitely deep dense fluid and along a coast on its right hand side, with its lower interface {{exposed to the}} ocean surface at some finite distance from the coast. The shocks are assumed to conserve mass and momentum. It is found that the shocks can be classified into two categories, “coastal shocks ” and “frontal shocks”, by {{the signs of the}} upper layer flux relative to the shocks. Coastal shocks, for which the relative upper layer flux is negative, always propagate downstream. The upper layer at the coast is thicker on the upstream sides of coastal shocks than on the <b>downstream</b> <b>sides.</b> Frontal shocks, for which the relative upper layer flux is positive, propagate upstream as well as downstream. In most cases, the current is wider on the <b>downstream</b> <b>sides</b> of frontal shocks than on the upstream sides. However, under the circumstances that the current is nearly separated from the coast, the current is wider on the upstream sides of frontal shocks. Coastal and frontal shocks both dissipate energy of the current. We also demonstrate that special shocks with no light fluid on the <b>downstream</b> <b>sides</b> cannot exist irrespective of the potential vorticity distribution. 1...|$|R
25|$|The fourth {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} in 1953 on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> of the old bridge, using a construction designed by A.M. Hamilton in 1930 and is called a Callender-Hamilton bridge. The fourth bridge was retained for use by cyclists and pedestrians when the fifth bridge was completed in 1999.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} raised {{tailings}} dam designs, the upstream, downstream and centerline, named {{according to the}} movement of the crest during raising. The specific design used is dependent upon topography, geology, climate, the type of tailings, and cost. An upstream tailings dam consists of trapezoidal embankments being constructed on top but toe to crest of another, moving the crest further upstream. This creates a relatively flat <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> and a jagged upstream side which is supported by tailings slurry in the impoundment. The downstream design refers to the successive raising of the embankment that positions the fill and crest further downstream. A centerlined dam has sequential embankment dams constructed directly on top of another while fill is placed on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> for support and slurry supports the upstream side.|$|E
25|$|The third {{bridge was}} damaged during World War II in 1940, {{leading to a}} {{permanent}} weight restriction. To alleviate this a fourth temporary bridge was constructed in 1953 on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> of the old bridge; this was relegated to use by cyclists and pedestrians only until finally demolished in 1985.|$|E
50|$|The wafer style {{butterfly}} valve {{is designed to}} maintain a seal against bi-directional pressure differential to prevent any backflow in systems designed for unidirectional flow. It accomplishes this with a tightly fitting seal; i.e., gasket, o-ring, precision machined, and a flat valve face on the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>sides</b> of the valve.|$|R

25|$|Immediately {{above the}} <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> {{of the dam}} is the Seneca Pumped Storage Generating Station, a {{hydroelectric}} power plant using pumped storage to accommodate peak electrical load by storing potential energy in water pumped into an upper reservoir. It uses base load electricity, then reclaims that energy when needed by allowing the water to fall back down and drive generators along the way.|$|E
25|$|On the piers of {{the bridge}} are stone carvings of water birds by {{sculptor}} John Birnie Philip. On the East (<b>downstream)</b> <b>side</b> (i.e. the side closer to the Thames Estuary and North Sea), the carvings show marine life and seabirds; those on the West (upstream) side show freshwater birds – reflecting the role of Blackfriars as the tidal turning point.|$|E
25|$|The longest {{buttress}} dam was the 632+m long Consuegra Dam (3rd–4thcenturyAD) in central Spain {{which is still}} fairly well preserved. Instead of an earth embankment, its only 1.3m thick retaining wall was supported on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> by buttresses in regular intervals of 5 to 10m. In Spain, {{a large number of}} ancient {{buttress dam}}s are concentrated, representing nearly one-third of the total found there.|$|E

Instead they appear to absorb oxygen directly through pores in their [...] "skin" [...] from the enveloping water. The caterpillars require flowing water to provide sufficient oxygen. They spin [...] "silk" [...] tethers to attach themselves to the <b>downstream</b> <b>sides</b> of rocks to keep from washing away.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} phase {{actually started}} in early 1715. Initially a core trench was excavated {{into which the}} dam was embedded. The building material for this was excavated from the land earmarked for the future reservoir. Granite blocks needed for the up- and <b>downstream</b> <b>sides</b> of the dam were cut from small quarries; this also provided a supply of granitic sand. The mining of material for the dam enabled the future reservoir capacity to be further enlarged.|$|R
25|$|But Washington Airport {{was only}} {{marginally}} safer than Hoover Field. Arlington Beach, a local amusement park with a Ferris wheel and high rollercoasters, was located {{to the northeast}} (on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> of Highway Bridge), and a landfill existed on the eastern side. The trash in the landfill was also on fire. The smoke sometimes obscured the landing field, and the stench was notorious through the city of Washington. The owners also {{could not afford to}} pave the runways.|$|E
25|$|As long as {{this process}} is gradual, the tissue gas loading in the diver will reduce by {{diffusion}} and perfusion until it eventually re-stabilises at the current saturation pressure. The problem arises when the pressure is reduced more quickly than the gas can be removed by this mechanism, {{and the level of}} supersaturation rises sufficiently to become unstable. At this point, bubbles may form and grow in the tissues, and may cause damage either by distending the tissue locally, or blocking small blood vessels, shutting off blood supply to the <b>downstream</b> <b>side,</b> and resulting in hypoxia of those tissues.|$|E
25|$|In a gravity dam, {{the force}} that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on {{the mass of the}} dam. The water presses {{laterally}} (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> of the dam). The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes upstream of the toe of the dam.|$|E
40|$|The {{article has}} data on {{potential}} designs of overflow structures made of soil rather than concrete. The most reliable and cheap ones are dykes made of sandbags. This viewpoint is substantiated by {{the operation of}} peatland irrigation systems, constructed in the Moscow region in 2011 — 2012. The construction of overflow sandbag dykes must have slope/riverbed protection structures to withstand their erosion by open and filtration flows of the downstream. Designs of overflow dykes having their <b>downstream</b> <b>sides</b> protected by geosynthetic coats, which are patented by other hydraulic engineers, have proven unreliable...|$|R
40|$|A new {{magnetic}} configuration is {{proposed for the}} suppression of co-extracted electrons in a negative- ion accelerator. This configuration is produced by an arrangement of permanent magnets embedded in one accelerator grid and creates an asymmetric local magnetic field on the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>sides</b> of this grid. Thanks to the “concentration” of the magnetic field on the upstream side of the grid, the resulting deflection of the ions due to magnetic field can be “intrinsically” cancelled by calibrating the configuration of permanent magnets. At the same time, the suppression of co-extracted electrons can be improved...|$|R

25|$|Following {{a lengthy}} {{campaign}} {{which came to}} a conclusion in 1869, the bridge became free from tolls on 12 March 1870, and celebrations including a fireworks show were followed {{a few days later}} with the burning of the toll gates on Hampton Green. The narrowness of the road became a problem and in 1911 the engineering firm Mott & Hay was contracted to widen the bridge on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side.</b> The work was undertaken between 1912 and 1914 with the carriageway increased from 25 feet to 55 feet. A new façade of Portland Stone was designed to replicate the features of the original. The bridge was reopened in October 1914. It was widened again in 2000 to include two bicycle lanes, larger pavements and a bus lane.|$|E
25|$|Guillotine gates. Some locks have {{vertically}} moving steel gates – {{these are}} quite common on river navigations in East Anglia. Sometimes {{just one of}} the pairs of swinging gates is replaced by a guillotine: for instance at Salterhebble Locks, where space to swing the balance beams of bottom gates of the lowest lock was restricted by bridge widening. On the River Nene most locks have this arrangement as in time of flood the top mitre gates are chained open and the bottom guillotines lifted so that the lock chamber acts as an overflow sluice. Guillotine gates are also used on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> of larger locks such as the 23m Bollène lock on the River Rhône, the aperture being large enough for a boat to travel under it.|$|E
25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the <b>downstream</b> <b>side.</b> Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A fuse plug spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the prediction of}} seepage in the impervious zones of six embankment dams by seepage analysis. In addition, by making use of the available monitored pore water pressure data of the first filling of reservoir, back analysis was carried out to estimate the best fit seepage parameters. The estimated parameters were used for further prediction of pore water pressures in subsequent monitored durations with reasonable accuracy. The accuracy of prediction was evaluated quantitatively by the prediction difference and error index. The {{results show that the}} error indices in the upstream sides of the impervious zones are smaller than those in the <b>downstream</b> <b>sides...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{process called}} "piping", which often occurs in water-retaining {{structures}} (earth-dams, dykes, levees), involving {{the formation and}} progression of a continuous tunnel between the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>sides,</b> {{is one of the}} main cause of structure failure. Starting with the diphasic flow volume equations and the jump equations including the erosion processes, a simplified one-dimensional model for two-phase piping flow erosion was developed. The numerical simulation based on constant input and output pressures showed that the particle concentration can be a significant factor at the very beginning of the process, resulting in the enlargement of the hole at the exit. However, it was concluded that this influence is a secondary factor: the dilute flow assumption, which considerably simplifies the description, is relevant here...|$|R

500|$|In 1804, Charles Heath recorded, [...] "The {{interior}} {{has nothing}} worthy {{of attention and}} the only purpose {{to which it is}} employed is an occasional guardhouse, or powder room, for the military, when stationed at Monmouth." [...] The gatehouse had by this point been abandoned as a dwelling. The lean-to extensions, including the guardhouse, were demolished around 1815. In 1819, a pedestrian passageway was driven through the building on the upstream side to help relieve the flow of traffic across the bridge. Before 1830, the gatehouse was owned by Monmouth Corporation, and subsequently the County Council, as inheritors of the medieval burgesses. In a lengthy transaction, begun that year but not concluded until 1835, ownership was formally transferred to the Duke of Beaufort as part of a property exchange. The gatehouse roof was reconstructed in 1832, with deeper eaves and four decorative corbels on each side. A second passageway was added on the <b>downstream</b> <b>side</b> of the arch in 1845. Since then, the structure has remained essentially unchanged, save for periodic maintenance and repair.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{have studied}} the homoepitaxial growth of SiC by CVD on trenched 8 ° {{off-axis}} 4 H-SiC (0001) substrates formed by reactive ion etching (RIE). The influences of C/Si ratio and trench direction on the growth have been investigated. Growth near the trenches perpendicular to the off-direction tended to be highly asymmetric due {{to the influence of}} step-flow growth, and the (0001) facet was formed at the <b>downstream</b> <b>sides</b> of off-direction.

5000|$|As Bridge Creek flowed {{toward the}} growing Colorado River {{during the last}} ice age, it carved first through softer rocks and veered away from the harder Triassic and Jurassic sandstones, {{eventually}} creating a wide hairpin bend that flowed around a solid [...] "fin" [...] of sandstone that would become Rainbow Bridge. The previous course of the creek is still visible above the bridge. Water flows back on itself at bends and wide spots, creating swirling eddies along the banks. As the creek flowed around Rainbow Bridge fin, these abrasive eddies formed on both the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>sides</b> and cut circular alcoves in the rock wall. The sediment in the creek eventually scoured the softer layers of sandstone away, leaving the harder layers behind.|$|R

It is observed that the imparted thrust increases {{with an increase in}} the downstream gas flow rate; simultaneously an upstream-peaking profile of the plasma density observed for the upstream gas injection becomes uniform for the downstream gas injection. The difference in the thrust between the upstream and downstream gas injections is enhanced by increasing the rf power.
