Polypropylene samples were injection moulded into standard disks with a HAAKE MiniJet II injection moulder at 190 °C and 200 bar for morphological and mechanical tests. The morphological and mechanical properties of specimens were investigated by means of optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microhardness (MH) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The samples exhibited a typical &# 945;-modification spherulite structure of <b>isotactic</b> <b>polypropylenes</b> crystallized from the melt. It {{was found that the}} most important factor affecting the structure and properties of these polymers is the isotacticity content. A clear molecular weight effect was also found for samples with low molecular weights. The microhardness and storage modulus values increased as crystallinity did. Accordingly, isotacticity degree is considered as the main parameter affecting the crystallinity of samples...|$|R

50|$|Polymers are {{composed}} of long molecular chains which form irregular, entangled coils in the melt. Some polymers retain such a disordered structure upon freezing and thus convert into amorphous solids. In other polymers, the chains rearrange upon freezing and form partly ordered regions with a typical size of the order 1 micrometer. Although it would be energetically favorable for the polymer chains to align parallel, such alignment is hindered by the entanglement. Therefore, within the ordered regions, the polymer chains are both aligned and folded. Those regions are therefore neither crystalline nor amorphous and are classified as semicrystalline. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are linear polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or <b>isotactic</b> <b>polypropylene</b> (PP).|$|E

A model is proposed that accounts for the variations of the fractions of amorphous material which undergo these relaxations.

Moreover, degradation usually induced by peroxide was shown to be comparatively limited in additional presence of N-bromosuccinimide. This fast and easy process therefore allows the production of polypropylene plastomers and elastomers with controlled and homogeneous crystallinities and isotacticities, and relatively low molecular weight distributions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{crystallization}} and melting {{behavior are}} closely related {{not only to the}} external conditions such as undercooling and cooling rate, but also to the chain struc-ture characteristics such as isotacticity distribution.

40|$|Several ansa C 1 -symmetric cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl {{metallocenes}} {{based on}} zirconium {{have been prepared}} with different substituents at position 3 on the cyclopentadienyl ring. <b>Isotactic</b> <b>polypropylene</b> production from these systems depends highly {{on the size of}} these substituents. Therefore, large groups such as 1 -methyl- 4 -tbutylcyclohexyl (metallocene 6), 1 -methyl-cyclohexyl (metallocene 7), 1, 3, 3, 5 - tetramethylcyclohexyl (metallocene 8), and 2, 3, 4 -trimethyl- 3 -pentyl (metallocene 9) have been investigated. In combination with methylaluminoxane (MAO), they showed good activity and produced high molecular weight of <b>isotactic</b> <b>polypropylene.</b> In terms of the tacticity of the polymers, metallocene 6 made the best <b>isotactic</b> <b>polypropylene</b> with ~ 88 % mmmm pentad content. Also, it has been found that if the size of this substituent is large as in 2, 3, 4 -trimethyl- 3 -pentyl (metallocene 9), then it will block the polymerization active site which will deactivate the metallocene. New synthetic pathways for the synthesis of cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl metallocenes based on titanium have been achieved. Anchoring these types of ligands onto titanium by following the conventional method of using TiCl 4 in the metallation step has failed for the production of Me 2 C(3 -(diphenylmethyl) -C 5 H 3) (C 13 H 8) TiCl 2 (metallocene 12), Ph 2 C(C 5 H 4) (C 13 H 8) TiCl 2 (metallocene 14), and Ph 2 C(C 5 H 4) (C 13 H 8) TiMe 2 (metallocene 15); this is possibly due to the high reactivity of TiCl 4. Therefore, TiCl 4 ?? 2 THF has been prepared and used in that step to produce these new titanocenes with good yields. A new ansa-C 2 -symmetric substituted bis-indenyl metallocene for <b>isotactic</b> <b>polypropylene</b> production has been successfully prepared. It is known that ansa-C 2 - symmetric metallocenes are good catalysts for <b>isotactic</b> <b>polypropylene</b> production, but in general, their synthesis suffers from the production of the meso Cs-stereoisomer of these catalysts, which generally produces only atactic polypropylene.

40|$|The {{influence}} of cooling rate from the melt on the polymorphism and crystallinity is investigated {{as a function}} of isotacticity and stereo-defect distribution in polypropylenes. Detailed analysis of wide angle x-ray diffraction patterns shows that crystallinity in the materials used is nearly independent of the experimental cooling rates (0. 5 – 408 C/min). At high cooling rates, the materials exist mainly in the a-phase, whereas the amount of the g-phase increases at the lower cooling rates. With an increasing amount of stereo-defects, this cooling-rate dependence of the polymorphism is enhanced. The effect of different stereo-defect distributions, as observed in metallocene- (random) and Ziegler–Natta (blocklike) derived <b>isotactic</b> <b>polypropylenes,</b> was investigated.

Whilst blending could allow systems having similar thermo-mechanical and electrical properties to XLPE to be designed, it was not possible to obtain better performance than XLPE using these systems.
