40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} finding the optimal shape of a {{continuous}} structure is addressed using, alternatively, heuristic, evolutionary and mixed evolutionary and heuristic optimization strategies. Boundaries are represented by B-splines. Two heuristics for minimizing {{the weight of a}} structure subject to limits on von Mises stresses and geometrical constraints are implemented: 'generalized biological growth' and 'penalized biological growth'. Penalized <b>biological</b> <b>growth</b> adds to generalized <b>biological</b> <b>growth</b> a control for shape changes. This control is based on the overall state of constraints satisfaction in the structure. The two heuristics are very efficient at improving the designs, but they do not yield globally optimal shapes. Therefore, they are interfaced with an evolutionary optimizer. Different strategies for mixing evolutionary search and <b>biological</b> <b>growth</b> are compared.

40|$|Background: Regular {{inspection}} of the cleanliness of the ventilation systems, {{as well as their}} periodic cleaning and disinfection, if necessary, are the main factors of the proper maintenance of each system. Performing maintenance operations on the ventilation system, workers are exposed to risk associated with the exposure to <b>harmful</b> <b>biological</b> agents. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the employees' exposure to bioaerosols during maintenance work on ventilation systems. Material and Methods: Bioaerosol measurements were carried out using a button sampler. The microbial particles were collected on gelatin filters. Settled-dust samples from the inner surface of the air ducts and filter-mat samples were selected for the microbiological analysis. In the collected air, dust and filter samples the concentration of bacteria and fungi were determined. Results: Bacteria and fungi concentrations ranged between 3. 6 × 102 - 2. 2 × 104 CFU/m 3 and 4. 7 × 102 - 4. 5 × 103 CFU/m 3 at workplaces where the operations connected with mechanical ventilation cleaning were performed and 2. 2 × 104 - 1. 2 × 105 CFU/m 3 and 9. 8 × 101 - 2. 5 × 102 CFU/m 3 at workplaces where filter exchange was performed, respectively. The qualitative analysis of microorganisms isolated from the air in all studied workplaces revealed that the most prevalent bacteria belonged to Bacillus genus. The average concentrations of bacteria and fungi in filter-mat samples were 3. 3 × 103 CFU/cm 2 and 1. 4 × 104 CFU/cm 2, respectively. In settled-dust samples, average concentrations were 591 CFU/ 100 cm 2 and 52 CFU/ 100 cm 2, for bacteria and fungi respectively. Conclusions: Workers cleaning ventilation systems are exposed to <b>harmful</b> <b>biological</b> agents classified into risk groups, 1 and 2, according to their level of the risk of infection. The research conducted in the workplace can be the basis of risk assessment related to exposure to <b>harmful</b> <b>biological</b> agents during maintenance work in ventilation.

40|$|Cooling water {{deficiency}} due {{to limited}} freshwater sources posed an obstacle of expending current thermoelectric power generation in the U.

Of all the potential alternatives, secondary treated municipal wastewater is prominent because of its vast allocation and abundant quantity. However, the impaired water quality and unique environment make the cooling tower management more challenging. Therefore, prudent water quality management with chemicals is required to prevent corrosion, scaling, and <b>biological</b> <b>growth</b> in the cooling systems. 	This study focused on {{the understanding of the}} kinetic, effectiveness, and dosage requirement of chlorine-based biocides (chlorine, chloramine and chlorine dioxide) in the recirculating cooling systems using treated municipal wastewater as makeup. Laboratory-scale studies and pilot-scale cooling systems were used to evaluate the <b>biological</b> <b>growth</b> under realistic conditions associated with full-scale cooling systems. Results of 30 -day field tests indicated that the pilot-scale cooling towers developed in this study are reliable for evaluating different chemical regimes by maintaining steady cooling performance under various operating conditions. 	Direct use of secondary treated effluent for cooling water is a feasible option when using monochloramine as major biocide. The low oxidizing ability of monochloramine resulted in a high residence time and high penetrating ability, and thus provided better biocidal effectiveness against planktonic and sessile heterotrophic bacteria and Legionella in recirculating cooling systems. A minimum monochloramine residual above 3 mg/L in the recirculating cooling water is needed for proper <b>biological</b> <b>growth</b> control with this impaired water. 	<b>Biological</b> <b>growth</b> potential is comparable in secondary treated effluent subjected to different tertiary treatment (i. e., nitrification, sand filtration, activated carbon adsorption) regardless of total organic carbon concentration in the wastewater. The performance of monochloramine was optimized when the secondary treated effluent was subjected to nitrification and sand filtration. 	The key findings {{of this study indicate that}} <b>biological</b> <b>growth</b> can be controlled in cooling systems using treated municipal effluents as makeup.
