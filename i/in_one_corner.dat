Some plastic chairs, pails and mini-tubs kindly donated by visitors are stored at {{the perimeter of the}} compound, which has a makeshift shed <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner.</b> A caretaker, paid by Mindef, takes care of the place to ensure its overall cleanliness, but there is no toilet on location. The hot spring is less frequented nowadays but remains rustic for rural and suburban families to discover and explore.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the chapel}} was {{believed}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been buried under the earthworks when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating for the site, and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the keep, the section of which had been reroofed and turned into an apartment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise is {{approaching}} the planet. Picard enters his ready room and finds his belongings {{scattered on the}} floor. He calls in Worf, who cannot explain their displacement. D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds nothing there. Then it suddenly appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge.

5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out. The fort continued to decay until the 20th century. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military. The interior was cleared out and a shed was built <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner.</b> A slit trench was dug {{on the north side of}} the building, a rifle embrasure formed on the east side of the building, and a machine-gun position was dug out and protected with sandbags outside it.|$|E
5|$|Launceston Castle {{is located}} in the town of Launceston, Cornwall, England. It was {{probably}} built by Robert the Count of Mortain after 1068, and initially comprised an earthwork and timber castle with a large motte <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner.</b> Launceston Castle formed the administrative centre of the new earldom of Cornwall, with a large community packed within the walls of its bailey. It was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century and then substantially redeveloped by Richard of Cornwall after 1227, including a high tower to enable visitors to view his surrounding lands. When Richard's son, Edmund, inherited the castle, he moved the earldom's administration to Lostwithiel, triggering the castle's decline. By 1337, the castle was increasingly ruinous and used primarily as a gaol and to host judicial assizes.|$|E
5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner,</b> and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E

It was built with a {{combination}} of Victorian, Moorish and Malay architectures. The Johor Bahru Old Chinese temple, located on the Trus Road, hosts the Gods of five Chinese dialects spoken in the city. It was built in 1875 and renovated by the Persekutuan Tiong Hua Johor Bahru (Johor Bahru Tiong Hua Association) in 1994–95 {{with the addition of a}} small L-shaped museum <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the square premises. The Wong Ah Fook Mansion, the home of the late Wong Ah Fook, was a former historical attraction. It stood for more than 150 years but was demolished illegally by its owner in 2014 to make way for a commercial housing development without informing the state government. Other historical religious buildings include the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Hindu Temple, Sri Raja Mariamman Hindu Temple, Gurdwara Sahib and Church of the Immaculate Conception.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, at {{the urging}} of {{relatives}} of the four students killed in 1970, the university constructed an individual memorial for each {{of the students in the}} parking lot between Taylor and Prentice halls. Each of the four memorials is located on the exact spot where the student fell, mortally wounded.

25|$|While {{this took}} place, in April the new Chief of Air Corps, Maj. Gen. James Fechet, {{appointed}} {{a committee of}} senior officers headed by Brig. Gen. Benjamin D. Foulois to approve a design. In July it rejected the circular layout proposed for the new base and put forth a plan that placed all buildings <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the property. Just prior to acceptance of the property, Lahm sharply criticized the revision to Fechet and a reconsideration, also on August 16, 1928, approved the original circular design. Clark was then detailed for special duty in Washington D.C. as Lahm's liaison with the Construction Service, Quartermaster Corps, which would build the base.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, little changed {{politically}} in Russia {{during this}} period, and the Winter Palace remained in darkness. In 1913 the Romanov dynasty celebrated its tercentenary, but the crowds that flocked {{to see the}} processions were thin, the Empress appeared unhappy and the heir sick. The Tsar and Empress declined to hold a celebratory ball at the Winter Palace, instead holding two small receptions, both of which the Empress failed to attend. In 1914, Russia was forced {{to go to war}} {{as a result of the}} Triple Entente Alliance. The Tsar and Empress briefly returned to the Winter Palace to stand on their balcony to accept salutes and homage from the departing troops. Ironically, unlike the monarchs of Europe who stood on balconies adorned with velvet, flanked by their families, the Tsar and Empress stood, alone, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of an unadorned balcony, appearing almost lost next to an oversized Imperial emblem, soon to be torn down by their own subjects. As the departing troops saluted their monarch in front of the palace, plans were being drawn up to store the palace's contents and convert the state rooms into a hospital to receive returning troops.|$|E

500|$|The castle was {{positioned}} <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the town, following a similar town plan {{to that in}} the town of Conwy, although in Beaumaris no town walls were constructed at first, despite some foundations being laid.

James had been appointed the [...] "master of the king's works in Wales", reflecting the responsibility he had in their construction and design. From 1295 onwards, Beaumaris became his primary responsibility and more frequently he was given the title [...] "magister operacionum de Bello Marisco". The work was recorded in considerable detail on the pipe rolls, the continuous records of medieval royal expenditure, and, as a result, the early stages of construction at Beaumaris are relatively well understood for the period.|$|E
