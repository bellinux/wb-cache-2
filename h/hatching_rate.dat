5|$|The frogs {{may move}} up to 100m during amplexus before the female lays her eggs. During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to {{fertilise}} the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen to paddle their rear legs during this time, which is speculated to accelerate fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, a clump of 11,682 has been recorded. The female moves around while depositing, {{leaving a trail of}} eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2–2.5mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black at one end and white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The <b>hatching</b> <b>rate</b> varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22°C. Hatching is less likely in acidic waters, although alkaline conditions do not lead to a lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{specific}} insect genotypes that enable {{efficient use of}} agricultural plants is an important subject not only in applied fields like pest control and management but also in basic disciplines like evolutionary biology. Conventionally, it has been presupposed that such pest-related ecological traits are attributed to genes encoded in the insect genomes. Here, however, we report that pest status of an insect is principally determined by symbiont genotype rather than by insect genotype. A pest stinkbug species, Megacopta punctatissima, performed well on crop legumes, while a closely related non-pest species, Megacopta cribraria, suffered low egg <b>hatch</b> <b>rate</b> on the plants.

However, those eggs hatched 2.3 times more successfully than eggs that were produced through selfing. The results observed in this experiment corroborates previous studies of S.

This discrepancy can be attributed to study source and the environment in which the experiment was conducted. The previous studies used wild cestodes while this study observed offsprings of wild cestodes bred in the laboratory. It has been speculated that a laboratory environment lowers selective pressures that would otherwise be present in the wild, thus allowing for genes that would be suppressed in the wild to be passed on to the next generation.|$|E

Smaller territories where prey {{does not have}} to be carried as far enhances {{reproductive}} success. [...] This species nests on cliff ledges, so breeding adults are local during the breeding season. The clutch averages four eggs, which are subelliptical and pinkish with brown, reddish-brown, and purplish dots. As part of their adaptation to hotter and lower humidity desert climates, the eggs of the prairie falcon are less porous and retain water better than those of their peregrine falcon cousins, leading to a higher <b>hatching</b> <b>rate</b> under these conditions. The incubation period is 31 days, beginning with the 2nd to last or last egg laid. Incubation becomes more intense after later eggs are laid, somewhat evening out hatching times. As is typical for falcons, the female does most of the incubating and brooding, and the male brings most of the food, with the female also hunting after the young are 12 to 14 days old. The young fledge (first fly) from 36 to 41 days after hatching. They continue to be supported by their parents while learning to fly and hunt, with the parents gradually winding down the amount of food they provide as the youngsters' hunting skills improve. At approximately 65 days of age they are ready to be self-sufficient, and disperse from their natal area.|$|E
50|$|Crag martin pairs nest {{alone or}} in small colonies, usually {{containing}} fewer than ten nests. Nests are on average 30 m apart and each pair aggressively defends its breeding territory against other crag martin and most other bird species. Nesting takes place from May to August, and usually two broods are raised. The nest, built by both adults, is an open half cup made of mud and lined with soft material such as feathers or dry grass. It is constructed under an overhang on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or cave, or on a man-made structure. It takes one to three weeks to build and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. The clutch is two to five eggs {{with an average of}} three. The eggs are white with brownish blotches particularly at the wide end, and average 20.2 x 14.0 mm with a weight of 2.08 g.

Both parents feed the chicks bringing food every two to five minutes, and the young are fed for 14-21 days after fledging. With such frequent feeding rates the adults mainly forage in the best hunting zones in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since the further they fly to forage the longer it would take to bring food to the chicks in the nest.

One {{of the most common}} predators encountered by these arboreal eggs is the cat-eyed snake, Leptodeira septentrionalis.  In order to escape predation, the red-eyed tree frogs have developed a form of adaptive plasticity, which can also be considered phenotypic plasticity, when it comes to hatching age; the clutch is able to hatch prematurely and survive outside of the egg five days after oviposition when faced with an immediate threat of predation.  The egg clutches take in important information from the vibrations felt around them and use it {{to determine whether or not}} they are at risk of predation. In the event of a snake attack, the clutch identifies the threat by the vibrations given off which, in turn, stimulates hatching almost instantaneously.  In a controlled experiment conducted by Karen Warkentin, <b>hatching</b> <b>rate</b> and ages of red-eyed tree frogs were observed in clutches that were and were not attacked by the cat-eyed snake.  When a clutch was attacked at six days of age, the entire clutch hatched at the same time, almost instantaneously.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of 6 h- and 10 h-storage at - 8 ºC on the quality and <b>hatch</b> <b>rate</b> of Piaractus mesopotamicus embryos at 4 stages of development. Embryos were exposed to a cryoprotectant solution, cooled down {{at a rate of}} 1 ºC. min- 1 to - 8 ºC, and stored at this temperature for 6 h and 10 h, respectively. For control treatment, viable embryos at the 4 developmental stages studied, were selected and taken immediately to the incubator, without going through cooling. The results were evaluated using a multivariate statistical technique (factor analysis). Damage was characterized according to the following variables: uniformity, adhesion, symmetry, margins, and inclusion. Two factors that best explained the variance of each parameter were defined. The control group had the highest <b>hatch</b> <b>rates,</b> and a weak relationship with embryo damage. Although treatments involving 6 h and 10 h cooling exhibited lower <b>hatch</b> <b>rates</b> and a higher association to damage. The information obtained in this study is useful in promoting improved cryopreservation techniques for fish embryos, indicating the probable conditions under which certain injuries are more frequent.
