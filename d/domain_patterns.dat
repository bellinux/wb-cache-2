40|$|Recent {{experiment}} [1] revealed {{many new}} {{characteristics of the}} <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> in a superelastic polycrystalline NiTi tube during tensile loading, such as domain wall instability and branching, dynamic topology transition of <b>domain</b> <b>patterns.</b> In this paper, we use the continuum mechanics approach and model the polycrystal as a phase-transformable continuum described by non-local nonlinear elasticity [2]. We simulate the equilibrium macroscopic <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> and their evolution in the tubes under tensile loading by the nonlocal Finite Element Method (FEM). It is revealed that the loading path dependence and dynamic topology transition of <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> are mainly due to thermodynamic metastability of the tube system.

Numerical {{simulations}} show that concentric-ring <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> centered at a strong defect are observed under a rapidly oscillating field in some cases. The concentric-ring pattern appears near the threshold of spatially-uniform patterns in high-frequency cases. The threshold is theoretically estimated and the theoretical threshold is in good agreement with numerical one in a high-frequency region. The theoretical analysis gives also good estimations of several characteristics of <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> for high-frequencies. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} electron {{system in}} the presence of a magnetic field and microwave irradiation can undergo a phase transition towards a zero-resistance state. A widely used model predicts the zero-resistance state to be a domain state, which responds to applied dc voltages or dc currents by slightly changing the domain structure. Here we propose an alternative response scenario, according to which the <b>domain</b> <b>pattern</b> remains unchanged. Surprisingly, a fixed <b>domain</b> <b>pattern</b> does not destroy zero resistance, provided that the resistance is direction independent. Otherwise, if the symmetry of the <b>domain</b> <b>pattern</b> allows a direction dependence of the resistance, the domain state can be dissipative. We give examples for both situations and simulate the response behavior numerically. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We present detail {{investigation}} of the domain evolution in lithium niobate and lithium tantalate during backswitched electric field poling which allowed to produce micro- and nanoscale <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> by application of voltage to lithographically defined strip electrodes. In situ optical observation of the domain kinetics during poling and high-resolution visualization by SEM and SFM of the static <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> on polar surfaces and cross-sections have been used.

The new phenomena include deformation instability with {{the formation of}} a helical domain, domain topology transition from helix to cylinder, domain-front branching and loading-path dependence of <b>domain</b> <b>patterns.</b> In this paper, we model the polycrystal as an elastic continuum with nonconvex strain energy([2]) and adopt the non-local strain gradient energy to account for the energy of the diffusive domain front. We simulate the equilibrium <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> and their evolution in tire tubes under tensile loading by a non-local Finite Element Method (FEM). It is revealed that the observed loading-path dependence and topology transition of <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> are due to the thermodynamic metastability of tire tube system.

40|$|Freestanding BaTiO 3 nanodots exhibit domain {{structures}} {{characterized by}} distinct quadrants of ferroelastic 90 domains in {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) observations. These differ significantly from flux-closure <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> in the same systems imaged by piezoresponse force microscopy. Based upon a series of phase field simulations of BaTiO 3 nanodots, we suggest that the TEM patterns result from a radial electric field arising from electron beam charging of the nanodot. For sufficiently large charging, this converts flux-closure <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> to quadrant patterns with radial net polarizations. Not only does this explain the puzzling patterns that have been observed in TEM studies of ferroelectric nanodots, but also suggests how to manipulate ferroelectric <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> via electron beams.

Magnetic <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> under a zero field are usually observed after an external magnetic field is removed.

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of the <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> in systems with {{competing}} short-range attractive interactions and long range repulsive Coulomb interactions. We take an energetic approach, in which patterns are considered as critical points of a mean-field free energy functional. Close to the microphase separation transition, this functional takes on a universal form, allowing to treat a number of diverse physical situations within a unified framework. We use asymptotic analysis to study <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> with sharp interfaces. We derived an interfacial representation of the pattern's free energy which remains valid in the fluctuating system, with a suitable renormalization of the Coulomb interaction's coupling constant. We also derived integrodifferential equations describing the stationary <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> of arbitrary shapes and their thermodynamic stability, coming from {{the first and second}} variation of the interfacial free energy. We showed that the length scale of a stable domain pattern must obey a certain scaling law with the strength of the Coulomb interaction. We analyzed existence and stability of localized (spots, stripes, annuli) and periodic (lamellar, hexagonal) patterns in two dimensions. We showed that these patterns are metastable in certain ranges of the parameters and that they can undergo morphological instabilities leading to the formation of more complex patterns. We discuss nucleation of the <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> by thermal fluctuations and pattern formation scenarios for various thermal quenches. We argue that self-induced disorder is an intrinsic property of the <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> in the systems under consideration.

40|$|Ferroelectrics form <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> that {{minimize}} {{their energy}} subject to imposed boundary conditions. In a linear, constrained theory, that neglects domain wall energy, periodic <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> {{in the form}} of multi-rank laminates can be identified as minimum energy states. However, when these laminates (formed in a macroscopic crystal) comprise of domains that are a few nanometers in size, the domain wall energy becomes significant, and the behaviour of laminate patterns at this scale is not known. Here, a phase-field model, which accounts for gradient energy and strain energy contributions, is employed to explore the stability and evolution of the nanoscale multi-rank laminates. The stress, electric field, and domain wall energies in the laminates are computed. The effect of scaling is also discussed. In the absence of external loading, stripe <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> are found to be lower energy states than the more complex, multi-rank laminates, which mostly collapse into simpler patterns. However, complex laminates can be stabilized by imposing external loads such as electric field, average strain and polarization.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} {{research is}} to understand domain evolution processes in ferroelectrics using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and Monte Carlo simulation. The results provide improved knowledge of domain evolution processes, and systematic experimental methods for research on domain evolution. There has been extensive previous research on domain evolution in ferroelectrics, but the research was mainly constrained to simple <b>domain</b> <b>patterns.</b> However, ferroelectric domains tend to form complex patterns that generate low-energy domain configurations. In this research, {{several methods such as}} statistical analysis of PFM data, ex situ/in situ PFM observation under electrical/mechanical loading and combining PFM with electron backscatter diffraction are employed to study domain evolution processes in complex <b>domain</b> <b>patterns.</b> The results show that domain switching almost always takes place by the evolution of pre-existing <b>domain</b> <b>patterns,</b> rather than direct flipping of polarization. Also the net effect of domain evolution processes follows a primary principle that positive work is done by external loads. But this principle is not always followed for microscopic switching processes. Multiple types of domain switching occur simultaneously, and occasionally an overwriting process involves unfavourable as well as favourable domain switching. Domain switching is significantly constrained by the pre-existing <b>domain</b> <b>patterns.</b> Meanwhile, angle-resolved PFM is developed for the systematic interpretation of PFM signal. Using lateral PFM images taken from multiple sample orientations, angle-resolved PFM maps are generated based on the angle of phase reversal in the PFM signal. The resulting maps reliably show complex <b>domain</b> <b>patterns</b> which may not appear in vertical and lateral PFM images. A model of domain evolution is developed using Monte Carlo simulation. Polarization switching by electric field and mechanical stress in the model is shown to take place via the motion of domain walls between pre-existing domains. Typical domain broadening processes are reproduced through this simulation. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|E

To explain magnetic properties of closely-spaced nanowire arrays we have taken into consideration the magnetostatic interaction between adjacent nanowires and their structural defects, like as boundary grains. The investigated magnetic <b>domain</b> <b>pattern</b> of individual bended nanowires confirms rather complicated magnetization reversal mechanism than either coherent rotation of magnetization or its curling.
