While there are always new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a <b>general</b> <b>treatment</b> goal is to have a minimum of 10mm in bone height, and 6mm in width. Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+mm of bone, B=7–9mm, C=4–6mm and D=0–3mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone.|$|E

25|$|Lilian Whiting's {{biography}} (Louise Chandler Moulton, Poet and Friend. Illustrated. Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1910) was {{direct and}} clear in its method, chronological and narrative rather than critical, compiled {{largely from the}} letters of Moulton and from the journal that was kept faithfully from age eight to {{the last days of}} failing health. With due acknowledgment of Moulton's gifts of personal charm and poetic sentiment and refinement, few discriminating readers ascribed to her verses that quality of genius. So it was considered unfortunate that Whiting began her biography with this word, as one of the implied characteristics of her subject. In her <b>general</b> <b>treatment</b> of Moulton's poetry, however, Whiting showed justice and reserve as well as sympathetic appreciation.|$|E
25|$|Conservation and {{restoration}} of ceramic objects {{is a process}} dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from ceramic. Typically this activity of conservation-restoration is undertaken by a conservator-restorer, especially when dealing with object of cultural heritage. Ceramics are created from a production of coatings of inorganic, nonmetallic materials using heating and cooling to create a glaze. Typically the coatings are permanent and sustainable for utilitarian and decorative purposes. The cleaning, handling, storage, and in <b>general</b> <b>treatment</b> of ceramics is consistent with that of glass because they are made of similar oxygen-rich components such as silicates. In conservation ceramics are broken down into three groups: unfired clay, earthenware or terracotta, and stoneware and porcelain.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of people}} who aided the {{development}} of modern orthopedic surgery were Hugh Owen Thomas, a surgeon from Wales, and his nephew, Robert Jones. Thomas became interested in orthopedics and bone-setting {{at a young age}} and, after establishing his own practice, went on to expand the field into <b>general</b> <b>treatment</b> of fracture and other musculoskeletal problems. He advocated enforced rest as the best remedy for fractures and tuberculosis and created the so-called 'Thomas Splint', to stabilize a fractured femur and prevent infection. He is also responsible for numerous other medical innovations that all carry his name: 'Thomas's collar' to treat tuberculosis of the cervical spine, 'Thomas's manoeuvre', an orthopedic investigation for fracture of the hip joint, Thomas test, a method of detecting hip deformity by having the patient lying flat in bed, 'Thomas's wrench' for reducing fractures, as well as an osteoclast to break and reset bones.|$|E
40|$|The {{diabetes}} mellitus is a metabolic disorder, {{characterized by the}} hyperglycemia with deficiency {{in the use of}} carbohydrates, fats and proteins, resultant of the impairment in secretion and/or insulin action. Severely, the type 1 diabetes provokes the compromise of several organs, causing different disorders and until death of patient. In this way, the literature has shown the <b>general</b> <b>treatments</b> for the type 1 diabetes and currently the focus in immunotherapy and/or immunomodulation, to control of this hyperglycemic condition. The use of new therapies is necessary due to the high increase of incidence of this disease around the world. Recent studies showed an increase of 40 % in the cases since 1997. This disease affects different organs, including the glandular tissues, mainly the pancreas. Despite all therapies for diabetes control, the damages occurred remain irreversible. Thus, in addition to <b>general</b> <b>treatments,</b> the use of immunotherapy may open new perspectives for treatment of this disease. Within this aspect, the anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibodies may be effective, mainly by protect and maintain the pancreatic acinar cells. Thus, these treatments based in the immunomodulation can be an option for diabetes control and to reverse the damage caused by this disease...|$|R

25|$|The {{goals of}} care are to {{optimise}} survival and locoregional disease control, and prevent spread to distant {{areas of the}} body (metastasis), while minimising {{short and long term}} morbidity. There is no high quality Level I evidence from prospective clinical trials in HPV+OPC, therefore treatment guidelines must rely on data from treatment of OPC in general and from some retrospective unplanned subsetting of those studies, together with data for head and neck cancer in <b>general.</b> <b>Treatment</b> for OPC has traditionally relied on radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or other systemic treatments, and surgical resection. Depending on stage and other factors treatment may include a combination of modalities. The mainstay has been radiotherapy in most cases. a pooled analysis of published studies suggested comparable disease control between radiation and surgery, but higher complication rates for surgery +/- radiation. Ideally a single modality approach is preferred, since triple modality is associated with much more toxicity, and a multidisciplinary team in a large centre with high patient volumes is recommended.|$|E

500|$|Freedom Ring was a {{character}} depicted as gay from his debut by his creator Robert Kirkman. Joe Quesada touted him as Marvel Comics' leading gay hero, with stories dedicated to his adventures in Marvel Team-Up. Despite this, the character was killed one month later. His death and <b>general</b> <b>treatment</b> {{was met with}} some negative reactions, including accusations of homophobia, {{particularly with respect to}} the phallic imagery of the death, with the character being killed by being impaled with spikes. Kirkman commented on the controversy, stating [...] "Freedom Ring was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die. I wanted to comment on the fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it... and that's not how life works. During working on the book, I was also noticing that most gay characters... are all about being gay. Straight characters are well-rounded characters who like chicks. So I wanted to do a well-rounded character who just happened to like dudes. Then I decided to combine the two ideas. In hindsight, yeah, killing a gay character is no good when there are so few of them... but I really had only the best of intentions in mind." [...] Kirkman later stated, [...] "Frankly, with the SMALL amount of gay characters in comics in general, and how unfortunate the portrayals have been thus far, whether intentional or not—I completely understand the backlash on the death of Freedom Ring, regardless of my intentions. If I had it to do all over again... I wouldn't kill him. I regret it more and more as time goes on. I got rid of what? 20% of the gay characters at Marvel by killing off this ONE character. I just never took that stuff into consideration while I was writing." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} distinction {{exists between the}} many uses of linguistic profiling {{and the potential for}} discriminatory treatment. The power to determine origin or racial identity based on speech can be utilized without overt discrimination, as argued in several court cases where voice was used in the prosecution of a suspect. The negative effects of linguistic profiling are seen in the practice of denying housing or employment based on stereotypes associated with dialect and/or accent. Further negative practices are associated with education and <b>general</b> <b>treatment</b> of individuals speaking stigmatized dialects. A more positive view of the practice is found in Baugh's description of expressions of ethnic pride. [...] Though average people {{have been shown to be}} well equipped in measuring social characteristics by means of speech, the failings of those unfamiliar with a speech community and the capability of manipulation of speech should be taken into account when determining the unbiased use of linguistic profiling.|$|E
