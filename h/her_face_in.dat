5|$|Stone's tears first {{roll down}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> micro-gravity, and are later seen {{floating}} off her face. After being pushed from her eye by her eyelid, the surface tension {{is not sufficient}} for the tears to continue adhering to her jawline. However, the movie correctly portrays the spherical nature of drops of liquid in a micro-gravity environment.|$|E
5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as she checks the {{rear-view}} mirror, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The opera was {{frequently}} revised, most particularly in 1717 and in 1731; modern performances are usually a conflation of the versions available. Up {{to and including}} 1717, these changes had no {{significant effect on the}} plot. In the 1731 version, however, in Act 2 Armida imitates Almirena's voice rather than assuming her appearance, and Argante declares his love to Almirena's portrait rather than to <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> Act 3 the marches and the battle scene are cut; Armida and Argante remain unrepentant and vanish in a chariot drawn by dragons before the conclusion.|$|E

Further posts on Twitter allude to the storyline running up {{to the start of the}} series, such as Naz buying the fake ID from Fatboy. Naz also appears in extra video content on the E20 website. In one video, she attempts to take a photo of herself to use on her fake ID. In another, Stevie and Naz have a picnic in the park, and Naz makes a video of Stevie, hoping to make Olly jealous, but Stevie ends up with cake on <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> another video, the four friends play a drinking game in the café. Another scene features Stevie and Naz talking about kissing, and another features a nightmare scenario of her and Ekin getting married in a Laz Vegas wedding chapel.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Genevieve {{arrives in}} Genoa City with her presumed dead son, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), who is posing as his {{actually}} dead twin brother, Caleb. Genevieve {{and her son}} are working against Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers), her husband and Cane's father, who she believes murdered her daughter by Colin, Samantha. Genevieve later lures Colin to her home where she set up a shrine for Samantha and tries to push him off a balcony because he was abducting their grandchildren, Charlie and Mattie Ashby. Colin is saved from his fall by his wife, Jill Abbott Fenmore (Jess Walton), and at the hospital it is revealed that Colin and Genevieve are still legally married, invalidating his marriage to Jill. Genevieve attempts to bond with Charlie and Mattie, however, Cane's wife Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) is against that as she believes her mother-in-law is dangerous. Colin is put in prison, and his marriage to Genevieve legally ends thereafter. Genevieve then starts flirting with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), leading to a relationship, and Jack also hires her at Jabot Cosmetics. Later, Colin locks Genevieve in the wine cellar at her home, planning an explosion that would kill her and Gloria Bardwell (Judith Chapman). The explosion goes awry when Lily and Genevieve’s unseen housekeeper, Myrna Murdock, ends up as the explosion’s victim. Colin is arrested and deported back to Australia. Myrna is revealed to be Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk), Jack's ex-wife who is still obsessed with him. She (Myrna/Patty) claims she is shy following the explosion and refuses to show <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> public. Soon after, Jack proposes to Genevieve and she accepts, enraging Patty.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet {{over her shoulder and}} messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|Early {{recordings}} {{were made}} entirely acoustically, the sound being collected by a horn and piped to a diaphragm, which vibrated the cutting stylus. Sensitivity and frequency range were poor, and frequency response was very irregular, giving acoustic recordings an instantly recognizable tonal quality. A singer practically {{had to put}} his or <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the recording horn. Lower-pitched orchestral instruments such as cellos and double basses were often doubled (or replaced) by louder instruments, such as tubas. Standard violins in orchestral ensembles were commonly replaced by Stroh violins, which became popular with recording studios.|$|E
25|$|As {{an evening}} job, Charlotte starts {{working as a}} new carer for Ambrose's bed-ridden father, Arthur. Most of the {{previous}} minders have quit, and the reason soon becomes obvious: Arthur is ungrateful and rude, constantly shouting hurtful abuse at his minders, belittling their efforts to help him. Charlotte is no exception, and when she makes Arthur soup, she is rewarded by him throwing it in <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> spite of this, Charlotte tries her best, drawing strength from her belief that to give in is giving in to the Devil.|$|E

One day, the library manager Misuzu gives Tomoki a diary, telling him that the book chose him. A cute girl introducing herself as Yua—who is the goddess of happiness—comes bursting out of the book, and informs Tomoki that all his happiest memories will be recorded in his diary. The story mostly revolves around Tomoki interacting with the four heroines (in later versions, seven) and eventually forming a romantic relationship with one.|$|E

Lynch helped Banks fend off Naomi and Tamina leading to a temporary and uneasy alliance between the two. Also that same night Charlotte lost a non-title match to Brie Bella by roll-up. This led to a title match between the two for the Divas Championship scheduled for Fastlane, which Charlotte won.|$|E
25|$|This {{season of}} Big Brother Australia {{proved to be}} highly controversial. Big Brother – Adults Only ended its run early after {{politicians}} warned Network Ten that its screening of the show could harm its push for media reforms. An alleged sexual assault during which John (real name Michael Bric) held down Camilla Severi on her bed while Ashley (Michael Cox) pushed his crotch into <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the house on 1 July 2006 resulted in the ejection of the pair from the show. The incident sparked calls for the series to be investigated for possible breaches of broadcasting laws, and calls for the cancellation of the series by several commentators and politicians, including then Australian Prime Minister John Howard and opposition leader Kim Beazley. The incident {{and in particular the}} Prime Minister's comments, were reported internationally, running on CNN and the BBC and in various other international publications.|$|E

25|$|Genie's father fed Genie {{as little}} as {{possible}} and refused to give her solid food, feeding her only baby food, cereal, Pablum, an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Her father, or when coerced her brother, spooned food into her mouth as quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough the person feeding her rubbed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> her food. These were normally the only times he allowed his wife to be with Genie, although she could not feed Genie herself. Genie's mother claimed her husband always fed Genie three times a day but also said that Genie sometimes risked a beating by making noise when hungry, leading researchers to believe he often refused to feed her. In early 1972 Genie's mother told researchers that at night, when possible, at around 11 PM she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food, causing Genie to develop an abnormal sleep pattern in which she slept from 7 to 11 PM, woke up for a few minutes, and fell back asleep for an additional 6 hours. This pattern continued for several months after removal from captivity.|$|E

So even at her worst, she had some of that sexiness throughout".|$|E
