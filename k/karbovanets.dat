50|$|In 1991, {{notes were}} {{introduced}} in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 <b>karbovanets</b> (also called kupons or coupons). All 1991 banknotes were of the same design, picturing Lybid from the monument {{of the founders of}} Kyiv on the obverse, and the Sophia Cathedral on reverse. The banknotes did not carry individual serial numbers or signatures. In 1992, banknotes for 100, 200, 500, 1,000 <b>karbovanets</b> were issued, which carried serial numbers and were better protected to counterfeiting.|$|E
50|$|On September 20, 1918, the Central Rada {{proclaimed the}} issue of bank-notes of the State Treasure in {{denominations}} of 5, 10, 25, and 50 <b>karbovanets,</b> to be valid until March 1, 1924. On April 6, the population of Kiev first saw 25-karbovanets bank-notes, and 50 <b>karbovanets</b> bank-notes later appeared, but 5- and 10-karbovanets bank-notes were not released. Primarily this series of bank-notes was issued without designation of series and number. In subsequent issues, the series indicated the place of printing: AK (Kiev) and AO (Odessa).|$|E
50|$|Originally the Metro ride cost 0.5 Soviet rubles (50 kopecks), however, in 1961, {{following}} Soviet denomination, and for {{the next}} 30 years, the ride was fixed at 0.05 rubles (5 kopecks). Since 1991, as Ukraine suffered from hyperinflation, the price gradually rose to 20,000 <b>karbovanets,</b> by 1996. Following the 1996 denomination 20,000 <b>karbovanets</b> became 0.2 hryvnias (30 kopiyok), although <b>karbovanets</b> sum was still payable up to 16 September that year. Since then the price rose to half a hryvnia in 2000 and to 2 hryvnia in 2008. In November 2008, when the price was increased to 2 hryvnia, public protests took place and the Antitrust Committee of Ukraine ordered to decrease the price to 1.70 hryvnia. In September 2010 the price was increased back to 2 hryvnia. In February 2015, the price was further increased. The last increase of prices (for the moment being) was done on 15 July 2017.|$|E
50|$|In 1917, the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic {{introduced}} 100 karbovantsiv notes. These {{were followed}} in 1918 by State Treasury notes for 25 and 50 karbovantsiv. That year {{also saw the}} issue of postage stamp currency denominated in shah and various bonds, together with state credit notes in denominations of 2, 10, 100, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 hryven. The Directorate issued notes for 100, 250 and 100 <b>karbovanets</b> in 1918, followed by 10 and 25 <b>karbovanets</b> in 1919. State notes for 5, 50 and 1,000 hryven were issued in 1920.|$|E
50|$|First, in August 1919, {{banknotes}} {{were printed}} with {{the value of}} 100, 250, and 1000 <b>karbovanets.</b> For printing of these bank-notes, they used clichés (slugs of type) that had been prepared by the Hetman's government.|$|E
50|$|After {{occupation}} of Odessa by military units of Denikin's Army in spring, 1919, the printing house of Odessa continued printing bank-notes of 50 <b>karbovanets.</b> The Ukrainian Government was indignant and proclaimed money {{issued by the}} Denikinists to be false (series AO, numbers 210 and above).|$|E
50|$|One of {{the best}} bank-notes among all Ukrainian paper-money is a bank-note of 1000 <b>karbovanets.</b> This bank-note was issued in Kyiv and entered {{circulation}} on November 13, 1918. Printing was continued by the Directorate government in October 1919 at Kamyanets'-Podilsk, and in 1920 at Warsaw. The last issue is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|And by just December 19 of {{the same}} year, a {{temporary}} law {{about the issue of}} state banknotes by the UPR was adopted. According to this law: [...] "Bank-notes must be issued in karbovanets" [...] (Карбованець). Each <b>karbovanets</b> contains 17.424 parts of pure gold and is divided into two hrivnas Гривня or 200 shahs (Шаг).|$|E
50|$|In November 1990, {{with the}} {{collapse}} of the Soviet planned economy, the Ukrainian SSR introduced one-time coupons, which were distributed to Ukrainian residents. The coupons were needed in addition to rubles in order to buy groceries and living essentials. On January 10, 1992, the <b>karbovanets</b> replaced rubles at par, with the ISO 4217 code being UAK.|$|E
50|$|One more bank-note of 50 <b>karbovanets</b> with Soviet symbolics was printed. On June 1, 1919, the Ukraine {{united with}} the Soviet governments of Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Belarus {{in a common}} revolutionary front, and only one {{monetary}} unit was legitimized - the ruble of the USSR. The necessity of printing separate bank-notes was gone, and the 50-karbovanets bank-note is known only by some specimen copies.|$|E
50|$|The People's Commissar of Finance of the USSR, {{with the}} mutual {{consent of the}} RSFSR government, {{decided to use the}} 10 <b>karbovanets</b> bank-notes of the Directorate. This note's cliché and artwork (without series and numbers) were {{captured}} by the Red Army on February 5, 1919. during the takeover of Kyiv from the Petlyurian troops. The Soviet bank-note differed from the Directorate's in paper, ink, water-marks, and the location of their series and numbers.|$|E
5000|$|Banknotes were {{introduced}} in June 1942 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 <b>karbovanets.</b> The banknotes were in dark colour, carrying nearly all inscriptions in German, and a warning in both German and Ukrainian stating [...] "falsification of banknotes is punished by imprisoning". The obverse of the notes all featured a portrait, including children, a peasant, a miner, a seaman and a chemist. The Nazi Reichsadler also appeared.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet ruble us used until 1992 in Russia (replaced by Russian ruble), Ukraine (replaced by Ukrainian <b>karbovanets),</b> Estonia (replaced by Estonian kroon), Latvia (replaced by Latvian rublis), Lithuania (replaced by Lithuanian talonas), {{and until}} 1993 in Belarus (replaced by Belarusian ruble), Georgia (replaced by Georgian lari), Armenia (replaced by Armenian dram), Kazakhstan (replaced by Kazakhstani tenge), Kyrgyzstan (replaced by Kyrgyzstani som), Moldova (replaced by Moldovan cupon), Turkmenistan (replaced by Turkmenistan manat), Uzbekistan (replaced by Uzbekistani so'm), and until 1994 in Azerbaijan (replaced by Azerbaijani manat) and until 1995 in Tajikistan (replaced by Tajikistani ruble).|$|E
5000|$|On January 5, 1918 {{the first}} Ukrainian bank-note with {{a value of}} 100 <b>karbovanets</b> was issued. There is an {{interesting}} detail: the trident depicted on the bank-note was proclaimed as a National Emblem of the UPR only 54 days after its appearing on the bank-note, on March 1, 1918. On all issued bank-notes was stated only one series - [...] "AД" [...] and only one number - 185. Combined {{with the use of}} ordinary paper (without water-marks) for printing of this bank-note, this led to the appearance of a great number of counterfeit bank-notes in circulation.|$|E
50|$|On 24 August 1991 Ukraine {{established}} {{its independence}} from the Soviet Union. Its economy suffered huge output declines and soaring inflation the following years. Ukraine also saw hyperinflation in the early 1990s {{because of a lack}} of access to financial markets and massive monetary expansion to finance government spending while there was a sharply declining output. Huge output declines and soaring inflation was at the time common to most former Soviet republics; but Ukraine was among the hardest hit by these problems. In response to (this) hyperinflation the National Bank of Ukraine replaced the old currency, the <b>karbovanets,</b> with the hryvnia in September 1996 and pledged to keep it stable in relation to the US dollar. The currency continued to be unstable through the late 1990s, particularly amid the 1998 Russian financial crisis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A cointegration {{analysis}} of the Ukrainian time series, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the mean monthly total wages of individuals, four price time series of basic foods: white bread, flour, semolina and mac-aroni is proposed. The results give rise to existence of linear equilibrium relations for the couples wages-bread, wages-flour, wages-semolina, wages-macaroni. This econometric data analysis means in economic terms that the purchasing power of the total wages for the acquisition of these four basic foods was preserved throughout the hyperinflation decade 1992 : 11 - 2001 : 10. Key-Words: wages, consumer price index, prices of basic food, cointegration 1 A decade of hyperinflation In the decade 1992 - 2001 the Ukrainian economy in transition was severely touched by periods of hyper-inflation and inflation. The evolution of the prices of primary goods was dramatic. A monthly Ukrainian Consumer Price Index (CPI) of 1992, measuring the general price level of consumer goods and services, has to be multiplied {{by a factor of}} about 5 ’ 000 to at-tain the Ukrainian CPI of the same month nine years later. The households and individuals had perma-nently to worry about the development of their own monthly wages, in relation {{to the development of the}} prices of the goods, necessary for the life of every day. One must not be misled by the relative stability of the Ukrainian Hryvna (UAH) 1 of the last three years. The overwhelming majority of Ukrainian citizens has lower incomes than the subsistence minimum and one can observe negative dynamics. If in 1990 the mean monthly wages (240 UAH at constant prices of 2002) was four times greater than the subsistence minimum, in September 2002 this value (391. 14 UAH) consti-tuted only 107. 2 % of the subsistence minimum [19]. Moreover, the index of wages share in GDP also con- 1 Since January 1997, the Hryvna is the actual currency of Ukraine that has replaced the earlier <b>Karbovanets.</b> firms negative tendency. Indeed, in Ukraine 2 the index of wages share fell from 53. 1 % of GDP in 1990 t...|$|E
40|$|Y. Antoniyk. ‘INSURGENT DENTISTS’: TEETH MEDICAL TREATMENT IN OUN AND UIA UNDERGROUND. The article {{analyses}} dentistry {{development in}} the underground of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. It is proved that personal hygiene maintenance had a significant role for them. In particular, the teeth care {{as one of its}} parts. It is established that the underground organizations strived by all means to provide themselves with toothbrushes and toothpowder. The above mentioned measures and also the youth of insurgents to some extend alleviated their dental problems. Nevertheless, in case the dental diseases or mouth cavity infections appeared the problem rose particularly acute. They attempted to cure the inflammation by herbal decoctions and to grow the toothache calm by dental drops. The underground got most part of medicine legally owing to their sympathisers. The other part they tried to produce by themselves at the insurgent workshops. Despite that, there was constant lack of medicine. It was even more difficult issue for insurgents to see a doctor. Considering the necessity of strict conspiracy they had to stomach excruciating pain {{for a long time and}} expect for golden opportunity of the medical cure. Therefore, starting from the summer of 1943 the military dentists began to function at ‘The Medical Service’ of the UIA underground. They constantly moved from one UIA cell to the other. Their task was to conduct a medical check-up of riflemen and also dental care of the underground cells in an accountable territory. The bad teeth were not filled but only extracted at those times. The insurgent dentists were assumed as very valuable specialists for the underground. There was a sorely deficiency of such specialists even with taking into consideration the fact that they were diligently calculated and mobilized. That was a reason why the dentists were recruited from Jewish doctors, who tried to save themselves from Nazis. The dental prosthesis was an exclusive possibility of the underground leaders of the OUN and UIA and their closest companions – assistants, typists, security guards etc. The most frequent material for making tooth crowns and dental prostheses they used Russian golden coins in value of 5 <b>karbovanets.</b> In most cases dental mechanics had any idea that they worked for the underground organization. The mentioned above clients introduced themselves by fictional names in order not to arise any suspects. Only in special cases the dentists, who worked confidentially in their specialty, were involved into the underground activity. At the same time, the underground dentists were used not only for dental cure but also for solving many other tasks. They took part into the maintaining of the connection lines, leading propaganda, medical courses, making some sabotage acts and terrorist attacks. Many of the underground dentists died in the clashes with the enemy or were captured and get considerable terms of imprisonments. Key words: the Ukrainian nationalistic underground, personal hygiene, insurgent dentists, prosthesis. Антонюк Я. Н. «Повстанческие дантисты»: лечение зубов в подполье ОУН и УПА.
