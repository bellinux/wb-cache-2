40|$|This study {{examines}} changes in <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> populations in southern Sri Lanka, based on reports from fishers in three age classes. Significantly higher values for best day's catch and largest specimen ever caught {{were obtained by}} older fishers than younger ones. Values were also significantly higher during early years, providing clear evidence of {{a decrease in the}} resource over time (1951 - 2007). Older fishers reported best catches further inshore and in shallower waters which, on becoming depleted, forced younger generations to fish in less exploited areas further offshore. Heavy harvesting is also evident from the significantly greater number of sites reported by older fishers as being depleted, compared with observations of younger fishers. These findings contrast markedly with catch and catch per effort patterns from statistics for <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> and bullet tuna (combined) in southern Sri Lanka (1994 - 2004). No stock decline is evident, and at least one report in the early 1990 s advocated increasing exploitation rates by 40 % to maximize yields. Although not a primary research objective, fisher observations on <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> populations were also analysed to help evaluate possible effects of the 2004 tsunami. Most fishers reported post-tsunami decline, but mainly from a larger new generation of fishers, rather than extra boats provided by aid money or (direct or indirect) biophysical impacts from the tsunami. Reliance on fishery statistics, especially for mixed species and over a limited period, can be risky and easily mask true stock status. Evidence of harvesting effects on <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> in southern Sri Lanka is evident using questionnaire data over a longer time scale. This study provides another compelling case of the 'shifting baseline syndrome', whereby fishers of different ages have altered perceptions/experiences of their environment. This may be its first reported occurrence in Sri Lanka. Traditional knowledge from this and similar surveys may provide national fishery management with valuable insights and help improve conservation prospects for <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> and other marine resources...|$|R

The perceptions of 500 Sri Lankan fishers about the influence of risk factors on tsunami death toll and house damage are quantified). Mangroves, coral reefs and sand dunes afforded protection against tsunami damage (67 – 94 % of fisher responses), as did housing and roads. Fishers believed rivers/estuaries, concave coastlines and hotels exacerbated impacts. For comparison, multi-variable models for death toll, housing damage, inundation area and distance are built, incorporating both natural and developmental risk factors. Bathymetry is the only factor significantly associated with all indicators of impact. Mangroves and marsh were not a significant factor in final multivariable models. However, in terms of inundation, sand dunes were identified as protective, while bodies of water exacerbated damage. The extent of agreement and variance between modelling results and the opinions of fisher questionnaires is critically examined. Research findings highlight the need for better coastal management. While the role mangroves in tsunami protection remains equivocal, their known role in providing many other ecosystem services suggests that mangroves warrant greater conservation attention in Sri Lanka, in the face of coastal development pressures. Coastal policy and conservation priorities should be influenced by scientific research (e. g. the tsunami model in this thesis) as well as traditional ecological knowledge and opinions from indigenous people. Factors shown to provide tsunami protection often cannot be altered by human intervention (e. g. topography and bathymetry). However, sand dunes could potentially be preserved to reduce future impacts. Tsunamis are rare events and further research should be carried out to determine which risk factors are important for more frequent events (e. g. monsoon). The needs of coastal communities should always remain paramount in considerations of future tsunami and environmental policies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
30|$|More {{stratified}} conditions, {{along with}} acidification {{of the upper}} 300  m layer (Fig.  7), shoaling of the oxycline (Fig.  8) and declining oxygen concentrations will directly contribute to increasing fish kill incidents (Fig.  13) and habitat compression for pelagic fishes over Omani shelf. This habitat compression is likely {{the cause of the}} reduced variability in sardine landings (Fig.  11). Oxygen concentrations below 3.5  ml L− 1 are stressful for many larger tropical pelagic fish (Prince and Goodyear 2006; Stramma et al. 2012). Oxygen and a shoaling oxycline both result in pelagic populations compressed in the upper layer. This increases they susceptibility to trawling and traditional fishing practices. Consequently, artisanal landings of pelagic species in Oman are tightly linked to hydrophysical processes and their changes over the last 50  years. Landings for 13 major groups of large pelagic species (Yellowfin tuna, Longtail tuna, Kawakawa, Stripped bonito, <b>Frigate</b> <b>tuna,</b> Other tuna, Skipjack, Kingfish, Queenfish, Baracuda, Cobia, Sailfish, and Large jacks) displayed positive trends through the past 20  years (Fishery Statistics Book 2012). However, rising landings (markedly driven by increased number of boats) might end soon. A shoaling oxycline (Fig.  8) could reach an ecological threshold of oxygen depletion in the upper 50  m layer, pushing hypoxic waters further onto the Omani shelf in the coming decades. Further shoaling could cause a gradual decline or even a collapse of large pelagic fisheries as many species will move offshore. This is a critical issue as the artisanal fishery, accounting for 96  % of Omani landings, represents the cornerstone of the national industry, directly employing around 40, 000 fishermen (Fishery Statistics Book 2012; Piontkovski et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|During the 2008 - 2011 period, 1548 {{specimens}} of tuna and tuna-like species were tagged by the Spanish Confederation of Responsible Recreational Fishing (CEPRR) with the scientific coordination of the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). Of these, 1031 bluefin tuna were tagged with conventional tags, whereas 10 other {{specimens of}} the same species were tagged with pop-up satellite electronic tags in the Mediterranean. Five pop-up electronic tags remained on the adult specimens up to 110 days. In this period, the specimens stayed in the tagging area except for one of them, which reached Algerian waters in the winter. Similarly, 333 long-finned tuna and up to 184 specimens belonging to other species such as swordfish, little tunny, bonito, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> and spearfish, were also tagged. Eight bluefin tuna were recaptured, including one adult tuna which was found in the same area where it was tagged (Balearic Islands) 1343 days after release. A juvenile tuna tagged in the Mediterranean was recaptured more than two years after release in the Cantabrian Sea. Over the 2008 - 2011 period, the IEO provided a number of training courses on conventional and electronic tagging techniques at the different ports where tournaments and/or tagging and release campaigns were carried out. This promoted participation of the CEPRR in the tagging design of the GBYP-ICCAT Atlantic-wide Research Programme on Bluefin Tuna, as well as strategic and scientific interest. Postprin...|$|R
40|$|The Maldivian pole-and-line tuna fishery {{has been}} in {{existence}} for hundreds of years. The sailing fleet underwent mechanization in the 1970 s. By mid 1980 s the purpose-built second generation vessels that replaced the converted sailing vessels increased the catch by threefold. However, further rapid increase in catch was slow until late 1990 s with third generation fibreglass (FRP) vessels joining the fleet. Catches then doubled from 1996 to 2006. Private sector investments in post-harvest sector are driving the most recent phase of fishery expansion. These include the additional collection and storage facilities, tuna canneries and the rapidly growing fresh tuna export business. Total reported tuna catches at present are 170, 000 mt of which 80 % is skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) followed by yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). Other coastal varieties, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> (Auxis thazard) and kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis) are caught in small quantities, < 5 % at present. Roughly a third of this catch is consumed locally the rest are exported in canned, fresh/chilled, frozen, dried, and other forms. The total export earnings {{in the recent years}} were in excess of US $ 100 million. The increasing fishing power and efficiency CPUE of both skipjack and yellowfin tuna are increasing. Skipjack CPUE has increased almost consistently in the recent years; from about 270 kg day in 1997 to over 600 kg /day during 2006. Yellowfin CPUE has been also being increasing from 50 kg /day i...|$|R
50|$|Since time immemorial, {{the method}} of fishing {{employed}} in the Archipelago has been the pole and line method. The types of fish caught by this method are <b>tuna,</b> skipjack <b>tuna,</b> <b>frigate</b> and mackerel. The main catch is tuna, which {{is used in the}} daily diet of the inhabitants, as well as for export in different forms. The daily catch depends for the most part on the seasons. Although triangular sailed dhoni were used in the past, today fishing dhoanis are mechanized.|$|R
40|$|In Spain, certain {{population-based}} {{studies have}} shown high blood mercury (Hg) levels due to the high consumption of fish. Some studies have stated {{that one of the}} most consumed fish in Spain is canned tuna. Different Spanish organisms consider that it is safe to consume canned tuna as it supposedly has a low mercury content, particularly in so-called light tuna. However, in Spain light tuna is mainly yellowfin and bigeye tuna, while in other countries it is mainly skipjack tuna. This study analyzed 36 cans of the most popular brands in Spain and examined the influence of the type of tuna, packaging medium (olive oil, sunflower seed oil, water or marinade), different brands, prices and expiration dates. Mercury concentrations (mg/kg) were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry and thermal decomposition amalgamation. The medians observed were (mg/kg) : light tuna: 0. 314; IQR: 0. 205 - 0. 594, white tuna: 0. 338; IQR: 0. 276 - 0. 558, skipjack: 0. 311; IQR: 0. 299 - 0. 322, frigate tuna: 0. 219; IQR 0. 182 - 0. 257 and mackerel: 0. 042; IQR 0. 029 -  0. 074. We found statistically significant differences between white tuna, light tuna and mackerel (p = 0. 004); light tuna and mackerel (p = 0. 002) and white tuna and mackerel (p = 0. 006). However, we found no differences between white tuna and light tuna, or among packaging medium, brands, prices or expiration dates. The limit of 0. 500 mg/kg of mercury in canned tuna was exceeded by the following percentages of the cans: 33. 3 % of light tuna, 16. 7 % of white tuna, and 0 % of Skipjack, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> and mackerel. The mercury content of the cans of Spanish light tuna that were analyzed was variable and high. The results of this study indicate that stricter regulation of Hg in canned tuna is necessary. Until then, it is safer to recommend that vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women consume canned mackerel, which has a markedly lower mercury content. </p...|$|R
5000|$|White marlin feed on {{a variety}} of {{schooling}} baitfish, including sardine, herring, and other clupeoids; squid; mackerel; scad; saury; and smaller tuna-like fishes, such as <b>frigate</b> and bullet <b>tuna.</b> Like their close relatives the striped marlin, and sailfish, white marlin will often group together to corral schooling baitfish into a tight group for feeding purposes, a phenomenon commonly referred to as [...] "balling bait". When this occurs, it is common for two or more fish to be raised to the baits or hooked up simultaneously.|$|R
