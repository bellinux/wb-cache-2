5|$|On 1 April, Alexander {{addressed}} the Sénat conservateur. Long docile to Napoleon, under Talleyrand's prodding <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> against him. Alexander told the Sénat that the Allies were fighting against Napoleon, not France, {{and they were}} prepared to offer honorable peace terms if Napoleon were removed from power. The next day, the Sénat passed the Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur ("Emperor's Demise Act"), which declared Napoleon deposed. Napoleon had advanced as far as Fontainebleau when he learned that Paris was lost. When Napoleon proposed the army march on the capital, his senior officers and marshals mutinied. On 4 April, led by Ney, they confronted Napoleon. Napoleon asserted the army would follow him, and Ney replied the army would follow its generals. While the ordinary soldiers and regimental officers wanted to fight on, without any senior officers or marshals any prospective invasion of Paris would have been impossible. Bowing to the inevitable, on 4 April Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son, with Marie Louise as regent. However, the Allies refused to accept this under prodding from Alexander, who feared that Napoleon might find an excuse to retake the throne. Napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later.|$|E

This was despite a plebiscite in which, according to a British colonial commission, {{almost all of the}} territory's ethnic Somalis favored joining the newly formed Somali Republic.|$|E

Richard Aboulafia, Teal Group vice president of analysis, and a long-time critic of the CSeries, indicated that the cancellation of the program and coverage of losses by the Government of Canada were both likely. Bombardier stated that it was fully committed to the CSeries and had the financial resources in place to support the program.|$|E
25|$|As the 20th century began, {{the company}} changed hands again {{and moved into}} {{mainstream}} magazine publishing. P. P.

In 1906, Crowell turned around and sold his interest in the company to Joseph Knapp and George Hazen of New York, who incorporated in New Jersey and kept the name Crowell Publishing Company. Crowell Publishing acquired The American Magazine in 1911. The magazine had muckraking roots but with the decline of muckraking journalism <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> into a general interest magazine.|$|E

25|$|Soon the German Christians in the presbytery {{fell out}} with each other, some siding with Hartig (now {{representing}} the radical Thuringian {{branch of the}} German Christians), others with Horn, blaming each other to use psychological terror and authoritarianism against each other. Horn, preserving some dignity as a pastor, requested the presbytery to reaccept Martha Fränkel (then living in Kochstraße 62), a parishioner of Jewish descent. Geest sided with the somewhat more moderate Horn, but in 1940 the consistory of the March of Brandenburg ecclesiastical province within the old-Prussian Church decided to completely dissolve the presbytery of the united congregation of Jerusalem Church and New Church, for <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> – with all its quarrels – incapacitated to function.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, under {{pressure}} from their World War II allies and {{to the dismay of}} the Somalis, the British returned the Haud (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably 'protected' by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British, French and Italians agreed upon the territorial boundaries of Ethiopia with the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against raids by hostile clans. Britain included the provision that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> over. Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District (NFD) to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic.|$|E
25|$|KRLD-TV {{served as}} the home base for CBS' network {{coverage}} of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, when suspect Lee Harvey Oswald (from an upper-floor window at the Texas School Book Depository) shot his rifle at sniper range at the Presidential motorcade carrying Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> onto Elm Street. Eddie Barker, who was KRLD-TV's news director {{at the time and}} had been with the station since it signed on fourteen years earlier as one of the original members of its news department staff, {{was the first person to}} announce Kennedy's death on television, relaying a message from an official at Parkland Hospital that Kennedy had succumbed from the gunshot wound as doctors conducted emergency surgery. Because of a local press pool arrangement that was put in place that morning to cover Kennedy's speech at the Trade Mart downtown, Barker's scoop appeared live simultaneously on CBS, which had sent correspondent Dan Rather to report from Dealey Plaza, and ABC. Two days later, a KRLD-TV field crew captured footage of Oswald's assassination by nightclub owner Jack Ruby as officers were transferring the former in handcuffs out of the Dallas Police Department's downtown precinct.|$|E

[...] In the early 1960s, Iowa21 was {{straightened}} through Keokuk County near Guernsey and Deep River. [...] This caused {{the eastern end of}} Iowa85 to move east back to the point where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> into an east–west route in the 1930s. [...] The route would remain this way for nearly thirty years. [...] In 1994, the westernmost [...] of Iowa85 was turned over to the City of Montezuma.

500|$|Following the match, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of the format used for the penalty shoot-out, specifically {{the way that the}} game was decided by kicks at goal attempted by players who wouldn't ordinarily kick the ball during a rugby match.

Responding to the violence, the government accused Lenin of high treason and ordered his arrest alongside that of other prominent Bolsheviks, ultimately making 400 arrests and raiding both the mansion and the offices of Pravda. They also made public their knowledge that Lenin had been permitted passage through Germany and thus press claimed {{him to be a}} German agent provocateur. While many others were arrested, Lenin escaped and hid in a series of Petrograd safe houses.|$|E

Gavin Fuller's review for The Daily Telegraph praised the suspense and [...] "the revelation that all the statues were Angels" [...] which he called [...] "genuinely shocking". Though he commented it [...] "took a while to get going", once it did he thought <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> into the [...] "first genuine chiller" [...] of the series.

Six hours later it became the first Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Ophelia in 2011. Subsequently, a concentric eyewall structure indicated an imminent eyewall replacement cycle, with the inner feature [...] "about as small as it can get" [...] according to the NHC. The eyewall replacement cycle briefly disrupted the storm's core, causing Gonzalo to weaken slightly, but upon completion {{on the evening of}} October 15, the system stabilized and resumed intensification.
