Previously, it has been assumed that the water injected into the upper plenum passes through the reactor core to the lower plenum without any heat interaction with the fuel rods during a LOCA. This simplified model neglects the many beneficial and adverse effects that accompany the upper plenum injection. This study is undertaken to examine the following items · heat transfer to the emergency core coolant before reaching the core · flow and heat transfer through the reactor core · reflood heat transfer.

Thus, pressure and wall shear stress acting along the pipe wall need to be analyzed to pin point whether there is any mechanism at work which will induce vibration. The results show large pressure difference was observed between the inner and outer elbows thus prompting high inclination to vibration.

To provide forced circulation of reactor water through the core to overcome the power density limitation of the fuel. b. To provide a variable moderator (coolant) flow through the core to control reactor power without manipulation of the control rods. The Reactor Recirculation System has been sized to provide a total flow capacity equal to the required flow at rated load. The design pressure of the recirculation pumps is 1300 psig, with a design temperature of 575 0 F. The system piping and valves have been designed for a pressure of 1200 psig and a temperature of 570 °F. 5. 4. 1. 2 System Description The system consists of the reactor vessel and five piping loops, as shown in Drawing GE 237 E 798. Each loop comprises one motor driven pump, a motor generator (M-G) set, suction and discharge valves, a bypass valve around each discharge valve, pipe support hangers, piping, and associated system controls and instrumentation. Recirculated coolant enters the lower head of the reactor through vessel nozzles, passes through the diffuser and orifices {{at the bottom of the}} core and flows upward through the core where bulk boiling produces steam. The steam-water mixture enters the moisture separators and then the steam dryers. The water separated from the steam flows downward across the top of the plenum, where it mixes with the incoming feedwater, and enters the downcomer annulus between the shroud and the vessel wall. The coolant flows through the downcomer region, through the outlet nozzles, and into the recirculation pumps suction piping.

It is particularly found in aerodynamic and engineering applications like VTOL aircrafts, the combustion mixing process and other chemical chambers. It {{can also be}} found in some domestic applications like chimney stacks or water <b>discharge</b> <b>piping</b> systems in rivers and seas. The twin jets considered in this work are elliptic as inclined with a 60 A degrees angle and arranged inline with the oncoming crossflow according to a jet spacing of three diameters. They are examined experimentally in a wind tunnel. The corresponding data is tracked by means of the particle image velocimetry technique in order to obtain the different instantaneous and mean dynamic features (different velocity components, vortices, etc.). The same case is numerically reproduced by the resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations by means of the finite volume method together with the Reynolds stress model second order turbulent closure model. A non-uniform mesh system tightened close to the emitting nozzles is also adopted. The comparison of the measured and calculated data gave a satisfying agreement. Further assumptions are adopted later in order to improve the examined configuration: a non-reactive fume is injected within the discharged jets and the jets' temperature is varied with reference to a constant mainstream temperature. Our aim is to evaluate precisely the impact of this temperature difference on the flow field, particularly on the dynamics of the jets in a crossflow. This parameter, namely the temperature difference, proved mainly to accelerate the discharged jet plumes {{in the direction of the}} main flow, which enhanced the mixing, particularly in the longitudinal direction.

The pump suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>piping</b> system {{is a part of}} chemical plant for processing hydrocarbon mixture at 270 ° C. Elevated temperature is one of static loads that influences the boundary conditions of the piping structure thus generating pump nozzle loadings leading to possible pump body deflection. Deflected shape of the pump body results in generation of flow fluctuation, visible and measurable as a pressure pulsation. This kind of fluctutation has been assumed further {{to be one of the}} dynamic loading on piping system structure. The dynamic analysis was performed to quantify the loading effect of pressure pulsation excited in the pump discharge nozzles on the structure of pipelines and the connected pump nozzles. The simulation was based on the numerical analysis of the excitation by acoustic waves propagation in subjected piping system. Measured on–site pressure pulsation at pumps nozzles has been identified and assumed to be the source of the acoustic waves. In the simulation elastic features of the piping structure as well as the fluid, and pressure loses in pipes, taken into account. Final result of the acoustic part of the simulation was spectral characteristics of the acoustic shock forces, defined further as harmonic loads for the dynamic structural analysis. To observe an influence of the acoustic excitation on the piping there was performed structural analysis of the piping system and the combined results of static and dynamic loading influence determined. This part of the analysis has been perfomed by means of FEM computer software Bentley AutoPIPE as well as some use of ANSYS FEM program. Important step in this simulation there was the theoretical modal analysis. This analysis allows to predict possible vibroacoustic resonance in the structural system under specific conditions of the coincidence between acoustic excitation and modals.

40|$|Wet gas {{compression}} {{technology is}} of great value to {{the oil and gas}} industry for boosting of unprocessed well stream and to reduce investment costs related to equipment and personnel. The growing interest in wet gas compression leads to a general request for accurate performance calculation procedures and proper measurement techniques for multiphase flow metering in compressors. An impeller rig for examination of single-phase and multiphase performance and aerodynamic stability is under construction at the test facility at NTNU. The construction of the compressor rig is behind time due to late deliveries of the compressor components and instrumentation. The performance calculations are therefore based upon one compressor test conducted with dry gas at part-load. The thermodynamic equation of state for ambient air is verified to be consistent with the ideal gas law in the compressor pressure and temperature range. The calculated polytropic performance is calculated with ideal gas assumptions and compared to values estimated by PRO/II. By analyzing the results the sensitivity of the calculation procedures is identified and the suitability for the ideal polytropic performance calculations is validated for the actual compressor test and operating range. A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to determine the effect of measurement uncertainties on performance calculations. Due to the low pressures involved for the compressor test, the performance calculation procedures are highly sensitive to uncertainties in the pressure measurements. Uncertainties in the temperature measurements will only slightly influence the polytropic head, but have great influence on the polytropic efficiency. The efficiency and operating range of a compressor are constrained by aerodynamic instabilities. This thesis describes the different flow phenomena associated with compressor instability and presents recommendations for suitable instrumentation and measuring techniques. Various visualization techniques are in addition evaluated to determine the suitability for multiphase compressors. Dynamic pressure transducers installed in the inlet and <b>discharge</b> <b>piping</b> are recommended for detection of pressure pulsation throughout the compressor system. Unsteady internal pressure measurements can be obtained from circumferentially distributed pressure transducers at various locations within the compressor components. Vibration probes installed at each end of the rotor are recommended for the vibration measurements.

Laser measurement techniques are recommended for the flow visualization in order to obtain information on the main features of the multiphase flow field. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note is {{a collection}} of pipe pressure testing documents for various sections of piping for the D-Zero cryogenic and gas systems. High pressure piping must conform with FESHM chapter 5031. 1. Piping lines with ratings greater than 150 psig have a pressure test done before the line is put into service. These tests require the use of pressure testing permits. It is my intent that all pressure piping over which my group has responsibility conforms to the chapter. This includes the liquid argon and liquid helium and liquid nitrogen cryogenic systems. It also includes the high pressure air system, and the high pressure gas piping of the WAMUS and MDT gas systems. This is not an all inclusive compilation of test documentation. Some piping tests have their own engineering note. Other piping section test permits are included in separate safety review documents. So if it isn't here, that doesn't mean that it wasn't tested. D-Zero has a back up air supply system to add reliability to air compressor systems. The system includes high pressure piping which requires a review per FESHM 5031. 1. The core system consists of a pressurized tube trailer, supply piping into the building and a pressure reducing regulator tied into the air compressor system <b>discharge</b> <b>piping.</b> Air flows from the trailer if the air compressor discharge pressure drops below the regulator setting. The tube trailer is periodically pumped back up to approximately 2000 psig. A high pressure compressor housed in one of the exterior buildings is used for that purpose. The system was previously documented, tested and reviewed for Run I, except for the recent addition of piping to and from the high pressure compressor.

40|$|TutorialTutorial 10 A: Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are subject}} to transient events, such as emergency shutdowns, which can cause energetic surge events during rapid shutdown transients. Many modeling tools are used to predict the behavior of compressor systems during fast transient events. Even more, centrifugal compressor dynamic modeling is a valuable assessment tool that can help improve {{the design of the}} compressor anti-surge system to prevent harsh conditions while the unit is coasting down. Modeling of centrifugal compressor transient events requires a detailed evaluation of many system variables to obtain accurate results. Additionally, many parameters should be included and analyzed to adjust the model and obtain acceptable predictions. Those parameters can include recycle valve characteristics, the controller and actuator, suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>piping</b> volumes, aftercoolers, and operating conditions. Other parameters, such as machine coast down speed and inertia and different control response times will determine if the compressor will reach its surge limit at a detrimental high head condition, avoid it or go through it at low acceptable energy conditions. Many designs use general guidelines to select and plan the compressor anti-surge system and its main components. For example, the recycle valve type, size and actuation time are key parameters during the shutdown of the compressor unit since they directly affect the amount of flow through the compressor and its reaction time. Other factors are also relevant and should be assessed in detail to assure a proper design to avoid such transient events as a sudden shutdown of a compressor from a full load or high head operating conditions resulting in damaging surge events. In order to refine the simulation approach of the transients in centrifugal compressors, an extensive assessment has been conducted of the main parameters that will affect the modeling predictions. Parameters such as recycle valve size, type, actuation time, after-cooler volume, friction factors, unit speed coast down predictions, compressor map, isolation valve control, acting time, as well as placement of the discharge check valve influence the modeling predictions considerably. Therefore, parametric studies of some of those variables have helped to refine and adjust the modeling technique while improving the accuracy of the results. Moreover, computational predictions have been compared against high fidelity ? high accuracy data collected in a full scale compressor system. Initial comparisons indicated reasonable results while adjustments in the technique and main assumptions improved the modeling predictions considerably. A generic methodology to improve modeling predictions and main considerations are part of the analysis. In addition, a comparison of the modeling results and experimental data are presented and complemented with parametric studies of different variables. In general, this work should provide guidelines for advancing the modeling of centrifugal compressor transients as well as showing the application of a valuable tool for designing surge control systems for centrifugal compressors...|$|E
40|$|Refining 155, 000 {{barrels of}} crude oil daily, a Louisiana plant markets oil {{products}} to gas stations in at least 26 states, including Washington, D. C. The plant uses 8, 538 steam traps with 1, 200 -, 600 -, 250 -, 75 -, 40 - and 15 -psi nominal pressures. Standardized with inverted bucket steam traps, the Louisiana refinery?s maintenance and energy coordinator was content with the results. The Spirax Sarco Inc (SSI) team demonstrated SSI?s Energy Service Group (ESG) capabilities and successes to the refinery manager, operations manager and production manager. From 2004 through 2006, the team presented a series of ESG seminars at the refinery site. The numerous models demonstrated quantitative savings with 3 - to 12 -mo paybacks. For a complete SSI turnkey program, for example, the SSI team presented an ROI with {{less than six months}} payback. The ESG survey found that only 3, 952 (46. 3 %) of the steam traps were operating correctly. The remaining steam traps experienced a variety of failures, including: 613 (7. 2 %) that failed open; 2, 763 (32. 4 %) were cold; 1, 012 (11. 9 %) that failed closed; 6 (0. 0 %) exhibited rapid cycling; and 192 (2. 2 %) were disconnected. The team also found performance and temperature issues with the HP sulfur reactors in the SRU units, largely due to the application of inverted bucket steam traps. Plus, as a result of excessive steam leaks, the sulfur reactors were creating a safety hazard. When these results were presented, management agreed that the sulfur reactors needed process improvement. The SSI team recommended replacing the inverted bucket steam traps with 1 - 1 / 2 -in. strainers and 1 - 1 / 2 -in. flanged float & thermostatic steam traps. They also suggested that the existing trap <b>discharge</b> <b>piping</b> should be removed and re-piped with globe-style bypass valves and gate-style isolation valves to reduce flow velocity. Once the SSI team began negotiations, it only took one survey for the Louisiana refinery to realize all the energy savings opportunities. In fact, the ESG survey uncovered more than $ 1. 3 million in steam losses through failed steam traps and another $ 1 million in steam leak opportunities and production, process, safety and environmental improvements. Impressed with the survey results, the refinery approved the estimated $ 110, 000 turnkey project, which offered a 5. 3 -month payback. Further negotiations netted the team annual steam trap surveys for the next three years, as well as an approved 2008 energy budget of $ 600, 000. Additionally, the Louisiana refinery has indicated that upon successful completion of the ESG program, SSI?s annual energy budget will increase to $ 1, 000, 000. ...|$|E
