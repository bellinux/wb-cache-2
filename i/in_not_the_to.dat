25|$|Kant’s second {{proposition}} {{states that}} “an action from duty has its moral worth <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> purpose <b>to</b> be attained by it {{but in the}} maxim in accordance with which it is decided upon, and therefore does <b>not</b> depend upon <b>the</b> realization of {{the object of the}} action but merely upon the principle of volition in accordance with which the action is done without regard for any object of the faculty of desire” (4:400). A maxim of an action is its principle of volition. By this, Kant means that the moral worth of an act depends not on its consequences, intended or real, but on the principle acted upon.|$|R

25|$|Joseph Stalin, then chief {{political}} commissar of the Southwest Front, was engaged at Lwów, about 200miles from Warsaw.

50|$|According to some Protestant sources, {{the figure}} of St. John Nepomuk is a legend due to Jesuits and that its {{historical}} kernel is really Jan Hus, who was metamorphosed from a Bohemian Reformer into a Roman Catholic saint: the Nepomuk story {{would be based on}} Wenceslaus Hajek's blending of the Jan who was drowned in 1393 and the Jan who was burned in 1415. The resemblances are certainly striking, extending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> manner of celebrating their commemorations. But when <b>the</b> Jesuits came <b>to</b> Prague, <b>the</b> Nepomuk veneration had long been widespread; and the idea of canonization originated <b>in</b> opposition <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hussites, but <b>to</b> Protestantism, as a weapon of the Counter-Reformation.

40|$|What is the {{capacity}} of ICT <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> (geographical and technological) localization of knowledge? In this paper, we analyze the impact of Internet adoption within US firms on knowledge spillovers. More specifically, we investigate the impact of basic Internet access on the likelihood that patents invented at a given R&D establishment cite patents invented elsewhere within the same firm. Our findings suggest that adoption of Internet significantly fosters cross-location citations in a significant way, and that these effects are proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> technologically proximity of the establishments. This positive effect holds even when excluding collaborative patents or controlling for earlier collaborations, and suggests that Internet adoption has helped in reducing the spatial localization of knowledge but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> draw from new knowledge sources (i. e. across different technological areas). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
