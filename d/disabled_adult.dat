25|$|Neglect is {{a passive}} form of abuse {{in which a}} {{caregiver}} responsible for providing care for a victim (a child, a physically or mentally <b>disabled</b> <b>adult,</b> an animal, a plant, or an inanimate object) fails to provide adequate care for the victim's needs, {{to the detriment of}} the victim. It is typically seen as a form of laziness or apathy on the form of the caregiver, rather than ignorance due to inability; accordingly, neglect of a child by and adult with mental disorders or who is overworked is not considered abuse, although this may constitute child neglect nonetheless.|$|E

[...] In 1995 Lisa McPherson died of a pulmonary embolism, weeks after leaving the hospital against medical advice with a group of Scientologists, while under the care of the Flag Service Organization (FSO), a branch of the Church of Scientology. Following her death the Church of Scientology was indicted on two felony charges [...] "abuse and/or neglect of a <b>disabled</b> <b>adult</b> and practicing medicine without a license", putting under trial the nature of Scientology beliefs and practices. [...] According to Slaughter's own court testimony, McPherson officially listed Slaughter as [...] "next of kin" [...] on her medical record, and Slaughter was the only person Lisa identified to be contacted in case of an emergency.|$|E

It was found that the incidence of employment did not vary significantly across services. Additionally, the incidence of employment subsequent to provision of services did not vary significantly from that of vocational rehabilitation clients who were not learning disabled. The results suggested that vocational rehabilitation services had a positive effect on the employability of the learning <b>disabled</b> <b>adults.</b> Demographic, input, and outcome data was included in the appendices...|$|R

40|$|The {{personalisation}} {{of adult}} social care {{has the potential}} to create support that is individualised, and it is the reality of this support relationship that forms the basis of this article. To date, there have been few studies that focus on the association between care users and their workers. Here, we consider research from a Ph. D. study that allows for comparison between two sets of relationships: between <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> and homecare workers employed by a local authority, and between <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> using direct payments to employ their own personal assistants. The research pays attention to the meanings attached to the concepts of independence and autonomy, with a model of autonomy applied to aid clarity and develop our understanding of complexities in support relationships. The research uses a grounded theory approach with qualitative interviews of matched samples of respondents, providing new evidence about the personalised relationship. Based on the research, we argue that direct employment of support workers appears to facilitate greater autonomy for <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> than traditional homecare relationships. However, the research goes on to suggest that greater autonomy for <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> may have a downside for support workers...|$|R

40|$|Developments {{in recent}} years have shown an {{increasing}} interest in the educational needs and aspirations of <b>disabled</b> <b>adults.</b> There is still, however, limited research information representing the disabled person's voice.

The findings indicated that, usually, the earlier someone had acquired a disability, the less likely they were, as adults, to have achieved professional or higher qualifications, and that the level of qualifications reached among women being surveyed was particularly low. Barriers to course attendance reflect both attitudinal and practical access issues, with underachievement often the result of oppression from a variety of sources. Both positive and negative experiences from <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> form the basis of recommendations for an equal opportunities approach to <b>adult</b> education for <b>disabled</b> people around the themes of integration, self worth, empowerment and consultation...|$|R
