The electricity distribution network is an interconnected system comprising of a manufacturing part producing electricity from various sources, a transmission system of conductors and equipment, distribution systems of high and low voltage, and of technical control stations suitably distributed to control the whole network. Energy security means ensuring continuity of necessary supplies of energy and energy services to accommodate the protected interests of the state. A long-term <b>electric</b> power <b>failure</b> may have serious consequences for the state security, for providing for basic subsistence needs of the population, individual?s health or the state economy. For their maintenance under ordinary as well as emergency conditions it is particularly necessary to ensure functioning of critical infrastructure. The aim of this thesis is to examine the level of preparedness of the subjects within the critical infrastructure for a long-term interruption of {{electric power}} supplies and to create a draft of an emergency preparedness plan of a subject within the critical infrastructure focused on a long-term <b>electric</b> power <b>failure.</b> The research part of the thesis has two parts.

40|$|Abstract: A fault on a {{power system}} is an {{abnormal}} condition that involves an <b>electric</b> <b>failure</b> of power system equipment. Short-circuit faults {{are a major}} problem. Generally, they can occur from an insulation failure or due to a sudden overvoltage caused by lightning impulses or switching devices. The return path of the zero sequence current through the ground is strongly influenced by the nature and {{the resistance of the}} soil. Usually the ground parameters are poorly known as they have a wide range variation with some random phenomena, such as seasonal changes and the amount of water retained. Due to the non uniform distribution of the zero sequence current, the determination of the earth return impedance is difficult. In this paper a summary of various techniques of calculation of the earth return impedance is given. The influence of the return path on an unbalanced one phase to earth fault is shown and explained...|$|E

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} rely on batteries {{that need}} to be frequently recharged. As an alternative to conductive charging, wireless chargers provide a higher reliability to pollution and <b>electric</b> <b>failures</b> and they also extend the situations and places where the recharge could be available without user’s intervention (e. g. parking spaces, on-road). In order to optimize the performance of a wireless charger, its configuration should be dynamically adapted to the varying battery’s electrical features. Towards this goal, controllers are incorporated into the system to modify the behavior of some switching devices belonging to the power electronics blocks. This paper presents a controller that acts in the DC/DC structure placed in the primary side. As a novelty, the controller infers the instantaneous battery power demands by exclusively measuring voltage and current in the primary side. In this way, {{there is no need for}} communicating (via wired or wireless links) the primary and the secondary sides.

It is therefore necessary to develop both models and techniques which can characterize accurately the PD propagation mechanisms in each system and work out the frequency characteristics of the PD pulses at detection point, in order to design proper sensors able to carry out PD measurement on-line with maximum SNR. Analytical models will be devised in order to predict PD propagation in MV apparatuses. Furthermore, simulation tools will be used where complex geometries make analytical models to be unfeasible.

40|$|International audienceThe {{origin and}} the {{consequences}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>failure</b> of in-service composite hollow insulators used in railway transportation were investigated. Direct electrical measurements made it possible the detection of partial discharges (PD) and UV emissions allowed of identifying the location of the PD at the interface between metal braids and a silicone liner. To investigate the effects of the damaging PD activity, physicochemical properties of the different polymers were investigated and compared to new samples. The thermomechanical properties of the HTV and RTV silicones showed important alterations in the polymers structure. The chemical analyses of the silicones and nitrile rubber conducted using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed that the polymers were oxidized after electrical failure. The results indicated that the ozone production and UV emission were due to the surface electrical activities. The breakdown of alumina trihydrate (ATH) in the inner HTV silicone liner demonstrated that undesired electrical discharges induced an significant increase of temperature and the formation of moisture in the air present in the hollow insulator. Laboratory artificial aging performed on the silicones and nitrile rubber showed similar degradation as in service. Further electrical experiments conducted on empty hollow insulators enabled the detection of internal PD located in micro-voids present in the adhesive used to bond the HTV silicone liner to the inner composite tube...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} (LN 2) {{has been}} proposed as a coolant for high temperature superconducting (HTS) applications also as electrical insulation. Partial discharge (PD) activity indicates overstressing of the liquid dielectric or contamination which may provide {{an indication of the}} health of the dielectric and provide a useful precursor to the <b>electric</b> <b>failure</b> of LN 2. The conventional method for PD measurements is restricted to a narrow bandwidth (less than 600 kHz). It has been shown that streamer discharges in liquid dielectrics consist of many small pulses, which due to the limited bandwidth of the PD detector would be integrated overtime by conventional equipment and recorded as single pulse [1]. The application of ultra high frequency (UHF) sensors can provide greater precision in the measurement of the discharge pulses during the pre-breakdown streamer phenomena in LN 2. In addition, the UHF technique can be installed as on-line monitoring system with the capability of locating the discharge sources using the time-of-flight method, as {{has been proposed}} for oil filled transformer designs [8]. This paper explores the use of UHF sensors to measure PD in LN 2. The experiments utilise a point to plane electrode configuration located inside a cryostat with high voltage bushing rated to 50 kV PD free [2].

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Concern about energy security on domestic Department of Defense installations {{has led to}} the possibility of using natural gas-fired electricity generators to provide power in the event of <b>electric</b> grid <b>failures.</b> As natural gas is an increasingly base-load fuel for electricity generation in the United States, the electricity generation system has become increasingly dependent on the operation of the natural gas system. However, as the natural gas system is also partly dependent on electricity for its ability to deliver natural gas from the well-head to the consumer, the question arises of whether, {{in the event of an}} <b>electric</b> grid <b>failure,</b> the natural gas would continue to flow. As the natural gas transmission system largely uses natural gas from the pipelines as a source of power, once the gas has been extracted from the ground, the system is less dependent on the electric grid. However, some of the drilling rigs, processing units, and pipeline compressors do depend on electric power, making the vulnerability to the system to a disruption in the national electricity supply network vary depending on the cause, breadth, and geographic location of the disruption. This is due to the large numbers of players in the natural gas production an...|$|R
