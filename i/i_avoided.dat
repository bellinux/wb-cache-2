500|$|The 1950 playoffs were {{overshadowed by}} an on-ice mishap {{in the opening}} game between Toronto and Detroit, in which the Red Wings' young star player, Gordie Howe, was seriously injured. Late in the game with Toronto leading 4–0, Kennedy stole the puck from Detroit defenseman Jack Stewart and was {{carrying}} it down the left wing about six feet from the boards into the Detroit end of the rink. Stewart was pursuing him from behind and Howe was coming in fast from the side to try to cut him off. Kennedy saw Howe coming at the last moment, {{and was able to}} dodge Howe's check while passing the puck to Sid Smith, but Howe could not stop and crashed head-first into the boards, with Stewart falling on top of him. Howe sustained a concussion, facial fractures, and a lacerated right eyeball, and doctors had to perform emergency procedures on him at the hospital to save his life. Detroit coach Tommy Ivan and general manager Jack Adams accused Kennedy of deliberately butt-ending Howe. Kennedy had not been assessed a penalty on the play. After the game Kennedy said, [...] "I don't know how he got it. <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> his check along the boards and didn't feel anything hit me, although he may have struck my stick." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then I am {{out on the}} moors. <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> the crests {{where the}} bonfires were being piled, and sought the lonely places. [...] .|$|E
60|$|As I made my {{way through}} the grounds I saw Audrey in the distance, walking with the Nugget. <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> them and went on into the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Briefly, then. <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> pine-trees, high houses, lonely barns, upland pastures, running water, {{flocks of}} cattle and sheep, {{a crowd of}} men. If I travel on foot--as to-day--I do not walk fast; if in my buggy, I touch not its back or sides; if on horseback, I {{dismount}} and lead the horse. But of all things, <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> tall men." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Bless the child! why didn't {{she come}} and call? I'd have let her in; though usually <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> stage-struck girls as I do reporters,' laughed Miss Cameron.|$|R
60|$|For full {{two days}} thereafter, {{for no reason}} that I could clearly give, <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> her, and save at table and in her husband's {{presence}} we were never once together.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> {{the turn}} by Braster Grange and went {{straight}} on to the village. Coming out of the post office I found myself {{face to face with}} Blanche Moyat. She held out her hand eagerly.|$|E
60|$|Wood. I am {{glad you}} did; for {{you could not}} but observe, with how much care <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> all {{occasions}} of railing at you; to which she urged me, like a malicious woman, as she was.|$|E
6000|$|MERTOUN. 'Twixt {{him and me}} and Mildred, Heaven be judge! [...] Can <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> this? Have your will, my lord! [...] [He draws and, after a few passes, falls.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are bold, Catharine," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "but neither as a knight nor {{a man can}} <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> {{accepting}} a defiance. I must teach you the risk of such challenges." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> {{my uncle}} with success, and I see 'er about {{the hour of}} dejeuner. She is talking to old gentleman. I have bowed. She have smiled and motioned me to approach.|$|R
60|$|This from Radbourne was {{not only}} comforting; it was relief, hope, assurance. <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> Spears, for it would hardly be {{possible}} for him to regard the Rube favorably, and I kept under cover until time to show up at the grounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I {{will tell}} you. There {{is an old}} {{friendship}} and cousinship between us; {{but we are not}} engaged, nor at all likely to be. I tell you so because, if <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> the question, you would draw the opposite and false conclusion." ...|$|E
60|$|Scaring {{eavesdropping}} boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway {{heard the}} growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus {{off for a}} swill to wash it down. Glad <b>I</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "To be {{laughed at}} by my brethren, Freydisa? Moreover, you are foolish, for if evil is to be, how can <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> it? Either your {{foresight}} is nothing or the evil must come." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{am not a}} good {{interpreter}} of my own music - I never played it and <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> giving lessons with my music on the stand. [...] " [...] - rec.music.classical.guitar (Jan 23 2003) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will forget}} me soon. He will, at any rate, forget his love, {{when he finds}} that <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> his company; but, Henri, if he {{formally}} asks my hand, and is refused, that he will neither forget nor forgive." ...|$|R
60|$|So, in {{the days}} that followed, I scarce knew myself. For a while (I shame to write it) <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> that sweet woman who had made my comfort her care, whose father had taken me when I was homeless. The good in me cried out, but the flesh rebelled.|$|E
60|$|She {{wiped her}} eyes with {{the corner of her}} apron, dropped me a curtsey, and withdrew. Feurgéres came in presently, and <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> looking at him for the first few minutes. To tell the truth, there was a lump in my own throat. When he spoke, however, his tone was as usual.|$|E
60|$|He declined. This lack of {{confidence}} on his part created a coldness between us, and from that time forward <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> him. It was my idea, in case anything happened to me, to so time the occurrence as to throw my custom {{into the hands of}} the opposition coroner on the American side.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{place was}} areek with blood," [...] St. Vincent cried passionately, {{springing}} to his feet. [...] "I {{tell you it}} was areek! How could <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> floundering in it, fighting as I was for life? Can you not take my word--" ...|$|R
60|$|Cleo. Slave, thou deservest it,-- Not that I fear my lord, will <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> him; <b>I</b> {{know him}} noble: when he banished me, And thought me false, he scorned {{to take my}} life; But I'll be justified, and then die with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop a moment, Cora. I do {{not know}} how it may be yet. But this I know, that if without cowardice <b>I</b> could <b>avoid</b> this task, <b>I</b> would {{certainly}} <b>avoid</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{sat down}} on the grass in front of her, feeling as I did so that the change of {{position}} in a manner clipped my wings. It is difficult to speak movingly while sitting on the ground. Instinctively <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> eloquence. Standing up, I might have been pathetic and pleading. Sitting down, I was compelled to be matter-of-fact.|$|E
60|$|Sir John. How happy a man shall I be, if I can but compass this! {{and what}} a precipice have <b>I</b> <b>avoided!</b> then the revenge, too, is so sweet, to steal a wife under her father's nose, and leave 'em in the lurch, who have abused me; well, such a servant as this Warner is a jewel.|$|E
60|$|But {{those words}} of his put {{something}} new into my head. Could we not decide the matter in some better way than fighting? The Bart was placing me in such a position that I should have to hurt him, or he would certainly hurt me. <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> his rush, though his sword-point was {{within an inch of}} my neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "You dined there!" [...] exclaimed St. Barbe. [...] "It is very odd, {{they have}} never asked me. Not that I would have {{accepted}} their invitation. <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> parvenus. They are too fidgety for my taste. I require repose, and only dine with the old nobility." ...|$|R
60|$|These Things, however {{intended}} for Terror, are indeed so ridiculous, that the Devil himself, to be sure, mocks at them, and a Man of Sense can hardly refrain doing the like, only <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> it, because <b>I</b> {{would not give}} offence to weaker Heads.|$|R
6000|$|CLEOPATRA. Slave, thou deservest it.-- [...] Not that I fear my lord, will <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> him; [...] <b>I</b> {{know him}} noble: when he banished me, [...] And thought me false, he scorned {{to take my}} life; [...] But I'll be justified, and then die with him.|$|R
60|$|The thick-set Selenite {{had gone}} some paces unheeded. He {{came back and}} stood {{between us and the}} great machine. <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> seeing him, because I guessed somehow that his idea was to beckon us onward. He walked away in the {{direction}} he wished us to go, and turned and came back, and flicked our faces to attract our attention.|$|E
6000|$|She evinced {{a similar}} {{disposition}} to argufy with me, which <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> [...] by either laughing or yielding. I despise the sex {{too much to}} squabble [...] with them, and I rather wonder you should allow a woman to draw you [...] into a contest, in which, however, I am sure you had the advantage, [...] she abuses you so bitterly.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> {{looking at}} him. I knew well {{enough that he}} would not like this opening. General ideas were not to his taste. He mistrusted them. I lighted a cigarette, not that I wanted to smoke, but to give another moment to the {{consideration}} of the advice--the diplomatic advice I had made up my mind to bowl him over with. And I continued in subdued tones.|$|E
60|$|For six letters (adding h, as <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> tailed letters) <b>I</b> {{substitute}} upright crosses for the oblique partitions, assigning the 4 portions, {{into which}} {{each of the}} 16 Cells is thus divided, to the four Classes eh, eh', e'h, e'h'. We have now got 64 Cells.|$|R
60|$|There {{are several}} {{considerable}} clauses might {{be added to}} this proposal (some of great advantage to the general trade of the kingdom, some to particular trades, {{and more to the}} public), but <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> being too particular in things which are but the product of my own private opinion.|$|R
60|$|STEPHEN: (Swaying) <b>I</b> don't <b>avoid</b> it. He provokes my intelligence.|$|R
