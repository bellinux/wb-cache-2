5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the total failure of the attack, Shlomo Shamir ordered the retreat at 11.30 am. But this {{occurred}} on open ground under a heavy sun and the soldiers had no water. Numerous men were killed or injured by Arab fire. It was only at 2 pm that the first injured men reached the transport they had left in the morning. However, the Arab Legion didn't {{take advantage of this}} victory while, according to Benny Morris, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> have performed a counter-attack up to the Israeli headquarters located at Hulda.|$|E
5|$|Montevideo, {{which had}} a {{historical}} rivalry with Buenos Aires, opposed the Primera Junta and the Council of Regency declared it the new capital of the Viceroyalty, along with Francisco Javier de Elío as the new Viceroy. The city was well defended, so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> resist an invasion. Peripheral cities in the Banda Oriental acted contrary to Montevideo's will and supported the Buenos Aires Junta. José Gervasio Artigas led them, and kept Montevideo under siege.

5|$|In the 19th century, the {{fin whale}} was {{occasionally}} hunted by open-boat whalers, {{but it was}} relatively safe, because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> outrun ships {{of the time and}} often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.|$|E
5|$|The grenade {{had several}} faults with its design. In tests, {{it failed to}} adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and, if the user was not careful after freeing the grenade from its casing, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> stick to his uniform. The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve the grenade {{for use by the}} British Army, but {{personal}} intervention by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, led to the grenade going into production. Between 1940 and 1943, approximately 2.5 million were produced. It was primarily issued to the Home Guard, but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa, accounting for six German tanks; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead, including the First Special Service Force; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign. The French Resistance were also issued a quantity of the grenades.|$|E
5|$|Michael Ryan, {{director}} of The YoungCuts Film Festival, {{noted that there}} was a precedent for the film in the Air Pirates lawsuit, in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an underground comix parody in which Mickey Mouse and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy the rights and release the film itself, which <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> do as its announced interest would guarantee it a monopsony on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, Escape from Tomorrow would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone else and the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke would take some of the satiric edge off.|$|E

25|$|It did {{not matter}} that the vehicle was lightly armoured, because the {{soldiers}} it was expected to meet would be lightly equipped; what was of key importance was that the vehicle would survive the bombardment that was expected to immediately precede a landing. Armadillos were to be kept {{a short distance from}} the airfield, well hidden and protected but always ready to be called into action. Overweight, the Armadillo was unsuitable for travelling over rough or boggy ground.

25|$|Introduced in 1942, {{the grenade}} saw service with the British Army until 1955. The United States Army {{also used the}} grenade, as well as {{developing}} their own variant known as the M7 light anti-tank mine. When used in an anti-tank role, {{a number of the}} grenades could be strung together in a 'daisy chain' at intervals of around two feet, and then placed across a road to damage an armoured vehicle. It was particularly effective at damaging the tracks of a tank. When sufficient grenades were grouped together, they were capable of disabling a medium tank. The Hawkins was also used in other roles, such as breaching walls, and its small size also meant that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be placed into the 'web' of a railway line and, when detonated, destroy a section of track.|$|E
25|$|Joseph's army swiftly overran Andalusia {{during the}} months of January and February 1810. However, they failed to capture Cádiz and that island city {{successfully}} held out against the French from 5 February 1810 until 25 August 1812. Soon after, Emperor Napoleon appointed Marshal Nicolas Soult to control Andalusia. The marshal soon {{found it difficult to}} defend the newly conquered territory against multiple threats. Soult deployed Mortier's V Corps to defend the Portuguese border to the northwest. The IV Corps watched the Murcian frontier to the east. Victor and the I Corps maintained the Siege of Cádiz. Because the British navy had control of the seas, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> transport British and Spanish troops to menace French-held locations on the coast. On 13 October 1810, one of these raids resulted in an embarrassing repulse of the British in the Battle of Fuengirola.|$|E
25|$|The plague disease, {{caused by}} Yersinia pestis, is {{enzootic}} (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda. Nestorian graves dating to 1338–1339 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists {{to mark the}} outbreak of the epidemic, from which <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, the 13th-century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed {{at the beginning of the}} 14thcentury. In the 1330s, a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after. Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25million Chinese and other Asians during the 15years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.|$|E

25|$|Around 650 AD, St Birinus, {{the first}} Bishop of Dorchester (Oxford), sent his missionaries into Wessex. The small {{settlement}} that {{existed at the}} time on the headland now known as Hengistbury Head, proved unsuitable for the purpose of spreading the word of God because it was set back from and out of reach of the traders who used the busy port. Far more useful was a stretch of raised land between the two rivers of the Avon and Stour which carried people and their wares to and from settlements such as Blandford and Old Sarum (Salisbury). The site had other advantages in that it was raised and well drained, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be defended being surrounded on three sides by water, it was close to the lowest crossing points of the two rivers, and there was a plentiful supply of drinking water both from the rivers and a number of wells in the area now known as Purewell.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} this ongoing {{development}} has resulted in greater homeownership for the region. Although the region saw an uptick in jobs over the past decade, {{it is not a}} heavy employment center, and many residents commute to Los Angeles and Orange counties for their work. With a lack of substantial public transportation in the Greater Los Angeles Area, this has led to traffic congestion and degradation in air quality for the Inland Empire. The solution to these problems is not simple. The presence of so many city governments within the Inland Empire, which often have different 'visions' for their own municipalities, means that two cities in the region rarely agree on a solution; just as common, they may have unequal means for implementing one even if they were to agree. Having no regional-wide governmental planning organization may undermine any solution that could be proposed. Lastly, the pace at which development occurs (fast) versus the ability of government to respond to changes (slow) means that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> take years, if not decades, for a viable solution (such as new roads, pollution controls, etc.) to go into effect.|$|E

In 1978, a property at 25 Columbia Heights underwent renovation for use as offices and in the early 1980s properties were bought at 175 Pearl Street and 360 Furman Street for factory and office use. A building at 360 Furman Street was bought in March 1983 and renovated, providing almost 9 hectares of floor space for shipping, carpentry and construction. The Bossert Hotel at 98 Montague Street was also bought in 1983 as a residence building. 97 Columbia Heights, the former site of the Margaret Hotel, was purchased in 1986 as it was ideally located next to WTBTS residences at 107 and 124 Columbia Heights and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> tie in with the main complex {{on the other side of}} the street by means of an under-street tunnel.
