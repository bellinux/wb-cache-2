5|$|As of 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{operates}} the Cole M. Rivers <b>Hatchery</b> {{near the base}} of the dam at Lost Creek Lake, slightly upstream of the former Rogue–Elk <b>Hatchery</b> built by Hume. It raises rainbow trout (steelhead), Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the <b>hatchery</b> in 1973 to offset the loss of fish habitat and spawning grounds in areas blocked by construction of the Lost Creek Dam on the main stem and the Applegate and Elk Creek dams on Rogue tributaries. It is the third-largest salmon and steelhead <b>hatchery</b> in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, in {{connection}} with his commercial fishery, Hume built a <b>hatchery</b> at Ellensburg (Gold Beach), which released fish into the river. In its first year of operation, Hume collected 215,000 salmon eggs and released about 100,000fry. After the first <b>hatchery</b> was destroyed by fire in 1893, Hume built a new <b>hatchery</b> in 1895, and in 1897 he co-operated with the United States Fish Commission in building and operating an egg-collecting station {{at the mouth of}} Elk Creek on the upper Rogue. In 1899, he built a <b>hatchery</b> near Wedderburn, across the river from Gold Beach, and until {{the time of his death}} in 1908 he had salmon eggs shipped to it from the Elk Creek station.|$|E
5|$|Releases of {{conventionally}} reared <b>hatchery</b> steelhead pose ecological {{risks to}} wild steelhead populations. <b>Hatchery</b> steelhead are typically {{larger than the}} wild forms and can displace wild-form juveniles from optimal habitats. Dominance of <b>hatchery</b> steelhead for optimal microhabitats within streams may reduce wild steelhead survival {{as a result of}} reduced foraging opportunity and increased rates of predation.|$|E
50|$|West Virginia began {{stocking}} fish {{in state}} waterways in the 1880s {{and has been}} operating its own fish <b>hatcheries</b> since 1930. Today, the Wildlife Resources Section operates a network of seven trout <b>hatcheries</b> and two warmwater fish <b>hatcheries.</b>|$|R

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that almost all California coastal steelhead are of native origin, despite over a century of <b>hatchery</b> stocking. Genetic {{analysis}} shows that the South Central California Coast DPS and Southern California DPS from Malibu Creek north, and including the San Gabriel River, Santa Ana River and San Mateo Creek, are not <b>hatchery</b> strains. Steelhead from Topanga Creek and the Sweetwater River were partly, and those from San Juan Creek completely, of <b>hatchery</b> origin. Genetic analysis has also shown that the steelhead in the streams of the Santa Clara County and Monterey Bay basins are not of <b>hatchery</b> origin, including the Coyote Creek, Guadalupe River, Pajaro River, Permanente Creek, Stevens Creek, San Francisquito Creek, San Lorenzo River, and San Tomas Aquino Creek basins. Natural waterfalls and two major dams have isolated Russian River steelhead from freshwater rainbow trout forms above the impassable barriers; a 2007 genetic study of fin samples collected from steelhead at 20 different sites both above and below passage barriers in the watershed found that although 30million <b>hatchery</b> trout were stocked in the river from 1911 to 1925, the steelhead remain of native and not <b>hatchery</b> origin.|$|E
5|$|The Butte Falls Fish <b>Hatchery</b> was {{scheduled}} to be closed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in July 2009 as part of a statewide effort to decrease the department's budget, but on July 3 it was announced that the <b>hatchery</b> would continue to operate with only one employee. However, the <b>hatchery</b> was closed permanently in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is limited}} to the lower reaches of the river. <b>Hatchery</b> Chinook salmon and summer and winter steelhead are {{sometimes}} caught near the confluence with the Sandy River, and catch and release fishing for wild trout is allowed {{from the mouth of the}} river to the edge of the Bull Run watershed reserve.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} prawn <b>hatcheries</b> had sprouted up since 1990, but most {{shut down by}} 2000. However, still {{there are a few}} {{profitable}} <b>hatcheries</b> operating here.|$|R
40|$|By {{combining}} {{economic analysis}} of markets with ecological parameters, this article considers {{the role that}} tourism-based sea turtle <b>hatcheries</b> (of an open-cycle type) can play in conserving populations of sea turtles. Background is provided on the nature and development of such <b>hatcheries</b> in Sri Lanka. The modeling facilitates {{the assessment of the}} impacts of turtle <b>hatcheries</b> on the conservation of sea turtles and enables the economic and ecological consequences of tourism, based on such <b>hatcheries,</b> to be better appreciated. The results demonstrate that sea turtle <b>hatcheries</b> serving tourists can make a positive contribution to sea turtle conservation, but that their conservation effectiveness depends on the way they are managed. Possible negative effects are also identified. Economic market models are combined with turtle population survival relationships to predict the conservation impact of turtle <b>hatcheries</b> and their consequence for the total economic value obtained from sea turtle populations...|$|R

5|$|Irrigation {{with water}} from the Merced River {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the San Joaquin, the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, a fish <b>hatchery,</b> the Merced River <b>Hatchery,</b> was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced River dam. Fall chinook salmon travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery's pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River.|$|E

The film received mostly positive reviews from media critics upon release.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} stem of Shamokin Creek is {{designated}} as a Warmwater Fishery, all of its tributaries are designated as Coldwater Fisheries. Some tributaries, such as North Branch Shamokin Creek and Quaker Run, lack fish life. However, several fish species have been observed in Carbon Run and downstream tributaries such as Trout Run, Bennys Run, Millers Run, and Lick Creek have supported healthy communities of aquatic life. Additionally, a small <b>hatchery</b> for fish is maintained {{at the mouth of}} Trout Run by local sportsmen.|$|E
50|$|The US Fish and Wildlife Service {{operates}} fish <b>hatcheries</b> {{throughout the}} United States. These <b>hatcheries</b> {{are a significant}} part of fisheries conservation and restoration efforts by producing and releasing rare, endangered and other fish back into America’s lakes and rivers. Some of these <b>hatcheries</b> also help mitigate the loss of fishing from the large federal dams built in the last century.|$|R
50|$|Greenwater <b>hatcheries</b> are {{medium-sized}} <b>hatcheries</b> using large tanks {{with low}} animal densities. To feed the shrimp larvae, an algal bloom is induced in the tanks. The survival rate is about 40%.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hatcheries</b> breed {{shrimp and}} produce nauplii or even postlarvae, which they sell to farms. Large shrimp farms {{maintain}} their own <b>hatcheries</b> and sell nauplii or postlarvae to smaller {{farms in the}} region.|$|R
5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and the first version was merely {{scrolling}} around a map and entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, <b>Hatchery,</b> Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} {{was introduced}} to the San Joaquin Valley in the late 19th century, and led to the construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow patterns, and the construction of a salmon <b>hatchery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The entire {{drainage}} basin of Scotch Run is {{designated by the}} Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has stocked it with adult trout. The Black Creek Sportsmens Club and the Beaver Township Rod and Gun Club also stock the stream with trout. A 1997 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission discovered a small population of wild brook trout and <b>hatchery</b> brook trout in the stream.|$|E
50|$|Poultry <b>hatcheries</b> {{produce a}} {{majority}} of the birds consumed in the developed world including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and some other minor bird species. A few poultry <b>hatcheries</b> specialize in producing birds for sale to backyard poultry keepers, hobby farmers, and people who are interested in competing with their birds at poultry shows. These <b>hatcheries</b> produce chicks of several different breeds and varieties, often including some heritage or endangered breeds.|$|R
50|$|Carp <b>hatcheries</b> in {{both the}} public and private sectors have contributed towards the {{increase}} in seed production from 6321 million fry in 1985-1986 to over 18500 million fry in 2007. There are 35 freshwater prawn <b>hatcheries</b> in the coastal states producing over 200 million seed per annum. Furthermore, the 237 shrimp <b>hatcheries</b> with a production capacity of approximately 11.425 billion post larvae per year are meeting the seed requirement of the brackish water shrimp farming sector.|$|R
50|$|There are {{debates over}} the {{effectiveness}} of <b>hatcheries.</b> Proponents of the plan argue that <b>hatcheries</b> {{are essential to the}} survival of salmon within the Puget Sound region and beyond. Other groups argue against the <b>hatcheries</b> because they claim that it offsets the environmental balance by introducing the artificially raised salmon populations and pitting them against the natural population.The problem with <b>hatcheries</b> lies in the subtle connections between elements of the salmon system. The earliest <b>hatcheries</b> were simply egg-incubating that released small fry into the streams. Through this system, people tried to protect the eggs in the bottom of stream so that they would reduce the mortality of young salmon hoping to increase the salmon population. People raise them to fingerling size before turning them loose, and people put salmon in the tightly packed space. However, people feed them a mixture of fish offal, horse meat, tripe, and condemned pork and beef. As a result, it causes disease, furthermore, the disease infects from one salmon to others.|$|R

He was the {{chairman}} of the Hampshire County Democratic Executive Committee in the 1870s, and during this leadership, registered members of the West Virginia Democratic Party grew from 449 to 1,369 in 1876. White was appointed by West Virginia Governor John J. Jacob as one of the inaugural commissioners of the West Virginia Fish Commission. He established the Maguire Springs fish <b>hatchery</b> near Romney, and for a time, served as the commission's president.|$|E
5|$|Telopea oreades is {{not listed}} under Commonwealth {{environmental}} legislation {{and is not}} considered by respective state authorities to be rare or threatened in Victoria or New South Wales. The species does occur in the threatened Cool Temperate Rainforest Community in Victoria that is protected under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, {{and it is a}} component of the threatened Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests of far southern New South Wales. Furthermore, planted specimens are frequently stolen from bush regeneration sites as they are desirable garden plants. Conversely in New Zealand, there is a report of T. oreades escaping into kanuka scrub from the trout <b>hatchery</b> gardens on the Tongariro River south of Lake Taupo.|$|E
5|$|The film's second script {{involved}} Pteranodon {{escaping from}} Isla Sorna and causing {{a spate of}} mysterious killings on the mainland, {{which was to be}} investigated by Alan Grant {{and a number of other}} characters including Billy Brennan, a naturalist named Simone, a tough military attaché, wealthy Paul Roby, and Roby's teenage son Miles. Grant's group crash-lands on the island, while a parallel investigation is being carried out on the mainland. The aviary sequence and laboratory set piece were initially much longer and more complex, including Velociraptor stealthily entering the <b>hatchery</b> as the team spends the night there. Sets, costumes, and props were built for this version.|$|E
25|$|Spat, {{also called}} seed, is the free-swimming larval {{stage of a}} shellfish. Spat is cultured in <b>hatcheries,</b> and can be grown in tanks on land. <b>Hatcheries</b> can also be {{associated}} with research facilities where spat can be selectively bred to specifications, as broodstock.|$|R
50|$|Intensification of cultured shrimp {{is limited}} by seed supply. The {{production}} of seeds in <b>hatcheries</b> depends {{on the availability of}} broodstock and quality of spawners.

50|$|Galveston <b>hatcheries</b> (named after Galveston, Texas, {{where they}} were developed) are large-scale, {{industrial}} <b>hatcheries</b> using a closed and tightly controlled environment. They breed the shrimp at high densities in large (15-30 t) tanks. Survival rates vary between 0% and 80%, but typically achieve 50%.|$|R
5|$|The primary rooms {{include the}} Lair, <b>Hatchery,</b> Training Room, Library, and the Treasury. These {{have the same}} purpose as the first game: they {{function}} as a resting place, feeding place, training area, research area, and gold storage area respectively. The only major {{difference is that the}} Training Room can only train creatures up to experience level four. Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures fight to the death. The higher a creature's experience level, the stronger and more powerful they become. The highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.|$|E
5|$|Zerg {{buildings}} and units are entirely organic in-game, and all Zerg can regenerate slowly without assistance (though not {{as quickly as}} Protoss shields). Zerg production is far more centralized than with the Terrans and Protoss; a central <b>hatchery</b> must be utilized to create new Zerg, with other structures providing the necessary technology tree assets, whereas the other two races can produce units from several structures. Zerg units tend to be weaker {{than those of the}} other two races, but are also cheaper, allowing for rush tactics to be used. Some Zerg units are capable of infesting enemies with various parasites that range from being able to see what an enemy unit sees to spawning Zerg inside an enemy unit. In addition, Zerg can infest some Terran buildings, allowing for the production of special infested Terran units.|$|E
5|$|By 1854, {{when it was}} incorporated, Crescent City had a {{population}} of 800 but no road leading inland. The Crescent City and Yreka Plank and Turnpike Company was incorporated at a meeting on June 10, and a survey was completed in October, but work stopped with the Panic of 1855. The corporation was revived in December 1856 as the Crescent City Plank Road and Turnpike Company, began construction of a plank road in 1857, and opened the road in May 1858. This road, shown on USGS topographic maps as Wimer Road, led northeast from Crescent City to the Smith River, {{where there was a}} toll booth, and then took a generally northerly route to near the state line, where it turned east, crossing {{back and forth between the}} states, to Oregon Mountain. There it turned northeast, following the Illinois River and branches past O'Brien and Waldo to north of Kerby. The final stretch ran easterly to Jacksonville via Wilderville, along the present US 199, Fish <b>Hatchery</b> Road, and OR 238.|$|E
