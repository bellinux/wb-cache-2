5|$|Boyd {{suffered}} from a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>flying,</b> which had on occasion caused difficulties in his football career. Chosen by the Birmingham County Football Association for a representative match in Hamburg in 1953, the players were already at the airport when he requested to be omitted from the team. While his teammates flew to Birmingham's Fairs Cup match in Milan, Boyd travelled across the English Channel by boat and then across France and into Italy by train.|$|E
5|$|In April 1916, Wallis met Earl Winfield Spencer Jr., a U.S. Navy aviator, at Pensacola, Florida, {{while visiting}} her cousin Corinne Mustin. It {{was at this}} time that Wallis {{witnessed}} two airplane crashes about two weeks apart, resulting in a lifelong <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>flying.</b> The couple married on 8 November 1916 at Christ Episcopal Church in Baltimore, which had been Wallis's parish. Win, as her husband was known, was a heavy drinker. He drank even before flying and once crashed into the sea, but escaped almost unharmed. After the United States entered the First World War in 1917, Spencer was posted to San Diego as the first commanding officer of a training base in Coronado, known as Naval Air Station North Island; they remained there until 1921.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with the}} comic book when he got the part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E

The trio headlined the 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour with My Chemical Romance, which ran from August to October 2011, with {{additional}} dates scheduled in Canada with Rancid and Against Me!. In 2012 the band embarked on a worldwide 20th Anniversary Tour. The band continued touring in 2012 with their 20th Anniversary Tour, where they performed the rescheduled European dates originally canceled {{in order to continue}} recording. They were scheduled to headline the Bamboozle 2012 Music Festival but cancelled when Barker had to undergo an operation for tonsilitis. The 20th Anniversary Tour extended into Australia for in 2013 as part of the Soundwave festival, as well as 4 sideshows along the east coast with punk acts The Vandals and Sharks.

5|$|On November 1, 2002 Aspect {{published}} Alan Grant's Smallville: Dragon, {{about an}} ex-convict who assumes the abilities and {{appearance of a}} dragon after he is exposed to kryptonite in a cave; the mutation drives {{him to try to}} kill everyone who testified against him. In the novel, Clark is hypnotized into believing that he is a normal teenager with no special abilities. A month after the publication of Grant's novel Bennett and Gottesfeld wrote Little, Brown Young Readers' Flight, about a young girl (Tia) who Clark discovers has wings. He and his friends believe that Tia is being abused by her father, and teach her to overcome her <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> so she can find her mother. Flight (like See No Evil) was a planned episode, but the crew was uncertain that they could get the flying effects right and the idea was scrapped. Nancy Holder wrote the third novel in the Aspect series. Published on January 1, 2003, Hauntings follows Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in a Smallville house. Little, Brown Young Readers then published Animal Rage by David and Bobby Weiss, about animal-rights activist Heather Fox (who can change into any animal she touches). Heather uses this ability to harm people who hurt animals until Clark discovers it and stops her. Aspect published Dean Wesley Smith's Whodunit, in which Clark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigate the murder of a boy and his sister while Lex tries to decide whether to ransom his kidnapped father or try rescuing Lionel himself.|$|E
40|$|Common {{fears were}} studied by {{household}} telephone interviews and mail survey in Seattle, Washington, {{to determine their}} relationship to dental fear and to utilization of the dentist. Dental fear was either {{the first or second}} most common fear, with a prevalence estimated between 183 and 226 persons per 1000 population. Dental fear was associated with <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> heights, <b>flying,</b> and enclosures. Respondents with multiple common fears other than <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> dentistry were more likely to delay or cancel dental appointments, report a longer period since their last visit to the dentist, and report poorer oral health and less satisfaction with oral appearance. Over 22 percent of the dentally fearful group reported two or more accompanying common fears...|$|R

25|$|In 1999, Mýa began {{production}} on an album {{that would eventually}} become <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>Flying.</b> The title was partially inspired by Erica Jong 1973 novel, <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>Flying</b> which shared a lot of similarities toward female sexuality and development of second-wave feminism. The album featured contributions from Rodney Jerkins, Swizz Beatz, Soulshock & Karlin, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Knobody, Robin Thicke and Wyclef Jean. The majority of <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>Flying</b> was co-written and co-produced by Mýa {{and many of the}} album's songs were about female empowerment.

40|$|<b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> driving {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a complex diagnostic entity. Studies on flying phobia have drawn similar conclusions, although increasing clarity has been gained through research that indicates {{that there may be}} subtypes <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> phobia based on the focus <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> However, it is unclear if similar subtypes exist for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> driving. The aim {{of the present study was}} to conduct a preliminary investigation <b>of</b> driving <b>fear</b> subtypes and to clarify further whether there were differences between driving-fearful respondents who had been in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and those who had not. Eighty-five driving-fearful, media-recruited respondents completed a questionnaire that assessed anxiety, avoidance, and concerns related to their driving fears. The sample had high expectations of negative events while driving. There were no significant differences between those who had experienced an MVA and those who had not on various measures <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> severity. Cluster analysis revealed two main foci <b>of</b> <b>fear,</b> one characterized by danger expectancies and the other based on anxiety expectancies and unpleasant driving situations. This emphasizes the importance of assessing both internal and external foci <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> Although this finding is consistent with the results obtained for flying phobia, more research is required to replicate and extend these results and to develop and evaluate differential treatment programs...|$|R

40|$|In {{a lecture}} {{given in the}} year 1882 the Vienna Physiologist Sigmund Exner {{considered}} "The physiology <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> and floating in the fine arts" (Exner, 1882). In this still fascinating paper Exner reflects in a phenomenological approach on the experiental foundation of the depiction <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> human (respectively superhuman) bodys in classic artworks (e. g. Giorgione, Giotto, Masaccio, Michelangelo, Rubens and Titoretto). Referring to Fechner Exner basically assumes that pictorial suggestions <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> and floating bodies correspond to the recollection of wake human perception. Once in the lecture he mentions his own experience <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> in dreams and ascribes his sensations during these dreams to the wake experience of swimming. My paper follows Exner 2 ̆ 7 s hint and analyses the role of dreams in the (artful depicted) imagination <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> and floating bodies. It {{is based on a}} qualitative content analysis <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> dreams (collected by interviews and by review of cases reported in the scientific and popular literature on dreams) and daydreams <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> (spontaneous or evoked during an interview). The results suggest that dreams <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> involve sensations in their own right even if mentation in dreams recurs to the recollection of wake perception. Further {{there is some evidence that}} certain stiles/aspects <b>of</b> depicting <b>flying</b> and floating bodys are rooted in flying dreams, whereas others are more common to typical aspects <b>of</b> daydreams <b>of</b> <b>flying.</b> In the paper I will discuss the phenomenological findings of my research in the context of recent results in the field of psychobiology of dreaming...|$|R
