5|$|At about 18:00, {{the prisoners}} were divided into groups. <b>Each</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 10 to 20 was loaded onto a truck and transported several hundred metres (yards) from the {{building}} towards a wooded ravine. When the prisoners reached the previously prepared execution site, they were shot and buried in a mass grave using a bulldozer. After 15–20 minutes, the truck would return empty {{to pick up the}} next group. The final group of prisoners was executed just outside the farm building itself. By 22:00 that evening, all of the prisoners had been killed. Most sources place the number of victims at around 260. This figure has been used by ICTY prosecutors. Some estimates of the death toll go as high as 264. The Croatian authorities believe that the total figure stands at 261. The massacre was the most severe individual war crime committed in Europe since World War II until that point.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} numerous hand-picked {{followers and}} organized them into {{about a dozen}} different circles, <b>each</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> supporters unaware {{of the existence of}} the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular and nationalist response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that <b>each</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.|$|E

5|$|The game's single-player {{campaign}} {{consists of}} around 30 linear levels, divided up into eight distinct missions. Missions have different objectives, from retrieving a particular item and accessing computer systems, escorting a friendly character through hostile territory, or destroying vital ship and station components. Enemies come in multiple {{forms in the}} game, often as Star Trek species such as the Borg and the Klingons. <b>Each</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> enemies uses a different means of attacking: most humanoid enemies are armed with weapons similar to the player, and will use cover and squad tactics to attempt to kill the player character. The Borg differ from this in that, instead of using squad tactics, they eventually adapt their personal energy shields {{to most of the}} player's weapons, slowly rendering the player's attacks useless as they advance. Other enemies may attempt to swarm the player and eliminate them with melee attacks.|$|E

Four washstands (two mounted {{at each end of the}} car) delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.|$|E
5|$|When Woods was 13 years old, {{he played}} in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major {{national}} junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with <b>each</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke. As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.|$|E

5|$|A {{declaration}} on {{the takeover}} of Prijedor by Serb forces was prepared by Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) politicians and was repeatedly read out on Radio Prijedor {{the day after the}} takeover. Four-hundred Bosnian Serb policemen were assigned to participate in the takeover, the objective of which was to seize the functions {{of the president of the}} municipality, the vice-president of the municipality, the director of the post office, the chief of the police, etc. On the night of the 29/30 April 1992, {{the takeover of}} power took place. Serb employees of the public security station and reserve police gathered in Cirkin Polje, part of the town of Prijedor. The people there were given the task of taking over power in the municipality and were broadly divided into five groups. <b>Each</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> about twenty had a leader and each was ordered to gain control of certain buildings. One group was responsible for the Assembly building, one for the main police building, one for the courts, one for the bank and the last for the post-office. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the takeover by the Serb politicians was an illegal coup d'état, which was planned and coordinated long in advance with the ultimate aim of creating a pure Serbian municipality. These plans were never hidden and they were implemented in a coordinated action by the Serb police, army and politicians. One of the leading figures was Milomir Stakić, who came to play the dominant role in the political life of the municipality.|$|E
