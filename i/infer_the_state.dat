60|$|Causal dependence, as I {{observed}} a moment ago, is a conception {{which it is}} very dangerous to accept at its face value. There exists a notion that in regard to any event there is something which may be called the cause of that event--some one definite occurrence, without which the event {{would have been impossible}} and with which it becomes necessary. An event is supposed to be dependent upon its cause in some way which in it is not dependent upon other things. Thus men will urge that the mind is dependent upon the brain, or, with equal plausibility, that the brain is dependent upon the mind. It seems not improbable that if we had sufficient knowledge we could <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of a man's mind from the state of his brain, or the state of his brain from the state of his mind. So long as the usual conception of causal dependence is retained, this state of affairs can be used by the materialist to urge that the state of our brain causes our thoughts, and by the idealist to urge that our thoughts cause the state of our brain. Either contention is equally valid or equally invalid. The fact seems to be that there are many correlations of the sort which may be called causal, and that, for example, either a physical or a mental event can be predicted, theoretically, either from a sufficient number of physical antecedents or from a sufficient number of mental antecedents. To speak of the cause of an event is therefore misleading. Any set of antecedents from which the event can theoretically be inferred by means of correlations might be called a cause of the event. But to speak of the cause is to imply a uniqueness which does not exist.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an {{appearance}} generative mixture model based on key frames for meanshift tracking. Meanshift tracking algorithm tracks object by maximizing {{the similarity between}} the histogram in tracking window and a static histogram acquired {{at the beginning of}} tracking. The tracking therefore may fail if the appearance of the object varies substantially. Assume the key appearances of the object can be acquired before tracking, the manifold of the object appearance can be approximated by some piece-wise linear combination of these key appearances in histogram space. The generative process can be described by a bayesian graphical model. Online EM algorithm is then derived to estimate the model parameters and to update the appearance histogram. The updating histogram would improve meanshift tracking accuracy and reliability, and the model parameters <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of the object with respect to the key appearances. We applied this approach to track human head motion and to infer the head pose simultaneously in videos. Experiments verify that, our online histogram generative updating algorithm constrained by key appearance histograms avoids the drifting problem often encountered in tracking with online updating, that the enhanced meanshift algorithm is capable of tracking object of varying appearances more robustly and accurately, and that our tracking algorithm can <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of the object(e. g. pose) simultaneously as a bonus. ...|$|E
