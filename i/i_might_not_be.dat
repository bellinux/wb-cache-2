500|$|In June 2016, Rowling campaigned {{against the}} Referendum {{to leave the}} European Union, stating on her website that, [...] "I'm the mongrel product of this European {{continent}} and I'm an internationalist. I was raised by a Francophile mother whose family was proud of their part-French heritage ... My values are not contained or proscribed by borders. The absence of a visa when I cross the channel has symbolic value to me. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> in my house, but I'm still in my hometown." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because I felt your anxious {{position}} too keenly," [...] Oscar answered. [...] "Don't think me inconsiderate towards you, Lucilla. If I had <b>not</b> kept away, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> able {{to control}} myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|VENABLES. I am sorry, Mrs. Shand, for he {{interested}} me. His {{career has}} set me wondering whether if I had begun as a railway porter <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> still <b>be</b> calling out, 'By your leave.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Heaven's Door was {{released}} in Japanese theaters on February 7, 2009 to mixed press and lukewarm box office, but was praised for its cast, music, cinematography, and sound design. Screen International correspondent Jason Gray concludes, [...] "I think younger audiences will find the tragedy of Heaven´s Door palpable.... For someone like me who devoured American cinema of the early 70s, tearing up at films like Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the best judge. Who knows, Heaven's Door may become the new Léon for the teen set here and regarded as a minor indie classic overseas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not believe}} you to be so illiberal, Mary! Had the deacon said as much, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> surprised; but, for one like {{you to tell me}} that my God <b>is</b> <b>not</b> your God, <b>is</b> narrow, indeed!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Drummer Tony Williams was {{an early}} influence. [...] "The first drummer I ever saw, where I got to feel the impact up close, was Tony Williams", Blackman said. [...] "When I was 16, Tony came to my local drum store with a bassist and did a [...] clinic that left a {{powerful}} impression on me. And that's what I thought drumming should be: drummers should {{have a lot of}} impact and a great sound, without being limited to a conventional role in the band—the drums should speak just as freely as anybody." [...] Blackman says that the way that Williams used all four limbs to attack the drums strongly influenced her. [...] "I just love and loved everything about Tony", says Blackman. [...] "To me, not only was he a master technician, a master drummer, the innovator of the age, but also, he was a sound innovator. He had so many things that elevated the sound and the level of skill required to play this kind of music." [...] But although Blackman is sometimes referred to as a disciple of Tony Williams, she follows her own path. [...] "On the one hand, it doesn't bother me at all to be associated and in line with a master of the instrument like that – Okay, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> where I want to be, but I'm on the right track", says Blackman. [...] "On the other hand, I don't plan on being a clone. What I'm doing is always looking to expound on something that he's done, or push the music in a different way".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, my {{destination}} to {{the church}} placed {{me out of the}} question; otherwise I will not affect to say, that, qualified by my education both to instruct and guide Miss Vernon, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> a more creditable choice than any of my elders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> much to see, sir. The lamps do not burn very brightly, and the fog {{is coming}} on. I thought that, if it grew thicker, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> lose my way, {{and in that}} case <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> in at the hour you named for supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have been}} misinformed,' she said, a little primly. 'I {{do not say}} that {{a few months back}} <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> willing to have entertained such an offer, but my {{circumstances}} have changed since then, and now I should not think for a moment of doing so.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "When you've {{known her}} {{as long as}} I have--nineteen years," [...] said Mr. Letts, as the other protested, [...] "things'll be a bit different. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> here, for one thing." ...|$|E
60|$|I am by {{no means}} sure that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> tempted to enlarge upon the subject, had not the papers that lay before me on the table been a silent reproach for even this digression. I took them up again when I had got thus far, and seriously {{prepared}} to read.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I don't {{pull him}} down first, {{so as to}} get the old brewery. I was obliged to buy your bit of ground now, as <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> able to get any just when I wanted it. You've sold it a deal too cheap. You tell Mr. Goodall I say so." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{resumed his}} childish ways; he recover, his {{innocent}} smile, with the odd little puckers and wrinkles accompanying {{it at the}} corners of his eyes. I began to doubt whether <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> unreasonably hard on him. I penitently resolved to be more considerate toward his infirmities of mind and body during the remainder of my visit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Or <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{there to}} marry, mynheer. Accidents {{sometimes}} happen {{to men who}} are not wanted, especially in wild countries or, for the matter of that, to those who are." ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{director}} William Fruet, Donaldson {{stated that}} she [...] "knew {{that he would}} do things off-the-cuff at the last minute, like changing a scene. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> called in that day and suddenly I’d get a call telling me [...] "Get to the set now!", and I’d have to do a scene I hadn’t memorized yet. It was tense that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|Why not? What guide had I {{through the}} {{trackless}} waste of interplanetary space? What assurance that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> as well <b>be</b> hurtled to some far-distant star of another solar system, as to Mars? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was sorry}} {{presently}} {{that this was}} all we said about that. I was rather disappointed. <b>I</b> feared <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> quite have <b>been</b> all I had meant to be since the letter and the answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Guy," [...] she cried, [...] "forgive me, but I {{could not}} help it. I have made a mummy of myself, and I have walked along those awful sands that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> seen; {{but there is a}} question--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{would have}} been useless,' said Miss Aldclyffe. 'All was over by that time.' She {{addressed}} herself as much as Cytherea when she continued, 'Is it a Providence who sent you here at this juncture that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> left entirely alone?' ...|$|E
