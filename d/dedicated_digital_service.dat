The paradigm of service-oriented architectures (SoA) allows providing application functionality in a modular, self-contained way and to individually combine this functionality. The paper presents the ISIS/OSIRIS system which consists of a generic infrastructure for the reliable execution of distributed service-based applications (OSIRIS) {{and a set of}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>Digital</b> Library application <b>services</b> (ISIS) that allow, among others, content-based search in multimedia collections...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDigital {{libraries}} offer {{a massive}} set of <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> to geographically distributed library patrons. The <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> are commonly sourced from third-party service providers for charge. As externally sourced <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> are becoming prevalence, issues regarding their quality assessment are gaining critical importance. Unfortunately, sourcing <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> from external providers has {{brought with it}} stringent quality of service (QoS) demand from the library service users. Currently, {{there is no way}} for ensuring QoS between the <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> providers and the library management. In this paper, we propose service level agreements (SLAs) to capture the QoS requirements of the <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> users and the commitments, as well as adherence of the <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> providers...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{services}} and service delivery has been changing rapidly since the 1980 ’s when many seminal papers in services research were published. <b>Services</b> are increasingly <b>digital,</b> or have a digital component. Further, a large and heterogeneous literature, with competing and overlapping definitions, {{many of which are}} dated and inappropriate to contemporary <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> offerings is impeding progress in <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> research. In this conceptual paper, we offer a critical review of some existing conceptualizations of <b>services</b> and <b>digital</b> <b>services.</b> We argue that an inductive approach to understanding cognition about <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> is required to develop a taxonomy of <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> and a new vocabulary. We argue that this is a pre-requisite to theorizing about <b>digital</b> <b>services,</b> including understanding quality drivers, value propositions, and quality determinants for different <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> types. We propose a research approach for reconceptualising <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> and service quality, and outline methodological approaches and outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This audit {{examined}} the approaches departments and agencies use {{to determine which}} services will be, or have already been, delivered online via digital devices and {{examined the}} ongoing monitoring {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery. We found successes in <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery. However, not all departments and agencies have a complete list of service transactions and costs attributable to delivering the service transactions, and transactions to be transitioned to <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery are not clearly identified. While audited departments and agencies are transitioning to <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery, they remain hindered by pertinent issues such as proof of identity requirements, legacy or inefficient existing information technology systems and inefficient back-office processes.

40|$|As <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> {{increasingly}} {{deal with}} commodity offerings (i. e., digital content and {{features that are}} similar between service providers), service providers are seeking to differentiate themselves with variations in their <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> business models. Research, though, has yet to consider the association of consumer perceived value with <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> business models underlying technological innovations. We seek to demonstrate that consumer value for <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> business models may be quite different even when consumers have similar preferences for standard technology characteristics. In {{the context of this}} paper, we specifically consider consumer perceived value associated with Personal Health Records (PHRs) and PHR digital business models, through the use of an integrated latent variable and choice empirical model. We find that although consumer perceived value for PHRs is generally high, when offered a choice between three competing PHR business models, consumers state high value for only two of the business models in the choice set: PHRs offered directly by groups of medical providers and Integrated PHRs. These findings suggest that while perceived value may be high for generally considered <b>digital</b> <b>services,</b> variations in the underlying <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> business models are likely to have significant impacts on consumer valuations of <b>digital</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|Conference Theme: Hyperconnected World: Anything, Anywhere, AnytimeSession - General Presentations 3 Despite {{growth of}} {{information}} technology (IT) enabled services, how IT provides flexibility in service rendering and delivery, remains a relatively unexplored area of research. In this study, we investigate how <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility (DSF) influences performance of credit unions – an exemplary set of service oriented firms. We identify three dimensions of <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility: (1) basic <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility (basic DSF), (2) customer-oriented <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility (customer DSF), and (2) transaction-oriented <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility (transaction DSF). We argue that transaction DSF complements the basic DSF in influencing the performance, whereas customer DSF has a negative moderation effect on basic DSF and performance relationship. Using an archival data set, we find empirical support for the hypothesized relationships; and discuss contributions and implications of the findings. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

To this end, we propose a new model suitable for evaluating the performance of <b>digital</b> library <b>services.</b> We argue that the level of QoS provided by the <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> providers have direct impact on the perception and satisfaction of the <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> end-users...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{conceptual}} framework for identifying the logic of <b>digital</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>services</b> are those services that we acquire after the digitalization of previously non-digital products or services. The objective of the framework is to apply it in identifying the logic of <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> which are the results of digital innovation {{in the context of}} remote diagnostic services in the vehicle industry. While building the framework, looking at the transformation of the non-digital to <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> and the involvement of physical products, i. e., digital devices in the transformation, it was found essential to identify the logic of the <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> on the basis of service logic and goods logic. For that purpose, we have reviewed the literature on service logic and goods logic as those logics discuss differently about the determination and meaning of value, role of customer, role of physical products, primary unit of exchange and some other aspects which are important to know in case o...|$|R
