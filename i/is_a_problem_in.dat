25|$|Air {{pollution}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> Sofia due to {{its location}} in the Sofia valley, which is surrounded by mountains that reduce {{the ability of the}} air to self-clean. The air is polluted mostly by particulate matters and nitrogen oxides. Sofia has the most polluted air of any capital in the EU.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} step, the metallointermediate formed is a {{saturated}} compound that can rotate and then break down, again detaching the alkene from the catalyst. Consequently, {{contact with a}} hydrogenation catalyst necessarily causes cis-trans-isomerization, because the isomerization is thermodynamically favorable. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> partial hydrogenation, while in complete hydrogenation the produced trans-alkene is eventually hydrogenated.|$|E
25|$|Aquifer {{depletion}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> some areas, and {{is especially}} critical in northern Africa, {{for example the}} Great Manmade River project of Libya. However, new methods of groundwater management such as artificial recharge and injection of surface waters during seasonal wet periods has extended the life of many freshwater aquifers, especially in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{former head}} of the Panama Canal's {{dredging}} division, Thomas Drohan, a critic of the expansion plan, discounted allegations that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the short term. He argued that if the supply of any good or service becomes short, businesses can raise their prices; this would apply to Panama Canal tolls as much as it does to petroleum.|$|E
25|$|Discarding <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> all fisheries, {{and nations}} {{have adopted a}} number of {{measures}} {{to deal with the}} issue. The idea of banning discards is that since the fish that are discarded have a negligible chance of survival it is better from a management perspective that they are included in the fishing induced mortality figures on which allowable catch estimates are based.|$|E
25|$|Arms {{trafficking}} {{has become}} a significant problem in the Russian Federation following {{the disintegration of the}} Soviet Union. The former Eastern Bloc countries (including Russia) are the source of the majority of illegal weapons in circulation around the world. Illegal arms possession <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> many regions in the nation, especially in the areas suffering from insurgency such as Chechnya and Dagestan.|$|E

25|$|Brine <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> {{proportion}} to the humidity created, since water's vapor pressure decreases with salinity, {{it is reasonable to}} expect at least as much brine as water in humidity. This means that a river of brine flows way from the powerplant at 41 tons (m3s-1) per second, along with a river of saline water flowing in with 82 tons of water per second (m3s-1).|$|E
25|$|Groundwater {{intrusion}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the SF Faulquemont. Bambesch {{is preserved}} and {{is open for}} public tours on occasion. Kerfent, though flooded, is interpreted by local volunteers who tour {{the surface of the}} ouvrage. Likewise, the surface of Einseling may be visited, but the underground works are flooded. Laudrefang is abandoned and flooded. Téting is abandoned and vandalized, but retains some of its equipment.|$|E
25|$|Much of the state's {{ecological}} woes {{stem from}} the housing explosion, which is mostly centered {{in the capital of}} Cuernavaca, but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> places such as Cuautla as well. Groups such as the Frente de Pueblos en Defensa de la Tierra y el Agua and Guardianes de los Àrboles have criticized the government for allowing city areas to grow with insufficient planning and control. They also claim that it is hurting much of the state's ecosystem and water supply.|$|E

25|$|The {{knapsack}} problem or rucksack problem <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> combinatorial optimization: Given {{a set of}} items, each with a weight and a value, {{determine the number of}} each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is {{less than or equal to}} a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.|$|E
25|$|A diver who has {{deployed}} a Delayed Surface Marker Buoy (DSMB) {{at the end}} of a dive may use a pre-arranged {{colour code}} to indicate if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>In</b> some circles a yellow DSMB is considered an emergency signal, and red means OK. In most circles a second DSMB deployed on the same line will indicate a problem. A DSMB can also be used to carry up a slate with a message, but this is unlikely to be noticed unless a special arrangement has been made.|$|E
25|$|Russia is a supply, transit, and {{destination}} country for men, women, and children being trafficked for various purposes. The trafficking is multidimensional and it involves both commercial sexual exploitation and labor exploitation. Russia {{is a significant}} source of women trafficked to over 50 nations. Internal trafficking <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the country; women are trafficked from rural areas to urban settlements for commercial sexual exploitation. Men are trafficked internally and from Central Asia for forced labor in the construction and agricultural industries. Debt bondage is common among the trafficking victims.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} {{that result in}} vertigo are {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), Ménière's disease, and labyrinthitis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> a part of the vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness.|$|E
25|$|Pellagra is {{most common}} to populations within {{developing}} {{countries in which}} corn is the dietary staple. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa. This is {{in part due to}} the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes involved in making corn tortillas, can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form. Pellegra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake.|$|E
25|$|Sewage from Guatemala City {{has caused}} the Villalobos and Las Vacas Rivers to be {{considered}} the most contaminated streams in the country. Additionally, biological contamination of shallow aquifers by pathogens due to the improper disposal of human or animal wastes <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> many populated and rural areas of the country. In agricultural areas, pesticides are a primary source of contamination. Chemical contamination results {{from the use of}} fertilizers and pesticides in the sugarcane and banana plantations of the Pacific and Caribbean coastal plains. Along both coasts are streams, marshes, and swamps that contain large quantities of brackish or saline water and unless desalinated, these sources are unsuitable for most uses.|$|E
