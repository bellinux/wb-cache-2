5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|He {{recognised}} German {{skill in}} constructing trench parapets: by {{making use of}} an irregular top and <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parapet, and constructing it from material of varying composition, {{the presence of a}} sniper or an observer poking his head up became much less conspicuous. In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{rattlesnake}} usually <b>faces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, and {{the early}} representations mentioned above face left. However, some versions of the flag show <b>the</b> snake <b>facing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right.|$|R
50|$|The Allentown, Pennsylvania Post Office, {{built in}} 1934, {{included}} inlaid swastika floor tiles. In 1965 The General Services Administration removed tiles with arms <b>facing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, but retained some with arms <b>facing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left.|$|R

5|$|Cave 7, {{originally}} a Buddhist vihara, has been adapted as a Hindu temple {{dedicated to the}} god Ganesha. It {{is one of the}} Ashtavinayak shrines, a set of the eight prominent Ganesha shrines in Western Maharashtra. Twenty-six of the caves are individually numbered. The caves <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and are numbered serially from east to west. Caves 6 and 14 are chaitya-grihas (chapels), while the rest are viharas (dwellings for monks). The latter are in the form of dwellings and cells. There are also several rock-cut water cisterns; two of them have inscriptions. The layout of the caves, in general, are similar in pattern and shape. They generally have one or two sides with two long benches for occupants' use.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1794, {{engraver}} Robert Scot began preparing {{designs for}} the silver dollar. Scot's initial design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse featured an eagle, both required by the 1792 Coinage Act. Scot's design closely followed his design for the cent, but with the Phrygian cap removed. Government officials later instructed Scot to include a wreath around the eagle and to move the denomination from the reverse <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of the coin. After receiving approval, Scot began engraving the hubs for the new silver dollar. Extra care was taken during the engraving of this denomination, because the dollar would be the largest American coin, and would thus receive the most scrutiny from foreign nations. The lettering was executed by Frederick Geiger, who {{had worked as a}} typographer for various books and newspapers. After the dies were created, several copper test pieces were struck. Officials decided to add fifteen stars around the periphery, representing the fifteen states that had ratified the Constitution to that point, to the right-facing Liberty on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|In Braavos, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) kills The Waif (Faye Marsay) {{and adds}} her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall, stating to Jaqen H'ghar (Tom Wlaschiha) {{that she is}} {{returning}} to Westeros, no longer intending to be a Faceless Man. At Riverrun, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) unsuccessfully negotiates Sansa's request for help from the Blackfish (Clive Russell), and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) returns Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) to the castle, with Edmure commanding they throw down their arms and surrender to the Lannisters. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) learns of her impending trial, and that {{she will not be}} able to demand a trial by combat by royal decree of King Tommen Baratheon (Dean-Charles Chapman). In Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) arrives, in the midst of an attack on the city by the wise masters of Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis. In the Riverlands, Sandor Clegane (Rory McCann) tracks down the Brotherhood Without Banners, who attempt to convince Clegane to join them.|$|E
50|$|The Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg {{appears on}} <b>the</b> coins <b>facing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. He was not {{featured}} on the Luxembourgish franc as he only became Grand Duke in 2000 following the abdication of his father, Jean. Jean's portrait on the francs showed him <b>facing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, and it is common {{in a number of}} countries for successive monarchs <b>to</b> alternate <b>the</b> direction they faced on coins. Other euro coins issued by member states which are monarchies show their monarchs <b>facing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, in common with the effigy on their legacy currencies.|$|R
50|$|The small rhombicuboctahedral {{cells are}} joined via their 6 axial square <b>faces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cubical cells, and joined via their 12 non-axial square <b>faces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{hexagonal}} prisms. The cubical cells are joined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rhombicuboctahedra via 2 opposite <b>faces,</b> and joined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hexagonal prisms via the remaining 4 faces. The hexagonal prisms are connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truncated tetrahedra via their hexagonal <b>faces,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rhombicuboctahedra via 3 of their square <b>faces</b> each, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cubes via the other 3 square faces. The truncated tetrahedra are joined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rhombicuboctahedra via their triangular faces, and the hexagonal prisms via their hexagonal faces.|$|R

5|$|To crown {{all this}} , {{what is left}} but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus not {{fighting}} as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.|$|E

25|$|There is also {{sometimes}} confusion between a rousant eagle with displayed wings and a displayed eagle. The {{difference is that}} rousant eagles <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right and have their {{feet on the ground}} and displayed eagles face the viewer, have their legs splayed out, and the tail is completely visible.|$|E

25|$|The {{tendering}} out of bus operations {{has been}} a bumpy ride for Adelaide commuters. The original 1996 partial service tendering saw services run and marketed under each operator's name, presenting a disjointed network to the public.

25|$|Determining {{which side}} of the seal should face up may be done in a number of ways: if there is a carving on top, the front should face the user; if there is an {{inscription}} on the side, it should <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left of the user; if there is a dot on the side, it should face away from the user.|$|E

25|$|Because of Gliese 581g's {{proximity}} to its parent star, it {{is predicted to}} be tidally locked to Gliese 581. Just as Earth's Moon always presents the same <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth, the length of Gliese 581g's sidereal day would then precisely match the length of its year, meaning it would be permanently light on one half and permanently dark on {{the other half of}} its surface.|$|E
25|$|Deer {{stones are}} usually {{constructed}} from granite or greenstone, {{depending on which}} is the most abundant in the surrounding area. They have varying heights; most are over 3 feet tall, but some reach a height of 15 feet. The tops of the stones can be flat, round or smashed, suggesting that perhaps the original top had been deliberately destroyed. The stones are usually oriented with the decorated <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} {{is that the}} Western Rite is inherently divisive. Following different liturgical traditions than their neighboring Byzantine Rite Orthodox Christians, those using the Western Rite do not share liturgical unity with them and present an unfamiliar <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> majority of Orthodox Christians. This sentiment is expressed most famously by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware, who was particularly concerned about the further fragmentation of Orthodoxy in non-Orthodox countries, in this case in Britain.|$|E

25|$|Frictional heat is {{generated}} between the wear-resistant tool {{and the work}} pieces. This heat, along with that generated by the mechanical mixing process and the adiabatic heat within the material, cause the stirred materials to soften without melting. As the tool is moved forward, a special profile on the probe forces plasticised material from the leading <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear, where the high forces assist in a forged consolidation of the weld.|$|E
25|$|Glass frogs {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to some green frogs of the genus Eleutherodactylus and to some tree frogs of the family Hylidae. However, hylid tree frogs have eyes that <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side, whilst those of glass frogs face forward. Some species of green tree frogs (especially juveniles), such as Hyloscirtus palmeri and Hypsiboas pellucens, have the transparent abdominal skin typical of glass frogs, {{but they also have}} calcars on the heels, a character not present in any species of the Centrolenidae.|$|E
25|$|Holbein's {{portrait}} of Jane Meutas is a drawing {{in black and}} coloured chalks on pink prepared paper, 283 x 212 mm, and has the name 'The Lady Meutas' written clearly on its <b>face.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> right of the head, Holbein has added a schematic sketch of his sitter's hands. On one finger is a heart-shaped leaf which German painters of the time used as a symbol for the colour green, taken to represent an emerald ring.
