40|$|One of {{the most}} {{dominant}} features of a classroom space is its high occupancy, which results in high internal heat gain (approximately 5 KW). Furthermore, installation of <b>educational</b> <b>technologies,</b> such as smart boards, projectors and computers in the spaces increases potential internal heat gain. Previous studies on office buildings indicate that {{with the introduction of}} IT equipment in spaces during the last decade, cooling load demands are increasing with an associated increase in summer electrical demand. Due to the fact that <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> in specific correspond to pedagogical practices within the space, a lot of variations due to occupancy patterns occur. Also, thermal loads caused by <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> are expected to be dependent on spatial configuration, for example, position with respect to the external walls, lighting equipment, mobility of devices. This study explores the thermal impact of <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> in 2 typical educational spaces in a facility of higher education; the classroom and the computer lab. The results indicate that a heat gain ranging between 0. 06 and 0. 095 KWh/m 2 is generated in the rooms when <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> are in use. The second phase of this study is ongoing, and investigates thermal zones within the rooms due to distribution of <b>educational</b> <b>technologies.</b> Through simulation of thermal performance of the rooms, alternative room configurations are thus recommended in response to the observed thermal zones...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{support the}} {{teaching}} of ethics in science and engineering, <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> {{offer a variety of}} functions: communication between students and instructors, production of documents, distribution of documents, archiving of class sessions, and access to remote resources.

Good pedagogical practices are illustrated in this paper with four examples of uses of <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> in {{the teaching of}} ethics in science and engineering. <b>Educational</b> <b>technologies</b> impose costs for the purchase of hardware, licensing of software, hiring of support personnel, and training of instructors. Whether the benefits justify these costs is an unsettled question.

Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences.

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{seeks to}} propose a {{collaborative}} process for evaluating, piloting and selecting, new and emerging <b>educational</b> <b>technologies.</b> It aims to promote discussion about how such an evaluative process can be inclusive of interdisciplinary stakeholders and envision the actual application of these technologies in real teaching and learning contexts across disciplines. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology applied in the piloting and evaluation of new <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> involves the design and identification of learning activities, the development of evaluation criteria which map to {{the goals of the}} learning activities and stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 needs, and the incorporation of the technology-enabled activities into the total course design. Findings - Evaluation methodologies that involve interdisciplinary stakeholders collaborating on a software pilot expose participants to multiple perspectives and divergent views. The evaluation of new <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> within a teaching and learning context is more effective in exposing the benefits and weaknesses of the technology than a conventional software pilot. Research limitations/implications - The new <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> evaluation methodology proposed in this paper has only been fully applied in three product pilots and is still in its developmental stage. The research is limited to the evaluation of educational software, not the implementation of new <b>educational</b> <b>technologies.</b> Practical implications - The re-iterative and time-consuming process of piloting and evaluating new <b>educational</b> <b>technologies</b> within a course context is one in which academics require pedagogical, technological and administrative support. This paper presents a methodology that ensures each of these varieties of support is included. Originality/value - With the rapid expansion of new, sometimes costly <b>educational</b> <b>technologies,</b> universities can benefit from employing evaluation techniques based within an educational context, and ensure that their investments in these tools make an effective contribution to the enhancement of teaching and learning...|$|R
