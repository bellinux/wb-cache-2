2500|$|Days after Novak's initial column appeared, Matthew Cooper of Time {{magazine}} published Plame's name, citing unnamed {{government officials}} as sources. In his article, titled [...] "A War on Wilson?", Cooper {{raises the possibility}} that the White House has [...] "declared war" [...] on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: [...] "I am prepared to testify. I will comply. Last night I hugged my son good-bye and told him it might {{be a long time before}} I see him again. I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions." [...] Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received [...] "in somewhat dramatic fashion" [...] a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to provide you with some other assurances, we will.'" [...] Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for Time. Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, [...] "A War on Wilson?", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{is indeed}} Saul among the prophets. Why this sudden enthusiasm {{for a game}} which <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> despised? Are our opponents so reduced?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] I answered, [...] "there are a {{good many}} more people here than I {{expected}} to see. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were to be alone." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing more, thanks," [...] the {{pressman}} answered; [...] "but if I might I'd {{like to stay}} {{while you}} open a few. There might be something interesting.

6000|$|... 'My dear Harriet,' said Mr Morfin, after a silence, 'I was not {{prepared}} for this. Do <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wish {{to make your own}} part in the inheritance available for your good purpose, as well as John's?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Anne, then," [...] he said, [...] "please {{let me get}} my bearings. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were engaged}} to Harbord--you weren't forced into it, I suppose?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{worry about}} it," [...] the Prince said gently. [...] "Go and see your doctor, if you like, but I have known many people, {{perfectly}} healthy, affected {{in the same}} way. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wished to {{have a word with}} me.
