In a regional sense, structural deformations are defined as a coordinated system preserving regional extension or extensional strain.

30|$|Syndepositional fault {{patterns}} and activity data {{are based on}} 3 D seismic interpretations, which were used in combination to calculate <b>fault</b> <b>throw.</b> The interpreted horizons of SQK 1 g 0 in the 3 D seismic cube were transformed from time domain to depth domain based on the synthetic seismogram and seismic wave velocity before being used for <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> calculations (Chen et al. 2014). According to the stratum back stripping analysis, the initial geomorphology of the Qingxi Sag in main rift I stage has been presented quantitatively. Identification of sequence boundaries (sb), transgressive surface (ts) and maximum flooding surface (mfs) are based on analysis of 3 D seismic reflection including onlap, downlap, toplap and truncation reflections, and complemented by well lithology and logging curve combination style variations. The integration of point (well)-line (cross sections)-plane (planforms), using lithological data, logging data (GR, RD, and LLD log curves), seismic profile and geomorphology, was applied {{to build up the}} sequence stratigraphic patterns (see Figs.  6, 7). Drilling cores from four wells (L 11, L 10, L 13, and Y 1) were used to determine the sedimentary facies and indicate their distribution range, combined with lithological statistics from 32 wells (see Figs.  8, 9).|$|E
40|$|Post-depositional normal faults {{within the}} turbidite {{sequence}} of the Late Miocene Mount Messenger Formation of the Taranaki basin, New Zealand are characterised by granulation and cataclasis of sands and by the smearing of clay beds. Clay smears maintain continuity for high ratios of <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> to clay source bed thickness (c. 8), but are highly variable in thickness, and gaps occur at any point between the clay source bed cutoffs at higher ratios. Although cataclastic fault rock permeabilities may be significantly lower (c. 2 orders of magnitude) than host rock sandstone permeabilities, the occurrence of continuous clay smears, combined with low clay permeabilities (10 's to 100 's nD) means that the primary control on fault rock permeability is clay smear continuity. A new permeability predictor, the Probabilistic Shale Smear Factor (PSSF), is developed which incorporates the main characteristics of clay smearing from the Taranaki Basin. The PSSF method calculates fault permeabilities from a simple model of multiple clay smears within fault zones, predicting a more heterogeneous and realistic fault rock structure than other approaches (e. g. Shale Gouge Ratio, SGR). Nevertheless, its averaging effects at higher ratios of <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> to bed thickness provide a rationale {{for the application of}} other fault rock mixing models, e. g. SGR, at appropriate scales...|$|E

Erosion on this topographic highland was extremely strong, which was conducive to the formation of eroded valleys at the basin margin (Xu 2013). These valleys acted as favorable conduits for sediments entering the basin; thus, multiple fan delta lobes developed at the slope toe of {{the boundary}} fault in Liudong area (Fig.  10 b).|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe present new {{results on}} the {{long-term}} throw rates of active normal faults in the North Baikal Rift (NBR), eastern Siberia, based on a statistical analysis of triangular faceted scarps. Fault-bounded ridges in the NBR display typical morphologies with several contiguous facets separated by fault-perpendicular catchments. Over a range of 20 fault segments analyzed, triangular facet heights vary from similar to 200 to > 900 m. As fault scarps have been developing under similar long-term climatic conditions, we infer that the scatter in mean facet height arises from long-term differences in <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> rate. We compare the morphology of NBR facets with results obtained in a previously published numerical model of facet growth. Using facet height as an input, model results provide estimates of the long-term <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> rate. NBR throw rates vary between 0. 2 and 1. 2 mm yr(- 1). The throw rates are then compared with the cumulated throw, which has been constrained by geophysical and stratigraphic data in the basins.

30|$|The Ledong and Lingshui Sags {{are located}} in southwestern Qiongdongnan Basin, {{northern}} South China Sea. The Ledong sag is bounded by Zhongjian uplift, like an irregular square narrows eastward, while Lingshui sag {{is similar to a}} narrow irregular trapezoid (Fig.  1). The extension amount in the Ledong sag can reach up to 138  km, comparing to 20  km that of the Lingshui sag. The Ledong sag is a graben controlled by northern Fault No. 2 and southern Fault No. 13. As contrasted to larger <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> of Fault No. 13, Fault No. 2 exhibits remarkable segmented activity and <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> is generally small. The western Lingshui sag features a graben, while its eastern part is a half-graben with gentle-slope and fault terrace which faults in the south and overlaps in the north (Zhao et al. 2010; Lei et al. 2011). It is the variation of tectonic stress from east to west that resulted in the different extension amount between two sags. Early Oligocene was the critical period for the development of source rock, when the Ledong sag was controlled by Red River Fault (Fault No. 1), which had a large component of extension amount owing to pull-apart strike-slip processes at that time (Chen et al. 1996; Tapponnier et al. 1990). So it can be inferred that source rock in the Ledong sag would be thicker and larger than that in the Lingshui sag in the view of tectonic–stratigraphic evolution.|$|E

The rivers {{upstream}} of the normal fault-bounded graben each contain a non-lithologic knickpoint, including those that drain through inferred fault segment boundaries. Knickpoint heights measured vertically from the fault scale with footwall relief and documented <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> (vertical displacement). Consequently, we deduce these knickpoints were initiated by an increase in slip rate on the basin-bounding fault, driven by linkage of the three main fault segments of the high-angle graben bounding fault array. Fault interaction theory and ratios of channel steepness suggest that the slip rate enhancement factor on linkage was a factor of 3. We combine this information with geomorphic and structural constraints to estimate that linkage took place between 0. 6 [*]Ma and 1 [*]Ma. Calculated pre- and post-linkage throw rates are 0. 6 and 2 [*]mm/yr respectively. Maximum knickpoint retreat rates upstream of the faults range from 4. 5 to 28 [*]mm/yr, faster than for similar catchments upstream of normal faults in the Central Apennines and the Hatay Graben of Turkey, and implying a fluvial landscape response time of 1. 6 to 2. 7 Myr. We explore the relative controls of drainage area and precipitation on these retreat rates, and conclude that while climate variation and <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> rate partially explain the variations seen, lithology remains a potentially important but poorly characterised variable...|$|E

The study area is located in quadrants A-G, with focus on the D- and western E- quadrants. The availability of new 3 D seismic data in this region allowed accurate mapping and quantification of the fluid flow features present. These features might represent migration pathways for ascending hydrocarbons and can potentially be related to dry wells drilled in the study area. In total, a number of 135 mounded structures have been recognized on the Mid Miocene Unconformity. The focus of {{this research}} is to investigate the relationship between these mounded structures and the underlying polygonal fault system present in the Paleogene sediments. This relationship is examined via quantitative analysis on the polygonal faults, which include azimuth, throw and fault trace length measurements. Results show that areas where <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> is largest, mounded structures are generally present. Furthermore, a positive relation exists between the mound height and magnitude of the underlying <b>fault</b> <b>throw.</b> These relationships combined with the characteristics found on 3 D seismic data, indicate that the mounds most likely originate from remobilized sediments. Fluids dewatering from the underlying polygonal faulted sequence resulted in the entrainment and expulsion of these sediments on the paleo seafloor. The lithology of the mounds however, is uncertain as no wells have been drilled through these structures. Finally this research discusses the implications for the petroleum industry, as the observed fluid flow features are known migration pathways and might represent drilling hazards...|$|E

40|$|Recurrent diking episodes along {{divergent}} plate boundaries, as at Dabbahu (2005, Afar) or at Bardarbunga (2014, Iceland), {{highlight the}} possibility to have m-wide opening {{in a short time}} (days to weeks). This suggests a prominent role of magma enhancing transient plate separations. However, the role of diking on a longer term (> 102 years) and its influence on the structure and the evolution of a divergent plate boundary is still poorly investigated. Here we use field surveys along the oceanic Icelandic and continental Ethiopian plate boundaries, along five eruptive fissures and four rift segments. Field observations have also been integrated with analogue and numerical models of dike emplacement to better understand the effect of dike emplacement at depth and at the surface. Our results show that the dike-fed eruptive fissures are systematically associated with graben structures formed by inward dipping normal <b>faults</b> having <b>throws</b> up to 10 m and commonly propagating downward. Moreover, rift segments (i. e. mature rift zones), despite any asymmetry and repetition, are characterized by the same features as the eruptive fissures, the only difference lying in the larger size (higher <b>fault</b> <b>throws,</b> up to 40 m, and wider deformation zones). Analogue and numerical models of dike intrusion confirm that all the structural features observed along the rift segments may be dike-induced; these features include downward propagating normal faults bordering graben structures, contraction {{at the base of the}} hanging walls of the faults and upward propagating faults. Simple calculations based on the deeper structure of the eroded rift segments in eastern and western Iceland also suggest that all the fault slip in the active rift segments may result from diking. These results suggest that the overall deformation pattern of eruptive fissures and rift segments may be explained only by dike emplacement. In a magmatic rift, the regional tectonic stress may rarely be high enough to be released through regional faulting, suggesting that regional tectonics has negligible direct impact compared to diking in shaping the studied plate boundaries on the longer-term...|$|R

The survey {{extended from the}} part of the ridge crest exhibiting a median valley to that with an axial high. An axial zone, about 13 km wide, is dominated by linear volcanic ridges striking 14 degree and believed to form over fissures running approximately normal to the spreading direction. Outside the axial zone the sea-floor morphology is dominated by inward-facing faults striking subparallel to the Reykjanes Ridge axis, and therefore oblique to the spreading direction.

The northward structural development of this ridge-trench system illustrates the evolution of an incipient subduction zone along a transform plate boundary that has been subjected to increasing transverse shortening during the past 10 m. y. At {{the southern end of the}} trench, where subduction has not yet started, the Puysegur Ridge has a narrow (< 50 km) steep-sided cross section, and the axial strike-slip fault separates a shallow (125 – 625 m), flat-topped eastern crest from a deeper (400 – 1600 m) western crest; these characteristics indicate differential uplift during the initial stage of shortening. On the lower plate an incipient, 5. 2 -km-deep trench developed in conjunction with normal and reverse faults, suggesting strong interplate coupling across the trench. Northward, the ridge broadens linearly to 80 km wide, its western flank has locally collapsed, and the ridge summit has subsided, possibly by 1. 5 km, suggesting that the interplate coupling decreases and that a Benioff zone is being formed.

In fault dislocation, if sand shale contraposition occurs in one interval, the fault in this interval is closed, while if multiple sand layers are connected in one interval, the fault in this interval is open.

When N/G is large, the possibility of a sand–sand connection is large, and hence the fault sealing ability is poor. When the N/G ratio is small, the fault sealing ability is in fact good.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the statistical characteristics of fault core thickness and fault displacement, and to state the relationship between these two fault attributes. Field work was carried out At Tidwell Draw, in the San Rafael region of Utah, USA; and along the Moab Fault adjacent to the entrance to Arches National Park. Data from these sites were statistically analyzed, and exceedence frequency plots of fault core thickness and <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> were drawn. These exceedence frequency plots were then redrawn on several scales, and graphical analyses were conducted to determine the frequency distribution of fault core thickness and <b>fault</b> <b>throw.</b> Following that, the data was then plotted together on a bivariate scatter plot, and analyzed for linear correlation in graphs of different scales. The data from the Moab Fault site was augmented with data gathered from photographs. Analysis suggests that results of data gathered from photographs can produce similar results and can be an acceptable method to obtain data from difficult locations. Results of these analyses reveal that <b>fault</b> <b>throw</b> at these locations is distributed following a power law distribution pattern, and that fault thickness tends to follow a log-normal distribution. Analysis of a global data base involving data from selected previously published works reveal that for many data sets, exceedence frequency plots of displacement reveal that frequency distribution tends to follow log-normal trends, rather than power law trends. The similar results display log-normal distribution for fault thickness as well. Emphasis is placed on the importance of analyzing EF plot in all scales in order to form the most accurate interpretation of data distribution Bivariate analysis of fault displacement and fault core thickness for the global data set exhibited a power law relationship with an exponent of 0, 728 with a global goodness of fit regression of 74, 2 %. Although the data from Tidwell Draw displayed a regression of 52, 0 % for a power law relation with exponent value of 0, 683, the data plotted consistent with the global plot. The data from the Moab Fault site also plotted consistent with the global plot. Although the Moab Fault data showed a weak regression for the power law relationship with exponent equal to 0, 497, when the data was combined with another data set covering the upper ranges of the Moab Fault attributes, the combined Moab Fault data set showed a power law relationship with an exponent of 0, 715 with a goodness of fit regression of 88, 0 %, exceeding the regression of both of the Moab Fault data sets and the global data set. This result indicates that 1) A large data set covering a broader range of displacement and fault core thickness will produce better results, and 2) data sets having most in common will produce better results when combined than data having least in common.
