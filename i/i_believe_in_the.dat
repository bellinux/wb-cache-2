500|$|On 17 October the New York Post wrote {{under the}} front-page {{headline}} [...] "Get Banksy!" [...] that police were pursuing Banksy, but noted the hunt {{is difficult because}} {{he has never been}} positively identified in public. In response Banksy posted an image of the front page on his website with the caption [...] "I don't read what <b>i</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> papers." [...] The NYPD later denied they were actively looking for Banksy as no property owners had filed any formal complaints.|$|E
60|$|Home {{had never}} been a very {{pleasant}} place to me, because of my sister's temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> it. <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best parlor as a most elegant saloon; <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence.

[...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother {{was one of the}} most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me." ...|$|E
5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> record <b>I</b> made {{but if you}} don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it.

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, leaks {{revealed}} e-mails between Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton and RAND Corporation defense analyst Bruce Bennett from June 2014. Bennett advised against toning down The Interviews graphic Jong-un death scene, in the hope that it would [...] "start some real thinking in South Korea and, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North once the DVD leaks into the North". Bennett expressed his view that [...] "the only resolution I can see to the North Korean nuclear and other threats is for the North Korean government to eventually go away", which he felt would be likeliest to occur following an assassination of Kim. Lynton replied that a senior figure in the United States Department of State agreed. Bennett responded that the office of Robert R. King, U.S. Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, had determined that the North Korean statements had been [...] "typical North Korean bullying, likely without follow-up".|$|E
500|$|Additionally, past macroevolution can be {{inferred}} from historical traces. Transitional fossils, for example, provide plausible links between several different groups of organisms, such as Archaeopteryx linking birds and dinosaurs, or the Tiktaalik linking fish and limbed amphibians. Creationists dispute such examples, from asserting that such fossils are hoaxes or that they belong exclusively to one group or the other, to asserting {{that there should be}} far more evidence of obvious transitional species. Darwin himself found the paucity of transitional species {{to be one of the}} greatest weaknesses of his theory: Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extreme imperfection of the geological record. Darwin appealed to the limited collections then available, the extreme lengths of time involved, and different rates of change with some living species differing very little from fossils of the Silurian period. In later editions he added [...] "that the periods during which species have been undergoing modification, though very long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which these same species remained without undergoing any change." [...] The number of clear transitional fossils has increased enormously since Darwin's day, and this problem has been largely resolved with the advent of the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which predicts a primarily stable fossil record broken up by occasional major speciations.|$|E
500|$|Bryant and Bob Green were {{divorced}} in May 1979, {{in a dispute}} made public through newspapers. Bryant moved to Alabama and gave a candid interview to Ladies Home Journal in 1980 where she told {{the details of her}} marriage during the campaign. She claimed she had been [...] "married for the wrong reasons" [...] and that she and Green had fought regularly, often considering divorce. Green became her manager and she claimed exhaustion due to being booked for every event available, making $700,000 in 1976 ( [...] dollars). She had checked herself into a Christian psychiatric facility in 1973, and regularly saw psychiatrists and marriage counselors. Her anxiety manifested itself in chest pains, tremors, difficulty swallowing food, and a bout with 24-hour paralysis during a trip to Israel with the Falwell family. Bryant revealed she had received severe criticism from Christians following her divorce. One Canadian pastor expressed doubt to her that she had [...] "ever met the Lord", to her humiliation. As a result of the backlash she received from Christians, Bryant had softened her stances on gay rights: [...] "The church needs to be more loving, unconditionally, and willing to see these people as human beings, to minister to them and try to understand. If I had it to do over, I'd do it again, but not in the same way," [...] and feminism: [...] "The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems that are based on Biblical principles. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run God will vindicate me. I've about given up on the fundamentalists, who have become so legalistic and letter-bound to the Bible." ...|$|E

Steve Perlman, {{a close friend}} of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope, and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding.
