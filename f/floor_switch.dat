50|$|Advance {{earthquake}} warning {{is possible}} by detecting the non-destructive primary waves that travel more {{quickly through the}} Earth's crust than do the destructive secondary and Rayleigh waves, {{in the same way}} that lightning flashes reach our eyes before we hear the thunder during a storm.

The effectiveness of advance warning depends on accurate detection of the P-waves and rejection of ground vibrations caused by local activity (such as trucks or construction) as otherwise false-positive warnings will result.

Using simple binary sensors and the large nine-person data set, we were able to achieve promising identification results: a 64 % total recognition rate for single footstep profiles and an 84 % total success rate using longer walking sequences (including 5 - 7 -footstep profiles). Finally, we present a context-aware prototype application. It uses person identification and footstep location information to provide reminders to a user.

Going up to the switch house, he suddenly remembers all of the night: he looked through the windows of the house to see his father strangling Elizabeth. In her struggle to survive, she left a handprint on the window (the same one he saw earlier), and she also accidentally pulled the levers of the train tracks, leading it to derail and kill the passengers.

40|$|The {{elevator}} control system {{is one of}} the important aspects in electronics control module in automotive application. Here {{elevator control}} system is designed with different levels. First the elevator control system is implemented for multi-storage building. This implementation is based on FPGA based Fuzzy logic controller for intelligent control of elevator group system. This proposed approach is based on algorithm which is developed {{to reduce the amount of}} computation required by focusing only on relevant rules and ignoring those which are irrelevant to the condition for better performance of the group of elevator system. Here only two inputs are considered i. e. elevator car distance and number of stops. Based on these data the fuzzy controller can calculate the Performance Index (PI) of each elevator car, the car which has maximum PI gives the answer to the hall calls. This would facilitate reducing the Average Waiting Time (AWT) of the passenger. In the second level, the dispatching algorithm is implemented for multi-storage building. Here six types of dispatching algorithms are considered. Based on the traffic situation and condition, one algorithm out of six is operated, that should reduce the Average Waiting Time of passenger and reduce the power consumption of elevator system. The hardware part of the work consists of a simple D. C. Motor, which can control the up and down movement of the elevator car. This D. C. Motor is controlled through the MC 9 S 12 DP 256 B microcontroller. Here four floor elevator systems have been considered and every <b>floor</b> has two <b>switches,</b> one switch is used for up movement and another switch is used for down movement. Based on the switch pressed, the elevator car can move either in upward or downward direction. Here two sensors are used in every floor. One sensor is used for detecting the elevator car when elevator car reached to its destination floor. This sensor detects the car and stops the D. C. Motor. At the same time, another sensor is used for opening and closing the door. Finally, a novel fuzzy based PID controller algorithm is implemented in the MC 9 S 12 dp 256 B microcontroller. This algorithm is mainly used for maintaining the constant speed of D. C. Motor with different load conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of two Arctic Trough Mouth Fans (TMFs), the Storfjorden and Kveithola TMFs, is investigated {{by means of}} sub-bottom and seismic reflection profiles, multibeam bathymetry and sediment samples allowing their detailed stratigraphic architecture to be defined. We find that the TMFs mainly consist of an alternation of rapidly deposited glacigenic debris flows during glacial maxima and a sequence of well-layered plumites and hemipelagic sediments, which were mainly deposited during the deglaciation phase of the adjacent glacial trough. We have identified eight units above regional reflector R 1, which indicate that the ice sheet reached the shelf edge within the Storfjorden Trough on at least three occasions during the last ~ 200 ka. A shallow subsurface unit of glacigenic debris flows suggests that the ice sheet had a short re-advance over the northern and central part of Storfjorden after the Last Glacial Maximum. From stratigraphy, core and literature data, we estimate that ice sheets reached the shelf edge between 19. 5 to 22. 5 ka, 61 to 65 ka and 135 to 167 ka. Detailed seismic imaging allows us to refine the sedimentary model of Arctic TMFs. The main differences to previous models involve gully formation during not only the deglaciation phase, but also during interglacials by dense shelf water cascading, and a specific timing for the occurrence of slope failures (i. e., shortly after the deglaciation phase). High mean sedimentation rates during glacial maxima of up to 18 kg m- 2 yr- 1 likely allow excess pore pressure to develop in the water rich plumites and hemipelagic sediments deposited in the previous deglacial period, particularly where such plumites attain a significant thickness. Climate variations control sediment supply to the continental slope as well as glacial advances and retreats. This hypothesis has been investigated by {{using a combination of}} geophysical and geotechnical data. The results of compressibility and permeability testing are used together with margin stratigraphic models obtained from seismic reflection data, as input for numerical finite elements models to understand focusing of interstitial fluids in glaciated continental margins. BASIN software has been used to model the evolution of the Storfjorden TMF from 2. 7 to 0. 2 Ma. The model results show that onset of glacial sedimentation (~ 1. 5 Ma) has a significant role in developing permeability barriers (tills) on the shelf decreasing the vertical fluid flow towards the sea <b>floor</b> and <b>switching</b> it towards the slope. Prior to 220 ka, the higher values (up to 0. 6) are located below the shelf edge and in the distal area. In turn, Plaxis software has been used to perform a detailed high resolution hydrogeological model of the four glacial/inter-glacial cycles. Ice loading during Glacial Maxima caused a rapid consolidation of the shelf sediments with high fluid expulsion rates towards the shallower plumite sediments on the slope. This caused an overpressure increase inside these layers up to 0. 6. The higher overpressures occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum and few thousand years after. Present day overpressures reach maximum values of 0. 7 on the shelf. A detailed slope stability analysis through the Last Glacial Maximum, last deglaciation and Holocene has been carried out. Safety factor (SF) of the margin was reduced to one half due to overpressures development during the Last Glacial Maximum with minimum values of ~ 1. 2 which were preserved through the last deglaciation. These low values occurrence match with the time when most of the landslides identified in the study are occurred. Although the safety factor values are close to the instability, mechanisms as glacio- eustatic rebound induced earthquakes can be considered as a final trigger. L’evolució de dos ventalls glacials, Storfjorden i Kveithola, s’ha investigat fent servir dades geofísiques i mostres de sediment. D’aquesta manera s’ha pogut establir de forma detallada la seva estratigrafia. A partir de l’anàlisi estratigràfic i dades de literatura s’ha pogut establir que el gel va ocupar la plataforma continental com a mínim en tres ocasions durant els últims ~ 200 ka: 19. 5 a 22. 5 ka, 61 a 65 ka i 135 to 167 ka. A més la bona cobertura i resolució de les dades geofísiques ha permès de refinar el model d’evolució dels ventalls glacials. Les diferències més important respecte a treballs previs corresponen a que la formació de xaragalls no dóna només en els deglacials, sinó també en els interglacial degut a les aigües denses de plataforma, i també l’ocurrència de esllavissades durant la deglaciació del marge. En aquest estudi queda palès el control climàtic en la tassa de sedimentació, els sediments dipositats i els avanços i retrocessos de gel. Aquestes variacions influeixen en el patrons de fluid del subsòl i el desenvolupament de sobrepressions en els sediments. Aquesta hipòtesi ha estat investigada utilitzant models d’elements finits (BASIN i Plaxis) a partir de les dades geofísiques i assajos geotècnics. La modelització dels darrers 2. 7 Ma mostra que l’inici dels períodes glacials, fa aproximadament 1. 5 Ma, va promoure la formació bandes de baixa permeabilitat (tills) a la plataforma. La càrrega de gel a la plataforma durant els màxims glacials, va provocar una ràpida consolidació dels sediments subjacents i l’expulsió de l’aigua intersticial, incrementant així el flux de fluids cap al talús superior. Alhora, aquest flux focalitzat cap als sediments més permeables del talús (plumites) va incrementar dràsticament les sobrepressions. Les sobrepressions màximes van tenir lloc durant l’últim màxim glacial i els següents mil·lennis. Degut a aquestes sobrepressions, el factor de seguretat del talús es va reduir a la meitat, arribant a valors de 1. 2 al final de l’últim màxim glacial. Tot i els que aquest valors són baixos, els terratrèmols provocats pel rebot glacio-eustàtic han de ser considerats com a desencadenants finals de les esllavissades identificades a la zona...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the processes that}} generate subaqueous, pumice-rich pyroclastic facies in below wave-base environments. The principal method is field-based facies analysis. I also present grain size distributions and hydraulic sorting ratios of selected samples using a new technique that combines image analysis and functional stereology. Two Tertiary volcaniclastic successions have been studied. The Ohanapecosh Formation (Washington State, United States) is dominated by subaqueous pumice-rich facies derived from subaerial explosive eruptions and subaqueous sediment remobilisation in a continental basin environment. The Dogashima Formation (Izu Peninsula, Japan) contains well-preserved examples of subaqueous pumice-rich facies produced by subaqueous explosive eruptions and below wave-base sediment remobilisation in an oceanic arc setting. The common processes of lithification and welding prevent quantification of grain size by conventional sieving for most clastic rocks in the geological record. In addition, the true grain size distribution of clastic rocks is finer grained than its representation in a random 2 D section. I show that image analysis combined with functional stereology {{can be used to}} infer 3 D volume fractions and weight percent of clast populations > 0. 25 - 2 mm from 2 D cross-sectional images. Data from synthetic rocks correlate well with results from sieving of the same samples while still unconsolidated. The method can be applied to any type of coarse grained clastic rock, regardless of age, and therefore has a wide application in volcanology and clastic sedimentology. The > 800 -m-thick Ohanapecosh Formation records voluminous sedimentation of volcanic clasts during the Eocene-Oligocene in the Central Cascades. Most volcaniclastic beds are dominated by angular pumice clasts and fiamme of intermediate composition, now entirely devitrified and altered. Very thick to extremely thick (1 – 50 m) and very thin to thick (0. 001 – 1 m) beds are laterally continuous and have even thickness; erosion surfaces, cross-beds and other traction structures are almost entirely absent, which strongly suggests a below wave-base environment of deposition for most of the succession. The Chinook Pass Member is mostly composed of extremely thick, graded, matrixsupported, pumice-and-fiamme-rich beds that commonly include a coarse basal breccia comprising sub-rounded dense clasts. The abundance of angular pumice clasts and extreme thickness suggest that this facies was generated by magmatic volatile-driven explosive eruptions, and the sub-rounded dense clasts were probably rounded above wave-base. Thus, these beds are interpreted to have been deposited in a below wave-base setting by subaerial pyroclastic flows that crossed the shoreline, and transformed into eruption-fed, water-supported subaqueous volcaniclastic density currents. Reversely to normally graded pumice breccia facies that contains sub-rounded pumice clasts, wood and accretionary lapilli is interpreted to have formed by settling from pumice rafts, also related to subaerial explosive eruptions. The White Pass Member chiefly contains massive to normally graded volcanic breccia and coarse volcanic breccia that suggest deposition from subaqueous high-concentration density currents and subaqueous debris flows. The abundance of angular pumice clasts suggests minor reworking above wave-base. Very thin to thick interbeds of ine sandstone to mudstone are interpreted to be derived from subaqueous and subaerial sources, and to have mostly been deposited from low density turbidity currents and suspension. The presence of shallow basaltic intrusions and mafic volcanic breccia composed of scoria lapilli and that contains rare beds of accretionary lapilli indicate the presence of intra-basinal scoria cones that may have been partly subaerial. The lateral transition to thinner and finer-grained facies in the Johnson Creek Member and western part of the White Pass Member suggests that the principal sources were to the east of the preserved exposures of the Ohanapecosh Formation. The Pliocene Dogashima Formation (Izu Peninsula, Japan) is composed of three volcaniclastic sequences erupted under water. Dogashima 1 is mostly composed of pumice breccia, shard-rich siltstone, and cross-bedded and planar bedded pumice breccia/sandstone. The base of Dogashima 2 is dominated by very thick, clast-supported, massive grey andesite breccia composed of very coarse andesite clasts with quenched margins. It is gradationally overlain by very thick, clast-supported white pumice breccia. The massive grey andesite breccia is confined to a palæo-valley eroded into beds of Dogashima 1. The white pumice breccia is hydraulically sorted and stratified in proximity to the wall of this palæo-valley, and is stratified and finer grained in the adjacent overbank setting. The top of Dogashima 2 is dominated by very thick cross-bedded pumice breccia-conglomerate and planar bedded pumice breccia that contains coarse pumice clasts. Dogashima 2 has an erosive contact with overall monomictic andesite breccia of Dogashima 3. The similar mineralogy and composition of white andesite pumice and grey andesite clasts in Dogashima 1 and 2 suggests they were co-magmatic and erupted from the same vent. Dogashima 2 is interpreted to record explosive destruction of a subaqueous hot lava dome by a subaqueous, magmatic volatile-driven explosive eruption. Most of the products of this eruption were deposited in two gradational units from cohesionless, water-supported volcaniclastic density currents. Coarse pumice clasts and ash present in overlying planar beds were settled from suspension. This sequence demonstrates that lava or dome effusion on the sea <b>floor</b> can <b>switch</b> to an open-vent, pumice-forming, magmatic volatile-driven explosive activity, as in subaerial analogues. Pumice breccia of Dogashima 1 is interpreted to be the product of precursory explosive activity, whereas Dogashima 3 records a late, dome-building episode. Pumice breccia and dome-related clasts indicate cyclic effusive and explosive activity throughout the Dogashima Formation. Cross-bedded pumice breccia/breccia conglomerate facies in the Dogashima Formation {{are most likely to be}} products of resedimentation of pumiceous aggregates, and development and destruction of subaqueous dune fields in a below wave-base, canyon setting. I apply the image analysis and functional stereology method to pumiceous volcaniclastic rocks of the Ohanapecosh and Dogashima formations and the Manukau Sub-Group (New Zealand) and the Sierra La Primavera caldera (Mexico). Samples from these waterlain successions were grouped into three broad facies, on the basis of bed thickness, abundance of matrix and clast size sorting. The volume of pumice clasts, dense clasts and matrix ( 2 mm), and that the pumice clasts were fully waterlogged during transport and deposition. In addition, the studied subaqueous volcaniclastic samples overlap with the fields defined by matrix-free subaerial pyroclastic flow deposits, which confirms that outputs from functional stereology and conventional sieving give comparable results. The volcaniclastic successions in the Ohanapecosh and the Dogashima formations include good examples of subaqueous, pumice-rich pyroclastic facies that were erupted onland or under water, and deposited in below wave-base settings. Eruption-fed facies generated by subaqueous pumice-forming explosive eruptions are exemplified by the extremely thick and graded sequence in Dogashima 2 (Dogashima Formation), which contains dense clasts that were deposited hot. Numerous beds of graded, extremely thick, pumice-rich facies in the Ohanapecosh Formation are interpreted to be deposited from eruption-fed, water-supported high concentration density currents that were fed by subaerial pyroclastic flows, primarily because rounded dense clasts, accretionary lapilli and wood in these and associated facies imply that the source vents were subaerial. Resedimentation events can occur during eruptions and after, especially after eruptions that produce large volumes of pyroclasts in unstable environments. However, resedimented facies can be difficult to distinguish from eruption-fed facies in below wave-base successions, essentially because clast reworking below wave-base is minimal during resedimentation. In addition, eruption-fed facies can contain clasts that were previously abraded in above wave-base settings, for example during long-distance transport in subaerial pyroclastic flows, in pumice rafts (e. g. Chinook Pass Member, Ohanapecosh Formation) or during transport in the dense-clast-dominated bedload of subaqueous volcaniclastic density currents (e. g. Dogashima 2). Short-distance transport in pyroclastic flows might not be able to abrade pumice clasts (e. g. the eruption-fed facies in the Chinook Pass Member, Ohanapecosh Formation) ...|$|R
