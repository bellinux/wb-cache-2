5000|$|Fair <b>Employment</b> <b>Week</b> is {{an annual}} {{campaign}} that promotes employment fairness for sessional lecturers and other contract faculty working in Canadian universities and colleges. It {{is held in}} the last week of October, {{at the same time as}} Campus Equity Week in the United States and Mexico. It grew out of an American initiative, Action 2000 (A2K), which was held in early 2000 when faculty from California’s 107 community colleges organized a week of political action. [...] The impetus for A2K was a common interest in California state legislation and the state budget, but many campus groups used the opportunity to address collective bargaining and local campus issues as well. In 2001, the participants at the Conference on Contingent Academic Labour (COCAL) IV, meeting in San Jose, California, voted to coordinate a week of activities across North America, under the name Campus Equity Week.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} unemployment benefit duration in Finland. To overcome the problem that the maximum duration of benefits {{is the same for}} all unemployed we exploit two observations. First, despite the uniform maximum benefit period, potential benefit duration at the beginning of unemployment spells varies across individuals because only those with sufficient work history {{in the past two years}} qualify for a new period of benefits whereas others may be entitled to unused benefit days from a previous spell. Second, part of this variation is exogenous due to a reform that reduced the minimum number of <b>employment</b> <b>weeks</b> required for the new benefit period. Using the exogenous part of the variation for identification we estimate that one extra week of benefits increases expected unemployment duration by 0. 15 weeks, which corresponds to an elasticity of 0. 5. We also find positive effects on the quality of the next job, especially when measured by job stability...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the macroeconomy and the poverty rate. The first section provides evidence that poverty was far less responsive to macroeconomic growth in the 1980 s {{than it had been in}} earlier decades. The section explores and rejects four reasons for this: It is not due to the exclusion of in-kind income from the data, to the regional location of the poor, to the public assistance changes of the early 1980 s, or to the changing demographic composition of the poor. Instead, it is almost entirely due to declines in real wages that occur among low-wage workers over the 1980 s. In fact, <b>employment</b> and <b>weeks</b> of work per year within low-income households expands more rapidly in the 1980 s than in the 1960 s. This is almost entirely offset, however, by declines in weekly earnings at the bottom of the income distribution. The result is that economic growth has been a far less effective anti-poverty tool over the past decade. ...|$|R

40|$|This study explores how {{faculty at}} one research-intensive {{university}} {{spend their time}} on research, teaching, mentoring, and service, as well as housework, childcare, care for elders, and other long-term care. Drawing on surveys and focus group interviews with faculty, the article examines how gender is related to time spent on the different components of faculty work, {{as well as on}} housework and care. Findings show that many faculty report working more than 60 hours a week, with substantial time on weekends devoted to work. Finding balance between different kinds of work (research, teaching, mentoring, and service) is as difficult as finding balance between work and personal life. The study further explores how gendered care giving, in particular being a mother to young children, is related to time spent on faculty work, controlling for partner employment and other factors. Men and women devote significantly different amounts of time to housework and care giving. While men and women faculty devote the same overall time to their <b>employment</b> each <b>week,</b> mothers of young children spend less time on research, the activity that counts most toward career advancement...|$|R

30|$|There is a {{considerable}} variation in the access to these labor market opportunities across the countries in this region. Looking simply at coverage {{of the opportunity to}} hold a job that entails at least 20  hours of <b>employment</b> per <b>week,</b> for example, the average ranges from about 30 percent for countries like Armenia and Azerbaijan to 80 percent in Czech Republic. There is also variation across opportunities as should be expected because the very definitions of opportunities embody varying level of restrictiveness. What is interesting is the gap between the coverage and HOI and the differences in these gaps across countries. For example consider difference between coverage and HOI for the same opportunity for two different countries Russia and Albania. In Russia, the penalty is 0.03 while in Albania where the coverage itself is already low, the penalty for inequality is more than twice that for Russia. The fact that Albania does worse than Russia in this particular opportunity is clear enough from the coverage numbers. But a refinement that the HOI brings is that it enables us to see that that Albania would compare even more unfavorably if the distributional aspects of the opportunity were to be taken into account.|$|R

30|$|The child {{tax credits}} are not {{contingent}} on work. In principle, the working tax credits (WTCs) are withheld during weeks not at work (with {{an exception for}} a four-week spell in between jobs). As a result, if annual income qualifies a worker for a positive WTC, the WTC has both a positive and {{negative effect on the}} weekly employment tax wedge. The positive-tax effect comes from the effect of a <b>week’s</b> <b>employment</b> on annual income and therefore the weekly amount of WTC to be received during times of employment. The magnitude of the positive tax effect depends on the phase-out rate and the number of weeks during the year the person is at work (i.e., equation (4) itself would depend on n). The negative-tax effect comes from the withholding of WTC payments during weeks not employed and, for the reasons noted below, is not relevant for my calculations.|$|R
