40|$|We {{compared}} {{numbers of}} strikes, proportions of fish that hooked up after strikes, proportions of fish that stayed on <b>hook</b> (<b>retained)</b> after <b>hook</b> up, {{and numbers of}} fish caught between circle and J hooks rigged with dead natural fish bait (ballyhoo) and trolled for three oceanic predator species: dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). Interactions were compared between circle and J hooks fished on 75 trips by two user groups (charter and recreational fishermen). Hooks were affixed to three species-specific leader types most commonly fished in this region: monofilament (dolphinfish), fluorocarbon (tuna), and wire (wahoo). Numbers of fish caught per trip and three potential mechanisms that might inf luence numbers caught (i. e., number of strikes, proportion of fish <b>hooked,</b> and proportion <b>retained)</b> were modeled with generalized linear models that considered hook type, leader type, species, user (fishing) group, and wave height as main effects. Hook type was a main effect at the catch level; generally, more fish were caught on J hooks than on circle hooks. The effect of hook type on strike rates was equivocal. However, J hooks had {{a greater proportion of}} hook-ups than did circle hooks. Finally, the proportion of fish <b>retained</b> once <b>hooked</b> was generally equal between hook types. We found similar results when data from additional species were pooled as a “tuna” group and a “mackerel” group. We conclude that J hooks are more effective than circle hooks at the hook-up level and result in greater numbers of troll-caught dolphinfish, tuna...|$|R

40|$|A {{retaining}} wall {{is one of}} the most important types of retaining structures. It is extensively used in variety of situations such as highway engineering, railway engineering, bridge engineering and irrigation engineering. Reinforced concrete {{retaining wall}}s have a vertical or inclined stem cast with base slab. These are considered suitable up to a height of 6 m. It resists lateral earth pressure by cantilever action of stem, toe slab and heel slab. The tendency of wall to slide forward due to lateral earth pressure should be investigated and a factor of safety of 1. 5 shall be provided against sliding. Cantilever retaining walls are found best up to a height of 6 m. For greater heights earth pressure due to retained fill will be higher due to lever arm effect, higher moments are produced at base, which leads to higher section for stability design as well as structural design. This proves to be an uneconomical design. As an alternative to this, one may go for counter fort retaining wall, which demands greater base area as well as steel. As a solution to this difficulty, a new approach that is to minimize effect of forces coming from retained fill, short reinforced concrete members in the form of cantilever steps are cast along the stem on the <b>retaining</b> <b>face.</b> Addition of these steps would counterbalance the locally appearing forces and will result into lesser moment and shear forces along the stem. Also it will reduce the bending action that is pressure below the base. The objectives of the study are 1) To reduce the stresses on the <b>retaining</b> <b>face</b> of the cantilever retaining wall, it is proposed to introduce reinforced concret...|$|R
50|$|IVC {{filters are}} {{attached}} to the vena cava via hooks on their ends. Some are compression springs, which compress outward onto the side wall of the vena cava; however, they still have small <b>hooks</b> that <b>retain</b> their location. These hooks aid in the anchoring and healing process, as they allow the tissues to 'ingrow' around them, securing the IVC in place. It is unlikely, then, after 4 to 6 weeks of healing, that an MRI of 1.5 tesla, up to 3 tesla, will cause any level of dislodging to occur to the IVC filter.|$|R

However, he is estranged from both due to his constant absences and broken promises, which irritates Moira. His preteen son, Jack, is often frustrated with Peter's prolonged absences and turns to Captain Hook for a father figure. His young daughter Maggie retains faith in Peter, which helps him and the Lost Boys rescue her and Jack from <b>Hook.</b> Peter <b>retains</b> much of his fun self after his final visit to Neverland, which strengthens his relationship with Jack, Maggie and Moira.|$|R
50|$|In {{its basic}} and {{standard}} configuration, {{each of the}} belt-mounted components is secured to the belt {{by a pair of}} double hooks (one double hook only {{in the case of the}} compass pouch) at the rear, hooked over the belt above and below, with the ends of the <b>hooks</b> further <b>retained</b> in canvas pockets on the inside face of the belt. However, variations are to be found - including water bottle pouches and ammunition pouches for non-standard personal weapons fitted with a canvas loop into which the belt is threaded, rather than the metal hooks. This method of attachment allows the pouch to be moved around the belt for the comfort of the user, for example when sitting for long periods.|$|R

The next year, the Gulp Tour had finished in September, when the band was working on their second LP, Oktubre, with Daniel Melero and Claudio Cornelio as guests, and the last with Tito D'Aviero, Willy Crook and Piojo Ávalos.

50|$|A simple {{earth and}} gravel {{platform}} held in by a wooden <b>retaining</b> <b>face</b> was duly provided and Colonel Stephens informed the Board of Trade {{of its existence}} in July 1903. In October 1913, the Salehurst Parish Council contacted Colonel Stephens {{about the possibility of}} establishing a public halt near the church. Although Stephens might have been favourable to the suggestion, nothing happened until 1929. In August 1929, the unexpected announcement was made that construction of a request stop at Salehurst had begun. Rather like Junction Road Halt, the station {{was no more than a}} single platform with a wooden bench and nameboard. The station, which began to appear in public timetables from 1929, seems to have been little used, even though it was one of the few stations on the line which was located close to the village it claimed to serve. It was also the only intermediate station not to be situated by a road crossing; it was reached by a footpath leading south from the church. The nearby small village of Salehurst consisted at the time of little more than a church, a public house and a cluster of houses, while Robertsbridge could be reached on foot in less than half an hour which was probably quicker than the usual late-running trains.|$|R
