50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} in using a <b>Double</b> <b>Block</b> and Bleed <b>Valve.</b> Significantly, {{because all the}} valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment.|$|R
50|$|This type of <b>Double</b> <b>Block</b> and Bleed <b>Valves</b> have a {{patented}} design which incorporates two {{ball valves}} and a bleed valve into one compact cartridge type unit with ANSI B16.5 tapped flanged connections. The major benefit of this design configuration {{is that the}} valve has the same face-to-face dimension as a single <b>block</b> ball <b>valve</b> (as specified in API 6D and ANSI B16.10), which means the valve can easily be installed into an existing pipeline {{without the need for}} any pipeline re-working.|$|R
50|$|This type of <b>Double</b> <b>Block</b> and Bleed <b>Valves</b> (DBB Valves) {{feature the}} {{traditional}} style of flange-by-flange type valve {{and is available}} with ANSI B16.5 flanges, hub connections and welded ends to suit the pipeline system {{it is to be}} installed in. It features all the benefits of the single unit DBB valve, with the added benefit of a bespoke face-to-face dimension if required.|$|R
50|$|These valves replace {{existing}} traditional techniques {{employed by}} pipeline engineers {{to generate a}} <b>double</b> <b>block</b> and bleed configuration in the pipeline. Two <b>block</b> <b>valves</b> and a bleed valve are as a unit, or manifold, to be installed for positive isolation. Used for critical process service, DBB valves are for high pressure systems or toxic/hazardous fluid processes. Applications that use DBB valves include instrument drain, chemical injection connection, chemical seal isolation, and gauge isolation. DBB valves {{do the work of}} three separate valves (2 isolations and 1 drain) and require less space and have less weight.|$|R

50|$|<b>Block</b> <b>valve</b> station: These are {{the first}} line of {{protection}} for pipelines. With these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak. <b>Block</b> <b>valve</b> stations are usually located every 20 to 30 mi, {{depending on the type of}} pipeline. Even though it is not a design rule, it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines. The location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported, the trajectory of the pipeline and/or the operational conditions of the line.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA proper <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set in PG(2,p) {{is a set}} B {{of points}} such that 2 ⩽|B∩l|⩽(p+ 1) - 2 for each line l. The {{smallest}} known example of a proper <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set in PG(2,p) for large primes p is the disjoint union of two projective triangles of side (p+ 3) / 2; {{the size of this}} set is 3 p+ 3. For each prime p⩾ 11 such that p≡ 3 (mod 4) we construct a proper <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set with 3 p+ 1 points, and for each prime p⩾ 7 we construct a proper <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set with 3 p+ 2 points...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Regarding <b>double</b> <b>block</b> {{ballastless track}} as {{research}} subject, three mechanical models were established, which include steel bar and concrete interaction mechanical model, spatial finite element static model of <b>double</b> <b>block</b> ballastless track, train-double block ballastless track vertical coupling dynamics model. According to concrete and steel bar stress time-dependant curves under axial even temperature and shrinkage load, temperature grads load and train load, fatigue load spectrum under coupling loads {{was obtained by}} using rain-flow counting method. Based on steel bar and concrete S-N curve, and Palmgren-Miner linear fatigue damage accumulation rule, track concrete layer fatigue life predicting model of <b>double</b> <b>block</b> ballastless track was established. Taking Changsha climatic condition for an example, the fatigue life of <b>double</b> <b>block</b> ballastless track is predicted, {{and the effects of}} design parameters to fatigue life are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|As {{shown by}} the actual {{material}} analysis of offshore pipeline damage caused by strong earthquakes, the greatest damage is caused to complex assemblies such as branch connections, bends, and various joints. In the seismic resistance analysis of the offshore pipeline a fixed junction of an offshore pipeline section with a <b>block</b> <b>valve</b> station is modeled. To assess the connection assembly for seismic resistance, a number of accelerograms with descriptions of magnitude 8 and 9 earthquakes in the Black Sea region were considered. The calculations have revealed significant pipe wall stresses in the offshore pipeline/block valve station junction. The resulting conclusion is that offshore pipeline <b>block</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{security}} of <b>double</b> <b>block</b> length hash functions with rate 1, {{which are based on}} a block cipher with a block length of n bits and a key length of 2 n bits, is reconsidered. Counter-examples and new attacks are presented on this general class of fast <b>double</b> <b>block</b> length hash functions, which reveal unnoticed flaws in the necessary conditions given by Satoh et al. and Hirose. Preimage and second preimage attacks are presented on Hirose’s two examples which were left as an open problem. Our synthetic analysis show that all rate- 1 hash functions in FDBL-II are failed to be optimally (second) preimage resistant. The necessary conditions are refined for ensuring a subclass of hash functions in FDBL-II to be optimally secure against collision attacks. In particular, one of Hirose’s two examples, which satisfies our refined conditions, is proven to be indifferentiable from a random oracle in the ideal cipher model. The security results are extended to a new class of <b>double</b> <b>block</b> length hash functions with rate 1, where the key length of one block cipher used in the compression function is equal to the block length, whereas the other is doubled.
