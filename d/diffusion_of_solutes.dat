In contrast to dialysis, which works on the principle of the size related <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>solutes</b> and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semi-permeable membrane, the purification with nanoparticles allows specific targeting of substances.

50|$|Water removal {{is based}} on the natural and {{non-destructive}} phenomenon of osmosis across cell membranes. The driving force for the diffusion of water from the tissue into the solution is provided by the higher osmotic pressure of the hyper-tonic solution. The diffusion of water is accompanied by the simultaneous counter <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>solutes</b> from the osmotic solution into the tissue. Since the cell membrane responsible for osmotic transport is not perfectly selective, solutes present in the cells (organic acids, reducing sugars, minerals, flavors and pigment compounds) can also be leached into the osmotic solution, which affect the organoleptic and nutritional characteristics of the product.|$|E
50|$|Phloem loading is {{the process}} of loading carbon into the phloem for {{transport}} to different 'sinks' in a plant. Sinks include metabolism, growth, storage, and other processes or organs that need carbon solutes to persist. It can be a passive process, relying on a pressure gradient to generate <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>solutes</b> through the symplast, or an active process, requiring energy to create membrane-bound transporter proteins that move solutes through the apoplast against a gradient. Passive phloem loading transports solutes freely through plasmodesma in the symplast of the minor veins of leaves. Active transport occurs apoplastically and does not use plasmodesmata. An intermediate type of loading exists that uses symplastic transport but utilizes a size-exclusion mechanism to ensure diffusion is a one-way process between the mesophyll and phloem cells. This process is referred to as polymer-trapping, in which simple solutes such as sucrose are synthesized into larger molecules such as stachyose or raffinose in intermediary cells. The larger molecules cannot diffuse back to the mesophyll but can move into the phloem's sieve cells. Therefore, the synthesis of larger compounds uses energy and is thus 'active' but this strategy does not require specialized proteins and can still move symplastically.|$|E

5000|$|In the Hittorf method, {{electrolysis}} {{is carried}} out in a cell with three compartments: anode, central, and cathode. Measurement of the concentration changes in the anode and cathode compartments determines the transport numbers. The exact relationship depends {{on the nature of}} the reactions at the two electrodes. For the electrolysis of aqueous copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) as an example, with Cu2+(aq) and SO(aq) ions, the cathode reaction is the reduction Cu2+(aq) + 2 e− → Cu(s) and the anode reaction is the corresponding oxidation of Cu to Cu2+. At the cathode, the passage of [...] coulombs of electricity leads to the reduction of [...] moles of Cu2+, where [...] is the Faraday constant. Since the Cu2+ ions carry a fraction t+ of the current, the quantity of Cu2+ flowing into the cathode compartment is t+ moles, so there is a net decrease of Cu2+ in the cathode compartment equal to (1-t+) = t-. This decrease may be measured by chemical analysis in order to evaluate the transport numbers. Analysis of the anode compartment gives a second pair of values as a check, while there should be no change of concentrations in the central compartment unless <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>solutes</b> has led to significant mixing during the time of the experiment and invalidated the results.|$|E
50|$|Dialysis {{works on}} the {{principles}} of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>solutes</b> and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semi-permeable membrane. Diffusion is a property of substances in water; substances in water tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Blood flows by one side of a semi-permeable membrane, and a dialysate, or special dialysis fluid, flows by the opposite side. A semipermeable membrane is a thin layer of material that contains holes of various sizes, or pores. Smaller solutes and fluid pass through the membrane, but the membrane blocks the passage of larger substances (for example, red blood cells, large proteins). This replicates the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys, when the blood enters the kidneys and the larger substances are separated from the smaller ones in the glomerulus.The two main types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, remove wastes and excess water from the blood in different ways. Hemodialysis removes wastes and water by circulating blood outside the body through an external filter, called a dialyzer, that contains a semipermeable membrane. The blood flows in one direction and the dialysate flows in the opposite. The counter-current flow of the blood and dialysate maximizes the concentration gradient of solutes between the blood and dialysate, which helps to remove more urea and creatinine from the blood. The concentrations of solutes (for example potassium, phosphorus, and urea) are undesirably high in the blood, but low or absent in the dialysis solution, and constant replacement of the dialysate ensures that the concentration of undesired solutes is kept low {{on this side of the}} membrane. The dialysis solution has levels of minerals like potassium and calcium that are similar to their natural concentration in healthy blood. For another solute, bicarbonate, dialysis solution level is set at a slightly higher level than in normal blood, to encourage diffusion of bicarbonate into the blood, to act as a pH buffer to neutralize the metabolic acidosis that is often present in these patients. The levels of the components of dialysate are typically prescribed by a nephrologist according to the needs of the individual patient.|$|E

In several polymer systems, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>solutes</b> largelydepends on the microstructure within the material. The aim of this work was to establish how the diffusion ofsolutes is affected by the microstructure of dairy systems. Diffusion measurements were carried out using thetechnique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Diffusion coefficients of a range of 8 fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC) –dextrans (molecular weights from 4 to 2000 kDa) were measured in dairy systems. Thesesystems had the same casein concentration (130 g kg− 1) and water activity but their microstructure had beenaltered by different treatments: heat-treatment and rennet-induced coagulation. Microstructural parametersof these systems were estimated by the image analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs. The results showed that the <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>solutes</b> was affected by the microstructure of dairy systems. Theapplication of heat-treatment hindered the diffusion of all solutes (irrespective of molecular weight), whereasrennet coagulation only increased the diffusion of the larger solute molecules (N 20 kDa). At the microscopicscale, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>solutes</b> in dairy systems was mainly explained by both the pore size within the structureand by the interface area between the solutemolecules and the surroundingmatrix.

The dragging force that the core impurities exert on the moving kink soliton is determined by computer simulation <b>of</b> diffusing <b>of</b> <b>solute</b> atoms in dislocation core. The soliton motion can be dissolves into two kinds of movement: the changing of soliton position and soliton shape.
