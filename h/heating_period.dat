40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Heat</b> <b>periods</b> {{during recent}} years were {{associated}} with excess hospitalization and mortality rates, especially in the elderly. We intended to study whether prolonged warmth/heat periods are {{associated with an increased}} prevalence of disorders of serum sodium and potassium and an increased hospital mortality. METHODS: In this cross-sectional analysis all patients admitted to the Department of Emergency Medicine of a large tertiary care facility between January 2009 and December 2010 with measurements of serum sodium were included. Demographic data along with detailed data on diuretic medication, length of hospital stay and hospital mortality were obtained for all patients. Data on daily temperatures (maximum, mean, minimum) and humidity were retrieved by Meteo Swiss. RESULTS: A total of 22. 239 patients were included in the study. 5 periods with a temperature exceeding 25 °C for 3 to 5 days were noticed and 2 periods with temperatures exceeding 25 °C for more than 5 days were noted. Additionally, 2 periods with 3 to 5 days with daily temperatures exceeding 30 °C were noted during the study period. We found a significantly increased prevalence of hyponatremia during <b>heat</b> <b>periods.</b> However, in the Cox regression analysis, prolonged heat was not associated with the prevalence of disorders of serum sodium or potassium. Admission during a <b>heat</b> <b>period</b> was an independent predictor for hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although we found an increased prevalence of hyponatremia during <b>heat</b> <b>periods,</b> no convincing connection could be found for hypernatremia or disorders of serum potassium...|$|R

50|$|Upset welding (UW)/resistance {{butt welding}} is a welding {{technique}} that produces coalescence simultaneously {{over the entire}} area of abutting surfaces or progressively along a joint, by the heat obtained from resistance to electric current through the area where those surfaces are in contact..Pressure is applied before heating is started and is maintained throughout the <b>heating</b> <b>period.</b> The equipment used for upset welding {{is very similar to}} that used for flash welding. It can be used only if the parts to be welded are equal in cross-sectional area. The abutting surfaces must be very carefully prepared to provide for proper heating.The difference from flash welding is that the parts are clamped in the welding machine and force is applied bringing them tightly together. High-amperage current is then passed through the joint, which heats the abutting surfaces. When they have been heated to a suitable forging temperature an upsetting force is applied and the current is stopped. The high temperature of the work at the abutting surfaces plus the high pressure causes coalescence to take place. After cooling, the force is released and the weld is completed.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the tensile property of laminated epoxy resin composites reinforced by carbon fiber plain woven fabric with different <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time at relatively high temperature. For this purpose, the tensile tests of laminated resin composites are carried out at 150 °C and 180 °C with 15 minutes, 10 hours and 30 hours <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time, respectively. The reasons for the variations of tensile property of these composites with different <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time at 150 °C and 180 °C are analyzed. At 150 °C and 180 °C，with <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time increasing the tensile strength of samples keep the same level. However at 180 °C the average tensile strength of samples is decreased by 14. 95 % compared with that at 150 °C and the variation coefficient (CV) of tensile strengths at 180 °C is much more than that at 150 °C. These show that the tensile strength of resin laminated composites is sensitive at high temperature, although the tensile strength of resin laminated composites keeps the same level at same temperature with different <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time. The reason of the tensile strength of resin laminated composites decreased at high temperature is that resin has been damaged，which losing the adhesion of fiber and resin, so that these make resin and fiber can not bear the tensile load together.
