Sophia Hapgood, an old co-worker of Indiana Jones who gave up her archaeological career to become a psychic, supports him along the journey. The two partners are pursued by the Nazis who seek to use the power of Atlantis for warfare, and serve as the adventure's antagonists. The story was written by Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein, the game's designers, who had rejected the original plan to base it on an unused movie script. They came up with the final concept while researching real-world sources for a suitable plot device.|$|E

In order to improve GSO’s local searching ability while maintaining its merit in <b>global</b> <b>searching,</b> we have proposed an improved GSO, group search optimizer with intraspecific competition and lévy walk (GSOICLW) [8], incorporating intraspecific competition (IC) [9] and lévy walk (LW) [10] into the GSO model.

25|$|An {{alternative}} method of structural learning uses optimization based search. It requires a scoring function and a search strategy. A common scoring function is posterior probability {{of the structure}} given the training data, like the BIC or the BDeu. The time requirement of an exhaustive search returning a structure that maximizes the score is superexponential {{in the number of}} variables. A local search strategy makes incremental changes aimed at improving the score of the structure. A <b>global</b> <b>search</b> algorithm like Markov chain Monte Carlo can avoid getting trapped in local minima. Friedman et al. discuss using mutual information between variables and finding a structure that maximizes this. They do this by restricting the parent candidate set to k nodes and exhaustively searching therein.|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, many {{researchers}} {{have been interested in}} algorithms inspired by the observation of natural phenomena to solve optimization problems. Among them, meta-heuristic algorithms have been extensively applied in continuous (real) and discrete (binary) search spaces. Such algorithms are appropriate for <b>global</b> <b>searches</b> because of their global exploration and local exploitation abilities. In this study, a memetic binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) scheme is introduced based on hybrid local and <b>global</b> <b>searches</b> in BPSO. The algorithm, binary hybrid topology particle swarm optimization (BHTPSO), is used to solve the optimization problems in the binary search spaces. In addition, a variant of the proposed algorithm, binary hybrid topology particle swarm optimization quadratic interpolation (BHTPSO-QI), is proposed to enhance the <b>global</b> <b>searching</b> capability. These algorithms are tested on two set of problems in the binary search space. Several nonlinear high-dimension functions and benchmarks for the 0 - 1 multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) are employed to evaluate their performances. Their results are compared with some well-known modified binary PSO and binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA). The experimental results showed that the proposed methods improve the performance of BPSO in terms of convergence speed and solution accuracy...|$|R

This latter feature is new and is considered a major upgrade compared to the existing Cospas-Sarsat system, which does not provide feedback to the user. Tests in February 2014 found that for Galileo's search and rescue function, operating as part of the existing International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, 77% of simulated distress locations can be pinpointed within 2km, and 95% within 5km.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A dynamic sensor {{deployment}} {{strategy for}} heterogeneous mobile {{wireless sensor networks}} is proposed, so-called virtual force-directed differential evolution algorithm (VFDE). To ensure efficient coverage of networks, VFDE combines the virtual force (VF) with differential evolution algorithm (DE), where the position vector of each population is updated according to not only the historical local and global optimal solutions but also the virtual forces of sensor nodes. The key motivation of this strategy {{is to use the}} virtual force to direct the updating of DE for improving the convergence speed, and DE is used to enhance the <b>global</b> <b>searching</b> ability. Simulation results show that VFDE has better performance on regional convergence and <b>global</b> <b>searching</b> than VF algorithm and DE algorithm, and it can implement dynamic heterogeneous mobile sensor deployment efficiently and rapidly...|$|R
3000|$|The {{original}} idea of ABC algorithm is to perform hierarchical optimization. Overall, <b>global</b> <b>searching</b> is performed by EB and local searching is implemented by OB. However, {{this idea is}} not prominent in traditional ABC algorithms, because the modifying extent of EB and OB is similar and relatively fixed. Dynamic modifying extent is more reasonable. To achieve more effective optimization, the activity of bees must be dynamic in different stages of the algorithm. Our idea is that <b>global</b> <b>searching</b> should be dominant in early cycles and local searching should be primary in the posterior cycles. This could be more consistent with actions of real bees: EB become main force in the initial, then more and more OB follow, they play the major role afterwards. Specifically, in early stages of optimization, audaciously modify more elements of [...]...|$|R

The Start menu search also doubles as the Run command from previous versions of Windows; simply typing any command will execute it. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu.|$|E

However, this work has been subject to much criticism by quantum chemists as {{it was concluded that}} the predicted Ih symmetric structure was vibrationally unstable and the resulting cage undergoes a spontaneous symmetry break, yielding a puckered cage with rare Th symmetry (symmetry of a volleyball). The number of six-member rings in this molecule is 20 and number of five-member rings is 12. There is an additional atom {{in the center of each}} six-member ring, bonded to each atom surrounding it. By employing a systematic <b>global</b> <b>search</b> algorithm, later it was found that the previously proposed B80 fullerene is not global minimum for 80 atom boron clusters and hence can not be found in nature. In the same paper by Sandip De et al., it was concluded that boron's energy landscape is significantly different from other fullerenes already found in nature hence pure boron fullerenes are unlikely to exist in nature.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Magnesium (Mg 2 +) is {{essential}} for cellular growth {{and the maintenance of}} normal cellular processes. Teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) is a newly developed population-based meta-heuristic algorithm. It has better <b>global</b> <b>searching</b> capability but it also easily got stuck on local optima when solving global optimization problems. This paper develops a new variant of TLBO, called teaching learning based optimization with global crossover (TLBO-GC), for improving the performance of TLBO. In teaching phase, a perturbed scheme is proposed to prevent the current best solution from getting trapped in local minima. And a new global crossover strategy is incorporated into the learning phase, which aims at balancing local and <b>global</b> <b>searching</b> effectively. The performance of TLBO-GC is assessed by solving global optimization functions with different characteristics. Compared to the TLBO, several modified TLBOs and other promising heuristic methods, numerical results reveal that the TLBO-GC has better optimization performance...|$|R
