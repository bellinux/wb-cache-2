Sam discovers {{that the only way to}} learn about Jill is to get transferred to Information Retrieval, where he can access her classified records. He had previously turned down a promotion arranged by his mother, Ida, who is obsessed with the rejuvenating plastic surgery of cosmetic surgeon Dr. Jaffe. Sam retracts his refusal by speaking with Deputy Minister Mr. Helpmann at a party hosted by Ida. Obtaining Jill's records, Sam tracks her down before she can be arrested, then falsifies the records to fake her death, allowing her to escape pursuit. The two share a romantic night together, but are soon apprehended by the government at gunpoint. Charged with treason for abusing his new position, Sam is restrained to a chair in a large, empty cylindrical room, to be tortured by his old friend, Jack Lint. Sam learns that Jill was killed while resisting arrest.|$|E
2500|$|Dowsing {{as practiced}} today may have {{originated}} in Germany during the 15th century, {{when it was}} used in attempts to find metals. As early as 1518 Martin Luther listed dowsing for metals as an act that broke the first commandment (i.e., as occultism). The 1550 edition of Sebastian Münster's Cosmographia contains a woodcut of a <b>dowser</b> with forked rod in hand walking over a cutaway image of a mining operation. The rod is labelled [...] "Virgula Divina – Glück rüt" [...] (Latin: divine rod; German [...] "Wünschelrute": fortune rod or stick), {{but there is no}} text accompanying the woodcut. By 1556 Georgius Agricola's treatment of mining and smelting of ore, De Re Metallica, included a detailed description of dowsing for metal ore.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, {{the most}} common dowsing rod is a forked (Y-shaped) branch from a tree or bush. Some dowsers prefer {{branches}} from particular trees, and some prefer the branches to be freshly cut. Hazel twigs in Europe and witch-hazel in the United States are traditionally commonly chosen, as are branches from willow or peach trees. The two ends on the forked side are held one in each hand with the third (the stem of the Y) pointing straight ahead. Often the branches are grasped palms down. The <b>dowser</b> then walks slowly over the places where he suspects the target (for example, minerals or water) may be, and the dowsing rod dips, inclines or twitches when a discovery is made. This method is sometimes known as [...] "willow witching".|$|E

2500|$|A 1990 {{double-blind}} study was undertaken in Kassel, Germany, {{under the direction}} of the Gesellschaft zur Wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften (Society for the Scientific Investigation of the Parasciences). James Randi offered a US$10,000 prize to any successful <b>dowser.</b> The three-day test of some 30 dowsers involved plastic pipes through which water flow could be controlled and directed. The pipes were buried [...] under a level field, the position of each marked on the surface with a colored strip. The dowsers had to tell whether water was running through each pipe. All the dowsers signed a statement agreeing this was a fair test of their abilities and that they expected a 100 percent success rate. However, the results were no better than chance, thus no one was awarded the prize.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1987–88 {{study in}} Munich by Hans-Dieter Betz and other scientists, 500 dowsers were {{initially}} tested for their skill, and the experimenters selected the best 43 among them for further tests. Water was pumped through a pipe {{on the ground}} floor of a two-storey barn. Before each test, the pipe was moved in a direction perpendicular to the water flow. On the upper floor, each <b>dowser</b> was asked to determine the position of the pipe. Over two years, the dowsers performed 843 such tests and, of the 43 pre-selected and extensively tested candidates, at least 37 showed no dowsing ability. The results from the remaining 6 were said to be better than chance, resulting in the experimenters' conclusion that some dowsers [...] "in particular tasks, showed an extraordinarily high rate of success, which can scarcely if at all be explained as due to chance... a real core of dowser-phenomena can be regarded as empirically proven." ...|$|E
2500|$|Five {{years after}} the Munich study was published, Jim T. Enright, a {{professor}} of physiology who emphasised correct data analysis procedure, contended that the study's results are merely consistent with statistical fluctuations and not significant. He believed the experiments provided [...] "the most convincing disproof imaginable that dowsers can do what they claim", stating that the data analysis was [...] "special, unconventional and customized". Replacing it with [...] "more ordinary analyses", {{he noted that the}} best <b>dowser</b> was on average [...] out of [...] closer to a mid-line guess, an advantage of 0.04%, and that the five other [...] "good" [...] dowsers were on average farther than a mid-line guess. Enright emphasized that the experimenters should have decided beforehand how to statistically analyze the results; if they only afterward chose the statistical analysis that showed the greatest success, then their conclusions would not be valid until replicated by another test analyzed by the same method. He further pointed out that the six [...] "good" [...] dowsers did not perform any better than chance in separate tests. Another study published in Pathophysiology hypothesized that such experiments as this one that were carried out in the 20th century could have been interfered with by man-made radio frequency radiation, as test subjects' bodies absorbed the radio waves and unconscious hand movement reactions took place following the standing waves or intensity variations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- We {{set up a}} rigidly controlled, {{double-blind}} dowsing {{experiment with}} three repetitions to test whether <b>dowsers</b> are able to extract information out of a system in an unconventional way. One hundred and four professional and lay <b>dowsers</b> had to distinguish between randomly distributed, sealed and indistinguishable probes of pure mineral water or parathione, using a one-hand dowsing rod. The subjects were unable, on the whole, to distinguish be-tween the probes better than chance. Performance was significantly nega-tively correlated with paranormal beliefs. Subjects instructed by one among three blinded experimenters were able {{to distinguish between the}} probes sig-nificantly better than chance. As we have excluded any conceivable way of leakage of relevant information, we conclude that we found a non-classical experimenter effect. 1...|$|R
60|$|As the divining-rod is {{the only}} {{instance}} in which automatism, whatever its nature and causes, has been found of practical value by practical men, and as it is obviously associated {{with a number of}} analogous phenomena, both in civilised and savage life, it certainly deserves the attention of science. But no advance will be made till scientifically trained inquirers themselves arrange and test a large number of experiments. Knowledge of the geological ignorance of the <b>dowsers,</b> examples of fraud on their part, and cases of failure or reported failure, with a general hostile bias, may prevent such experiments from being made by scientific experts on an adequate scale. Such experts ought, of course, to avoid working the <b>dowsers</b> into a state of irritation.|$|R
2500|$|Dawkins now {{describes}} {{the history of}} scientific knowledge of echolocation, {{and points to the}} cumulative build-up of corroborating evidence for scientific explanations of the phenomena. He visits psychologist Chris French, who is performing a double-blind test of dowsing. None of the <b>dowsers</b> perform better, in a statistically significant sense, than is expectable by chance alone. While the <b>dowsers</b> are surprised, Dawkins and French note that their confidence is untouched, and they prefer explanations (French states some may call them excuses) that retain the hypothesis that they have paranormal dowsing powers. Dawkins next attempts his own explanation of belief in the paranormal in a combination of evolutionary and psychological terms, saying: [...] "we don’t want to believe things just happen", and he suggests superstition is just the sort of animal error committed by Skinner’s pigeons.|$|R
