5|$|Overfishing is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna. Overfishing {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed.

5|$|The {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a closed binary star system. The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence, and it expands to form a red giant. The two stars now share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink. The giant star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> continue nuclear fusion. At this point it becomes a white dwarf star, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen. Eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant. Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in mass. Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model, the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event are still unclear.|$|E

50|$|A lion {{falls in}} love with a peasant's {{daughter}} and asks the father's permission to marry her. Unwilling to refuse outright, the man sets the condition that the animal should first have its claws clipped and its teeth filed.

25|$|Not all {{of these}} words are stably masculine. Native English speakers, among others, tend to treat kuzo (acousin) and amiko (afriend) as gender-neutral, and nepo (agrandson/grandchild), bubo (abrat), and koko (arooster/chicken) are often {{ambiguous}} as well. Once such a word is used ambiguously by {{a significant number of}} speakers or writers, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be assumed to be masculine. Language guides suggest using all ambiguous words neutrally, and many people find this the least confusing approach—and so the ranks of masculine words gradually dwindle.|$|E

25|$|ACE inhibitors can induce angioedema. ACE inhibitors {{block the}} enzyme ACE so <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> degrade {{bradykinin}}; thus, bradykinin accumulates and causes angioedema. This complication appears {{more common in}} African-Americans. In people with ACE inhibitor angioedema, the drug needs to be discontinued and an alternative treatment needs to be found, such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) which has a similar mechanism but does not affect bradykinin. However, this is controversial, as small studies have shown some patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema can develop it with ARBs, as well.|$|E
25|$|As in all mercury-based {{gas-filled}} tubes, {{mercury is}} slowly adsorbed onto the glass, phosphor, and tube electrodes throughout {{the life of}} the lamp, until <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> function. Loss of mercury will take over from failure of the phosphor in some lamps. The failure symptoms are similar, except loss of mercury initially causes an extended run-up time to full light output, and finally causes the lamp to glow a dim pink when the mercury runs out and the argon base gas takes over as the primary discharge.|$|E
25|$|Adiabatic cooling {{occurs when}} {{one or more}} of three {{possible}} lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. If the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, it normally sheds vapor <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> retain, which condenses into cloud. Water vapor in saturated air is normally attracted to condensation nuclei such as dust and salt particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.|$|E

25|$|Normal {{end plate}} {{function}} can be blocked by two mechanisms. Nondepolarizing agents, such as tubocurarine, block the agonist, acetylcholine, from binding to nicotinic receptors and activating them, thereby preventing depolarization. Alternatively, depolarizing agents, such as succinylcholine, are nicotinic receptor agonists which mimic Ach, block muscle contraction by depolarizing {{to such an}} extent that it desensitizes the receptor and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> initiate an action potential and cause muscle contraction. Both of these classes of neuromuscular blocking drugs are structurally similar to acetylcholine, the endogenous ligand, in many cases containing two acetylcholine molecules linked end-to-end by a rigid carbon ring system, as in pancuronium (a nondepolarizing agent).|$|E
25|$|As seen above, {{voters in}} an STV {{election}} rank candidates on a preferential ballot. STV systems {{in use in}} different countries vary both as to ballot design and {{to whether or not}} voters are obliged to provide a full list of preferences. In jurisdictions such as the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland voters are permitted to rank as many or as few candidates as they wish. Consequently, voters sometimes, for example, rank only the candidates of a single party, or of their most preferred parties. A minority of voters, especially if they do not fully understand the system, might even 'bullet vote', only expressing a first preference. Allowing voters to rank only as many candidates as they wish grants them greater freedom, but can also lead to some voters ranking so few candidates that their vote eventually becomes 'exhausted'; that is, at a certain point during the count <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be transferred and therefore loses an opportunity to influence the result.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatics {{ultimately}} drain {{into the}} bloodstream, so the plague bacteria may enter {{the blood and}} travel to almost {{any part of the}} body. In septicemic plague, bacterial endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischaemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent. People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.|$|E

2500|$|All cells {{contain the}} enzyme hexokinase, which catalyzes the {{conversion}} of glucose that has entered the cell into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P).
