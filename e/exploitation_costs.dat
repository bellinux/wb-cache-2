40|$|Ever stricter {{emission}} regulations stimulate vessel {{owners to}} consider the adoption of alternative marine fuels, such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). In deciding whether to invest in LNG-fueled vessels, initial investment and operating costs are decisive factors {{that have not yet}} been fully studied in the literature. In this paper, we present a new investment appraisal method to compare the costs of LNG-fueled vessels with conventional vessels. We analyze the fuel costs and overall <b>exploitation</b> <b>costs</b> by simulating bunker planning decisions under stochastic fuel prices, presence in emission controlled areas, and route lengths. Our analyses reveal that the fuel costs of LNG-fueled vessels are often lower than those of conventional vessels, even under unfavorable LNG prices. Due to the higher initial investment costs in LNG-fueled vessels, these fuel cost reductions do not always translate into lower overall <b>exploitation</b> <b>costs.</b> By conducting numerical experiments, we identified conditions under which the <b>exploitation</b> <b>costs</b> of LNG-fueled vessels are lower than conventional vessels...|$|E

40|$|When {{selecting}} a resource to exploit, an insect colony {{must take into}} account at least two constraints: the resource must be abundant enough to sustain the whole group, but not too large to limit <b>exploitation</b> <b>costs,</b> and risks of conflicts with other colonies.

The present paper definitely demonstrates the good attitude of the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff (NYT) {{for the production of}} lightweight expanded aggregates (LEA) with bulk densities ranging between 0. 9 and 1. 1 g/cm(3). LEAs showing these features, usually manufactured with clays, are mainly used in the production of lightweight structural concretes (LSC).

40|$|This article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of a methodology for building dynamical electronic systems. As an example {{a part of a}} system for epileptic seizure prediction is used, which monitors EEG signals and continuously calculates the largest short-term Lyapunov exponents. In dynamical electronic systems, the cost of exploitation, for instance energy consumption, may vary substantially with the values of input signals. In addition, the functions describing the variations are not known at the time the system is designed. As a result, the architecture of the system must accommodate for the worst case <b>exploitation</b> <b>costs,</b> which rapidly exceed the available resources (for instance battery life) when accumulated over time. The presented system scenario methodology solves these challenges by identifying at design time groups of possible <b>exploitation</b> <b>costs,</b> called system scenarios, and implementing a mechanism to detect system scenarios at run time and re-configure the system to cost-efficiently accommodate them. During reconfiguration, the optimized system architecture settings for the active system scenario are selected and the total exploitation cost is reduced. When the dynamic behavior is due to input data variables with a large number of possible values, current techniques for bottom-up scenario identification and detection becomes too complex. A new top-down technique, based on polygonal regions, is presented in this paper. The results for the example system indicate that with 10 system scenarios the average energy consumption of the system can be reduced by 28 % and brought within 5 % of the theoretically best solution...|$|E

One of the research fields that benefits from it the most is the aircrafts positioning and collision avoidance. Light cameras with low energy consumption are an ideal solution for UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) navigation systems. With the new Swedish law – unique to Europe, that allows for civil usage of UAVs that fly on altitudes up to 120 meters, the need for reliable and cheap positioning systems became even more dire. In this thesis two possible solutions for positioning problem and one for collision avoidance were proposed and analyzed. Possibility of tracking the vehicles position both from ground and from air was exploited. Camera setup for successful positioning and collision avoidance systems was defined and preliminary results for of the systems performance were presented.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the technical and economic feasibility of an alternative energy system in which the urban water system functions as a source for sustainable energy supply. It is demonstrated that aquifer thermal energy storage supplemented with surface water heat collection in summer, yields sufficient heat to compensate total heat demand of a residential district. Using the urban water system as energy source makes natural gas supply obsolete, provides a CO 2 reduction of 60 % and is preferable in terms of costs compared to conventional gas based central heating installations. The feasibility of the urban groundwater system, urban surface water system, and the economic feasibility are determined in this paper. The local groundwater feasibility to supply the design discharge is determined by soil and aquifer characteristics from the national groundwater database, reference projects, and bore-hole data. A heat balance model is used to quantify effects on the water system. Internal rate of return calculation for the investments and full lifetime <b>exploitation</b> <b>costs</b> are used to determine the economic feasibility of the concept. In summer, there is a net water temperature decrease of 1. 5 - 1. 6 °C. Water quality and ecological improvement take place because a lower temperature results in increasing oxygen content.

It is accounts for {{the contributions of the}} six main phases of their life-cycle: concept definition, design and development, manufacturing, installation, exploitation and dismantling, the costs of which have been defined. Moreover, the energy produced is also taken into account to calculate the Levelized Cost of Energy of a floating offshore renewable energy farm. The methodology proposed has been applied to two renewable energy devices: a floating offshore wave energy device and a floating offshore wind energy device. Two locations have been considered: Aguçadoura and São Pedro de Moel, both in Portugal. Results indicate that the most important cost in terms of the life-cycle of a floating offshore renewable energy farm is the <b>exploitation</b> <b>cost,</b> followed by the manufacturing and the installation cost. In addition, the best area in terms of costs is the same independently of the type of floating offshore renewable energy considered: Aguçadoura. However, the results in terms of Levelized Cost of Energy are different: Aguçadoura is better when considering wave energy technology and the São Pedro de Moel region is the best option when considering floating wind energy technology. The method proposed aims to give a direct approach to calculate the main life-cycle cost of a floating offshore renewable energy farm.

The removal {{efficiency of}} ammonia-nitrogen, phosphorus and CODCr was highest under the velocity of 12 BV/h. Penetrates capacity of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus were 4. 04 mg/g and 0. 14 mg/g, penetrates volume were 29 BV and 58 BV, respectively. China, by far the world's biggest producer of pork, is home to about half the world's porcine population with 460 million pigs [1 - 2]. In recent years, Though China's pig industry is developing rapidly, a large amount of wastewater from piggery farm is mostly discharged directly without appropriate recycle and treatment [3 - 4], which can bring about a serious pollution to the environment [5 - 6]. The domestic and foreign research shows that anaerobic digestion is an effective way of the swine wastewater treatment.
