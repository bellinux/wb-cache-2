50|$|This dendronotid nudibranch is {{translucent}} {{white with}} dark red {{spots on the}} ceratal tubercles. The digestive <b>gland</b> <b>inside</b> the cerata is bright rose-red in colour. Its body size attains 12 mm.|$|R
50|$|An intralobular duct is {{the portion}} of an exocrine <b>gland</b> <b>inside</b> a lobule, leading {{directly}} from acinus to interlobular duct. It is composed of two subdivisions, the intercalated duct and the striated duct.|$|R
50|$|This dendronotid nudibranch is {{transparent}} with no pigment {{apart from}} a few white glands in the rhinophore sheaths and rhinophores. The cerata have rather pointed tubercles and are also transparent with snow white digestive <b>gland</b> <b>inside</b> them.|$|R
5000|$|Saliva stagnates {{and forms}} a mucus plug behind the {{stricture}} during sleep when the salivary {{output of the}} parotid is reduced. Then, when salivary secretion is stimulated, the mucus plug becomes stuck in the stricture. [...] The backlog of saliva behind the blockage causes the swelling, and the increased pressure <b>inside</b> the <b>gland</b> causes the pain. When the mucus plug is dislodged, the built up saliva is released and the swelling subsides.|$|R
50|$|This dendronotid nudibranch is {{transparent}} {{white with}} small spots and patches of black {{scattered on the}} back and sides of the body. The typical Doto cerata have moderately elongate tubercles which each have a black spot at the tip. The digestive <b>gland</b> <b>inside</b> the cerata is a pink cream colour.|$|R
50|$|A {{stuffing}} box of a sailboat {{will have a}} stern tube that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have packing nut threads or a gland nut. The packing is <b>inside</b> the <b>gland</b> nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing {{and put in the}} gland nut. Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. Stuffing box components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.|$|R
5|$|In caecilians, {{fertilisation}} is internal, {{the male}} extruding an intromittent organ, the phallodeum, and inserting {{it into the}} female cloaca. The paired Müllerian <b>glands</b> <b>inside</b> the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably {{takes place in the}} oviduct.|$|R
50|$|The body is colourless, but the cerata are {{coloured}} due to {{the digestive}} <b>glands</b> <b>inside</b> them. The colour of the digestive gland can be creamy yellow to orange-red to brown, depending on the colour of the hydroids that an individual specimen has been eating. Compared with Doto kya and Doto columbiana this species lacks any dark pigment on the body.|$|R
50|$|Lactation is {{also the}} {{hallmark}} of adenotrophic viviparity - a breeding mechanism developed by some insects, most notably tsetse flies. The single egg of the tse-tse develops into a larva inside the uterus where it is fed by a milky substance secreted by a milk <b>gland</b> <b>inside</b> the uterus. The cockroach species Diploptera punctata is also known to feed their offspring by milky secretions.|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of glycine in vitro into the silk glands of the silkworm has been studied. Glycine accumulates inside the tissue to a concentration {{higher than that}} present outside, indicating an active transport mechanism. The kinetics of uptake show a biphasic curve and two apparent Km values for accumulation, 0. 33 mM and 5. 00 mM. The effect of inhibitors on the energy metabolism of glycine transport is inconclusive. Exchange studies indicate the existence of two pools <b>inside</b> the <b>gland,</b> one that is easily removed by exchange and osmotic shock, and the other which is not. The results obtained conform with the carrier model of Britten and McClure concerning the amino-acid pool in E. coli...|$|R
50|$|Sebaceous glands are skin glands {{that produce}} oil and are mostly {{found in the}} skin of the chin, {{at the base of the}} tail, and in the eyelids, lips, prepuce, and scrotum. They are {{connected}} to hair follicles. In acne, the follicles become clogged with black sebaceous material, forming comedones (also known as blackheads). Comedones can become irritated, swollen, infected, and ultimately pustules. These may elicit itching and discomfort due to swelling and bacterial growth <b>inside</b> infected <b>glands.</b> Cats may continue to scratch and reopen wounds, allowing bacterial infections to grow worse. Bacterial folliculitis occurs when follicules become infected with Staphylococcus aureus, and commonly associated with moderate-to-severe feline acne. Secondary fungal infections (species malassezia) may also occur.|$|R
5|$|The fossa {{has several}} scent glands, {{although}} the glands are less developed in females.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interactions}} of insect societies {{are associated with}} chemical signals released by the exocrine glands that control some insect behaviors. Exocrine glands can be classified into different classes: class I release substances that cross the body cuticle and class III glands that have a conducting canal. This study compares the morphology of intramandibular and mandibular glands in virgin queens of different ages, {{as well as in}} nurses and forager workers of Melipona scutellaris. We have found the occurrence of two types of <b>glands</b> <b>inside</b> the mandible; <b>glands</b> of class I, corresponding to a well-developed epithelium, secretory only in virgin queens, and glands of class III. On the other hand, mandibular glands {{have been found to be}} well-developed in workers and queens and they also have high amounts of mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Together, these data show that the mandibular and intramandibular glands of M. scutellaris virgin queens have morphological features that indicate the synthesis of compounds that are lipid in nature. Furthermore, both glands have a similar developmental degree in newly emerged and 7 -day-old ones...|$|R

40|$|The {{swordfish}} is reputedly {{the fastest}} swimmer on Earth. The concave head and iconic sword are unique characteristics, but how {{they contribute to}} its speed is still unknown. Recent computed tomography scans revealed a poorly mineralised area near {{the base of the}} rostrum. Here we report, using magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy scanning, the discovery of a complex organ consisting of an oil-producing gland connected to capillaries that communicate with oil-excreting pores in the skin of the head. The capillary vessels transport oil to abundant tiny circular pores that are surrounded by denticles. The oil is distributed from the pores over the front part of the head. The oil <b>inside</b> the <b>gland</b> is identical to that found on the skin and is a mixture of methyl esters. We hypothesize that the oil layer, in combination with the denticles, creates a super-hydrophobic layer that reduces streamwise friction drag and increases swimming efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} and ultrastructure of the convoluted <b>gland</b> <b>inside</b> {{the venom}} reservoir of four species of social Vespidae are described. The {{cells of the}} venom gland (including the convoluted gland) {{can be divided into}} six groups: (1) epithelial cells, (2) glandular cells with the end apparatus secreting into the tubule <b>inside</b> the convoluted <b>gland</b> (internal or embedded tubule), (3) a continuous arrangement of glandular cells with the end apparatus secreting directly into the venom reservoir, (4) glandular cells that are loosely dispersed along the tubule lumen between the free tubules and the embedded tubule of the convoluted gland, (5) secretory cells of the free tubules and (6) duct cells. One kind of secretory cell, hitherto unknown and described in this paper (group 3), is characterized by the presence of a well-developed end apparatus, usually with enlarged extracellular spaces, but lacking the normally associated duct cells. The secretory cells contain several stacks of granular endoplasmic reticulum, but these are mainly concentrated {{in the middle of the}} cell. The basal half of the cells contains many lipid droplets. Although the function of the convoluted gland is not yet understood, an hypothesis is related to what is known of the function of reservoir secretory cells in solitary wasps. All wasp species studied showed the same organization of the convoluted gland, which clearly distinguishes their venom gland from that of Sphecidae. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{other factor}} {{believed}} to be partly responsible for Malacosteus diet is its unique visual system, which uses a derivative of chlorophyll as a photosensitizer that absorbs long-wave light (around 700 nm) and then indirectly stimulates the fishs two visual pigments, which have maximum absorbances at only 520 and 540 nm. No vertebrates are known to synthesize chlorophyll derivatives, and Malacosteus is believed to obtain these derivatives from the copepods it consumes. The red photophore of Malacosteus consists of a pigmented sac with a reflective inner lining and an internal mass of <b>gland</b> cells. <b>Inside</b> the <b>gland</b> cells, blue-green light is produced via the same chemical reaction found in other stomiids, which is then absorbed by a protein that fluoresces in a broad red band. This light is then reflected out through the photophore apterture, where it passes through a brown filter, yielding a far-red light with a maximum absorbance at 708 nm (almost infra-red). In live fish, the suborbital and postorbital photophores both flash vigorously, the suborbital at a slower rate.|$|R
