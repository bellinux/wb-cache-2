40|$|Abstract—Image {{formation}} is traditionally {{described by a}} number of individual models, one for each specific effect in the image formation process. However, it is difficult to aggregate the effects by concatenating such individual models. In this paper, we apply light transport analysis to derive a unified image formation model that represents the radiance along a light ray as a 4 -D light field signal and physical phenomena such as lens refraction and blocking as linear transformations or modulations of the light field. This unified mathematical framework allows the entire image formation process to be elegantly described by a single equation. It also allows most geometric and photometric effects of imaging, including perspective transformation, defocus blur, and vignetting, to be represented in both 4 -D primal and dual domains. The result matches that of traditional models. Generalizations and applications of this theoretic framework are discussed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{formation}} of sporangial sori on laminarian blades depends both on environmental and endogenous factors. In nature, most laminarian species form sorus during the slow growth {{period of the}} blade. There is recent experimental evidence {{for the existence of}} sporulation inhibitors produced by the actively growing basal blade meristem, moving in distal direction and preventing sorus formation. Sorus may readily develop during the active growth phase on isolated blade discs or distally of transverse cuts in entire blades, probably due to isolation from the inhibitor stream. In nature, growth activity of the blade decreases due to an endogenous circannual rhythm, possibly decreasing the sporulation inhibitor concentration down to a critical level enabling sorus <b>formation.</b> <b>Light</b> and temperature demands of sporogenesis for Laminaria digitata were investigated using isolated blade discs. Optimal sporogenesis took place in photon fluence rates of 20 - 200 µmol m- 2 s- 1; while no induction was achieved in continuous darkness. Daylength had a modulating effect with a significant promotion of sorus size in long days. Fastest sporogenesis was achieved between 10 - 17 °C while optimal sporogenesis with biggest sori took place in low temperatures (1 - 10 °C).

Migrant entrepreneurship may be reactive – resulting from exclusion from mainstream economic life (Kloosterman and Rath 2001) – or proactive – for example, ‘middleman minority’ [sic] status may help individuals create business opportunities between social groups (Bonacich 1973). Entrepreneurs may also benefit from externalities of migrant enclaves, such as better access to information or finance (Edin et al. 2003). Skilled migrants are in a particularly strong position. Migration may positively select both highly skilled individuals – as noted above – and those with strong entrepreneurial abilities and motivation.

These emulsions were cooled to induce crystallization and form SLN suspensions. In the absence of fish oil, the SLN suspensions formed a gel after the emulsified tripalmitin crystallized, which was attributed to particle shape changes leading to aggregation and network <b>formation.</b> <b>Light</b> scattering and rheology measurements indicated that incorporation of fish oil into the lipid phase (≥ 10 wt %) increased the stability of SLN to aggregation.

The rate of α- to β-polymorphic transitions of tripalmitin increased with increasing fish oil content, and tripalmitin crystals formed appeared to be less ordered as evidence by a lower melting temperature. Results suggest that the phase behavior and morphology of tripalmitin crystals can be altered by mixing them with low melting lipids such as fish oil thereby improving the stability of SLN suspensions to particle aggregation and gelation.

Cutting rooting was closely related to carbohydrate content in cutting stems during the rooting process. Cutting carbohydrate status was positively influenced by leaf photosynthesis during rooting. Non saturating light exposure of leafy cuttings can contribute to improve photosynthetic activity of leafy cuttings. Collection of cuttings from different part of the mother shoots influenced rooting percentage and this appear related to the different capability to concentrate soluble sugars in the cutting stem during rooting.

40|$|Multiple {{epiphyseal}} dysplasia (MED) is {{a relatively}} common skeletal dysplasia that can present in childhood with a variable phenotype of short stature and pain and stiffness in the large joints, and often progresses to early-onset osteoarthritis in adulthood. Mutations in the matrilin- 3 gene (MATN 3) have recently been shown to underlie some forms of autosomal dominant MED. To date all MED mutations in matrilin- 3 cluster in the single A-domain, suggesting that they may disrupt the structure and/or function of this important domain. To {{determine the effects of}} MATN 3 mutations on the structure and function of matrilin- 3 we expressed both normal and mutant matrilin- 3 in mammalian cells. Wild-type (wt) matrilin- 3 was efficiently secreted into conditioned medium, whereas mutant matrilin- 3 was retained and accumulated within the cell. Furthermore, when the mutant A-domains were examined individually, they existed primarily in an unfolded conformation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the mutant A-domains were specifically associated with ERp 72, a chaperone protein known to be involved in mediating disulfide bond <b>formation.</b> <b>Light</b> microscopy of cartilage from an MED patient with a MATN 3 mutation showed the presence of intracellular material within the chondrocytes, whilst the overall matrix appeared normal.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} of a sunspot penumbra in the active region NOAA 11024. We simultaneously observed the Stokes parameters of the photospheric iron lines at 1089. 6 nm with the TIP and 617. 3 nm with the GFPI spectropolarimeters along with broad-band images using G-band and CaIIK filters at the German VTT. The formation of the penumbra is intimately related to the inclined magnetic field. Within 4. 5 h observing time, the magnetic flux of the penumbra increases from 9. 7 E+ 20 to 18. 2 E+ 20 Mx, while the magnetic flux of the umbra remains constant at about 3. 8 E+ 20 Mx. Magnetic flux in the immediate surroundings is incorporated into the spot, and new flux is supplied via small flux patches (SFPs), which on average have a flux of 2 - 3 E+ 18 Mx. The spot's flux increase rate of 4. 2 E+ 16 Mx/s corresponds to the merging of one SFP per minute. We also find that during {{the formation of}} the spot penumbra: a) the maximum magnetic field strength of the umbra does not change, b) the magnetic neutral line keeps the same position relative to the umbra, c) the new flux arrives on the emergence side of the spot while the penumbra forms on the opposite side, d) the average LRF inclination of the light bridges decreases from 50 to 37 deg, and e) as the penumbra develops, the mean magnetic field strength at the spot border decreases from 1. 0 to 0. 8 kG. The SFPs associated with elongated granules are the building blocks of structure formation in active regions. During the sunspot formation, their contribution is comparable to the coalescence of pores. A quiet environment in the surroundings is important for penumbral formation.

40|$|There {{is great}} {{interest}} {{beginning to be}} shown in conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole (PPy), {{for use in the}} area of drug delivery systems. The main aim of the project was to produce PPy containing antischistosomal compounds and to study their release under electrochemical control. Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent typical disease in the world, affecting millions of people, the majority of whom are young children. Once affected, parasites live inside the body, causing several terrible symptomatic diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis, ascites and granuloma formation. Antischistosomal compounds investigated for incorporation were niclosamide, niclosamide ethanolamine salt (NES), praziquantel and trichlorfon. All these, apart from NES, were found be to electrochemically inactive in the potential window used to prepare PPy. The conducting polymer grown in the presence of niclosamide was found to have quite different topography to that electrodeposited in its absence, as indicated by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies, however, did not show any peaks associated with niclosamide. This, together with the very poor solubility of niclosamide in a range of electrolytes (e. g., aqueous Na 2 SO 4 (0. 1 mol dm- 3); tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, TBABF 4 (0. 01 mol dm- 3) / acetonitrile; TBABF 4 (0. 01 mol dm- 3) / methanol) suggested that niclosamide was not a suitable candidate for incorporation into this conducting polymer. Nucleation and growth behaviour (chronoamperometry) showed that the presence of praziquantel and trichlorfon in the electrolyte did not,alter PPy <b>formation.</b> <b>Light</b> microscopy and SEM investigations showed that no changes in film topography occured when these two drugs were added to the electrolyte. PPy was found to be electrodeposited at the surface of reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) electrodes and did not penetrate far into the bulk of the material. Thicker films (7 – 11 μm) and slightly greater penetration was achieved by stepping the potential to + 800 mV vs. SCE for 15 min, rather than using potential cycling. Subsequent studies were focused on trichlorfon due to its solubility in aqueous systems and hence greater promise for use in delivery devices to be used in aquatic systems. The presence of trichlorfon in PPy was not evidenced from Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) investigations, although this was probably due to the low concentration of the compound, since it was detected by XPS. These studies showed that one trichlorfon molecule was incorporated for every 765 pyrrole units when RVC was used as the substrate, and for every 103 pyrrole units when ITO glass was used. The former substrate has a much larger surface area, however, and so more trichlorfon overall will be incorporated than for PPy on ITO. XPS also showed that one sulphate anion was detected for every 4. 6 to 6. 4 pyrrole units. Trichlorfon release from PPy was successfully followed by GCMS, where ca. twice as much trichlorfon was released when the PPy/trichlorfon/RVC electrode was held at - 300 mV vs. SCE compared to open circuit conditions (no applied potential). At - 400 mV vs. SCE, a similar amount of trichlorfon (6. 43 μmol) was released after just 60 min compared to that released at - 300 mV vs. SCE after 24 h (6. 93 μmol). When the potential was too negative (- 500 mV vs. SCE), a reduced amount of trichlorfon (4. 72 μmol) was released after 60 min compared to the film at - 400 mV vs. SCE (6. 43 μmol), although it was greater than that released at - 300 mV vs. SCE (2. 87 μmol) and with no applied potential (1. 09 μmol). Thus, trichlorfon was successfully incorporated into PPy and could be released in a controlled fashion by varying the potential. The PPy/trichlorfon/RVC system showed promise for the construction of delivery devices for controlled release of trichlorfon, potentially for use in vivo or in aquatic environments. The last part of the work used computational chemistry techniques to investigate growing conducting polymer chains. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the unpaired π-electron spin density distribution of oligopyrrole and oligothiophene radical cations using VWN, BLYP and B 3 LYP functionals. For the oligomers investigated, α,α'-linkages were maintained, which preserve conjugation and hence conductivity. Pendant monomer units, however, joined via α,β'-linkages along the linear chain, were also predicted. The frequency of these pendent groups was dependent on the functional used, with more accurate B 3 LYP calculations suggesting a higher frequency than those performed using VWN. The time required to perform DFT calculations on long-chain oligomers (ca. 10 monomer units) was still practicable using the high-level B 3 LYP functional owing to the use of parallel processing. Since the frequency of pendant monomer units along the chain was dependent on the functional used, calculations using the B 3 LYP functional are recommended over more rapid computations using the VWN functional.
