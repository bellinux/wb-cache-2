Insulator areas contaminated by fungal growth could be distinguished from clean surfaces and readily be imaged.

40|$|We {{present a}} transmission, fluorescence, and {{polarization}} near-field scanning optical microscope with shear-force feedback control that is small {{in size and}} simple to operate. This microscope features an ultrafine mechanical tip/sample approach with continuous manual submicron control over a range of several millimeters. The piezo-driven 12 μm x-yx-y scan range is complimented by a 4 mm coarse mechanical translation range in each direction. The construction materials used in the mechanical feedback loop have been carefully chosen for thermal compatibility {{in order to reduce}} differential expansion and contraction between the tip and sample. A unique pressure-fit sample mount allows for quick and reliable sample exchange. Shear-force feedback light is delivered to the scan head via <b>an</b> <b>optical</b> fiber so that a remote laser of any type may be used as a source. This dither light is collimated and refocused onto the tip, delivering a consistently small spot which is collected by a high numerical aperture objective. This new scan head <b>incorporates</b> <b>an</b> <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> which will permit the linearization of scan piezo response similar to a scheme used successfully with atomic force microscopy. This is designed to both overcome the piezo’s inherent hysteresis and to eliminate drift during long duration spatial scans or spectroscopic measurements at a single location. The scan head design offers added flexibility due to the use of optical fibers to deliver the dither and scan linearization light, and functions in any orientation for use in conjunction with upright or inverted optical microscopes. © 1998 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|Prior to the {{retirement}} of the Space Shuttle, many exterior repairs on the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out by shuttle astronauts, trained {{on the ground and}} flown to the station to perform these repairs. After {{the retirement}} of the shuttle, this is no longer an available option. As such, the need for the ISS crew members to review scenarios while on flight, either for tasks they already trained or for contingency operations has become a very critical subject. In many situations, the time between the last session of Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) training and an Extravehicular Activity (EVA) task might be 6 to 8 months. In order to help with training for contingency repairs and to maintain EVA proficiency while on flight, the Johnson Space Center Virtual Reality Lab (VRLab) designed an onboard immersive ISS Virtual Reality Trainer (VRT), <b>incorporating</b> <b>a</b> unique <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> and making use of the already successful Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphical (DOUG) graphics software, to assist crew members with current procedures and contingency EVAs while on flight. The VRT provides an immersive environment similar to the one experienced at the VRLab crew training facility at NASA Johnson Space Center. EVA tasks are critical for a mission since as time passes the crew members may lose proficiency on previously trained tasks. In addition, there is an increased need for unplanned contingency repairs to fix problems arising as the ISS ages. The need to train and re-train crew members for EVAs and contingency scenarios is crucial and extremely demanding. ISS crew members are now asked to perform EVA tasks for which they have not been trained and potentially have never seen before...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the {{development}} and assessment of a biomimetic pump based on soft polymeric actuators, i. e. polyurethane tubes (950 μm internal diameter) with polypyrrole, which expands and contracts during redox cycling and provides the driving force for liquid movement. This pump can be integrated in the microfluidic channels, functioning {{in a similar manner}} similar to blood vessels. In principle, these biomimetic pumps and low power detectors could be integrated into a fully functional and totally integrated microanalytical platform. It was also low power (of the order of 100 mJ/μL to obtain a flow rate of 0. 08 μL/s), operating using voltages of up to ± 1 V, and requiring currents of less than 100 mA. The flow rates achieved are comparable to miniaturised commercial pumps, with the benefit of considerably reduced power consumption (a conventional miniaturised peristaltic pump consumes ca. 3. 6 J/μL to obtain the same flow rates as the pump integrated in this system). The microchip was constructed using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and designed to provide the appropriate mixing of reagents in order to obtain optimum response from the sensors. The chip <b>incorporated</b> <b>an</b> <b>optical</b> detection <b>system</b> constructed using miniaturised light emitting diodes (LED) for both the light source and the detector. This low-cost and low-power detector was surprisingly sensitive due to its integrating mode of operation, and exhibited very low limits of detection. In the present system, conventional LEDs were employed as proof of concept. However, surface mount LEDs will be employed which will allow for a much more compact and compatible format for use in microfluidic manifolds than conventional LEDs. The low-power biomimetic pump, and the low power detector system were assessed as components that could be integrated into a futuristic integrated microanalytical platform...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores computational optical imaging {{methods to}} circumvent the physical limitations of classical sensing. An ideal imaging system would maximize resolution in time, spectral bandwidth, three-dimensional object space, and polarization. Practically, increasing any one parameter will correspondingly decrease the others. Spectrometers strive to measure the power spectral density of the object scene. Traditional pushbroom spectral imagers acquire high resolution spectral and spatial resolution {{at the expense of}} acquisition time. Multiplexed spectral imagers acquire spectral and spatial information at each instant of time. Using a coded aperture and dispersive element, the coded aperture snapshot spectral imagers (CASSI) here described leverage correlations between voxels in the spatial-spectral data cube to compressively sample the power spectral density with minimal loss in spatial-spectral resolution while maintaining high temporal resolution. Photography is limited by similar physical constraints. Low f/# systems are required for high spatial resolution to circumvent diffraction limits and allow for more photon transfer to the film plain, but require larger optical volumes and more optical elements. Wide field systems similarly suffer from increasing complexity and <b>optical</b> volume. <b>Incorporating</b> <b>a</b> multi-scale <b>optical</b> <b>system,</b> the f/#, resolving power, optical volume and wide field of view become much less coupled. This system uses a single objective lens that images onto a curved spherical focal plane which is relayed by small micro-optics to discrete focal planes. Using this design methodology allows for gigapixel designs at low f/# that are only a few pounds and smaller than a one-foot hemisphere. Computational imaging systems add the necessary step of forward modeling and calibration. Since the mapping from object space to image space is no longer directly readable, post-processing is required to display the required data. The CASSI system uses an undersampled measurement matrix that requires inversion while the multi-scale camera requires image stitching and compositing methods for billions of pixels in the image. Calibration methods and a testbed are demonstrated that were developed specifically for these computational imaging systems. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} {{activities for the}} summer of 2003 consisted of two projects: One project was concerned with determining a method for predicting the static and dynamic assembly properties of nano-structures using laser tweezers. The other project {{was to investigate the}} generation of Laguerre-Gaussian modes using a spatial light modulator <b>incorporated</b> into <b>an</b> <b>optical</b> tweezers <b>system.</b> Concerning the first project, I initially pursued the approach suggested by my NASA colleague Dr. Art Decker. This approach involved mimicking the model of the structure of atomic nucleus for the assembly of 1 to 100 atoms using allowed quadruple transitions induced by orbital angular momentums of a Laguerre- Gaussian (Doughnut) laser mode. After realizing the inaptness of the nuclear model with the nanostructure model as far as the binding forces and transitions were concerned, I focused on using quantum dot modei. This model was not attuned also for the host lattice influences the electronic structure of the quantum dot. Thus one other option that I decided to pursue was the approach of molecular quantum mechanics. In this approach the nanostructure is treated as a large (10 - 100 nm) molecule constructed from single element or multi-elements. Subsequent to consultation with Dr. Fred Morales, a chemical engineer at NASA GRC, and Dr. David Ball, a computational chemist at Cleveland State University, I acquired a molecular-quantum computation software, Hyperchem 7. 0. This software allows simulation of different molecular structures as far as their static and dynamic behaviors are concerned. The time that I spent on this project was about eight weeks. Once this suitable approach was identified, I realized the need to collaborate with a computational quantum chemist to pursue searching for stable nanostructures in the range of 10 - 100 nm that we can be assembled using laser tweezers. The second project was about generating laser tweezers that possess orbital angular momentum. As shown, we were able to generate laser tweezers modes of different orbital angular momentum using a spatial light modulator <b>incorporated</b> into <b>a</b> laser tweezers system. The motivation for investigating these types of modes stems from being able to spin particles at high speeds and also to orient two particles in separate traps and then join them together. Also, there has been recent intense interest on fundamental physics research on orbital angular momentum of light. The fact that circularly polarized light may have associated with it angular momentum that relates to the spin of individual photons (spin 0 for the plane polarized light, spin + 1 for the right-circularly polarized light and spin - 1 for the left-circularly polarized light) was first demonstrated by Beth in 1936. Orbital angular momentum is, however, distinct from spin in that the spin angular momentum of light is intrinsically linked to the behavior of the electric field in the light whereas orbital angular momentum is a consequence of inclined wavefronts. In 1992 L. Allen, et al showed that the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes could possess well-defined orbital angular momentum that can exceed 1 planck's constant, i. e. l plancks constant per photon, where l is the azimuthal index of the mode...|$|R
