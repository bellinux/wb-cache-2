5|$|In the American camp, {{the mutual}} resentment between Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold finally {{exploded}} into open hostility. Gates quickly reported {{the action of}} September 19 to the Congress and Governor George Clinton of New York, but he failed to mention Arnold at all. The field commanders and men universally credited Arnold for their success. Almost all the troops involved were from Arnold's command and Arnold was the one directing the battle while Gates sat in <b>his</b> <b>tent.</b> Arnold protested, and the dispute escalated into a shouting match that ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command and giving it to Benjamin Lincoln. Arnold asked for a transfer to Washington's command, which Gates granted, but instead of leaving he remained in <b>his</b> <b>tent.</b> There is no documentary evidence for a commonly recounted anecdote that a petition signed by line officers convinced Arnold to stay in camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} assassination, June 28 (June 15 in the Julian calendar), is {{the feast}} of St. Vitus. In Serbia, it is called Vidovdan and commemorates the 1389 Battle of Kosovo against the Ottomans, at which the Sultan was assassinated in <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> by a Serb.|$|E
5|$|At {{an archaeological}} dig in the Ecuadorian highlands, two archaeologists, Dr. Bilac and Dr. Roosevelt, {{get into an}} {{argument}} over the removal of a burial urn that contains an Amaru, or a female shaman. Roosevelt argues that the urn must be taken from the site and preserved in a museum, much {{to the chagrin of}} Bilac and the tribespeople present. Later, a native shaman distributes Yaje to the local villagers and Bilac. During this ritual, a jaguar spirit kills Roosevelt in <b>his</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|E

50|$|Khirbet es-Sibte (also Ain Sebta), {{the present-day}} {{site of the}} Oak of Mamre, two {{kilometres}} southwest of Ramat el-Khalil, has been considered since the 19th century as the place where Abraham pitched <b>his</b> <b>tents</b> and saw the angels.|$|R
60|$|Frederick {{sent for}} <b>his</b> <b>tents,</b> {{and the army}} pitched its camp, facing the Russians; but during the night the latter, having got {{into a sort of}} order, moved away to the westward and bivouacked on Drewitz Heath, facing the battle ground.|$|R
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>tent</b> {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E
5|$|Later, Tyrion is {{awakened by}} Bronn as a Stark force approaches. Tyrion leaves <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> dressed in armor and orders the hill tribes to combat, {{but he is}} trampled as they rush to war. By the time he regains consciousness, the battle has been played out. Lord Tywin reveals that the Stark host was only 2,000 men, leaving them to wonder where the other 18,000 went.|$|E
5|$|The {{flashback}} ends, and Desmond {{is pulled}} off Charlie by Hurley. They help Desmond to <b>his</b> <b>tent.</b> Charlie {{tries to get}} an answer from him one last time. Desmond reveals that both times he rescued Claire, he was really saving Charlie; Charlie would have been electrocuted, and Charlie would have drowned attempting to save Claire from the ocean. Desmond tells Charlie that although he has prevented his death twice, Charlie is destined to die.|$|E
50|$|Shiz pursued Coriantumr to the {{seashore}} and gave battle for three days. The people of Shiz grew frightened and {{fled to the}} land of Corihor, while Coriantumr pitched <b>his</b> <b>tents</b> in the valley of Shurr, and assembled his army on the hill of Comnor hard by.|$|R

60|$|Frederick's rashness {{had cost}} him dear. He had lost eight {{thousand}} men; five thousand {{three hundred and}} eighty-one of them, and a hundred and nineteen officers, killed or prisoners; the rest wounded. He had also lost a hundred and one guns, and most of <b>his</b> <b>tents.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily {{offered his}} {{services}} at the roundabout {{on the evening of}} 16February, shortly after he had returned from Houston. According to Human rights watch, Alekry along with other staff were wearing special medical jackets showing the Red Crescent. During the raid, riot police attacked <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> and cut through it; despite telling them he was a physician, police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on his head {{and other parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|In January 1566 Suleiman {{went to war}} for {{the last}} time. The siege of Szigetvár was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and, though it {{resulted}} in an Ottoman victory, there were heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the battle—Zrinski in the final charge and Suleiman in <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> from natural causes. More than 20,000 Turks had fallen during the attacks {{and almost all of}} Zrinski's 2,300 man garrison was killed, with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day. Although the battle was an Ottoman victory, it stopped the Ottoman push to Vienna that year. Vienna was not threatened again until the Battle of Vienna in 1683.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> on the beach, Zurga {{notes that}} the storm has abated, as has his rage; he now feels remorse for his anger towards Nadir (""). Leila is brought in; Zurga is captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir's life, but his jealousy is rekindled. He confesses his love for her, but refuses mercy (""). Nourabad {{and some of the}} {{fishermen}} enter to report that the funeral pyre is ready.

5|$|According to the Old Book of Tang, Tong Yabghu's reign {{was once}} {{considered}} as {{the golden age}} of Western Göktürk Khaganate:Tong Yehu Kaghan is a man of bravery and astuteness. He is good at art of war. Thus he controlled Tiele tribes to the north, confronted Persia to the west, connected with Kasmira (nowadays Kashmir) to the south. All countries are subjected to him. He controlled ten thousands of men with arrow and bow, establishing his power over the western region. He occupied the land of Wusun and moved <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> to Qianquan north of Tashkent. All of the princes of western region assumed the Turk office of Jielifa. Tong Yehu Kaghan also sent a Tutun to monitor them for imposition. The power of Western Turks had never reached such a state before".|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1915, Jensen enlisted as {{a private}} in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for service in World War I, and was allotted to the 6th {{reinforcements}} to the 10th Battalion with the regimental number 2389. His reinforcement draft embarked on HMAT Borda at Outer Harbor on 23 June, and joined the battalion at Gallipoli on 4 August. By the time Jensen arrived, {{nearly half of the}} battalion had been evacuated sick with dysentery. For the remainder of the Gallipoli campaign, the 10th Battalion rotated through various positions in the line defending the beachhead until withdrawn to Lemnos in November. Jensen remained with his unit throughout, except for a week in late September/early October which he spent in hospital. The battalion embarked for Egypt late the following month and spent the next four months training and assisting in the defence of the Suez Canal. During their time in Egypt, the battalion was split into two, with one half forming the nucleus of the new 50th Battalion, which was part of the 13th Brigade, 4th Division. In April 1916, Jensen {{and a number of other}} 10th Battalion men were transferred to the 50th Battalion, and later that month Jensen was charged for not being in <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> at tattoo. On 5 June the battalion embarked for France, arriving in Marseilles six days later. The unit then entrained for the Western Front, entering the trenches for the first time on 28 June.|$|E

25|$|In {{his history}} of the 32nd Armoured Regiment, Maurizio Parri wrote that a company of the II Medium Tank Battalion with its M11/39s had tried to {{counter-attack}} the British Matildas but the crews misunderstood flag signals, which caused delays and the attack failed. In 1944, Moorehead wrote that Maletti was wounded while rallying his men, then retreated to <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> with a machine-gun, where he was killed. Maletti's mortal remains were to be seen {{at the entrance of}} <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> when war correspondents visited the camp. Moorehead wrote that he saw unattended donkeys wandering around looking for water and soldiers looting extravagant Italian army uniforms and lunching on luxury foods, wines and Recoaro mineral water. New equipment, weapons and ammunition strewed the ground, already disappearing under the sand and dozens of dug-outs were found to be full of food, new equipment and ammunition.|$|E

60|$|After a day {{of painful}} and fruitless scrambling, Mr. Hunt gave up the attempt to {{penetrate}} in this direction, and, returning to the little stream on the skirts of the mountain, pitched <b>his</b> <b>tents</b> within six miles of his encampment of the preceding night.

50|$|Shapur III died in 388, after reigning {{a little}} more than five years. He was a man of simple tastes, and was fond of {{spending}} his time outdoors in <b>his</b> <b>tents.</b> He died when some nobles cut the ropes of a large tent that he had erected in one of his palace courts, so that the tent fell on top of him. He was shortly succeeded by his son Bahram IV.|$|R
25|$|A legend arose that James {{had been}} warned against invading England by supernatural powers. While he was praying in St Michael's Kirk at Linlithgow, a man strangely dressed in blue had {{approached}} his desk saying his mother {{had told him to}} say James should not to go to war or take the advice of women. Then before the King could reply, the man vanished. David Lindsay of the Mount and John Inglis could find no trace of him. The historian R. L. Mackie wondered if the incident really happened as a masquerade orchestrated by an anti-war party: Norman Macdougall doubts if there was a significant anti-war faction. Three other portents of disaster were described by Paolo Giovio in 1549 and repeated in John Polemon's 1578 account of the battle. When James was in council at the camp at Flodden Edge a hare ran out of <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> and escaped the weapons of his knights; it was found that mice had gnawed away the strings and buckle of the King's helmet; and in the morning <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> was spreckled with a bloody dew.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of how Brian was killed, from dying in heroic man-to-man combat to {{being killed by}} the fleeing Viking mercenary Brodir while praying in <b>his</b> <b>tent</b> at Clontarf.

25|$|In 1978, Dublin Corporation began {{preparing}} to demolish Hollyfield Buildings.
