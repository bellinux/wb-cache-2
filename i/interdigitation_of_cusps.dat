40|$|Background. Valvular {{apparatus}} {{of the heart}} is the frequent object of the surgical operations for today. Morphological changes which are happed within valves of the heart at time of cardiac diseases the modern medicine considers on the clinical, instrumental, histological, cytological and ultramicroscopical levels. The cardiac surgeons that make the heart valve replacement using the tissue engineering have the great interest {{in front of the}} heart valves. The achievements of the modern medicine are impossible without the fundamental morphological investigations. Objective. To study the morphological features <b>of</b> the <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> human heart valves on the light and ultramicroscopic levels. Methods. We have reviewed the structure <b>of</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> 48 heart valves of adults. It was used a light and electron microscopy which enabled us to study the morphology <b>of</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> atria-ventricular and ventriculo-vascular heart valves. Results. The data indicate that <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> heart valves are stratified. Layers <b>of</b> <b>cusps</b> are made <b>of</b> different types of fibrous connective tissues. The spongy layer is made of loose connective tissue, the fibrous layer – dense regular connective tissue, ventricular layer – dense irregular connective tissue. The arrangement of these layers in the <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> atria-ventricular heart valves (in the direction from atrium toward ventricle) is: spongy, fibrous and ventricular. The arrangement of these layers in the <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> ventricular-vascular heart valves (in the direction from side that is faced to the wall of blood vessel toward the ventricle) is: fibrous, spongy, ventricular. Conclusion. The position of data layers within <b>cusp</b> <b>of</b> atria-ventricular valves differs from position of data layers within ventriculo-vascular valves. These changes of tissue localization correlate to haemodynamic conditions during heart cycle. Citation: Fedoniuk L, Semeniuk T, Bodnar E.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relative}} contribution <b>of</b> <b>cusps</b> and pseudocusps, on cosmic (super) strings, to the emitted bursts of gravitational waves. The gravitational wave emission {{in the vicinity}} of highly relativistic points on the string follows, for a high enough frequency, a logarithmic decrease. The slope has been analytically found to be ^- 4 /_ 3 for points reaching exactly the speed of light in the limit c= 1. We investigate the variations of this high frequency behaviour with respect to the velocity of the points considered, for strings formed through a numerical simulation, and we then compute numerically the gravitational waves emitted. We find that for string points moving with velocities as far as 10 ^- 3 from the theoretical (relativistic) limit c= 1, gravitational wave emission follows a behaviour consistent with that <b>of</b> <b>cusps,</b> effectively increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>cusps</b> on a string.
