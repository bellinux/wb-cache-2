40|$|AbstractThe long {{bones of}} the {{vertebrate}} appendicular skeleton arise from initially continuous condensations of mesenchymal cells that subsequently segment and cavitate to form discrete elements separated by synovial joints. Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms of joint formation. We present evidence that Wnt- 14 plays {{a central role in}} initiating synovial joint formation in the chick limb. Wnt- 14 is expressed in <b>joint-forming</b> regions prior to the segmentation of the cartilage elements, and local misexpression of Wnt- 14 induces morphological and molecular changes characteristic of the first steps of joint formation. Induction of an ectopic joint-like region by Wnt- 14 suppresses the formation of the immediately adjacent endogenous joint, potentially providing insight into the spacing of joints...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe origin, {{roles and}} fate of {{progenitor}} cells forming synovial joints during limb skeletogenesis remain largely unclear. Here we produced prenatal and postnatal genetic cell fate-maps by mating ROSA-LacZ-reporter mice with mice expressing Cre-recombinase at prospective joint sites {{under the control}} of Gdf 5 regulatory sequences (Gdf 5 -Cre). Reporter-expressing cells initially constituted the interzone, a compact mesenchymal structure representing the first overt sign of joint formation, and displayed a gradient-like distribution along the ventral-to-dorsal axis. The cells expressed genes such as Wnt 9 a, Erg and collagen IIA, remained predominant in the <b>joint-forming</b> sites over time, gave rise to articular cartilage, synovial lining and other joint tissues, but contributed little if any to underlying growth plate cartilage and shaft. To study their developmental properties more directly, we isolated the <b>joint-forming</b> cells from prospective autopod joint sites using a novel microsurgical procedure and tested them in vitro. The cells displayed a propensity to undergo chondrogenesis that was enhanced by treatment with exogenous rGdf 5 but blocked by Wnt 9 a over-expression. To test roles for such Wnt-mediated anti-chondrogenic capacity in vivo, we created conditional mutants deficient in Wnt/β-catenin signaling using Col 2 -Cre or Gdf 5 -Cre. Synovial joints did form in both mutants; however, the joints displayed a defective flat cell layer normally abutting the synovial cavity and expressed markedly reduced levels of lubricin. In sum, our data indicate that cells present at prospective joint sites and expressing Gdf 5 constitute a distinct cohort of progenitor cells responsible for limb joint formation. The cells appear to be patterned along specific limb symmetry axes and rely on local signaling tools to make distinct contributions to joint formation...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDespite its {{clinical}} significance, {{the mechanisms}} of joint morphogenesis are elusive. By combining laser-capture microdissection for RNA sampling with microarrays, {{we show that}} the setting in which <b>joint-forming</b> interzone cells develop is distinct from adjacent growth plate chondrocytes and is characterized by downregulation of chemokines, such as monocyte-chemoattractant protein- 5 (MCP- 5). Using in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro approaches, we show that low levels of interzone-MCP- 5 are essential for joint formation and contribute to proper growth plate organization. Mice lacking the TGF-β-type-II-receptor (TβRII) in their limbs (Tgfbr 2 Prx 1 KO), which lack joint development and fail chondrocyte hypertrophy, show upregulation of interzone-MCP- 5. In vivo and ex vivo blockade of the sole MCP- 5 receptor, CCR 2, led {{to the rescue of}} joint formation and growth plate maturation in Tgfbr 2 Prx 1 KO but an acceleration of growth plate mineralization in control mice. Our study characterized the TβRII/MCP- 5 axis as an essential crossroad for joint development and endochondral growth. Video Abstrac...|$|E
40|$|AbstractJoints are {{essential}} for skeletal form and function, yet their development remains poorly understood. In zebrafish fins, joints form between the bony fin ray segments providing essentially unlimited opportunities to evaluate joint morphogenesis. Mutations in cx 43 cause the short segment phenotype of short fin (sofb 123) mutants, suggesting that direct cell–cell communication may regulate joint location. Interestingly, increased cx 43 expression in the another long fin (alfdty 86) mutant appears to cause joint failure typical of that mutant. Indeed, knockdown of cx 43 in alfdty 86 mutant fins rescues joint formation. Together, these data reveal a correlation between the level of Cx 43 expression in the fin ray mesenchyme {{and the location of}} joints. Cx 43 was also observed laterally in cells associated with developing joints. Confocal microscopy revealed that the Cx 43 protein initially surrounds the membranes of ZNS 5 -positive joint cells, but at later stages becomes polarized toward the underlying Cx 43 -positive mesenchymal cells. One possibility is that communication between the Cx 43 -positive mesenchyme and the overlying ZNS 5 -positive cells regulates joint location, and upregulation of Cx 43 in <b>joint-forming</b> cells contributes to joint morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEndothelin 1 (Edn 1) {{signaling}} promotes ventral {{character to}} the facial skeleton. In zebrafish edn 1 mutants, the ventral jaw structures are severely reduced and fused to their dorsal counterparts, {{with a loss}} of joints that normally form at an intermediate dorsal–ventral position. Loss of function at another locus, sturgeon, also yields joint losses, but only mild reductions in the ventral jaw structures. We show that sturgeon encodes one of two orthologs of Furin present in zebrafish, and that both furin genes may function partially redundantly to activate Edn 1 signaling. Supporting this hypothesis, early expression of edn 1 -dependent genes is downregulated in sturgeon (furinA) mutants. Later in development, expression of most of these genes recovers to near wild-type levels in furinA mutants but not in edn 1 mutants. The recovery explains the less severe furinA mutant skeletal phenotype and suggests that late gene expression is dependent on a critical level of Edn 1 signaling not present in the more severe edn 1 mutants. However, expression defects in the intermediate <b>joint-forming</b> domains in both mutants persist, explaining the joint losses observed later in both mutants. We further show that in both mutants the arches fail to correctly undergo ventral elongation before skeletogenesis begins and propose a model in which this failure is largely responsible for the loss of an Edn 1 -dependent compartmentation of the arch into the intermediate and ventral domains...|$|E
40|$|Skeletogenesis of the axial and appendicular {{elements}} occurs through endochondral ossification, {{a complex}} process partially regulated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and their heparan sulfate (HS) chains. Negatively charged HS interacts {{with a number of}} growth factors including members of the bone morphogenetic protein, Wnt, hedgehog, and fibroblast growth factor families, all of which influence endochondral ossification. These interactions control factor distribution and bioavailability, providing tissue and cell-specific signaling events. The importance of HSPGs in skeletal development is reiterated by the skeletal disorder Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) caused by heterozygous mutations in HS-polymerizing enzymes EXT 1 or EXT 2. HME patients develop ectopic cartilaginous outgrowths that form next to growth plates of long bones adjacent to joints. The goal of this investigation was to better understand the connection between loss of HS and exostosis formation and to specifically address a few poorly understood aspects of HME. We hypothesized that loss of HS would allow pro-chondrogenic signaling factors to signal more robustly outside typical distribution regions, potentially initiating ectopic chondrocyte differentiation. In order to address cell origin and track early exostosis formation, an in vivo model was developed with conditional deletion of Ext 1 in a population of <b>joint-forming</b> epiphyseal cells. Ex vivo and in vitro models of HS deficiency allowed us to investigate how this change influences chondrogenesis as well as cell signaling events. We uncovered a specific population of perichondrial cells that contribute to exostosis development, at least partially due to an increase in BMP 2 signaling in this area. Biochemical analysis of HS-BMP interactions demonstrated that interfering with HS increased the amount of 2 ̆ 2 free 2 ̆ 2 and available ligand, likely promoting receptor interaction and subsequent signaling. Another interesting characteristic of HME is that many exostoses express very low to no HS even within a heterozygous patient (which should express 50...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} (HSPGs) regulate {{a number}} of major developmental processes, but their roles in synovial joint formation remain unknown. Here we created conditional mouse embryo mutants lacking Ext 1 in developing joints by mating Ext 1 f/f and Gdf 5 -Cre mice. Ext 1 encodes a subunit of the Ext 1 /Ext 2 Golgi-associated protein complex responsible for heparan sulfate (HS) synthesis. The proximal limb joints did form in the Gdf 5 -Cre;Ext 1 f/f mutants, but contained an uneven articulating superficial zone that expressed very low lubricin levels. The underlying cartilaginous epiphysis was deranged as well and displayed random patterns of cell proliferation and matrillin- 1 and collagen IIA expression, indicative of an aberrant phenotypic definition of the epiphysis itself. Digit joints were even more affected, lacked a distinct mesenchymal interzone and were often fused likely as a result of local abnormal BMP and hedgehog activity and signaling. Interestingly, overall growth and lengthening of long bones were also delayed in the mutants. To test whether Ext 1 function is needed for joint formation at other sites, we examined the spine. Indeed, entire intervertebral discs, normally composed by nucleus pulposus surrounded by the annulus fibrosus, were often missing in Gdf 5 -Cre;Ext 1 f/f mice. When disc remnants were present, they displayed aberrant organization and defective joint marker expression. Similar intervertebral joint defects and fusions occurred in Col 2 -Cre;β-cateninf/f mutants. The study provides novel evidence that local Ext 1 expression and HS production are needed to maintain the phenotype and function of <b>joint-forming</b> cells and coordinate local signaling by BMP, hedgehog and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. The data indicate also that defects in joint formation reverberate on, and delay, overall long bone growth...|$|E
