5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion and the writers thought it would be funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. The episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl, which would become a common background prop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> home.|$|E
5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from {{watching}} the Itchy & Scratchy Halloween special, removing the batteries from the remote control. When Marge leaves, Bart finds plutonium in Homer's toolbox and hammers {{it into the}} remote's battery slot. When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy. Bart and Lisa are soon hunted by Itchy and Scratchy. Back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> house, Homer enters {{the living room and}} watches the show. Oblivious to what he sees, Homer decides to change the channel, and Bart, Lisa, Itchy, and Scratchy wind up on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. They end up back at Itchy's house and urge Homer from inside the TV to use the remote to get them out, who eventually succeeds in doing so. Unfortunately, Itchy and Scratchy also escape. At first, the family is scared, but realize how small the two characters are and decide to keep them as pets.|$|E

500|$|Marge is the matriarch of the Simpson family. With {{her husband}} Homer, she has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force {{in her family}} and often {{provides}} a grounding voice {{in the midst of}} her family's antics by trying to maintain order <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> household. She is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and is often included on lists of top [...] "TV moms". She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons—including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books—and inspired an entire line of merchandise.|$|E
500|$|Springfield is [...] "in {{the grip}} of lottery fever" [...] with a $130 million jackpot, and as a result, no one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> family notices that their pet dog, Santa's Little Helper, has become ill. Once the dog is {{discovered}} to be sick, the family rushes him to the animal hospital, where they learn that he needs an emergency operation to cure gastric dilatation volvulus which will cost $750. Homer is saddened to tell his children, Bart and Lisa, that the family cannot afford the operation. However, after seeing how much everyone loves the dog, especially Bart, he decides {{to find a way}} to pay for it.|$|E
500|$|... "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Martin and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. Both Homer's mother Mona Simpson and Herb make their first appearances on The Simpsons in the episode. Some fans were upset with the sad ending of the episode, {{and as a result}} the producers decided to write a sequel in which Herb would be given a kinder fate. The resulting episode, [...] "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?", aired {{at the end of the}} third season. In that episode, Herb briefly settled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb US$2000, which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. He then bought each member of the family gifts and paid Homer back with a vibrating chair, along with his forgiveness.|$|E

500|$|Nancy Basile at About.com {{said her}} {{favorite}} Maggie scenes on The Simpsons {{are the ones}} that show her acting more like an adult than a one-year-old. Some of her favorite Maggie scenes include scenes from [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] and [...] "Lady Bouvier's Lover" [...] where Maggie meets her unibrowed archenemy, Baby Gerald, and the one scene from [...] "" [...] in which Bart is supposed to babysit Maggie, but she escapes and takes Homer's car for a ride. Basile also added that [...] "whether watching 'The Happy Elves' or falling down, Maggie is the cutest baby <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> family". Comedian Ricky Gervais named [...] "And Maggie Makes Three" [...] his second favorite episode of the show and said that the scene in the end where Homer puts up pictures of Maggie over his desk gave him [...] "a lump in the throat thinking about it". Todd Everett at Variety called the scene in [...] "Lisa's First Word" [...] where Maggie speaks her first word [...] "quite a heart-melter".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{includes}} a gag in which Quagmire rapes Marge Simpson, {{and the two}} later end up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> family's house, where Quagmire kills the family by shooting them. The network executives believed the joke was [...] "personal" [...] and told MacFarlane {{that he could not}} do a gag with The Simpsons. MacFarlane responded, saying that they had made fun of Family Guy several times, to which the executives replied that they wanted to [...] "end the feud". MacFarlane, however, claimed that there was no feud and told them: [...] "You are afraid of [...] James L. Brooks. [...] And that's why we can't do it." [...] Fox eventually cut the gag, which left the episode without a joke {{at the end of the}} first act. Brooks and Al Jean were reportedly very upset with the gag, and because of it, Fox told both the Family Guy and The Simpsons staff that they could no longer make fun of one another. However, the gag was included on the DVD set and broadcasts on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. It also aired on Global in Canada.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{thought it was a}} [...] "quintessential" [...] Swartzwelder episode, and executive producer/show runner David Mirkin said it was a [...] "fantastic job by one of the most prolific writers of the show". The most important thing to Mirkin while making the episode was {{to make sure that the}} elephant would be a [...] "bastard" [...] and behave rudely, unlike other animals on the show. For example, instead of putting people on his back, Stampy would put them in his mouth. Mirkin said the elephant [...] "never quite bonds because it's a very cantankerous animal, a concept that was very important to this episode". Stampy has since been used several times in jokes later on in the series. For example, Stampy made an appearance in the season nine episode [...] "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace" [...] in one of Bart's dreams, and in the season fourteen episode [...] "Large Marge", where he is used by Bart in a stunt to help Krusty the Clown win back his popularity. Stampy appeared briefly in The Simpsons Movie, where he tries to break down the giant glass dome lowered over Springfield. The episode also introduces the character Cletus Spuckler. He is shown as one of the [...] "slack-jawed yokels" [...] gawking at Stampy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> family's backyard. Cletus is not named in the episode, so the staff simply referred to him as the Slack-Jawed Yokel.|$|E

500|$|In {{a parody}} of Bram Stoker's Dracula, after a news story about several vampire attacks, Lisa begins to suspect that Mr. Burns is a vampire, {{but the rest of}} the family dismisses her concerns. The family is invited to Mr. Burns' castle in Pennsylvania, where Bart and Lisa {{discover}} a secret staircase descending to an eerie basement filled with coffins. As they investigate, vampires emerge from the coffins and encircle them. Lisa escapes, but Bart activates the [...] "Super Fun Happy Slide", causing him to be captured and get bitten by Mr. Burns. Bart returns to the table with Mr. Burns, who tells him to take a seat. Bart is very pale and is behaving oddly, but these factors get little attention by the family. Later that night, Lisa is awakened by a now undead Bart and his vampire friends. When Bart is about to bite Lisa, Homer and Marge interrupt and discover that Bart is a vampire. Lisa claims that the only way to restore him is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns. The family returns to Mr. Burns' mansion, where Homer drives a stake through Mr. Burns' heart. Unfortunately, despite Mr. Burns' death, Bart still remains a vampire. To make things worse, Lisa discovers that everyone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> family except for herself is a vampire, and that the true head vampire is inexplicably Marge, not Mr. Burns. With this revelation, the whole entire family swoops in on Lisa, only to stop and wish everyone a happy Halloween. Then, they all harmonize [...] "Hark the Herald Angels Sing", parodying A Charlie Brown Christmas.|$|E
500|$|Herbert [...] "Herb" [...] Powell (voiced by Danny DeVito), is Homer's {{paternal}} half-brother. He resembles Homer, {{though he}} is much thinner, boasts {{a full head of}} hair and is more astute. He first appeared in the season two episode [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] when Homer discovered he had a half-brother, the product of a short-lived affair between his father Abe and a carnival dunk-tank worker who was also a prostitute (identified in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album as [...] "Gaby"). [...] A year after putting the baby up for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb or how he was conceived. [...] Herb was raised by his adoptive parents Edward and [...] Mililani Powell (first names given in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album), put himself through college by working odd jobs, then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit. Herb is an exception to [...] "the Simpson Gene", which causes all male members of the Simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they mature, as Herb is intelligent, successful and an astute businessman, becoming extremely wealthy due to his car dealership. Overjoyed to learn that he had a blood family, Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer, as a representative of average Americans, to design a car. The car was a flop, bankrupting the company, and Herb angrily rejects Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant. The episode was written by Jeff Martin but the idea of having Herb voiced by Danny DeVito had been pitched by Sam Simon. Some were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result the producers decided to make a sequel. Herb re-appeared the next season in [...] "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?". Now broke and homeless, he briefly settled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb $2000, which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. In gratitude, he bought gifts for each member of the family and paid Homer back with his forgiveness. Homer's [...] "seldom seen half-brother" [...] has had only one brief speaking part since this episode: DeVito reprised his role for the Season 24 episode [...] "The Changing of the Guardian", in which Powell's answering machine message, [...] "Hi, you've reached Herb Powell. I'm poor again.", is heard.|$|E

2500|$|Individual dunes in ergs {{typically}} have widths, lengths, or both dimensions greater than [...] Both the regional {{extent of their}} sand cover and the complexity and great size of their dunes distinguish ergs from dune fields.

2500|$|Sand {{seas and}} dune fields {{generally}} occur in regions downwind of copious sources of dry, loose sand, such as dry riverbeds and deltas, floodplains, glacial outwash plains, dry lakes, and beaches. Almost all major ergs are located downwind from river beds {{in areas that}} are too dry to support extensive vegetative cover and are thus subject to long-continued wind erosion. Sand from these abundant sources migrates downwind and builds up into very large dunes where its movement is halted or slowed by topographic barriers to windflow or by convergence of windflow. Entire ergs and dune fields tend to migrate downwind as far as hundreds of kilometers from their sources of sand. Such accumulation requires long periods of time. At least one million years are required to build ergs with very large dunes, such as those on the Arabian Peninsula, in North Africa, and in central Asia. Sand seas that have accumulated in subsiding structural and topographic basins, such as the Murzuk Sand Sea (...) of Libya, may attain great thicknesses (more than 1000m) but others, such as the ergs of linear dunes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> Desert ...|$|E
