5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{medicine}} {{deals with}} medical research {{on issues of}} diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness. The field includes {{the effect on the}} human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> important parts of diver education.|$|E

50|$|In medicine, a <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> a {{functional}} abnormality or disturbance. Medical <b>disorders</b> can <b>be</b> categorized into mental disorders, physical disorders, genetic disorders, {{emotional and behavioral}} disorders, and functional disorders. The term <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> often considered more value-neutral and less stigmatizing than the terms disease or illness, and therefore is a preferred terminology in some circumstances. In mental health, the term mental <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> used {{as a way of}} acknowledging the complex interaction of biological, social, and psychological factors in psychiatric conditions. However, the term <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> also used in many other areas of medicine, primarily to identify physical <b>disorders</b> that <b>are</b> not caused by infectious organisms, such as metabolic disorders.|$|R

5|$|Gastrointestinal <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} {{associated with}} aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E
5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E

40|$|Psychiatric {{assessment}} was done {{according to the}} DSM-IV TR criteria in 19 children with predialysis chronic renal failure (CRF) and 19 children with end-stage renal disease on regular hemodialysis. The prevalence rate of psychiatric disorders in all the studied patients was 52. 6 %. Adjustment <b>disorders</b> <b>were</b> the most common disorders (18. 4 %), followed by depression (10. 3 %) and neurocognitive disorders (7. 7 %). Anxiety and elimination <b>disorders</b> <b>were</b> reported in 5. 1 and 2. 6 %, respectively. The <b>disorders</b> <b>were</b> more prevalent (P= 0. 05) in dialysis (68. 4 %) than in predialysis patients (36. 8 %). The presence of psychiatric <b>disorders</b> <b>was</b> not significantly correlated with sex, severity of anemia, duration of CRF or the efficiency or the duration of hemodialysis. In conclusion, psychiatric <b>disorders</b> <b>were</b> prevalent in our patients, especially in those on hemodialysis.

5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external validity of the AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments {{of people who}} harm themselves are most effective. Psychiatric and personality <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> common in individuals who self-harm {{and as a result}} self-harm may be an indicator of depression and/or other psychological problems. Many people who self-harm have moderate or severe depression and therefore treatment with antidepressant medications may often be used. There is tentative evidence for the medication flupentixol; however, greater study is required before it can be recommended.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians {{have a better chance of}} getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mutations}} within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's phenotype (silent mutations). Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous mutations). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. conservative mutations). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E

50|$|The key {{difference}} between dysthymic disorder and depressive personality <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> {{the focus of}} the symptoms used to diagnose. Dysthymic <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> diagnosed by looking at the somatic senses, the more tangible senses.

5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating <b>disorders</b> <b>are</b> usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E
