25|$|The loincloth is the {{simplest}} form of underwear; {{it was probably}} the first undergarment worn by <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> <b>In</b> warmer climates the loincloth was often the only clothing worn (effectively making it an outer garment rather than an undergarment), as was doubtless its origin, but in colder regions the loincloth often formed the basis of a person's clothing and was covered by other garments.

In Chalcedonian Christology, Jesus is the Word of God, which was in the beginning and, thus, is uncreated, and hence is God, and consequently identical with the Creator of the world ex nihilo.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the chess pieces had altered greatly since the times of chaturanga, with ornate pieces and chess pieces depicting animals giving way to abstract shapes. This is because of a Muslim ban on the game’s lifelike pieces, as they {{were said to have}} brought upon images of idolatry. The Islamic sets of later centuries followed a pattern which assigned names and abstract shapes to the chess pieces, as Islam forbids depiction of animals and <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>in</b> art.

25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the most}} common theory among {{scientists}} was still the concept of scala naturae, proposed by Aristotle.

25|$|Generally, {{the nobility}} grew from wealthier or more {{powerful}} {{members of the}} peasantry, those who were capable of assigning work or wealth to provide the requisite cavalrymen. In Finland, there never existed outright serfdom. Hence, nobility was basically a class of well-off citizens, not owners of other <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> <b>In</b> the Middle Ages {{and much of the}} modern age, nobles and other wealthy men were landowners, as well as lords of villeins and servants. Members of the nobility utilized their economic power and sometimes also other powers to have smaller farmowners sell their lands to manor lords, so landowning centralized gradually more {{in the hands of the}} noble class.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{interprets the}} concept of <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the work of Maimonides and ibn Rushd, two representatives of major Arab and Jewish medieval philosophy. It {{combines}} the ancient Greek philosophical tradition, especially Aristotle, with a religious context. When Maimonides and Ibn Rushd tried to harmonize these two traditions, they {{had to deal with}} many opposite views, that stemmed from the difference between religious and ancient world. Behind this intellectual ground have they created the original thesis and approaches to grasping reality, the world and the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> it. The issue of <b>human</b> <b>being</b> is analyzed <b>in</b> three levels. The first level consists of the relationship between <b>human</b> <b>being</b> and creation, which addresses the question about origin of the world the human soul and the resurrection. The second level, i. e. the man and the world, is devoted to describing a scheme of the world, human knowledge and the theory of prophecy.

Japanese parents sometimes write {{the names of their}} children, or their own names, on cucumbers and toss them into waters believed to be infested with kappa in order to mollify the creatures and allow the family to bathe. In some regions, it was customary to eat cucumbers before swimming as protection, but in others it was believed that this act would guarantee an attack.
