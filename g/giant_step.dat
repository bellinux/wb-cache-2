It ran for 572 performances.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the early}} fully {{imported}} 200B sedans and coupes retained the {{independent rear suspension}} from the 180B, locally assembled 200B sedans instead switched to coil springs with a live axle, while the wagon (imported from Japan) had a live axle in the rear with leaf springs. Seen as a <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> backwards, {{the reason for the}} change was certainly not a cost-cutting measure, but simply the need for Nissan to reach an 85% local content quota that the then Federal Government demanded of Australian car manufacturers. However, in practice the live rear axle, being an Australian development, proved to actually benefit the car's overall handling dynamics.|$|E

25|$|Ordered to the Pacific, Hall {{departed}} Charleston, South Carolina on 21 December {{and arrived}} at Pearl Harbor 11 January 1944. On 22 January, she cleared Hawaii with Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner's Expeditionary Force bound for the capture and occupation of the Marshall Islands, a <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> across the Pacific toward Japan. Sent with three cruisers and three other destroyers on a special mission to wreck the airfields on Tarao Island during the invasion, Hall joined in the devastating bombardment of that island 30 January. Her guns knocked out a gasoline dump with a tremendous explosion, hit several gun emplacements, and then screened the larger ships during {{the remainder of the}} firing. Tarao effectively neutralized, the ships then sailed for Kwajalein and the main assault.|$|E
25|$|In the {{political}} philosophy of healthcare, {{the debate between}} universal healthcare and private healthcare is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives {{by the federal government}} to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> in the direction of socialized medicine, many people think that the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage. Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that already exists in the United States.|$|E

On March 4, 2007, Gordon established a career high 48 points, leading a miraculous comeback effort to win 126–121 in overtime against the Milwaukee Bucks. In {{the first round of}} the playoffs the Bulls again faced the Heat, but this time won the series in four games, becoming the first team in NBA history to sweep the defending champions in the first round.

He later formed a small government consulting firm known as The Paul Laxalt Group. After his retirement from the U.S. Senate, Laxalt was named by President George H.W. Bush to a prestigious deficit reduction panel that consisted of current and former members of Congress and other prominent Americans. The commission eventually deadlocked on how best to address federal budget deficits. Paul Laxalt was honored in various ways both during and after his public service career. The Paul Laxalt Mineral Engineering Center, an $11 million building that was completed in 1983, {{has been described as a}} <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> forward for the University of Nevada-Reno and the School of Mines. The 60,000-square-foot building houses classrooms and laboratories for mining engineering, chemical and materials engineering, and geological sciences. The Paul Laxalt State Building in Carson City was formerly the U.S. Post Office (built in 1891) and the first Federal building erected in Nevada. It is located in the center of the Carson City's Historic District.|$|E

[...] Oram considered that the amendments to the NZ ETS destroyed its effectiveness. His examples were: removing limits on emissions by adopting intensity-based allocation of free carbon credits, slavishly following climate-laggard Australia, minimising the price incentive by extending the free allocation of credits for 75 years, muting the price signal with a $NZ25 per tonne of carbon cap, forcing forestry holders of credits to sell them overseas because of the $NZ25 per tonne cap, cancelling complementary measures such as fuel efficiency standards, giving in to special pleading via subsidies, and creating uncertainty for business.|$|E

500|$|Their musical {{innovations}} {{and commercial}} success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival {{marked the beginning}} of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any [...] "pre-Beatles" [...] music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with [...] "filler", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a [...] "major breakthrough... a <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> toward reshaping the concert business".

500|$|Both AllHipHop and Billboard {{were very}} {{positive}} toward Gravity after a preview listening session, considering it Lecrae's strongest and most mainstream work to date. AllHipHop stated that [...] "overall, {{it appears that}} Lecrae is ready to offer {{one of his most}} broad and, dare-we-say, mainstream albums in terms of sound; yet, it still manages to capture the trueness of what he has always stood for and rapped about. If anything, Gravity is a <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> forward for his expanding career, and it will surely be a welcome addition to many 'Top 10' lists when 2012 comes to a close." [...] Indie Vision Music in announcing the cover of Gravity called the album [...] "likely the biggest Christian hip hop album yet". AllHipHop listed [...] "Mayday" [...] as one of the standout tracks on the album, noting the [...] "beautiful" [...] melody and hook by Ashthon Jones. The reviewer considered [...] "Violence" [...] a personal favorite, calling Lecrae's line [...] "Grew up under Tupac, bible verse and two glocks" [...] {{one of the most powerful}} lines on the album. Parlé Magazine also was favorable to the song, stating [...] "That track is definitely going places." [...] Jonathan Landrum of The Associated Press was favorable to the album, saying that [...] "in his sixth album 'Gravity,' Lecrae delivers a strong piece of work. He's not afraid to rap about his past mistakes, supplying inspirational rhymes filled with Christian values backed by well-produced secular hip-hop beats." [...] In its track-by-track review of the album, The Boombox stated that [...] "based on the warm reception to Church Clothes, this LP is set to stir the pot further in the realm of both of hip-hop and Christianity." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, declaring that Lecrae makes Gravitys various genre experiments and jumps in style [...] "sound effortless and natural". He asserted that [...] "while Rehab is the more rewarding album in the end, this one is more persuasive and immediate, making it an easy entry point into this gifted artist's discography." ...|$|E
