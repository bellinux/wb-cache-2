5|$|All {{students}} {{have the right to}} enter upper secondary education when they turn sixteen. Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable <b>drop-out</b> rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E

40|$|Non-response is {{a serious}} threat to the {{external}} validity of longitudinal psychosocial studies. Little is known about potential systematic differences between patients with coronary artery disease who complete a psychosocial study and those who drop out prematurely due to non-response, or whether <b>drop-outs</b> may have a different cardiovascular risk. We studied a cohort of 1132 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). At baseline, all patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Type D Scale (DS 14). At 12 months follow-up, 70. 8 % (n[*]=[*] 802) of patients completed both questionnaires, while 29. 2 % (n[*]=[*] 330) dropped out. We observed significant differences in socio-demographic, clinical, and psychological baseline characteristics between completers and <b>drop-outs.</b> <b>Drop-outs</b> were younger, more likely to smoke, but less often prescribed cardiovascular medications, including calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as compared with completers. <b>Drop-outs</b> more often had depression, anxiety, and negative affectivity, as compared with completers (all p-values < 0. 05). After a median follow-up of 4 years, we found no significant differences in mortality risk between completers and <b>drop-outs</b> (6. 5 vs. 7. 3 %; adjusted HR 1. 34, 95 % CI 0. 82 – 2. 19, respectively). In conclusion, a possible attrition bias occurred, as <b>drop-outs</b> and completers differed systematically on some socio-demographic, clinical, and psychological baseline characteristics. Despite these differences, this did not translate into a poorer short-term prognosis, as there were no differences in the mortality risk of completers vs. <b>drop-outs</b> after a median follow-up of 4 years. In future prospective studies, attention should be paid to attrition bias, and its possible impact on study results and implications should be discussed...|$|R

5|$|In the 2015-2016 school year, {{the school}} {{district}} had a total of 50,394 students, starting from early childhood/pre-kindergarten education through grade 12. The class of 2015 included 3,406 graduates with an annual <b>drop-out</b> rate in grades 9-12 of 1.4%. In 2016, the racial makeup of the district was 39.6% Hispanic, 34.4% White, 14.1% African American, 8.6% Asian, 0.4% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and 2.8% with two or more races. This results in Klein ISD being named as the 12th most diverse district {{in the state of}} Texas. Additionally, 40.8% of students in the district are economically disadvantaged, and 14.6% of the students are English Language Learners.

50|$|A {{well-known}} {{practical application}} of diversity reception is in wireless microphones, and in similar electronic {{devices such as}} wireless guitar systems. A wireless microphone with a non-diversity receiver (a receiver having only one antenna) is prone to random <b>drop-outs,</b> fades, noise, or other interference, especially if the transmitter (the wireless microphone) is in motion. A wireless microphone or sound system using diversity reception will switch to the other antenna within microseconds if one antenna experiences noise, providing an improved quality signal with fewer <b>drop-outs</b> and noise. Ideally, no <b>drop-outs</b> or noise will occur in the received signal.|$|R

Purcell was cast three days before the start of {{production}} and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E

This difficult co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street. Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present the languages of the region more evenly.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an explorative {{analysis}} about the causes of children’s high proportion of <b>drop-outs</b> from rural schools of Pakistan. For this purpose, simple random sampling technique was used by taking a sample size of 120 respondents from six villages of the rural areas of district Jhang, Pakistan in 2010. The major objectives of the said research were to investigate the socio-economic hurdles of the <b>drop-outs</b> of children from schools, to find out the attitude of parents towards the <b>drop-outs,</b> and finally to suggest the measures for solving the problems regarding <b>drop-outs</b> of rural children from schools. Initially, the pre-testing was done on ten respondents before starting the actual research. As a result of the said research, it was found that there are certain factors, e. g. uneducated parents, teachers’ behavior, low mental ability, bad habits, bad peer group and scarcity of educated people in the community, which not only affects the performance of the children but also ends it in the form of their drop out from school...|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, other {{researchers}} write that CBT studies have high <b>drop-out</b> rates {{compared to other}} treatments. At times, the CBT <b>drop-out</b> rates can be {{more than five times}} higher than other treatments groups. For example, the researchers provided statistics of 28 participants in a group receiving CBT therapy dropping out, compared to 5 participants in a group receiving problem-solving therapy dropping out, or 11 participants in a group receiving psychodynamic therapy dropping out. This high <b>drop-out</b> rate is also evident in the treatment of several disorders, particularly the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, which is commonly treated with CBT. Those treated with CBT have a high chance of dropping out of therapy before completion and reverting to their anorexia behaviors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} PROGRESA education grants on school enrollment. It looks at its effect on total school enrollment and in particular on school enrollment of <b>drop-outs,</b> i. e. those children who face a re-enrollment decision since they were not enrolled in school the year prior {{to the implementation of}} the PROGRESA program. Estimates of the impact of PROGRESA education grants on <b>drop-outs</b> and non-drop-outs are obtained applying difference estimation and maximum likelihood estimation of a reduced form equation for schooling decision. Differences in results between both groups of children are discussed looking at the distribution of marginal effects. PROGRESA did send <b>drop-outs</b> back to school. It had a larger effect on <b>drop-outs</b> than on non-drop-outs. However, for the particular group of girls who dropped out of school just before attending secondary school PROGRESA grants only had a minor effect. This last finding highlights the fact that determinants of the schooling decision are different for young girls and that PROGRESA grants do not provide a strong enough incentive to send them back to school.
