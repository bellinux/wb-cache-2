40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a utility}} power plant construction project using an option pricing {{model of the}} value of the capital investment. It includes descriptive factors frequently ignored in the valuation of capital investments by regulated firms, including lead time, lumpy and sequential cost outlays, irreversibility of expenditures, and uncertainty about regulatory outcomes <b>for</b> <b>completed</b> <b>projects.</b> The analysis shows the value of shorter lead time technologies, the value of flexibility to delay or abandon construction, the incentive to delay construction under uncertain regulation, and how cost recovery policies, such as possible disallowance of Allow for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC), create incentives to invest less, but to complete construction quickly. The analysis may also apply in unregulated contexts, where the value of a completed project is affected by taxation, the possibility of nationalization, or possible competitors' actions that create uncertain restrictions on potential profits. uncertain regulation, electric utilities, real option valuation, capital investment, regulatory incentives...|$|E
40|$|In {{this this}} version we migrate to Server-Side {{rendering}} (SSR) for improved SEO and performance. Other highlights include: Collection microsites can now configured via the admin interface, with any changes made instantly visible. Pagination replaced with an "infinite loading" model for retrieving domain objects (projects, tasks etc.). So, {{rather than having}} to navigate through pages of projects you can just keep scrolling down the page to continue loading. Tables columns throughout the site are now sortable, so you can quickly locate, for example, the data <b>for</b> <b>completed</b> <b>projects</b> with the most tasks. Tagging system implemented for projects. Rather than dealing with a clunky system of clicking through different categories/volumes looking for a project all projects are now loaded by default and can be filtered across multiple criteria to show, for example all "tagging" projects for "London". These tags are also fully configurable via the admin interface (so you can choose a different set of filters for each collection).

40|$|The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program reports {{its status}} to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) in March of each year. The program {{operates}} {{under the authority}} of DOE Order 413. 2 A, 'Laboratory Directed Research and Development' (January 8, 2001), which establishes DOE's requirements for the program while providing the Laboratory Director broad flexibility for program implementation. LDRD funds are obtained through a charge to all Laboratory programs. This report describes all ORNL LDRD research activities supported during FY 2004 and includes final reports <b>for</b> <b>completed</b> <b>projects</b> and shorter progress reports for projects that were active, but not completed, during this period. The FY 2004 ORNL LDRD Self-Assessment (ORNL/PPA- 2005 / 2) provides financial data about the FY 2004 projects and an internal evaluation of the program's management process. ORNL is a DOE multiprogram science, technology, and energy laboratory with distinctive capabilities in materials science and engineering, neutron science and technology, energy production and end-use technologies, biological and environmental science, and scientific computing. With these capabilities ORNL conducts basic and applied research and development (R&D) to support DOE's overarching national security mission, which encompasses science, energy resources, environmental quality, and national nuclear security. As a national resource, the Laboratory also applies its capabilities and skills to the specific needs of other federal agencies and customers through the DOE Work For Others (WFO) program. Information about the Laboratory and its programs is available on the Internet at <[URL] LDRD is a relatively small but vital DOE program that allows ORNL, as well as other multiprogram DOE laboratories, to select a limited number of R&D projects for the purpose of: (1) maintaining the scientific and technical vitality of the Laboratory; (2) enhancing the Laboratory's ability to address future DOE missions; (3) fostering creativity and stimulating exploration of forefront science and technology; (4) serving as a proving ground for new research; and (5) supporting high-risk, potentially high-value R&D. Through LDRD the Laboratory is able to improve its distinctive capabilities and enhance its ability to conduct cutting-edge R&D for its DOE and WFO sponsors. To meet the LDRD objectives and fulfill the particular needs of the Laboratory, ORNL has established a program with two components: the Director's R&D Fund and the Seed Money Fund. As outlined in Table 1, these two funds are complementary. The Director's R&D Fund develops new capabilities in support of the Laboratory initiatives, while the Seed Money Fund is open to all innovative ideas that have the potential for enhancing the Laboratory's core scientific and technical competencies. Provision for multiple routes of access to ORNL LDRD funds maximizes the likelihood that novel and seminal ideas with scientific and technological merit will be recognized and supported...|$|E

Project {{management}} {{often involves}} {{the selection of}} alternatives from various options for completion {{of one or more}} activities. In some cases in addition to uncertainty in cost and activity completion time, the reliability of the alternatives must also be considered.
