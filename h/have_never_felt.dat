5|$|One {{year after}} the death of the Joker during the events of , Batman is {{struggling}} {{to come to terms with}} the absence of his nemesis and the uncomfortable feeling that the pair shared a bond deeper than either could admit. Without the Joker's chaotic presence, Gotham's citizens <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> safer, and crime in the city has dramatically declined. However, this gives Batman's enemies, including Penguin, Two-Face, and Harley Quinn, a chance to unite with the singular goal of killing Batman.|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{indicates}} Potter {{was particularly}} {{sensitive to the}} openings and closings of her books (she insisted Benjamin Bunny end with the term [...] "rabbit-tobacco", for example), and, in the Flopsy Bunnies, the opening reflects her flair for the elevated diction sometimes encountered in her other books: [...] "It is said the effect of eating too much lettuce is 'soporific'." [...] Though the word 'soporific' is not generally encountered in literature for young children, Potter is aware of her audience's limitations and not only defines the word immediately but places it in context: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit." [...] She not only defines the word, but introduces rabbits as her subject. The line does not draw attention to itself (though Potter is intruding herself into the narrative), but rather gives the tale a conversational tone or {{a sense of the}} story being told aloud by a narrator. Because she immediately brings the audience's attention back to the rabbits, there is no danger she will become a character in the tale, and she is invisible through the remainder of the tale.|$|E
500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a blinker hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> before..." ...|$|E

500|$|At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser [...] {{and three}} destroyers shelled the Lunga {{perimeter}} for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight. Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion—led by Major Yukichi Kokusho—attacked the Raider's [...] "C" [...] company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning {{at least one}} platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kokusho's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was {{in relation to the}} U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, [...] "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. In my whole life I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so disappointed and helpless." [...] Twelve U.S. Marines were killed; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{called his}} U.S.-based {{advisers}} to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, {{as it would}} damage public morale. He also noted {{that because of the}} political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was {{despite the fact that the}} Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that [...] "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was [...] "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [...] political crisis". Johnson said to Taylor that [...] "Every time I get a military recommendation it seems to me that it calls for large-scale bombing. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> that this war will be won from the air." [...] At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy.|$|E
2500|$|The murders {{committed}} by John Christie were dramatised in the 1971 film 10 Rillington Place, {{in which he}} was portrayed by Richard Attenborough, who spoke of his ambivalence concerning the role: [...] "I do not like playing the part, but I accepted it at once without seeing the script. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so totally involved in any part as this. It is a most devastating statement on capital punishment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goldmann {{found the}} Jewish {{leadership}} in the U.S. divided, with no cohesive policy in place {{at a time when}} unity of [...] "intention and purpose was vital." [...] Deeply frustrated over this divided leadership, he said:'In all my years in Jewish politics, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so impotent, so grimly bitter as I did over this. All of us who speak for the Jewish people in those days—and I emphatically include myself—bear a share of the guilt.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Brantley, {{reviewing}} the 2007 Encores! concert for The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> the splendid sadness of 'Follies' as acutely as I did watching the emotionally transparent concert production...At almost any moment, {{to look at}} the faces of any of the principal performers...is to be aware of people both bewitched and wounded by the contemplation of who they used to be. When they sing, in voices layered with ambivalence and anger and longing, it is clear that it is their past selves whom they are serenading." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt still won Utah {{in each of}} {{the four}} presidential elections. Grant {{regarded}} that as [...] "one of the most serious conditions that has confronted me since I became President of the Church." [...] Later, when Utah voters agreed by plebiscite to become the 36th state to ratify the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, thus completing the process of ratification and repealing prohibition, Grant was devastated; in a general conference, he told the Latter-day Saints, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so humiliated in my life over anything as that the State of Utah voted for the repeal of Prohibition." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{appearing}} {{regularly for}} England in FIFA World Cup qualifying matches and friendly matches, Defoe was not {{named in the}} provisional England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and named only on a five-man standby list. He joined the squad for training in Germany, but returned to England when Wayne Rooney was cleared to play after having suffered a foot injury in April. He confessed that he was baffled by his omission, saying, [...] "I've been involved in every squad {{for the last two}} years and feel I've played a part in helping us to qualify. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> fitter and sharper than I was in training and believe I could have scored goals in the tournament. It's a strange decision and everybody I speak to thinks so as well." [...] Eriksson explained why Defoe was not selected for the England squad: [...] "Jermain had a very bad season. I don't think he deserved to go to the World Cup." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ali was not {{originally}} {{a member of}} the Democratic party but changed parties after listening to Representative Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). Ali was [...] "so enamored of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions that he changed his party affiliation from Green to Democratic." [...] Ali soon became [...] "the first elected President of the District 39 Democratic Club". Ali's political activity first gained media attention when he [...] "was the Legislative District 39 Coordinator for the Howard Dean presidential campaign in 2003 and early 2004." [...] After Dean failed to win the primary, Ali supported the John Kerry and John Edwards presidential ticket. During that election season, Ali became a full-time campaign volunteer for Rep. Chris Van Hollen, because of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions and his stance on the Iraq War. During Van Hollen's 2004 reelection campaign, Ali said [...] "I'm really motivated against this war and <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so animated before. I thought, 'What is the most head-turning thing I could possibly do?'" [...] and he [...] "bought 500 bumper stickers at a buck apiece and applied more than 400 to the car". It was noted that the family's other car was kept [...] "very pristine" [...] as [...] "That's the one his wife drives." [...] Later that year he was Co-Chair of the Montgomery County Democratic Spring Ball. Also in 2004, Ali, {{a member of the}} Montgomery County Muslim Council, helped plan [...] "the first Muslim-Jewish Day of Friendship" [...] with [...] "congregations Temple Shalom in Chevy Chase, Adat Shalom in Bethesda, Bethesda Jewish Congregation and Fabrangen Cheder" [...] to [...] "clean up a historic Underground Railroad stop in Germantown". Ali hoped the event would [...] "allow people to start lasting friendships and show the ability of these groups to come together for a common good." [...] In 2005, Ali's political activities expanded when he helped form the [...] "Longdraft Road Coalition", an organization opposing the expansion of this [...] "quiet, residential two-lane road to a bustling four-lane byway." [...] Ali became [...] "co-chairman of the 180-person plus group" [...] whose efforts were largely viewed as successful. In September 2005, Ali also co-organized [...] "The 2nd annual Montgomery County Muslim-Jewish Day of Friendship". In 2005, Ali was a campaign supporter of Jun Choi, the Democratic candidate for Mayor of Edison, New Jersey, which Choi won.|$|E
