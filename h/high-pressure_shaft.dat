25|$|The F3 is a two-shaft (or two spool) low-bypass turbofan. It {{features}} a two-stage fan (low-pressure compressor) on the low-pressure shaft, {{followed by a}} five-stage high-pressure compressor on the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>shaft.</b> The engine uses an annular combustor, which feeds a single-stage high-pressure turbine followed by a single-stage low-pressure turbine.

50|$|The {{outer port}} shaft {{was driven by}} a {{high-pressure}} turbine that exhausted into a medium pressure turbine driving the outer starboard shaft. The two middle shafts, capable of reversal, were each driven by a low-pressure turbine, which in emergencies could each be driven by exhaust from the <b>high-pressure</b> turbine. Each <b>shaft</b> drove a four-bladed bronze propeller for a designed sea speed of 19 knots. Steam was provided by six double-ended and four single-ended forced draft boilers divided between two boiler rooms. On trials in the Clyde Calgarian attained 21.25 knots and on a double run for contract speed made 20.63 knots, a knot and a half above required service speed.|$|R
40|$|Filament winding {{technology}} {{is one of}} the fundamental methods in composite material fields, which needs a high degree of automation. It is the process in which continuous strands or filament of fibres are wound on the mandrel, which is more suitable for making <b>high-pressure</b> vessels, pipes, <b>shaft</b> and ducts. The filament winding machines have existed in enterprises or factories, which are high costs, heavy, complex control system, simple products so far. This paper describes {{the development of a new}} 3 -axis filament winding machine for the production of wound composite cylinders, which is designed to be more portable, lightweight, low costs, high efficiency and easy control system compared to previous machines. It relates to design hardware control system and the software control system. Based on three axes movement principles, a 3 -axis prototype filament winding machine has been developed. The x-axis is the movement left and right of the carriage, the y-axis is the rotation of mandrel and the z-axis is the movement of the feeder. Arduino Uno and CNC (Computer Numeral Control) shield module are used as hardware of control system. Universal G-Code Sender (UGS) and Grbl (G-codes) are adopted as software control system. In conclusion, a protable 3 -axis filament winding machine has been successfully designed and performed, which offers potential filament wound composite cylinders with simple control system...|$|R
50|$|Increasing overall {{pressure}} ratio implies raising the high-pressure compressor exit temperature. This implies a higher <b>high-pressure</b> <b>shaft</b> speed, {{to maintain the}} datum blade tip Mach number on the rear compressor stage. Stress considerations, however, may limit the shaft speed increase, causing the original compressor to throttle-back aerodynamically to a lower {{pressure ratio}} than datum.|$|E

50|$|The F124 {{engine is}} {{fundamentally}} a low bypass, two spool engine (meaning {{that there are}} two rotational shafts, a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>shaft</b> and a low-pressure shaft). The fan/low-pressure compressor section is made of three stages with titanium blades. The first stage has 30 un-shrouded blades, and the overall pressure ratio for the three stage fan section is 2.5:1. Some of the air is bypassed (Bypass ratio of 0.472:1), and the rest is fed to the high-pressure compressor section.|$|E
50|$|Selection of the internal/external drive {{arrangement}} is often idiosyncratic. The service {{life of the}} <b>high-pressure</b> <b>shaft</b> seal {{can be difficult to}} predict, and it may safely be assumed that the seal will cost a good deal more than the motor itself. For instance, a 2 in, 150 psi seal for a 50 hp motor will cost $2,000, whereas the motor itself is half that much. Generally, the combination of vessel pressure, shaft diameter, and fan speed encountered in autoclaves is such as to make the use of a shaft seal reasonably practicable.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: One key aspect when {{developing}} a robust health management system for turbines {{is the development}} of accurate and robust fault classifiers. The paper illustrates the application of a hybrid Stochastic-Neuro-Fuzzy-Inference System to fault diagnostics and prognostics for turbine performance. The random fluctuations of turbine performance parameters in different varying operating conditions are modeled using a multivariate stochastic model. At any time, the fault risk condition is approached as a conditional reliability problem based on the measurement of parameter deviations from the normal operating condition. The paper illustrates the application of the proposed system to a typical aircraft turbofan engine for in-flight engine performance diagnostic and prognostic. 1 TURBINE THROUGH FLOW ANALYSIS MODELING Figure 1 shows a sketch of a typical turbofan engine including the performance parameters considered herein for fault diagnostic and prognostic. Figures 2 and 3 show pressure variations {{as a function of the}} <b>high-pressure</b> <b>shaft</b> speed stationary conditions versus highly transient operating conditions, respectively. It is obvious from these figures that although for slowly varying conditions the pressure closely follows a nonlinear relationship with shaft speed, for highly transient operating conditions the pressure deviates from this nonlinear path due to highly transient conditions and significant changes in the inlet conditions...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{turbines}} are {{fitted with}} rolling element bearings, which transfer loads and supports the shafts. The {{interaction between the}} rotating and stationary parts in the bearing causes a conversion {{of some of the}} power into heat, influencing the thermal behaviour of the entire bearing chamber. To improve thermal modelling of bearing chambers, this work focused on modelling of the heat generated and dissipated around the bearings, in terms of magnitude and location, and the interaction with the components/systems in the bearing chamber. A thermal network model and a finite element model of an experimental <b>high-pressure</b> <b>shaft</b> ball bearing and housing were generated and a comparison to test rig results have been conducted. Nevertheless, the purpose of the thermal matching process that focused on the finite element model and experimental data is to provide a template for predicting temperatures and heat transfers for other bearing models. The result of the analysis shows that predictions of the thermal network are considerate, despite the simplifications. However, lower relative errors were obtained in the finite element model compared to the thermal network model. For both methods, the highest relative error is seen to occur during transient (acceleration and deceleration). This observation highlights the importance of boundary conditions and definitions: surrounding temperatures, heat split and the oil flow, influencing both the heat transfer and heat generation. These aspects, incorporated in the modelling and benchmarked with experimental data, can help facilitate other related cases where there is limited or no experimental data for validation...|$|E
