40|$|Foci {{of tissue}} {{sponginess}} and necrosis in the cerebral cortex and the subcortical white matter were studied histopathologically in three cases of Neuro-Behçet's disease. The following results were obtained: Lesions in the cerebral cortex and the subcortical white matter were less severe {{than those in}} the brain stem. Though recent and older foci coexisted, glial scar foci were rare. Necrotic foci in the cerebral cortex and the subcortical white matter were vascular in origin. Foci were more numerous in the cerebral cortex than in the subcortical white matter. Foci were relatively numerous in the temporal lobe, especially in the hippocampus (Case 2), and were not so numerous in the frontal lobe. Mental symptoms such as hypospontaneity, blunted affect, euphoria, distrubance of immediate and recent memory, <b>forced</b> <b>laughing</b> and crying and bradyphrenia are attributable to brain stem lesions, but some cases of Neuro-Behçet's disease with numerous necrotic foci in the hippocampus and adjacent structures are believed to have hippocampal amnesia superimosed on brain stem symptoms...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper an autopsy case report of Neuro-Behçet's {{syndrome}} has been made and patho-histological studies of the brain of the 8 autopsy cases reported previously {{as well as those}} of the present case have been conducted. The present case was a 47 -years old man. In the ninth years after the onset of symptoms in the oral cavity and in the genitalia he was troubled repeatedly with diplopia. Gradually there appeared such symptoms as the disturbance of his gait, <b>forced</b> <b>laughing,</b> disturbance of speech, ataxia, and the inflammation at the sites of injection. He had remission and aggravation of these symptoms. However, he died of respiratory paralysis 17 years after the onset of oral aphtha and 8 years after the onset of diplopia. In the patho-histological observation of this case there were seen perivascular cell infiltration covering the entire cerebral parenchyma as well as a portion of meninges, revealing a picture of chronic disseminated panmeningoencephalitis and cerebral abscess of medulla oblongata. In addition, there were fibrinoid degeneration of the blood vessel wall and such degenerative changes in the blood vessels as fibrosis and proliferation of collagen fibers; and also circumscribed foci of glia cell proliferation, softening cavities and abnomal proliferation of consumptive pigments. These pathlogical changes were recognized in the entire brain, but they were especially prominent in brain-stem. There were no pathologica changes in the optic nerves and in the spinal cord. In the investigations of the patho-histological picture of the brain in our case as well as in the cases reported in literature, the common findings in Neuro-Behçet's syndrome are extensive disseminated perivascular cell infiltration of the brain, softning accompanied by a moderate proliferation of microglia cells and degenerative changes of the blood vessel wall. while these pathological changes are especially marked in the brain-stem, to a greater degree in the white matter than in the grey matter. Neuro-Behçet's syndrome has been found to resemble periarteritis nodosa and clinically it shows many common pathologic changes as found in collagene disease. Hence, it is assumed that Behçet's syndrome belongs to the collagene disease...|$|E
