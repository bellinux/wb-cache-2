This experience in medical' education also brought to fruition the publication of a textbook, <b>General</b> <b>Pathology,</b> in 1966.

2500|$|As a {{field of}} general inquiry and research, {{pathology}} addresses four components of disease: cause, mechanisms of development (pathogenesis), structural alterations of cells (morphologic changes), {{and the consequences of}} changes (clinical manifestations).

[...] Further divisions in specialty exist {{on the basis of the}} involved sample types (comparing, for example, cytopathology, hematopathology, and histopathology), organs (as in renal pathology), and physiological systems (oral pathology), as well as on the basis of the focus of the examination (as with forensic pathology).|$|E

[...] These diagnostic techniques are often performed in combination with <b>general</b> <b>pathology</b> procedures and are themselves often essential to developing new understanding of the pathogenesis of a given disease and tracking the progress of disease in specific medical cases. [...] Examples of important subdivisions in medical imaging include radiology (which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray radiography) magnetic resonance imaging, [...] medical ultrasonography (or ultrasound), endoscopy, elastography, tactile imaging, thermography, medical photography, nuclear medicine and functional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography. [...] Though they do not strictly relay images, readings from diagnostics tests involving electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and electrocardiography often give hints as to the state and function of certain tissues in the brain and heart respectively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We want to {{demonstrate}} a retrospective analysis of the patient group who received cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging in our department focussing on indications extending the established range. For postprocessing purposes eFilm Workstation 1. 8. 3 (Merge eFilm, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was used. Examinations were either recorded on CD-ROM or documented as printouts. Beside established indications we noticed {{an increasing number of}} examinations of traumatologic disorders. New diagnostic possibilities were seen for osteomyelitis and orthodontic problems. Concerning high-contrast structures CBCT proved to be an equivalent alternative to CT leading to reduced radiation exposures of patients. Furthermore, the number of conventional tomographies has markedly decreased. In <b>general,</b> <b>pathologies</b> of the facial skeleton offer a large number of indications for CBCT examinations, but technical limitations have to be kept in mind...|$|R
50|$|Theory of Modernization, {{conceived}} {{in terms of}} development of different scientific/scholarly and practice-based forms of rationality and ‘tacit knowing’ (not merely instrumental rationality, but also interpretive and argumentative rationality), historically situated in decisive actors, institutions, and collective experiences. A focus on general modernization processes, but also on special ones - e.g. in Scandinavia: Multiple Modernities. A Tale of Scandinavian Experiences, 2011 (Norwegian version Norsk og moderne, 2010). These countries are characterized by general trust, rule of law, and a general and generous welfare state - how come?

2500|$|Neuropathology is {{the study}} of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either {{surgical}} biopsies or sometimes whole brains in the case of autopsy. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery. [...] In many English-speaking countries, neuropathology is considered a subfield of anatomical pathology. [...] A physician who specializes in neuropathology, usually by completing a fellowship after a residency in anatomical or <b>general</b> <b>pathology,</b> is called a neuropathologist. In day-to-day clinical practice, a neuropathologist is a consultant for other physicians. If a disease of the nervous system is suspected, and the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive methods, a biopsy [...] of nervous tissue is taken from the brain or spinal cord to aid in diagnosis. [...] Biopsy is usually requested after a mass is detected by medical imaging. With autopsies, the principal work of the neuropathologist is to help in the post-mortem diagnosis of various conditions that affect the central nervous system. [...] Biopsies can also consist of the skin. Epidermal nerve fiber density testing (ENFD) is a more recently developed neuropathology test in which a punch skin biopsy is taken to identify small fiber neuropathies by analyzing the nerve fibers of the skin. This test is becoming available in select labs as well as many universities; it replaces the traditional nerve biopsy test as less invasive.|$|E

The room in which the experiments took place was an isolated one, connected with the laboratory of experimental physiology, and belonged to that part of the university set aside for Bottazzi's exclusive use. Nothing could have been further from the ordinary stuffy back parlor of the 'materializing medium.'

60|$|In {{the first}} place, even now, when a four years' {{curriculum}} is required, the time allotted for medical education is too brief. A {{young man of}} eighteen beginning to study medicine is probably absolutely ignorant {{of the existence of}} such a thing as anatomy, or physiology, or indeed of any branch of physical science. He comes into an entirely new world; he addresses himself to a kind of work of which he has not the smallest experience. Up to that time his work has been with books; he rushes suddenly into work with things, which is as different from work with books as anything can well be. I am quite sure that a very considerable number of young men spend a very large portion of their first session in simply learning how to learn subjects which are entirely new to them. And yet recollect that in this period of four years they have to acquire a knowledge of all the branches of a great and responsible practical calling of medicine, surgery, obstetrics, <b>general</b> <b>pathology,</b> medical jurisprudence, and so forth. Anybody who knows what these things are, and who knows what is the kind of work which is necessary to give a man the confidence which will enable him to stand at the bedside and say to the satisfaction of his own conscience what shall be done, and what shall not be done, must be aware that if a man has only four years to do all that in he will not have much time to spare. But that is not all. As I have said, the young man comes up, probably ignorant of the existence of science; he has never heard a word of chemistry, he has never heard a word of physics, he has not the smallest conception of the outlines of biological science; and all these things have to be learned as well and crammed into the time which in itself is barely sufficient to acquire a fair amount of that knowledge which is requisite for the satisfactory discharge of his professional duties.|$|E
