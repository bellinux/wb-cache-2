40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} a method to recover the linseed oil from oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion by a rotating disk filtration system. The influence of transmembrane pressure (TMP), disk rotating speed, and disk geometry on permeate flux and oil recovery has been studied. Hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes with average pore size 0. 15 mu m and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes with 50 kDa molecular weight cut off (MWCO) were used. The results showed that the rotating <b>disk</b> <b>module</b> can produce high permeate fluxes. The highest permeate fluxes were obtained when using a rotating disk equipped with vanes, which generated the largest shear rates at the membrane. This study demonstrated that hydrophilic membranes were suitable for demulsification of linseed oil-in-water emulsion. The linseed oil droplets in the emulsions could be separated by concentration tests due to the coalescence of oil droplets in the concentration polarization layer. For an initial oil mass of 46. 5 g, 35. 2 g supernatant oil was obtained owing to oil droplets coalescence. This supernatant oil represented a recovery of 76 %. The rotating disk with vanes consumed less specific energy than smooth disk in the concentration tests. (c) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of dairy}} {{effluent}} by membrane filtration permits to recover both reusable water and nutrients, but its advantages are weakened by concentration polarization and subsequent membrane fouling as they cause flux decline and permeate quality deterioration. In order to control flux decline, model dairy effluent was treated by shear-enhanced membrane filtration in this study, {{and the role}} of foulants was analyzed. For ultrafiltration (UF) of dairy effluent, protein adsorption and deposition caused flux decline and hydrophilic modification of membranes can reduced this fouling. While for nanofiltration (NF), flux decline was mitigated by the presence of casein micelles, and when the caseins were removed by UF pretreatment, whey proteins would agglomerate through calcium bridges, resulting in severe flux decline during NF concentration. Even if most of proteins were retained by UF pretreatment, free calcium ions increased due to the absence of casein micelles, also inducing flux decline at high concentration factor. Thus, the two-step UF/NF process was not found advantageous as it did not improve the average permeate flux nor permeate quality, while increasing significantly the process energy consumption. This conclusion was valid not only for rotating <b>disk</b> <b>module</b> (RDM) but also for vibratory shear-enhanced process (VSEP), which is available in large membrane area with a low energy consumption.

40|$|Membrane fouling and flux decline are {{important}} problems in chicory juice clarification by membrane process for inulin production. In this study, a rotating <b>disk</b> <b>module</b> (RDM) equipped with four micro- and ultra-filtration membranes {{was used to}} treat raw chicory root extract, and the permeate flux behavior at high-shear conditions was investigated. Increasing disk rotating speed can reduce concentration polarization and cake fouling, and thus improve permeate flux. However, a moderate rotating speed of 1000 rpm was a good compromise between energy saving and polarization/cake layers control, while a higher disk rotating speed can be used at regular intervals for on-line membrane cleaning. Threshold and limiting fluxes were determined in chicory juice clarification at 1000 rpm and 50 degrees C by pressure stepping experiments, and they were almost independent of pore size, permeability and fouling extent, with ranges of 130 - 140 L m(- 2) h(- 1) for threshold and 155 - 168 L m(- 2) h(- 1) for limiting flux. Below threshold flux, filtration resistance is independent of flux, while above it, membrane fouling increases with increasing permeate flux. This work confirmed that threshold flux criterion was also applicable to high-shear microfiltration and ultrafiltration, and size-dependent shear-induced and Brownian back diffusions {{played an important role}} in such filtration resistance transition. Moreover, both limiting flux and flux fluctuations should be avoided in practical applications because they cause high fouling and flux decline. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Transaction {{processing}} workloads impose heavy {{demands on}} the memory and storage sub-systems and oten result in large amounts of franc in I/O and memory buses. In this paper, we design a hierarchical computing system that utilizes processing elements distributed across the storage hierarchy, {{with the objective of}} reducing the data movement between the storage subsystem and the processing units. The computing elements can be commodity processing elements or specialized devices similar to active memory <b>modules</b> and active <b>disk</b> devices emerging from other research groups. Database queries are partitioned across the different layers of the hierarchy depending on the anity of code to a particular layer. Commands percolate down into the lower layers of the hierarchy and partially processed information flows up into the higher layers, where if necessary subsequent operations are performed. All layers actively participate in the processing of the transaction by doing tasks for which they are particularly suited. We evaluate the effectiveness of the hierarchical computing model using the SimOS full system simulator. On TPC-H queries, hierarchical computing systems with 4 and 8 memory modules can yield speedups in the range of 1. 18 x to 1. 5 x when compared with equivalent shared-memory multiprocessor systems. Likewise, on a hierarchical system with 2 memory <b>modules</b> and 4 <b>disk</b> <b>modules,</b> we see speedups between 1. 07 x and 1. 27 x with respect to a 8 -way SMP system, even though the hierarchical system has one less processor. In comparison to uniprocessors, the speedups are between 2. 9 x and 3. 9 x for the 4 -way hierarchical system, up to 7. 2 x for the 8 -way hierarchical system and up to 6. 8 x for a hierarchical computing system with 2 memory <b>modules</b> and 4 <b>disk</b> <b>modules.</b> We also implement the hierarchical computing paradigm on SMP hardware, however, bus contention is still seen to limit performance...|$|R

40|$|Treatment of {{wastewater}} {{containing a}} cleaning-in-place detergent was investigated {{by using a}} rotating <b>disk</b> <b>module</b> equipped with a nanofiltration (NF) membrane. At a rotational speed of 2000 rpm, a pH 7. 2 and 25 degrees C. the permeate flux reached a plateau at 350 Lm(- 2) h(- 1) above 35 bar while rejection of conductivity and COD were respectively 93 and 97 %. When a pretreatment by ultrafiltration (UF) was carried out before the NF, the NF flux increased linearly with TMP to reach 450 Lm(- 2) h(- 1) at 40 bar while COD of NF permeate was a little lower than without pretreatment. Both permeate flux and conductivity rejection increased with increasing pH. High membrane shear rates prevented flux decline with time, as surfactant molecules were dragged away from membrane surface, preventing surfactant aggregates formation. The disk rotational speed necessary for flux stability increased with TMP from 1000 rpm at 10 bar to 2000 rpm at 30 bar. Increasing feed pH had a similar effect by enhancing electrostatic repulsion between surfactant molecules and membrane. Raising the temperature to 45 degrees C increased the permeate flux to over 500 Lm(- 2) h(- 1) at 30 bar and 2000 rpm. This work confirms the high performance of high shear dynamic filtration in detergent wastewater treatment by NF system {{both in terms of}} permeate flux and ion and COD rejections due to reduction in concentration polarization, so that a UF pretreatment was not necessary.

40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanical}} {{nature of}} the magnetic disks limits the possi-bility of significant improvement of the I/O performance of the magnetic disk storage systems currently in use. The use of magnetic disk stor-age system has become an obstacle to the performance development of critical applications. This paper describes an implementation of a remote non-volatile RAM disk (abbreviated as NVDisk) over Fiber Channel net-work. Read and write latencies are drastically reduced and thus the I/O performance of the storage system is improved by order of magnitudes. We implemented an NVDisk target driver to provide full standard SCSI command set support, so a virtual disk can be constructed {{for use in the}} storage area network. NVDisk does not engage the foreground server’s CPU and main memory resources, so it can undertake extremely heavy workloads. In addition, we implemented a Virtual <b>Disk</b> (VD) <b>module</b> in the Linux kernel, which used a memory pool and backup disks to form a virtual transparent appliance and achieved the encapsulation of the ramdisk. With this, snapshot-based online backup mechanisms can be carried out. The whole system was built in the FC SAN environment, so the NVDisk is fine scalable and can be shared easily between servers. ...|$|R
