40|$|Narratives {{have emerged}} {{in the area of}} second {{language}} (L 2) writing and have played a key role as a proper research method. Reflective narratives have identified significant benefits by analyzing the writer’s experiences and insider perspectives in depth. Furthermore, stories shared by writers have validity in enriching their understanding further about personal realities and unraveling interpretive accounts with a critical eye. However, few studies demonstrate the findings of writing problems that students encounter and offer suggestions for teaching writing based on students’ experiences and practices of writing in English utilizing their detailed reflective narratives, especially in EFL contexts. This study focuses mainly on broadening possibilities for writing approaches suitable for teaching contexts as teacher development. The data analysis employed the categorization of 15 Japanese EFL undergraduates’ reflective narratives in three phases: the careful reading of all sentences in their reflective accounts of writing in English, the development of a temporary coding system, and the evaluation of the reliability of the coding system. The research findings show that the participants referred to the further importance of written structures (<b>e.</b> g., <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and thesis statements), reader awareness for English writing at the university level, and joint work in the writing classroom.

Children were trained to find the main idea in one-and two-paragraph texts and took pre- and posttests in which they were asked to write the main ideas contained in one-, and six- to eight-paragraph texts. The main ideas contained in these texts either were explicitly stated (<b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> first or last) or were implicit (<b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> missing). Children's performance improved from pre- to posttest, although the effect of <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> placement was evident at both test times (performance on topic-sentence-first paragraphs was better than on topic-sentence-last paragraphs, which was, in turn, better than performance on topic-sentence-missing paragraphs).

40|$|Good {{composition}} {{is the one}} which creates clear impression of unity (Vivian and Jackson, 1961 : 32). In addition, a good composition must be unified on two levels. First, it must have an overall unity that means each paragraph of the composition must {{be related to the}} thesis statement as the central idea which is stated in the introductory paragraph. Second, the individual support paragraphs (paragraph 2, paragraph 3, and so on) must also exhibit internal unity. It means that the supporting sentences of each paragraph must be related to its <b>topic</b> <b>sentence.</b> This study is intended to reveal how far the third semester English Department students of Widya Mandala Catholic University can apply their knowledge in writing unified compositions. As they learn descriptive writing, the writer analyzes the unity as encountered in their descriptive compositions. The analysis covered the analysis of unity in the paragraph and unity in the whole composition. To carry out this study, the writer took the third semester English Department students of Widya Mandala University as the subjects of this study. The data were taken from their final test papers. As stated previously, the analysis of the data covered the analysis of unity in the paragraph and unity in the whole composition. To analyze the unity in the paragraph, the writer identified the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> of each paragraph and evaluated the relationship between the supporting <b>sentences</b> and its <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> while to analyze the unity in the whole composition, the writer identified the thesis statement of each composition and evaluated the relationship between each <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> and its thesis statement. The analysis of unity in the paragraph showed that most paragraphs under study were disunified while the rest were unified. There were two factors that violated the unity in those paragraphs. They are the presence of more than one <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> and the irrelevant relationship between some supporting <b>sentences</b> and the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence.</b> In addition, the analysis of the unity in the whole composition showed that all compositions under study were disunified. There were also some factors that made all compositions under study disunified. They are the absence of thesis statement as the central idea of the composition, the disunity in one or some or all paragraphs of the compositions, and finally, the irrelevant relationship between one or two <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and the thesis statement. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that all students under study still found difficulties in creating unity in their compositions especially in writing composition with one thesis statement, in making all paragraphs of the composition unfied, and developing the thesis statement in several paragraphs which support the thesis statement itself. Concerning the result of this study, it is suggested that the teachers should train the students in forming thesis statements as the central idea of a composition as well as elaborate it into several <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> by making an outline of a composition. It is also suggested that the teachers should keep training the students to create unity in the paragraph since one or two or all paragraphs are disunfied in all students’ compositions under study...|$|R

For students with LD, challenges in written expression are more intensive than their typical peers. Without effective written expression supports and instruction, such as procedural facilitators, students {{with and without}} LD may be negatively impacted across academic areas and postschool outcomes. While research exists on procedural facilitators, little addresses how to sustain written expression gains after supports have been removed. Using a quasi-experimental design, secondary students with (n = 8) and without (n = 66) LD in written expression used a series of three procedural facilitators – from the most (i. e., prompts for the planning and organization process) to mid-way (i. <b>e.,</b> brainstorming and <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> prompts) to the least support (i. e., brainstorming prompts). To begin this study, students completed a written expression pretest. Next, for each level of procedural facilitator, from the most to the least support, students wrote an essay with each. Last, students completed two posttests without the use of procedural facilitators two weeks and then four weeks later. All written expression prompts were for expository, five-paragraph essays, and preselected between the researchers and the teachers. Gains in written expression were analyzed with repeated measures, within factors ANOVAs with post-hoc analysis using students 2 ̆ 7 essays scores, derived from a rubric. Post-hoc analyses (i. e., Bonferroni) were used to understand if significant differences in written expression occurred between each level of graphic organizer.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{experimental}} study aims {{to investigate the}} effect of different task variance that involves Providing <b>Topic</b> <b>Sentence</b> and Providing Signal Words as independent variables on student’s writing proficiency which covers complexity and coherence as dependent variables. Two groups {{of the first year}} students of English Department at Jambi University in Indonesia were selected as participants in this study. Each group consists of 30 students. Group I was required to perform the writing task that is provided <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> (PTS). Group II was required to perform the writing task that is provided signal words (PSW). The results of the test were rated or scored by using analytical and holistic rating systems. The data were analyzed statistically by using Independent Sample T – Test and Correlation. The findings of the study showed that on average, Group I has higher level of effect on student’s writing proficiency (M = 72. 57, SE = 1. 81) than the effect of Group II on student’s writing proficiency (M = 56. 50, SE = 2. 16). This difference is significant (t (58) = 5. 70; p < 0. 05). Furthermore, the interactions among the components of complexity have strong correlation. Then, positive relationships among the components of coherence are also statistically proved. Therefore, the null hypothesis which says that there is no effect of different task variance that involves Providing <b>Topic</b> <b>Sentence</b> and Providing Signal Words on student’s writing proficiency which covers complexity and coherence can be rejected. Based on these findings we conclude that Providing <b>Topic</b> <b>Sentence</b> helps students much better to develop paragraph writing than Providing Signal Words. ...|$|R

The interview was conducted in 2013 and in this clip the interviewee is responding with possible ways to transfer the writing methods from this course to other courses. Brief excerpt from interview: [The instructor] likes a really detailed outline. My outlines, I would do the introduction, body, conclusion, and then in there I would maybe have a <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> for each thing or each paragraph that I would write for the different sections. What [the instructor] likes is actually writing not only the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> but what you would put in there... When you finally do the final paper, you do some grammatical changes... Since [his] class, I do still make a little more detailed outline, but I {{go back to my}} old way because it takes me forever to even write the outline...|$|R
40|$|Conference Theme: Curriculum Development, Implementation, and ReviewSession 4 Students at the University of Hong Kong {{now take}} a first year general English for {{academic}} purposes course, followed by a disciplinary English course later in their degree. New disciplinary English courses for Faculty of Arts students include a number of written academic language features that did not appear in past courses. This paper focuses {{on one of these}} features: Inductive rhetoric at the paragraph level of writing, where the main idea is not summarized in a <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> placed early in the paragraph. Inductive and deductive rhetoric have drawn limited interest from contemporary applied linguists, but scholars of more traditional approaches of enquiry such as contrastive rhetoric and composition studies have offered some useful insights, including that Asian writers generally prefer inductive rhetoric, while westerners generally prefer deductive rhetoric. The response by some writing instructors has been to try to teach Asians to be more deductive in their academic writing. At the whole-text level, this may be appropriate, but past research has indicated that the emphasis on deductive paragraphing (i. e., beginning each paragraph with a <b>topic</b> <b>sentence)</b> in teaching and assessment may be misguided. This paper picks up from long-standing doubts about the actual use of <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> in professional academic writing. The paper theorizes why teachers of second language writing have emphasized deductive paragraph rhetoric, why inductive rhetoric in paragraphs is a feature worth teaching in humanities and social science writing courses, and then suggests what functions inductive rhetoric performs in sophisticated humanities and social science writing...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} to recognizing sentiment polarity in Chinese reviews based on <b>topic</b> sentiment <b>sentences</b> is presented. Considering {{the features of}} Chinese reviews, we firstly identify the topic of a review using an n-gram matching approach. To extract candidate <b>topic</b> sentiment <b>sentences,</b> we compute the semantic similarity between a given sentence and the ascertained topic and meanwhile determine whether the sentence is subjective. A certain number of these sentences are then selected as representatives according to their semantic similarity value with relation to the topic. The average value of the representative <b>topic</b> sentiment <b>sentences</b> is calculated and taken as the sentiment polarity of a review. Experiment {{results show that the}} proposed method is feasible and can achieve relatively high precision. ...|$|R
