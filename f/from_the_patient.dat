5|$|Assessment {{of motives}} {{in a medical}} setting is usually based on {{precursors}} to the incident, circumstances, and information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> However, limited studies show that professional assessments tend to suggest more manipulative or punitive motives than personal assessments.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} {{will be unable}} to provide care to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
40|$|Surveying the {{literature}} on the assessment of quality of care <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> perspective, <b>the</b> concept has often been operationalized as patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction has been a widely investigated subject in health care research, and dozens of measuring instruments were developed during the past decade. Quality of care <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> perspective, however, has been investigated only very recently, and only a few measuring instruments have explicitly been developed for the assessment of quality of care <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> perspective. <b>The</b> authors consider <b>patient</b> satisfaction as an indicator of quality of care <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> perspective. This review is concerned with the question of whether any reliable and valid instruments have been developed to measure quality of care <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> perspective.

25|$|In {{very severe}} myelosuppression, which occurs in some regimens, {{almost all the}} bone marrow stem cells (cells that produce white and red blood cells) are destroyed, meaning {{allogenic}} or autologous bone marrow cell transplants are necessary. (In autologous BMTs, cells are removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterward; in allogenic BMTs, the source is a donor.) However, some patients still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} {{retrieved}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> using a transvaginal technique called transvaginal oocyte retrieval, involving an ultrasound-guided needle piercing the vaginal wall {{to reach the}} ovaries. Through this needle follicles can be aspirated, and the follicular fluid is passed to an embryologist to identify ova. It is common to remove between ten and thirty eggs. The retrieval procedure usually takes between 20 and 40 minutes, depending {{on the number of}} mature follicles, and is usually done under conscious sedation or general anaesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Collateral {{information}} or parallel information is information obtained from family, friends or treatment providers of the patient. Some jurisdictions require consent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> to obtain this information while others do not. For example, {{with a patient}} who {{is thought to be}} paranoid about people following him or spying on him, this information can be helpful discern if these thoughts are more or less likely to be based in reality. Past episodes of suicide attempts or violent behavior can be confirmed or disproven.|$|E

25|$|Method of storing the material. Wrap the scabs {{carefully}} in paper {{and put them}} into a small container bottle. Cork it tightly so that the activity is not dissipated. The container must not be exposed to sunlight or warmed beside a fire. It is best to carry it for some time on the person so that the scabs dry naturally and slowly. The container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|E
25|$|The CBC {{provides}} a quantified {{measure of the}} different cells in the whole blood sample <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> Such cells examined for in this test include red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes). A common sign of renal cell carcinoma is anaemia whereby the patient exhibits deficiency in red blood cells. CBC tests are vital as a screening tool for examination the health of patient prior to surgery. Inconsistencies with platelet counts are also common amongst these cancer patients and further coagulation tests, including Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) should be considered.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of Rita and Charlie, Lofty was left to run the ED and began to {{struggle}} when disruptive patients were admitted. Since there was a staff shortage, Lofty hired agency nurse Diane Stuart (Catherine Skinner). When Lofty caught Diane sleeping on the job, she revealed {{she and her husband}} had recently separated, which Lofty sympathised with and so, gives her a second chance. Later, Lofty, Dylan and Diane are with a patient in a lift when the lift breaks down and the patient flatlines. As Lofty prepares to resuscitate, Diane fails to remove her hand <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and is electrocuted, killing herself.|$|E

25|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{involves}} an artery or vein <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> being implanted to bypass narrowings or occlusions in the coronary arteries. Several arteries and veins can be used, however internal mammary artery grafts have demonstrated significantly better long-term patency rates than great saphenous vein grafts. In patients {{with two or}} more coronary arteries affected, bypass surgery is associated with higher long-term survival rates compared to percutaneous interventions. In patients with single vessel disease, surgery is comparably safe and effective, and may be a treatment option in selected cases. Bypass surgery has higher costs initially, but becomes cost-effective in the long term. A surgical bypass graft is more invasive initially but bears less risk of recurrent procedures (but these may be again minimally invasive).|$|E
25|$|In September it was {{announced}} that an 18-year-old male patient in France with beta-thalassemia major had been successfully treated. Beta-thalassemia major is an inherited blood disease in which beta haemoglobin is missing and patients are dependent on regular lifelong blood transfusions. The technique used a lentiviral vector to transduce the human ß-globin gene into purified blood and marrow cells obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> in June 2007. The patient's haemoglobin levels were stable at 9 to 10 g/dL. About a third of the hemoglobin contained the form introduced by the viral vector and blood transfusions were not needed. Further clinical trials were planned. Bone marrow transplants are the only cure for thalassemia, but 75% of patients do not find a matching donor.|$|E
25|$|By type of procedure: Amputation {{involves}} {{cutting off}} a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration {{is also an}} example. Resection is the removal of all of an internal organ or body part, or a key part (lung lobe; liver quadrant) of such an organ or body part that has its own name or code designation. Replantation involves reattaching a severed body part. Reconstructive surgery involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. Excision is the cutting out or removal of only part of an organ, tissue, or other body part <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> Transplant surgery is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the patient. Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.|$|E

25|$|Another legal {{difficulty}} connected with modern pharmacopoeias is the inclusion {{in some of}} them of synthetic chemical remedies, the processes for preparing which have been patented, whilst the substances are sold under trade-mark names. The scientific chemical name is often long and unwieldy, and the physician prefers when writing a prescription to use the shorter name under which it is sold by the patentees. In this case the pharmacist is compelled to use the more expensive patented article, which may lead to complaints <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> If the physician were {{to use the same}} article under its pharmacopoeial name when the patented article is prescribed, they would become open to prosecution by the patentee for infringement of patent rights. Hence the only solution is for the physician to use the chemical name (which cannot be patented) as given in the Pharmacopoeia, or, for those synthetic remedies not included in the Pharmacopoeia, the scientific and chemical name given in the British Pharmaceutical Codex.|$|E
25|$|Other {{treatment}} methods {{may be used}} in psychiatric emergency service settings. Brief psychotherapy can be used to treat acute conditions or immediate problems as long as the patient understands his or her issues are psychological, the patient trusts the physician, the physician can encourage hope for change, the patient has motivation to change, the physician is aware of the psychopathological history of the patient, and the patient understands that their confidentiality will be respected. The process of brief therapy under emergency psychiatric conditions includes the establishment of a primary complaint <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> realizing psychosocial factors, formulating an accurate representation of the problem, coming up with ways to solve the problem, and setting specific goals. The information gathering aspect of brief psychotherapy is therapeutic because it helps the patient place his or her problem in the proper perspective. If the physician determines that deeper psychotherapy sessions are required, he or she can transition the patient out of the emergency setting and into an appropriate clinic or center.|$|E
25|$|Autologous {{cells are}} {{obtained}} from the same individual to which they will be reimplanted. Autologous cells have the fewest problems with rejection and pathogen transmission, however in some cases might not be available. For example, in genetic disease suitable autologous cells are not available. Also very ill or elderly persons, as well as patients suffering from severe burns, may not have sufficient quantities of autologous cells to establish useful cell lines. Moreover, since this category of cells needs to be harvested <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> {{there are also some}} concerns related to the necessity of performing such surgical operations that might lead to donor site infection or chronic pain. Autologous cells also must be cultured from samples before they can be used: this takes time, so autologous solutions may not be very quick. Recently there has been a trend towards the use of mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow and fat. These cells can differentiate into a variety of tissue types, including bone, cartilage, fat, and nerve. A large number of cells can be easily and quickly isolated from fat, thus opening the potential for large numbers of cells to be quickly and easily obtained.|$|E

25|$|Early implant designs had the {{potential}} to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which bone graft was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design. With time, other forms of stem surface treatment and stem geometry have been developed and improved.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous {{military}} organization also encompasses Africa’s substantial cavalry or mounted tradition, {{from the}} armored chevaliers of Western Africa, {{to the desert}} horsemen of North Africa, to the mounted fighters of the Basotho in their southern redoubts. On {{the waters of the}} continent, naval activities must be accounted for, not simply canoe transport, but fighting vessels, ports, and troop landings covered by poisoned arrows, bullets and cannonballs. Different styles of warfare and modes of organization are also demonstrated by indigenous systems, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> tactical defensive of the Basotho, the elaborate armies of Ashanti, the sweeping offensive horns of the Zulu impi, and the protracted guerrilla styles and archery of forest peoples like the Lobi, or the San (Bushmen) further south. As regards styles of organization, different approaches over different eras can be seen. Among the Kongo kingdoms of the 18th century for example, a mixture of unit types was deployed – heavy infantry with strong shields for example, backed by lighter contingents armed with bows and spears. Special units of elite troops and bodyguards were also maintained. Like the reorganized Roman legions of old however, the later Zulu system dispensed with such distinctions in favor of one streamlined combat organization and method. Such standardized methods were to be copied by other tribes, and were to dominate or influence large parts of southern Africa and beyond during the 19th century. Such complexity again illustrates that African military systems cannot be conceived of in static, one-dimensional terms.|$|E
