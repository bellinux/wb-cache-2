She focuses more narrowly on the honour of her nuclear family.|$|E
40|$|In 1995, I {{wrote an}} essay 'Existence'.

The consciousness is thus indivisible implying the permanent 'existential solitude' at the very bottom of each existence.

5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
