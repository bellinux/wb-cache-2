5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I {{put him in the}} first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, New Line Cinema {{bought the}} rights {{to make a film}} adaptation, with Stuart Beattie writing the script along with Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey. In June 2008, Len Wiseman was {{confirmed}} to direct before dropping out in 2010. Since then, New Line <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a new director and have allegedly lowered the budget.|$|E
25|$|Though the 2008 {{financial}} crisis {{had only a}} minor impact on the webcomic industry, many webcomic artists <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> alternative employment in the 2010s. While Topatoco has been seeking work with video game developers, podcasters and other internet personalities, some creators {{moved on to other}} media entirely. Toothpaste for Dinner-creator Drew Fairweather, for instance, started focusing his energy on his blog and his career as a rapper in 2011, while the creators of Amazing Super Powers moved on to developing video games.|$|E

25|$|Youth {{activism}} in Indonesia takes many different forms {{and include a}} number of mass protests to overthrow governments and remove colonial powers in the past. Popular motivations of youth {{activism in}} Indonesia are indigenous rights and national unity, pro-communism, anticommunism, pro-democracy and militant Islam. A common form of activism is massa, a cavalcade of motorcycles, trucks, music, and many young people on foot. These cavalcades are mostly males and end with a rally to address a certain political issue. In general, youth <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> political change during the last four decades.|$|E
25|$|Years {{go by and}} Rudolph {{has grown}} into adulthood. Returning home, he finds that his parents and Clarice <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> him for months. He sets out once again to find them, only to {{discover}} that they have been kidnapped by the Abominable Snow Monster. Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten, but the monster hits him {{in the head with a}} stalactite, dazing him. Later, Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph. Hermey, oinking like a pig, lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out. Hermey then pulls out all the monster's teeth. Realizing that the Abominable is now defenseless, Yukon drives the toothless monster back, only to fall over the cliff with all his pack dogs. Mourning Yukon's death, Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them. After hearing their story, Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown, promises that he'll find homes for the Misfit Toys, Hermey opens his own dentist's office, and Donner apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph. Yukon then returns with a reformed Abominable Snow Monster whom he hired to be a tree decorator. Christmas Eve comes and while everybody's celebrating, Santa fears that he'll have to cancel Christmas if the storm doesn't let up. Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph's red nose and realizes that it's light could cut through the storm. He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees. The team then flies off to the island where the Misfit Toys to pick them up. The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} a positive review from Monica Herrera of Billboard, {{who called the}} song [...] "honest and adult". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone cited [...] "Until It Beats No More" [...] as being one of two stand-outs songs on Love?; the other being [...] "On the Floor". Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots gave a positive review of the song, stating that the lyrics are [...] "spot on" [...] and the [...] "winds are fabo, the keys and key breaks in this one really allow her vocal sense {{to come out and}} shine". He concluded by stating that: [...] "If you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a new love song, this could be your pick".|$|E

500|$|On 30 December 1941, after {{transferring}} {{responsibility for}} their defensive area to a Militia Light Horse machine gun regiment from South Australia, the battalion embarked upon two troopships, Westralia and Marella, bound for Malaya via Port Moresby. Arriving on 4 January 1942, they were transferred to the transport Aquitania, which was to take them {{the rest of the}} way. Before they had completed transferring the battalion's equipment, news was received that Rabaul, about [...] north-east, had been bombed by carrier-based aircraft. Due to concerns that the aircraft may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the convoy, or US warships fleeing the Philippines, and that Port Moresby might be bombed next, the convoy's departure was advanced and so they sailed immediately. Instead of proceeding to Malaya, though, they were taken to Sydney, New South Wales, as it was decided that it would be safer to proceed via the southern route.|$|E
500|$|Luton Town <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a {{new ground}} since 1955, when club {{chairman}} Percy Mitchell spoke {{of building a}} stadium [...] "to hold 35,000 in comfort... {{get a lot of}} support which goes to London at the moment". However, due to unstable finances and an inability to find a site, no ground was built. The club proposed a move to Milton Keynes in 1982—according to The Luton News, to play as [...] "MK Hatters" [...] in a [...] "super-stadium"—but this was prevented by vehement protests in Luton, where supporters against such a move marched through the town to display their feelings. Despite consistent fan opposition to the idea, relocation up the M1 motorway to the new town was raised several more times over the next two decades; for example, The Football League refused Luton permission to move to Milton Keynes in 2000, saying that a member club was not allowed to leave its home town. Wimbledon F.C. was granted permission to relocate there in 2002, did so a year later and became Milton Keynes Dons in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Morley {{was awarded}} the same {{printing}} monopoly that Byrd had held. Morley's pick of Barley as an assignee (rather than experienced printers such as East or Peter Short, both of whom had previously worked with Morley) is surprising. Morley may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> help in challenging the metrical psalter patent of Richard Day and his assignees. At that time, East and Short were stationers, and the Stationers' Company was actively enforcing the Day monopoly. Barley, however, was not a stationer, and in 1599 he and Morley published The Whole Booke of Psalmes and Richard Allison's Psalmes of David in Metre. The former was a small pocket edition that was largely based on East's 1592 publication of the same name. This work, although pirated and filled with small errors, provides some evidence of Barley's editorial skill; musicologist Robert Illing notes that if Barley [...] "is to be discredited for roguery, he must also be applauded for his strokes of musical imagination" [...] for successfully compressing such a large work into a pocket-sized production. In Allison's work, the two claimed that they had exclusive rights on the metrical psalter. Duly provoked, Day sued. The outcome of his lawsuit is not known, but neither Barley nor Morley ever published another metrical psalter.|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have provided praise and criticism on Orochimaru's character. IGN writer Jason Van Horn compared Orochimaru's search for power and subsequent fall into villainy to that of Darth Sidious from Star Wars, and labeled Orochimaru as [...] "something more than just pure evil." [...] Justin Rich from Mania Entertainment considered Orochimaru the [...] "first real villain" [...] of the series, noting {{that he had no}} redeeming qualities, as versus Zabuza Momochi, the villain of the previous arc. DVDTalk's Todd Douglass Jr. celebrated the introduction of Orochimaru into the series, as well as the potential plot development from the curse seal Orochimaru placed on Sasuke, noting {{it was one of the}} best parts of the series. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network that Orochimaru's influence over him kept the tension high even when he had minor appearances. Javier Lugo from Manga Life praised the fight between Orochimaru and the Third Hokage based on the surprises such encounter showed. Instead, Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network labeled Orochimaru to be a character that can not be killed. IGN's Charles White considered Orochimaru as [...] "one of the more interesting characters on the show" [...] as he states Orochimaru [...] "can literally steal the show at any time". A. E. Sparrow from the same site praised Orochimaru's scenario in the 13th volume of the manga as he interrupts the current story arc in order to engage with the Third Hokage in a possible deadmatch despite interrupting the fight between Sasuke and Gaara which readers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Despite finding ruined watchtowers and {{fortification}} walls, Evans {{said that}} there was little evidence of ancient Minoan fortifications. According to Stylianos Alexiou (in Kretologia 8), a number of sites (especially early and middle Minoan sites such as Aghia Photia) are built on hilltops or otherwise fortified. Lucia Nixon wrote, [...] "We may have been over-influenced by the lack of what we might think of as solid fortifications to assess the archaeological evidence properly. As in so many other instances, we may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> evidence in the right places, and therefore we may not end with a correct assessment of the Minoans and their ability to avoid war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Decryption of the [...] "code" [...] {{was being}} started from scratch. It had been {{determined}} the letter frequency was considerably different from letters written down randomly; the frequency {{was to be}} further tested {{to determine if the}} alcohol level of the writer could alter random distribution. The format of the code also appeared to follow the quatrain format of the Rubaiyat, supporting the theory that the code was a one-time pad encryption algorithm. Copies of the Rubaiyat, as well as the Talmud and Bible, were being compared to the code using computers {{in order to get a}} statistical base for letter frequencies. However, the code's short length meant the investigators would require the exact edition of the book used. With the original copy lost in the 1960s, researchers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a FitzGerald edition without success.|$|E

Gerbic is often asked about her Wikipedia contributions and edits: [...] "I discovered {{that there are people}} in our community that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a way to become more involved but need more structure, support, and training." [...] When people ask how they can help the skeptical movement, Gerbic is quick to suggest that they, too, learn to edit Wikipedia: [...] "We rewrite Wikipedia, and proof the pages, we remove citations that are not noteworthy, we add citations, we do just about everything in Wikipedia to improve content." [...] Emery Emery asked Gerbic: [...] "This was a need right?" [...] Gerbic responded: [...] "I was trying to find something to do. It was my time to step up and take on some responsibility... I'd attended the lectures, I'd read the books, it was my time." ...|$|E
