40|$|The {{causes of}} {{variation}} in <b>effectiveness</b> of <b>environmental</b> public policy are subject to debate. Different levels of effectiveness in wider government policy are commonly explained by external influences. Fewer studies focus {{on the role of}} factors within the Executive, such as institutional arrangements, differing levels of capability in policy-makers, and ways ideas shape how people and institutions perceive environmental values and issues. This study aims to advance our understanding of how such factors combine to effect environmental policy in a specific national jurisdiction. The research investigates how environmental policy efforts of environmental government departments are influenced by factors within the Executive in New Zealand, and how these factors contribute to variability in <b>environmental</b> policy <b>effectiveness.</b> Drawing on theories about the main drivers of policy change and ideas about <b>environmental</b> policy <b>effectiveness,</b> the thesis puts forward a framework to analyse three case studies of environmental policy development between the 1990 s and the late 2000 s: oceans policy; biodiversity policy; and water policy. The main finding of the research is that four key intra-government variables are the primary determinants of <b>environmental</b> policy <b>effectiveness</b> in New Zealand. These are: the level of government commitment to environmental values relative to other values; the environmental commitment and capability of ministers holding environmental portfolios; the capability of officials within the environmental departments, notably their ability to provide leadership; {{and the extent to which}} environmental departments are organised and equipped to play a lead role in the development of environmental policy. These four variables are interdependent. Government will and the actions of ministers and officials can enable structural change that facilitates environmental organisations to take a leadership role, but where institutions do not allow or facilitate this to happen, environmental policy can be constrained or ineffective even where there is government commitment. From an organisational perspective features that stand out as being most important to enhance <b>environmental</b> policy <b>effectiveness</b> are: ensuring that priority is placed on environmental imperatives in policy design; concentrating effort by reorganising and aligning operating procedures internally in a timely way to focus on the issue at hand; forming close alliances with supportive departments and drawing in opposing departments; and organising to shape and lead the policy process within the machinery of government...|$|R

40|$|Forest {{certification}} can {{be conceived}} {{as one of}} many rapidly growing non-state market driven (NSMD) modes of governance. The <b>environmental</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of forest certification is oftentimes evaluated by indicators such as stringency of standards, degree of participation by key stakeholders, certified area, etc. In political science, forest certification as an NSMD governance arrangement is usually evaluated {{in terms of the}} quality of the decision-making procedures (input legitimacy) rather than for its problem solving capacity, i. e. its environmental performance or effectiveness. We conceptualize <b>environmental</b> <b>effectiveness</b> as a function of a standard's environmental stringency and the area covered by the standard, the latter dependent on the degree of social acceptance. Accordingly, the <b>environmental</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of different certification schemes ought to be evaluated taking both the standard stringency and the area certified into account. The forest certification process in Sweden illustrates how forestry history and regional differences affect the development, acceptance and adoption of different certification schemes. Industrial and Northern forestry owners favour the NGO led Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards whereas Southern small-scale private forest owners preferred to develop an alternative scheme the Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). We demonstrate that there is a bifurcated geographical coverage of the two certification schemes along a north-south divide coupled with a similarity in standard stringency and a high degree of acceptance in their different areas of dominance. Both forest certification schemes display a similar degree of <b>environmental</b> <b>effectiveness</b> - but in different parts of the country and for different types of ownership.

Depending on how market power is exerted by the dominant permit suppliers, the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries, the overall compliance costs of all remaining Annex 1 regions differ significantly. Moreover, curtailing permit supply by market power increases substantially the overall <b>environmental</b> <b>effectiveness</b> by cutting the amount of hot air being emitted into the atmosphere by more than half, although to much less extent than in the case of the US compliance.

In both the EU ETS and the ACPM, the free allocation of allowances to emissions-intensive trade-exposed sectors is the primary instrument of addressing leakage and competitiveness concerns. They, however, use different systems of free allocation.

40|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1994, there has been strong demand for evidence of the <b>environmental</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS), which paid farmers in the Republic of Ireland over € 3 billion by 2010. A variety of research projects have been undertaken that investigate the environmental effects of REPS through an examination of either specific environmental measures or specific geographical areas. A review of available publications confirmed {{the absence of a}} comprehensive, national-scale study of the environmental impacts of REPS. Because of this, there is insufficient evidence with which to judge the <b>environmental</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the national-scale implementation of the whole scheme. For some specific measures, however, sufficient evidence is available to inform an objective assessment in some cases, and to help learn how to improve <b>environmental</b> <b>effectiveness</b> in most cases. The majority of the REPS payments are now dedicated toward biodiversity objectives. Thus, biodiversity measures and options should be a priority for any national-scale environmental assessment of the scheme. Such a study would help identify the environmental benefits of REPS, the specific elements of REPS that are performing adequately, and those elements that are in need of improvement. Given the considerable overlap between REPS measures and options and those included in the 2010 Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS), assessment of REPS measures could also be used to inform the likely environmental performance of the AEOS. peer-reviewe...|$|E
