40|$|This paper defines <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulse</b> as {{a measure}} of whether {{government}} fiscal policy decisions are adding to, or subtracting from, aggregate demand pressures in the economy. When assessing the effects of fiscal policy on the economy it can be useful to have an approximate estimate of <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulse.</b> Estimates of <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulse</b> range from simple indicators based on fiscal aggregates, to more complicated approaches requiring greater use of judgement and economic theory. This paper develops reasonably simple indicators based on adjusted fiscal aggregates. It also sets out some sensitivity analysis. The indicators reflect intuitive assessments about changes in New Zealand fiscal policy over the last decade and looking forward into the forecast period. Although estimates are relatively insensitive to alternative assumptions, this {{is likely to be the}} result of the relative stability of the time period under consideration. Simple indicators of <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulse</b> have limitations. At best they can only provide an indication of the first round impact of changes in discretionary fiscal policy. A more complete assessment of the effects of fiscal policy on the economy requires a full-scale macroeconomic model, perhaps complemented with time series analysis.

We also directly test the effects of <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulses</b> on labor costs and households’ expectations. The results confirm that the composition of impulses matters for output and its components response. Notably we find evidence that investment and export growth accelerates after fiscal adjustment and decelerates after fiscal stimulus when the impulses are expenditure based. In turn, private consumption seems not to respond to <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulses</b> regardless of their size. The analysis confirms that expenditure based fiscal adjustments enhance wage moderation and thereby competitiveness of domestic enterprises, while expenditure-based fiscal stimuli weaken it.

This indicator corrects conventional fiscal-stance measures {{for the effects of}} theeconomic cycle, and yields a measure of the discretionary change in the budgetary position of the public-sector, known as the <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulse.</b> Section 2 briefly examines the evolution of traditional fiscal policy indicators over the recent period, detecting the bottom line of the changes in the fiscal stance. The details of the estimation of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulse</b> measure for the Brazilian economy are presented in Section 3.

40|$|Three Monetarist models [...] the Netherlands Bank Model, the Polak Model and the St. Louis Model [...] are {{critically}} {{examined in}} this study. A structural model {{has been set up}} for the St. Louis Model, showing some missing links and variables. The reduced-form approach should not be applied recklessly, i. e. without constructing its theoretical structural equations. Furthermore, in empirical studies, the concepts of stock and flow, and time references and time dimensions should be properly specified; failure to do so can lead to difficulties in interpretation. The Netherlands Bank Model and the St. Louis Model have been applied to the Canadian economy from 1957 to 1974. The findings from this empirical study are, in general, favourable to the Monetarist hypothesis. The application of the Netherlands Bank Model to the Canadian economy demonstrates that the monetary impulses induce greater changes in nominal income and price level than in real income. The empirical results derived from the application of the St. Louis Model on a short-term basis support a middle ground position between Monetarists and Fiscalists: the monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulses</b> exert about the same magnitude effect (about 1. 5) on economic activity in a year.

The paper shows that the OECD and IMF measures of <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulse</b> differ in at least four fundamental ways: (1) the OECD includes fiscal drag under the presumption that {{it is part of the}} "structure" of fiscal policy, while the IMF excludes it from its adjusted measure of the budget balance; (2) the OECD and the IMF both adjust for cyclical factors but they do so differently; (3) the OECD estimates its marginal tax and expenditure rates from a structural model whereas the IMF assumes unit income-elasticity of its parameters and uses historical average tax and spending rates; and (4) each agency uses different estimates of potential output. The paper then numerically allocates differences in the published figures of the OECD and the IMF to these various sources. The paper assesses the usefulness of each measure.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} analyse and {{quantify}} cross-border effects of discretionary fiscal policies from two major points of view. The aggregate approach {{rests on the}} use of the structural vector autoregression model (SVAR) and its extension, the global vector autoregression model (GVAR). The discretionary <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulse</b> itself is then defined as a change in cyclically adjusted balance of the government sector, calculated at quarterly frequencies. This section is then complemented by a case study of a single measure: the German car scrapping scheme during 2009 and its effects on the Czech economy. It was found that cross-border effects of discretionary fiscal policies may be indeed present, in case certain conditions are met. Importantly, a <b>fiscal</b> <b>impulse</b> has to originate from a sufficiently large economy and there needs to be a tight trade linkage between examined countries. In most cases, cross-border effects have also been found of lesser magnitude than direct impacts of fiscal policies on the domestic country. Finally, as demonstrated on the German-Czech case, even a single fiscal measure can trigger substantial cross-border spillovers. It was estimated that this measure positively contributed to real GDP growth in 2009 in the Czech Republic by 0. 44 pp...|$|E

Models can, more easily than empirical studies, account for differences between fiscal instruments, for differences between structural characteristics of the economy, and for monetary-fiscal policy interactions.

(iii) Fiscal policy is most effective if it has some persistence and if monetary policy accommodates it.

However, the existing empirical literature has concentrated on few countries, mostly outside the EU.
