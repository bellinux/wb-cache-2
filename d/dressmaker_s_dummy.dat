40|$|A {{model of}} {{industry}} speed of price adjustment {{is derived from}} firm pricing behaviours. The model is applied to quarterly two-digit Australian manufacturing data for the period 1985 : 3 to 2002 : 3. Initially, the industry speed of price adjustment is treated {{as a function of}} structural cross-section variables. The results suggest that the industry speed of price adjustment is positively related to the average size of large firms within the industry and is negatively related to industry concentration. With the inclusion of time variables into the final estimating equation, we find that import share has a role in attenuating the effects of industry concentration and that the trend real GDP growth reduces the speed of price adjustment. While a 1990 <b>s</b> <b>dummy</b> variable is included in the final estimating equation and is found to be significant, its magnitude is too small to be of economic importance. Calculated industry speeds of price adjustment are stable across the period of examination but are also small, suggesting that manufacturing prices are sticky...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates a state 2 ̆ 7 s {{economic environment}} subsequent {{to a state}} tax modification for evidence of change in business presence. ^ Sponsors of economically motivated state tax policy initiatives generally adopt a tax reduction program {{in order to improve}} a state 2 ̆ 7 s business climate and to stimulate a state 2 ̆ 7 s economy. The results of previous empirical studies researching the possible linkage between tax reduction and economic stimulation is inconclusive. ^ This dissertation examines the economic period subsequent to New York State 2 ̆ 7 s 1987 tax policy change in order to detect shifts in business presence within New York. Detecting shifts in business presence after a state tax reduction provides evidence of a nexus between tax initiatives and economic stimulation. ^ Time series models were developed to incorporate the economic environment prior to the 1987 tax modification in New York. The specific monthly time series data examined were: employment in non-agriculture, the unemployment rate, and the business activity index. Quarterly income tax collection were also examined as a measure of economic prosperity. ^ Three different research methods were employed to examine the four time series. The three methods were, CuSum chart of quality control, sequential application of the Student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> t-test, and <b>dummy</b> variable multiple regression. ^ The results of the analysis provide some basis for concluding that a linkage between tax reduction and economic stimulation is not as robust as legislators perceive. None of the time series examined exhibited long term improvement. ^ Another implication of this dissertation is that the methods of quality control generate earlier signals as to the ineffectiveness of New York State 2 ̆ 7 s tax modification than either the Student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> t-test or <b>dummy</b> variable multiple regression. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{domestic}} {{beef cattle}} producers have supplied only 70 {{percent of the}} national need. Demand of the beef cattle has not been accompanied by an increasing of supply response. One of the major problems in beef cattle farming is its low productivity that might be caused by its low efficiency of input use. Therefore, this study aims are (1) to estimate the factors that influence the production of beef cattle fattening, (2) to analyze the level of technical efficiency of beef cattle fattening. The stochastic production frontier is used to estimate production function. The results showed that quantity of concentrate, dummy of cattle 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> age, and <b>dummy</b> of livestock ownership significantly influence production. The average value of the farm technical efficiency is 0. 764 ranging from a minimum of 0. 478 to a maximum of 0. 996...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies two {{fundamental}} problems {{both of which}} are defined on a set S of elements drawn from an or-dered domain. In the first problem—called approximate K-partitioning—we want to divide S into K disjoint partitions P 1, [...] ., PK such that (i) every element in Pi is smaller than all the elements in Pj for any i, j satisfying 1 ≤ i < j ≤ K, and (ii) the size of each Pi (1 ≤ i ≤ K) falls in a given range [a, b]. In the second problem—called approximate K-splitters—we want to find K − 1 elements s 1, [...] ., sK− 1 from S, such that the size of S ∩ (si, si− 1] falls in a given range [a, b] (define <b>dummy</b> <b>s</b> 0 = − ∞ and sK =∞). We present I/O-efficient comparison-based algorithms for solving these problems, and establish their optimality by proving matching lower bounds. Our results reveal that the two problems are separated in terms of I/O complexity when K is small, but have the same hardness when K is large...|$|R

However, this potential has not been realized. The goal {{of this study is}} to determine the impacts of trade impediments and barriers of the market access of US oilseeds and grains in China. A market access variable that was obtained by dividing the total value of U. S soybean and corn exports to China by U. S agricultural G. D. P was regressed on China’s per capita income, exchange rate of the yuan to the dollar, arable land to labor ratio in the U. <b>S</b> and a <b>dummy</b> variable representing China’s WTO accession. The result found per capita income to have a positive impact on market access of U. S oilseeds and grains in China. Exchange rate of the yuan to the dollar was found to be significant and has a negative impact on market access. However, China’s WTO accession and the arable land to labor ratio in the U. S did not have any significance on the market access of U. S oilseeds and grains. Market Access, Market Access Barriers, U.

The model is a seven-equation simultaneous model with three endogenous <b>dummies</b> <b>S,</b> D, and PC. The data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). We nd that the four birth inputs are determined jointly and dependently among S, D, and PC, but independently of WG. S has negative systematic correlation with G. D and PC appear to have no sizeable systematic e ect on G, BL, or BW. Except for the sizeable and positive correlation between the unexplained parts of S and G, there seem to be no unexplained common e ects between the birth inputs and outputs. Moreover, G appears dependent on the exogenous size of the mother. BL is a ected by the inputs mainly through WG. BW is a ected by the inputs through their e ects on G. Except for maternal weight, there is little correlation between the remaining exogenous variables and BW. Finally, the predictive density of BW for a typical pregnancy gives a mean weight of 3 : 240 kg...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} 'Essays on Global Outsourcing and Innovation' {{consists of}} three papers. The first and the second papers investigate two issues arising from global sourcing of multinational corporations. The third paper empirically studies whether U. S innovation is influenced by intellectual property rights protection in other countries. Chapter one is 'Cluster-based Economic Growth and Sourcing Behavior of Multinationals'. The paper considers the relationship between global sourcing of multinational enterprises and agglomeration effect of industrial clusters by extending an intra-industry heterogeneity North-South trade model (embedded with property-rights approach). We assume {{that there is only}} one cluster in each industry in the South and in the North. The actual scale of a cluster (measured by the number of firms which produce manufacturing goods in the cluster) is determined by the investment or outsourcing choice of multinationals or final goods producers. We investigate respectively the industries of high headquarter intensity and the industries of low headquarter intensity. In either case, multiple equilibria exist. When the headquarter intensity is very low, the multinationals do not produce intermediate goods internally. Normally firms with relatively low productivities find their suppliers in the North whereas firms with relatively high productivities outsource in the South. When the headquarter intensity is high enough, at most three organizational forms exist in equilibrium and no firms outsource in the South. Also, firms with low productivities will procure intermediate goods in the North, while firms which have high productivities will source the inputs from the South. In either case, we derive that in industries with higher wage rates, more varieties of goods are produced in the South, but not in the North. The reason is that the agglomeration effect of industrial clusters cancels out the effect of higher wage rates on production cost. Therefore, the development mode of cluster-based economic growth in the South is interpreted under our framework. Moreover, in the industries of low headquarter intensity, hollowing-out trend might take place; but in the industries of high headquarter intensity, more varieties of intermediate goods will still be produced in the North rather than in the South. Since the industrial scale of headquarter intensive sector in the South is not as large as that in the North, the paper suggests that high-tech industries of the South should be nurtured under self-reliance policy. Chapter two is 'Global Sourcing: Complete Contract and Imperfect Law Enforcement'. It assumes that the contract between a multinational corporation and its outside intermediate supplier is complete, while law enforcement is imperfect when the multinational breach the contract. We investigate the sorting pattern of the organizational forms of multinationals with different productivity. The pattern is described respectively when the law enforcement probability in the South is rather low or much stronger. When the probability of law enforcement in the South is low, at most three organizational forms exist in equilibrium. Firms with lower productivity integrate vertically in the North or in the South, but firms having the highest productivity will outsource their input suppliers in the South. When the probability of law enforcement in the South is high, there are four types of organizational choice of the final-goods producers. Normally, firms with the lowest productivity make internally the intermediate goods in the North whereas firms with highest productivity outsource the intermediate inputs in the South. Then we study the relative prevalence of different organizational modes. The fraction of firms choosing any particular organizational forms depends on the wage differential across countries, the degree of productivity dispersion in an industry, the probability of law enforcement in the South, the social penalty of breach of contracts, the headquarter intensity of the multinational corporation, the difference of fixed management costs and other factors. Specifically, weaker law enforcement in the South will attract more multinationals to source suppliers overseas and smaller social penalty has a similar effect on the choice of multinationals. Chapter three is 'Does IPR protection in Developing Countries Influence Technological Innovation in the U. S?' It uses patent data to empirically test the relationship between IPR protection in other countries and technological innovation in the U. S. The U. S government always urges developing countries to adopt a more stringent policy towards IPR protection. It often claims that weak protection in these countries would reduce the return of innovation of U. S companies and hamper their incentive towards innovation activity. This paper does a series of regressions and verifies that the U. S argument does not stand up. We use the data of patent application in 1967 - 1999 filed in the USPTO (categorized by six technological sectors) to stand for innovation in U. <b>S</b> companies. <b>Dummies</b> are utilized to reflect the policy shift in IPR protection in other countries during this period. Control variables such as per capita GDP, human capital investment, and the dummies of the TRIPS agreement and the CAFC are also included. Moreover, economic linkage strength between the U. S and other countries are considered by using interaction terms in the econometric model. The regression results do not support that the IPR reform in other countries have promoted innovation in the U. S. The setting up of the CAFC has not had obvious influence, either. We devise some robustness checks to challenge that conclusion. We examine the GDP effect, lagged response to IPR reform, and the effect of time trend etc, and find that the result is credible. However, this paper indicates that U. S innovation was facilitated through domestic policy transformation around the TRIPS which came into force in 1995...|$|R
