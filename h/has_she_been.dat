Upon what strange meat <b>has</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> fed {{that she}} hath grown so great: And what {{inspired}} her, she {{who might have}} taken up knitting or petunia-growing, to adopt as her hobby the deliberate and sometimes hasty criticism {{of men and women}} she has never seen."

2500|$|Mother Candace Chacona {{said she}} was [...] "flabbergasted" [...] by the allegations: [...] "My {{first thought was that}} my {{daughter}} has her computer open almost around the clock in her bedroom. <b>Has</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> spied on?" [...] Chuck Barsh, an insurance broker whose son is in high school, called the district's actions a [...] "gross invasion" [...] of student privacy, and supported the lawsuit, saying: [...] "These people were able to look at our kids in our house". [...] Mike Salmonson, father of an elementary school student, said the matter was [...] "part of … institutional arrogance—a lack of full disclosure and honesty" [...] on the part of district administrators.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after The News of the World story broke, rival tabloid the Daily Star {{ran a story}} alleging Archer {{had paid}} for sex with Coghlan, {{something}} The News of the World had been careful to avoid stating directly. Archer responded by suing the Daily Star. The case came to court in July 1987. Explaining the payment to Coghlan as the action of a philanthropist rather {{than that of a}} guilty man, Archer won the case and was awarded £500,000 damages. Archer stated he would donate the money to charity. However, this case would ultimately result in Archer's final exit from front-line politics some years later. The description the judge (Mr Justice Caulfield) gave of Mrs Archer in his jury instructions included: [...] "Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box. Your vision of her probably will never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married life? <b>Has</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey?" [...] The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer, [...] "Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?" ...|$|E

6000|$|There was {{a rueful}} defeat and bewilderment in Dan's face that made Mrs. Pasmer laugh. [...] "What <b>has</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> doing now?" [...] she asked.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a fine {{creature}} <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> educated, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> educated, {{and consequently}} her ideas were ill-formed, and her abilities were exercised in a wrong direction.|$|R

6000|$|It {{had been}} Clara Desmond's first ball, {{and on the}} {{following}} morning <b>she</b> <b>had</b> much to occupy her thoughts. In the first place, <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> pleased or <b>had</b> <b>she</b> not? Had <b>she</b> <b>been</b> most gratified or most pained? ...|$|R
60|$|She hesitated. So rapidly <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> {{rushed into}} the {{adventure}} that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not considered {{the question of a}} name at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>has.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> bewitchingly pretty, {{but that}} only makes her case the more perplexing. Why trouble {{ourselves}} about her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's some peach," [...] allowed Tuppence carelessly. [...] "Finds {{it useful}} in her lay-out, you bet. <b>Has</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> wearing {{any of the}} emeralds, by the way?" ...|$|E
