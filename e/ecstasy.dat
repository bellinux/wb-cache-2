5|$|Lambert had a {{different}} visual aspect of the song on her mind. She {{felt that it was}} more about <b>ecstasy,</b> especially a sexual one, and how it related to religious <b>ecstasy.</b> She listened to the song with Madonna a number of times and together decided to include the <b>ecstasy</b> part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the trigger for the sexual and religious <b>ecstasy.</b> Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E

5|$|In Little Busters! <b>Ecstasy,</b> adult {{elements}} {{were added to}} the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex. <b>Ecstasy</b> extends the story for the scenarios of the heroines in Little Busters!, as well as increasing the number of heroine routes from six to nine. These three heroine routes include scenarios for Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa—two supporting characters from Little Busters!—and a new heroine named Saya Tokido who is only featured in <b>Ecstasy.</b> The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes are unavailable to the player until after the Refrain scenario is completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. <b>Ecstasy</b> has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences. Also, <b>Ecstasy</b> features the addition of two recurring minigames related to Saya: a shooting game with pistols and navigating a labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|The {{game is a}} {{spin-off}} of Key's earlier game Little Busters! {{rated for}} all ages and its expanded, adult version Little Busters! <b>Ecstasy.</b> Kudryavka appears as a heroine in both Little Busters! and <b>Ecstasy.</b> Kud Wafter is an expansion of Kudryavka's story after the events of <b>Ecstasy</b> and is written by Chika Shirokiri. Na-Ga and Itaru Hinoue returned as co-art directors. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for {{the time of its}} release. A manga adaptation illustrated by Bakutendō was serialized in ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine. A 40-minute theatrical anime adaptation by J.C.Staff will premiere in Q4 2019.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Little Busters! {{follows a}} branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, {{and focuses on}} {{the appeal of the}} six female main characters by the player character, which increases to nine in <b>Ecstasy.</b> There are additional minigames added into the gameplay, such as battle sequences that resemble fighting games or baseball batting practice, which serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during battle, and improve their statistics. Both Little Busters! and <b>Ecstasy</b> ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of their release, and <b>Ecstasy</b> would go on to sell over 100,000 units. Key went on to produce an adult spin-off called Kud Wafter in June 2010, which expanded on the scenario of Kudryavka Noumi, one of the heroines from Little Busters! and <b>Ecstasy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three or {{four months}} before the release of Little Busters!, {{it was decided that}} an adult version of the game would be {{developed}} titled , or Little Busters-EX for short. Na-Ga designed the heroine Saya Tokido and Maeda wrote her scenario. Tonokawa wrote Sasami Sasasegawa's scenario, and Shirokiri wrote Kanata Futaki's story. Lines from the original game were rewritten as well for <b>Ecstasy,</b> and the total number of lines with spoken dialogue comes to 43,347 lines. The total word count in <b>Ecstasy</b> exceeds that of Clannad by about 4,000 words, making it Key's longest work, and carries so much data that <b>Ecstasy</b> was released on two DVDs instead of one for the original release.|$|E

5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (<b>ecstasy)</b> {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.|$|E

[...] He asserted that in this manner, <b>Ecstasies</b> built on the work of the historian Norman Cohn (1915 - 2007) in his book Europe's Inner Demons (1975).|$|R
5000|$|Her {{parish priest}} Jean-David Reichard (1796-1867) knew of {{her desire to}} {{establish}} a religious congregation and aided her in finding companions for her project. In 1846 she saw a vision of Jesus Christ and this {{began a series of}} <b>ecstasies</b> and she soon became known as [...] "the Niederbronn Ecstatic". But Reichard also learned of her <b>ecstasies</b> and felt obligated to inform his bishop of this. The Bishop of Strasbourg Andreas Raess heard of her from Reichard and met her in July 1848 in order to conduct tests and interviews with her while being convinced of her intentions to serve the ill and the poor. Raess also believed that God had called Eppinger for a special mission. Father Claude Ignatius Busson published a series of writings on her - three sets - from 1849 until 1853 in response to these <b>ecstasies.</b>|$|R
