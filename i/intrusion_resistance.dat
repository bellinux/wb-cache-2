40|$|Adaptation {{is a key}} {{technique}} in constructing survivable information systems. Allowing a system to continue running, albeit with reduced functionality or performance, {{in the face of}} reduced resources, attacks, or broken components is often preferable to either complete shutdown or continued normal operation in compromised mode. However, unpredictable adaptation can sometimes be worse than the problem it seeks to cope with. In this paper we introduce adaptation spaces, which precisely and predictably specify the adaptation of a software component. We then present two survivable systems that have been specified and implemented using adaptation spaces. The first example uses user preferences regarding quality in an audio application to guide the adaptation when available bandwidth decreases. The second trades off performance overhead with <b>intrusion</b> <b>resistance</b> for "stack-smashing" attacks. We formally define an adaptation space and show briefly how it enables certain kinds of reasoning about adaptive applications. We conclude with related work and future plans...|$|E

During the last decade, scientific research in flood risk {{focused on the}} development of a probabilistic approach to quantify the probability of flooding of the primary flood defence system. This paper proposed a methodology to quantify the probability of flooding of regional flood defence systems, which required several additions to the methodology used for the primary flood defence system. These additions focused on a method to account for regulation of regional water levels, the possibility of (reduced) <b>intrusion</b> <b>resistance</b> due to maintenance dredging in regional water, the probability of traffic loads and the influence of dependence between regional water levels and the phreatic surface of a regional flood defence. In addition, reliability updating is used to demonstrate the potential for updating the probability of failure of regional flood defences with performance observations. The results demonstrated that the proposed methodology can be used to determine the probability of flooding of a regional flood defence system. In doing so, the methodology contributes to improving flood risk management in these systems. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} analyzing the survivability of distributed network systems and an example of its application. Survivability is the capability of a system to fulfill its mission, in a timely manner, {{in the presence of}} attacks, failures, or accidents. Survivability requires capabilities for <b>intrusion</b> <b>resistance,</b> recognition, and recovery. The Survivable Network Analysis (SNA) method permits assessment of survivability strategies at the architecture level. Steps in the SNA method include system mission and architecture definition, essential capability definition, compromisable capability definition, and survivability analysis of architectural softspots that are both essential and compromisable. Intrusion scenarios {{play a key role in}} the method. SNA results are summarized in a Survivability Map which links recommended survivability strategies for resistance, recognition, and recovery to the system architecture and requirements. This case study summarizes the application and results of applying the SNA method to a subsystem of a large-scale, distributed healthcare system. The study recommended specific modifications to the subsystem architecture to support survivability objectives. Positive client response to study recommendations suggests that the method can provide significant added value for ensuring survivability.

40|$|Research {{dealing with}} {{malicious}} acts can be partitioned into three areas, namely Resistance, Recognition and Recovery [1].

40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the ability to inhibit already processed and actually irrelevant information influences performance in the reading span task (RST). French versions of the Stroop color-word task and of the Daneman and Carpenter's RST were administered to 151 participants,from 30 to 80 years. In addition to the traditional span score, a score of vulnerability to intrusions was also computed as the number of intruding responses (words from preceding trials of the RST or nonfinal words). An analysis of variance showed a significant age effect on the reading span and on the resistance to interference, but no significant age effect on the vulnerability to intruding responses. A multiple-regression analysis was also made with the reading span score as the dependent variable, and with age, vulnerability to <b>intrusions,</b> and <b>resistance</b> to Stroop interference as independent variables. This analysis revealed that there was a relation between participants' vulnerability to intruding responses and their working memory span scores; the contribution of age and resistance to interference were very weak. In conclusion the present findings first support the idea that the working memory capacity undoubtedly involves some inhibitory control; however, because the participants' vulnerability to intruding responses is not clearly affected by age, the present findings also suggest that some part of age effects upon the working memory span has to be explained by another factor than a growing inefficiency in inhibitory control...|$|R
40|$|A {{common factor}} in roof {{failures}} is wind forces, which inflict considerable damage every year, even to new roof structures. Metal roofs are a popular low-sloped roof assembly. On {{the basis of}} their layout, metal roofs can be categorized as either composite or noncomposite assemblies. In North American practice, five main test procedures - ASTM E 1592, ANSI/FM 4474, UL 580, UL 1817, and CSA A 123. 21 - 04 - are used to determine the wind uplift performance of metal roofs. The fundamental differences between these test protocols lie in the way they represent wind effects on the performance of metal roofing systems. Of the five, CSA A 123. 21 - 04 {{is the only one that}} assesses the wind uplift resistance under dynamic wind load conditions. To evaluate the wind uplift performance of noncomposite and composite metal roofing assemblies, eight assemblies with two different types of panels - SNAP-IT and MR- 24 - were tested by using the CSA A 123. 21 - 04 dynamic test protocol. By relating air intrusion characteristics of the subsurface components to panel behavior, this paper shows how composite assemblies resist wind uplift pressures better than noncomposite assemblies. This paper reveals that increased air <b>intrusion</b> <b>resistance</b> of the sub surface components in composite assemblies results in increased suction resistance, decreased panel deflection, decreased stress on the panels, and increased wind uplift resistance. 9 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

40|$|In an {{automotive}} crash event, hot stamped, die quenched martensitic structural components {{have been}} shown to provide excellent <b>intrusion</b> <b>resistance.</b> These alloys exhibit only limited ductility, however, which may limit the overall impact performance of the component. The introduction of lower strength and more ductile “tailored” properties within some regions of a hot stamped component has the potential to improve impact performance. One approach being applied to achieving such tailored properties is through locally controlling the cooling rate within the stamping die. The primary motivation for the current work is to understand the role of cooling rate on the as-quenched mechanical response of tailored hot stampings, which has required characterization of the high strain rate mechanical behaviour of tailored hot stamped boron steel. The effect of cooling rate and resulting microstructure on the as-quenched mechanical behavior of USIBOR® 1500 P boron steel at strain rates between 10 - 3 and 103 s- 1 was investigated. Specimens quenched at rates above the critical cooling rate (~ 27 °C/s) exhibited a fully martensitic microstructure with a UTS of ~ 1, 450 MPa. Sub-critical cooling rates, in the range 14 °C/s to 50 °C/s, resulted in as-quenched microstructures ranging between bainitic to martensitic, respectively. Tension tests revealed that predominantly bainitic material conditions (14 °C/s cooling rate) exhibited a lower UTS of 816 MPa compared to 1, 447 MPa for the fully martensitic material condition (50 °C/s cooling rate) with a corresponding increase in elongation from 0. 10 to 0. 15 for the bainitic condition. The reduction in area was 70 % for the bainitic material condition and 58 % for the martensitic material conditions which implied that a tailored region consisting of bainite may be a desirable candidate for implementation within a hot stamped component. The strain rate sensitivity was shown to be moderate for all of the as-quenched material conditions and the measured flow stress curves were used to develop a strain rate sensitive constitutive model, the “Tailored Crash Model (TCM) ”. The TCM accurately reproduced the measured flow stress curves as a function of effective plastic strain, strain rate and Vickers hardness (or area fraction of martensite and bainite). The effect of deformation during quenching and the associated shift in the CCT diagram on the subsequent constitutive response was also examined for this material. Specimens were simultaneously quenched and deformed at various cooling rates to achieve a range of as-quenched microstructures that included ferrite in addition to martensite and bainite. Tensile tests conducted on these specimens at strain rates ranging from 0. 003 s- 1 to ~ 80 s- 1 revealed that the presence of ferrite resulted in an increase in uniform elongation and n-value which increased overall energy absorption for a given hardness level. The strain rate sensitivity was shown to be moderate for all of the as-quenched material conditions and the TCM constitutive model was extended to account for the presence of ferrite. This extended constitutive model, the “Tailored Crash Model II (TCM II) ”, has been shown to predict flow stress as a function of effective plastic strain, strain rate and area fraction of martensite, bainite and ferrite. As a validation exercise, uniaxial tension test simulations of specimens extracted from the transition zone of a hot stamped lab-scale B-pillar with tailored properties [1] were performed. The measured hardness distribution along the gauge length of the tensile specimens was used as input for the TCM constitutive model to define the element constitutive response used in the finite element (FE) models. The measured stress versus strain response and strain distribution during loading (measured using digital image correlation) was in excellent agreement with the FE models and thus validated the TCM constitutive model developed in this work. Validation of the TCM II version of the model is left for future work...|$|E
40|$|Historically the Netherlands {{have always}} {{had to deal with}} the threat of flooding, both from the rivers and the sea as well as from heavy rainfall. The country {{consists}} of a large amount of polders, which are low lying areas of land protected from flooding by embankments. These polders require an extensive water storage and drainage system to discharge excess water to the surrounding ‘outside water’. Through a large system of ditches water is pumped onto large storage canals which in turn drain in to the ‘outside water’: in the sea or in rivers. In Dutch these drainage canals are called ‘Boezems’. The embankments which enclose the storage canals inside the polders are called Regional Flood Defences. The objective is to determine whether or not the flood risk approach can be applied to a system of regional flood defence systems, given the existing data and ‘state of the art’ methods. The proposed methodology will provide a basis for more thorough assessment of the regional flood defences, not only based on the safety standards, but including the failure probabilities of all relevant geotechnical failure mechanisms and corresponding consequences of flooding. The project focuses on ‘Boezemkaden’, which will be addressed as regional flood defences in the remainder of this document. These flood defences typically retain lower hydraulic heads than primary flood defences. Risk assessment methodology Flood risk is assessed by the annual expected damage due to flooding, which is estimated by multiplying the probability of flooding with the consequences of flooding. The largest knowledge gaps exist in the calculation of probabilities, because several ‘state of the art’ models are available to determine the flood consequences due to breaches in a flood defence system. Probability of flooding The probability of failure of a system of flood defences is determined based on a schematization of the system, which divides it in sections with similar strength properties. Probabilistic methods are used to determine the probability of failure of one section. Flood scenarios are defined as groups of sections which have similar consequences during a flood: these are chosen such that every breach in this group, regardless of its location, will lead to the same flood consequences. To obtain the probability of one flood scenario, the failure probabilities of individual dike sections are combined. The probability of flooding of the whole system can be determined by combining the scenario probabilities. The manner in which the failure probabilities are combined depends on the occurrence of relief in the system:  Relief: if failure of one section results in lower loads on the other sections relief is taken in to account. This can be done in two ways: by assuming that the weakest section fails first or by assuming that the first loaded section fails first;  No relief: if failure of one section does not have any effect on the loads of other sections, no relief is taken in to account. The occurrence of relief strongly depends on the volume of water inside the canal compared to the size of the inundated area after a breach. The extent of relief in canal systems requires careful investigation for every case study. With relief, we can assume only one breach is possible within one canal system. However, when there is no relief multiple breaches are possible. This is an important part of the schematization of the system, as the occurrence of relief has large effect on flood risk. Flood consequences It is assumed that floods resulting from a breach in a regional flood defence system only have inundation depths in the order of decimetres, except for the occasional deeper polders. Due to the low expected inundation depths no loss of life is taken in to account. The economic consequences are determined with HIS SSM and WSS. The HIS SSM model provides an estimate of the economic consequences and loss of life for large floods, with inundation depths of several meters. A disadvantage of the model is that it is inaccurate for low inundation depths. The ‘Water Schade Schatter’ is developed to determine the consequences of small floods due to heavy rainfall in polders. This model uses more accurate consequence functions for low inundation depths of several decimetres, providing more accurate estimations for small floods. A major disadvantage is that the consequence functions are limited to inundation depths below 0. 3 meter. To account for larger inundation depths, the consequence functions for buildings specifically have to be changed. Both methods are used and compared in this report; the difference between both estimators can reach up to 20 %. No clear distinction can be made of which estimator provides an upper or lower limit. Uncertainties in loads on regional flood defences To determine failure probabilities, insight is required in the statistical distribution of the governing loads, which for regional flood defences are: 1) Hydraulic loads: water levels inside the canals and resulting groundwater level; 2) Traffic loads: vertical loads on top of the flood defence; Waves in these canals are neglected. Currently a research program is undergoing on the stability of peat dikes during droughts. This load is not taken in to account at this stage, because the results of this research are expected to largely influence the assessment of regional flood defences. Furthermore, a case study is chosen for a region where earthquake loading is not present. Hydraulic loads We consider the volume of water in the canals being governed by the inflow from the polder drainage stations and the outflow to the outside water; neglecting rainfall, seepage and local wind set up. These water levels are regulated by the water boards. During extreme rainfall events, the canals have a certain storage volume available for storage of excess water out of the polders pumped on to the canals, which is determined by the difference between the target water level and the ‘drain stop level’; the maximum allowed water level on the canals. Once the ‘drain stop level’ is reached, the polder drainage stations are not allowed to keep pumping water on to the canals. This event may only occur with a probability of 1 / 100 per year. Whether or not the drain stop is successful depends on the way these are managed. During heavy rainfall events, water boards may have to choose between having to exceed the ‘drain stop level’ on the canals to keep polders dry, or vice versa. The drain stop may fail due to factors which cannot be influenced by the waterboard, or because a certain part of a polder needs to remain dry. The event where the water levels exceed the drain stop level is defined as ‘failure of the drain stop’. Water level observations are used to determine the water level statistic of the regulated system. A Generalized Pareto Distribution is fitted through independent peaks of water levels in the canals. This distribution is modified, to account for the regulation of water levels in the system, by making a distinction successful and unsuccessful drain stop, see Figure 21. Traffic loads The combination of hydraulic loads (high water levels) and traffic loads is governing for the stability of the flood defence. Expert ellicitation was used to determine the statistical distribution of traffic loads. Water board employees responsible for the assessment of the regional flood defences were asked to provide estimates of the 5 th, 50 th and 95 th quantiles of the statistical distribution of the traffic loads. Furthermore, they were asked to provide an estimate of the correlation between the traffic load and water level. The resulting traffic load distribution is shown in Figure 25, for green and grey flood defences. No correlations between the traffic load and water levels was expected with average water levels; the experts all agreed on this point. However, they did not agree on the correlation between the traffic load and the extreme water levels, which was either positive or negative. Different combinations of hydraulic and traffic loads are possible, which depend on the management of the water board. Specifically the policy regarding traffic loads on a regional flood defence determines which combinations of loads are most likely to occur. We determined the probability of failure of the regional flood defences with and without traffic loads. Using this methodology, we showed the influence of the traffic loads on the failure probability and risk of regional flood defences, which is significant. Uncertainties in strength of regional flood defences The following failure mechanisms are governing for regional flood defences: Overflow, Piping and Instability of the inner slope. FORM reliability calculations are used to determine the probability of failure for each mechanism. Overflow will occur when the water levels in the canal exceed the retaining height of the surrounding flood defence. The limit state function of overflow is based on a critical overflow amount, which can lead to erosion of the inner slope and breaching. The stability for piping is calculated with the updated Sellmeijer formula. ‘Hydraulic short circuiting’ is required for piping to develop under regional flood defences. Recent research has shown that hydraulic short circuiting is likely to occur when there is an aquifer below the canals. The response of the water pressure behind the dike to intrusion of water from the canal in the aquifer depends on the thickness of the aquifer. Field tests are required to determine the reduced hydraulic head over the flood defence, due to reduced infiltration of water from the canal to the aquifer. D-Geo Stability is used to determine the probability of failure for inner slope instability. The failure probability of critical slip circles is calculated with Bishop, for several combinations of water levels, piezo metric lines and traffic loads. Only slip circles which will lead to breaching of the flood defence are taken in to account (i. e. slip circles which protrude the crest of the flood defence). Finally, these are combined to obtain the failure probability of instability. Due to the absence of data on probabilities of phreatic lines, we assumed a distribution. We recommend to perform field tests to determine the actual distribution of the phreatic line. Proven strength Proven strength has high potential for updating failure probabilities of regional flood defences. In these canal systems, the difference between average and maximum water levels is very low which results in high potential for proven strength. Especially for overflow and piping the potential is great; the main uncertainty for these failure mechanisms lies in the water levels. The potential of proven strength for the instability failure mechanism is much lower, because not only the water level load determines the stability, but also the phreatic line and traffic loads; these are not always known for the survived load cases. Case study: HHNK Heerhugowaard The ‘Heerhugowaard’ polder is considered in our case study. It is surrounded by two canal systems: the Schermerboezem and the VRNK-boezem. The city of Heerhugowaard lies within the polder, on the Western side. The flood defence system was divided in 17 sections, based on strength properties. The water board made simulations of flooding for a number of breach locations along the flood defence system with Sobek. These were used to schematise the flood defence system in six flood scenarios, each consisting of a group of dike sections (Figure 42). Failure probabilities Overflow: The probability of overflow in this flood defence system is negligible; the retaining height of the flood defences is well above the water levels in the canals, which correspond with very low return periods (< 10 - 6 per year). Piping: The hydraulic heads over the considered regional flood defences result in rather high failure probabilities. However, there is no direct contact between the water in the canals and the aquifer, due to impermeable layers on the bottom of the canal. Therefore a reduced hydraulic head is taken in to account, which is based on field tests of the <b>intrusion</b> <b>resistance</b> of these layers. When taking the reduced hydraulic head in to account, more accurate failure probabilities are found (considering these flood defences have not failed in the last decennia). Note that these flood defences may still be at risk for piping if the geological profile is changed, for example due to dredging works or erosion of the bottom of the canals. This may expose the flood defence to the maximum hydraulic head, due to intrusion of the canal water in to the aquifer below, which results in high probability of piping. In follow up research, we recommend including the effect of these events. The piping probability can be computed for scenarios with and without the reduced head, and then combined. Instability: The probability of failure for instability largely depends on the combination of the phreatic line and top loads. The influence of the outer water level for a given phreatic line is very low. Traffic loads reduce the reliability of the flood defence considerably. Due to the absence of data on probabilities of phreatic lines, we assumed a distribution based on expert judgement. We recommend performing field tests to determine actual distribution of the phreatic line in the defence more accurately. Several experts have stated that the current approach to for including traffic loads does not model the actual situation correct. We therefore recommend discussing the impact of having to include traffic loads on the strength of regional flood defences more thoroughly. The total failure probability of the regional flood defence system surrounding the Heerhugowaard polder is shown in Table 3. Proven strength We used First Order Survival Updating to update the failure probabilities found for piping. The probability of piping reduced to below 10 - 6, partly because the probability of water levels higher than the maximum survived water level is very small. However, if we analyse the equations used in this method we conclude that, for this specific case, the method is unrealistic, because the water level uncertainty has little influence on the failure probability (alpha values of 0, 05). This results in an error in the formulas, with very low failure probabilities as a result. We therefore recommend to apply an exact method of Bayesian Updating for proven strength, which is described in (Schweckendiek, 2014). This will provide better estimates of the posterior failure probability. Flood risk HIS SSM and WSS were used to compute the consequences of flooding for each flood scenario. The calculated consequences both lie in the same order of magnitude (except for scenario 5, due to large difference in the damage to industry). We assume the WSS model to determine the flood damages for regional flood defences more accurately than HIS SSM, because, in general, these floods have lower inundation depths. The flood risk of each scenario is shown in Table 34. The largest flood risk is determined by scenario 3, or section 11, which has a large probability of flooding combined with high flood consequences. Moreover, the Schermer canal has higher flood risks than the VRNK canal. Cost effectiveness The results of a flood risk assessment for regional flood defences can be used to make cost benefit assessment for interventions in the system. Currently interventions in the system are based on the assessment of regional flood defences, wherein weakest sections are prioritized over stronger sections. However, the weakest sections within a system may very well not be the sections where interventions are most cost effective. Note that the results in this assessment are presented to illustrate the method. The expected total costs of several interventions aiming to reduce flood risk in a system of regional flood defences were compared: - Reducing the hydraulic loads on regional flood defences is not cost effective, as the influence on the flood risk of reducing the drain stop level is negligible; - Restricting traffic loads on regional flood defences can be cost effective, if instability is the governing failure mechanism for the considered section. - Compartmentalization of canals, to reduce the consequences after a flood, can be a cost effective intervention. - Reinforcements prove to be the most cost effective measure. Discussion and conclusions We conclude that the flood risk approach can be applied to regional flood defence systems using the data used in the safety assessment of regional flood defences. The approach not only provides insight in the failure probabilities of the flood defences, but also in the corresponding consequences of flooding and therefore the flood risk. The results can be used to compare the flood risk within the system and prioritize interventions based on the expected risk reduction and cost effectiveness. To obtain more accurate results we recommend investigating how the data obtained in the assessment can be used more effectively in the flood risk approach and/or proven strength assessments. For example, more insight in the relation between the outer water level and rainfall on the phreatic line may provide better estimates of the probability density function of the phreatic line. For these assessments, insights obtained from the water board dike supervisors can play a useful rule. According to the IPO safety standards, the probability of flooding for these flood defence system is required to be 20 % of the probability of a drain stop, which is 1 / 500 per year. The probabilities found for overflow comply with these requirements. However, several sections do not comply with the safety standard for piping and instability, which was also concluded in the safety assessment of the flood defence system. Temporary measures to increase the strength of flood defences during calamities have not been considered in this report. We recommend investigating the potential effectiveness of these measures and comparing this with more traditional reinforcements of the flood defences and consequence reducing measures, such as compartmentalization of the canals. The results of a flood risk assessment of regional flood defence systems can be compared with the results of flood risk from primary flood defences. To do so, more research is required in system behaviour of several regional flood defence systems, as one primary flood defence system often surrounds several of these systems. This report focussed on the flood risk from regional flood defences loaded by canal systems; however, these flood defences are also used to protect polders from flooding from the larger lakes and several ‘regional rivers’ (e. g. the Dommel). The load uncertainty (i. e. water level difference) in these systems is larger, which can result in different conclusions than those obtained in this report. This also requires further research...|$|E

Thirdly, the article examines the role of humour in the complexities of identity work and in relation to different frameworks of power.

Zeolite membrane processes and kinetically selective cyclic adsorption processes depend for their selectivity on differences in intracrystalline diffusion rates so these processes are designed to operate under conditions of intracrystalline diffusion control.

These factors individually and all in combination, may limit the relative autonomy of the regulatory system that was kick-started by the 1992 programme. The regulatory process is likely to become more prone to influences from the political and the social domains, as well as susceptible to more active external influences (both EU enlargement and WTO developments).
