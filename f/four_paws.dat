500|$|Being both a gregarious and solitary animal, the {{variability}} of the coyote's visual and vocal repertoire is intermediate between that of the solitary foxes and the highly social wolf. The aggressive behavior of the coyote bears more similarities to that of foxes than it does that of wolves and dogs. An aggressive coyote arches its back and lowers its tail. Unlike dogs, which solicit playful behavior by performing a [...] "play-bow" [...] followed by a [...] "play-leap", play in coyotes consists of a bow, followed by side-to-side head flexions {{and a series of}} [...] "spins" [...] and [...] "dives". Although coyotes will sometimes bite their playmates' scruff as dogs do, they typically approach low, and make upward-directed bites. Pups fight each other regardless of sex, while among adults, aggression is typically reserved for members of the same sex. Combatants approach each other waving their tails and snarling with their jaws open, though fights are typically silent. Males tend to fight in a vertical stance, while females fight on all <b>four</b> <b>paws.</b> Fights among females tend to be more serious than ones among males, as females seize their opponents' forelegs, throat, and shoulders.|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} told from the {{perspective}} of a tabby cat with <b>four</b> white <b>paws</b> who lives with a young married couple, Bill and Marilyn Bricker. Initially, Socks and the Bricker couple are alone, and Socks receives a great deal of love and attention as a result. However, the Brickers soon have a baby son and Socks begins to feel as though he has been forgotten. Socks receives less attention than he normally would as the Brickers must now spend most of their time caring for baby Charles William; he even ends up living in the garage for a short time when his behavior is misinterpreted. He has several misadventures in the course, culminating in a fight with another neighborhood cat. After this takes place, the Brickers realize they have been so wrapped up with the new baby that they have neglected Socks, and they resolve this by petting and hugging Socks to remind him they love him. Later on, Socks discovers that he has a new friend in little Charles William and a new way to be part of the family. The book ends with Socks sleeping next to Charles William in his crib.|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the motor cortex in the rat can evoke complex forelimb multi-joint movements, including movement of limb and paw. In this study, these movements have been quantified in terms of 3 D displacement and kinematic variables of two markers positioned on the wrist and middle digits (limb and paw movement, respectively). Electrical microstimulation {{was applied to the}} motor cortex using a pulse train of 500 ms duration. Movements were measured using a high-resolution 3 D optical system. Five classes of limb movements (abduction, adduction, extension, retraction, elevation) and <b>four</b> classes of <b>paw</b> movements (opening, closure, opening/closure sequence, supination) were described according to their kinematics. A consistent topography of these classes of movements was presented across the motor cortex together with a topography of spatial locations to which the paw was directed. In about one-half of cortical sites, a specific pattern of limb-paw movement combination did exist. Four categories of limb-paw movements resembling behavioral repertoire were identified: reach-shaping, reach-grasp sequence, bring-to-body, and hold-like movement. Overall, the forelimb motor region included: (1) a large caudal forelimb area dominated by reach-shaping movement representation; (2) a small rostral area containing reach-grasp sequence and bring-to-body movement representation; and (3) a more lateral portion where hold-like movement was represented. These results support the view that, in rats, the motor cortex controls forelimb movements at a relatively complex level and suggest that the orderly representation of complex movements and their dynamics/kinematics emerge from the principles of forelimb motor cortex organization...|$|R
40|$|Chinese herbal {{medicine}} {{has been used}} for thousands of years in China and other Asian countries to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases. The classic Chinese herbal formula, Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan (HLXL) is commonly used in traditional Chinese {{herbal medicine}} for the treatment of joint pain and other symptoms of arthritis. The present study is an investigation of the effects of a modified HLXL extract on persistent hyperalgesia and edema in rats with peripheral inflammation. Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into one hind <b>paw.</b> <b>Four</b> dosages of the extract were compared to a vehicle control. Each was administered intragastrally (i. g.) daily for seven days beginning one day before CFA. Hyperalgesia was assessed using a paw withdrawal latency (PWL) test and edema was determined by measuring paw thickness at pre-CFA and 2 hours, 24 hours, and 5 days post-CFA. Immunohistochemistry was performed 2 hours post-CFA to determine spinal Fos protein expression. Adverse effects of the extract were monitored by observing the animals closely for unusual behavioral changes. Compared to the control, HLXL at the two lower dosages (0. 575 g/kg and 1. 15 g/kg) were effective in the later stage (day 5) of inflammatory hyperalgesia and edema, while the two higher dosages (2. 3 g/kg and 4. 6 g/kg) alleviated early stage hind paw inflammation and hyperalgesia and facilitated recovery from paw edema and hyperalgesia during the late stage. HLXL at 2. 30 g/kg significantly suppressed Fos expression in laminae I-II, III-IV and V-VI ipsilaterally and in III-IV contralaterally. No significant signs of toxicity or adverse effects were observed. The data suggest that HLXL dosage-dependently attenuates CFA-induced inflammation and hyperalgesia, at least in part by inhibiting noxious transmission at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

40|$|The {{majority}} of piglet deaths occur {{within the first}} 72 h after parturition, with crushing by the sow as {{the most common cause}} of preweaning mortality. The aim of this study was to compare the behavior and performance of sows that killed piglets (CR) to those that did not (NC) inside a farrowing hut within the first 72 h after parturition. A total of 336 sows and their litters were used for comparisons. CR sows had more (P 3 Ìc 0. 01) piglets born/litter and born alive/litter than NC sows. Mortality was higher (P 3 Ìc 0. 01) for CR sows, with most piglet mortality in the first 72 h and there was a trend (P = 0. 06) for CR sows to wean fewer piglets/litter than NC sows (7. 8 Â± 0. 20 versus 8. 4 Â± 0. 26), respectively. Behaviors were collected by time-lapse video on 20 sows, 10 from each group. Four sow postures: walking, standing, sitting and lying; <b>four</b> sow behaviors: <b>pawing,</b> rooting, nursing interval and nursing duration; and one sow location: out of hut were recorded.

His dog (not the immortal Luath, but a successor unknown to fame, caret quia vote sacro), apparently sensible of some neglect, followed his master to and fro, to the confusion of the dancers. Some mirthful comments followed; and Jean heard the poet say to his partner--or, as I should imagine, laughingly launch the remark to the company at large--that [...] "he wished he could get any of the lasses to like him as well as his dog."

This brought the two into conversation; when Jean, with a somewhat hoydenish advance, inquired if [...] "he had yet got any of the lasses to like him as well as his dog?" [...] It is one of the misfortunes of the professional Don Juan that his honour forbids him to refuse battle; he is in life like the Roman soldier upon duty, or like the sworn physician who must attend on all diseases. Burns accepted the provocation; hungry hope reawakened in his heart; here was a girl--pretty, simple at least, if not honestly stupid, and plainly not averse to his attentions: it seemed to him once more as if love might here be waiting him. Had he but known the truth! for this facile and empty-headed girl had nothing more in view than a flirtation; and her heart, from the first and on to the end of her story, was engaged by another man. Burns once more commenced the celebrated process of [...] "battering himself into a warm affection"; and the proofs of his success are to be found in many verses of the period. Nor did he succeed with himself only; Jean, with her heart still elsewhere, succumbed to his fascination, and early in the next year the natural consequence became manifest. It was a heavy stroke for this unfortunate couple. They had trifled with life, and were now rudely reminded of life's serious issues. Jean awoke to the ruin of her hopes; the best she had now to expect was marriage with a man who was a stranger to her dearest thoughts; she might now be glad if she could get what she would never have chosen. As for Burns, at the stroke of the calamity he recognised that his voyage of discovery had led him into a wrong hemisphere--that he was not, and never had been, really in love with Jean. Hear him in the pressure of the hour. [...] "Against two things," [...] he writes, [...] "I am as fixed as fate--staying at home, and owning her conjugally. The first, by heaven, I will not do!--the last, by hell, I will never do!" [...] And then he adds, perhaps already in a more relenting temper: [...] "If you see Jean, tell her I will meet her, so God hold me in my hour of need." [...] They met accordingly; and Burns, touched with her misery, came down from these heights of independence, and gave her a written acknowledgment of marriage. It is the punishment of Don Juanism to create continually false positions--relations of life which are wrong in themselves, and which it is equally wrong to break or to perpetuate. This was such a case. Worldly Wiseman would have laughed and gone his way; let us be glad that Burns was better counselled by his heart. When we discover that we can no longer be true, the next best is to be kind. I daresay he came away from that interview not very content, but with a glorious conscience; and as he went homeward, he would sing his favourite, [...] "How are Thy servants blest, O Lord!" [...] Jean, on the other hand, armed with her [...] "lines," [...] confided her position to the master-mason, her father, and his wife. Burns and his brother were then in a fair way to ruin themselves in their farm; the poet was an execrable match for any well-to-do country lass; and perhaps old Armour had an inkling of a previous attachment on his daughter's part. At least, he was not so much incensed by her slip from virtue as by the marriage which had been designed to cover it. Of this he would not hear a word. Jean, who had besought the acknowledgment only to appease her parents, and not at all from any violent inclination to the poet, readily gave up the paper for destruction; and all parties imagined, although wrongly, that the marriage was thus dissolved. To a proud man like Burns here was a crushing blow. The concession which had been wrung from his pity was now publicly thrown back in his teeth. The Armour family preferred disgrace to his connection. Since the promise, besides, he had doubtless been busy [...] "battering himself" [...] back again into his affection for the girl; and the blow would not only take him in his vanity, but wound him at the heart.|$|R
