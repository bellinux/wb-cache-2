In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days before}} the HELP {{confirmation}} hearing, former Surgeon General Richard Carmona went public with claims that the Bush Administration censored his speeches and buried his scientific reports. When asked about this at the hearing, Holsinger said, [...] "If I were faced with a situation that I felt I could not in good conscience do, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> clear response to that. I would resign." ...|$|E

2500|$|These Republican {{leaders have}} not been content with attacks on me, or my wife, or on my sons. No, not content with that, they now include my little dog, Fala. [...] Well, of course, I don't resent attacks, and my family don't resent attacks, but Fala does resent them. You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, {{as soon as he}} learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I'd left him behind on an Aleutian island and had sent a {{destroyer}} back to find him—at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or twenty million dollars—his Scotch soul was furious. He has not been the same dog since. I am accustomed to hearing malicious falsehoods about myself ...

6000|$|... "So I gather," [...] I replied; [...] "but mine have {{remained}} much the same, {{and if it}} is convenient to you to repay me that £250 you owe me, with interest, I shall be much obliged. If not, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good story to tell about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we {{must say}} more about it," [...] he replied. [...] "I repeat I {{have no idea}} of what you are talking about. I have no secret {{whatever}} on my mind.

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Mr. Perkins politely. [...] "Well, I suppose I {{could easily}} find out by opening it. But {{it is very}} impolite to open other people's letters. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better plan.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. It {{is a very}} serious sort of thing to my way of thinking. When Mary got your letter it nearly broke her heart. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to expect it, and if you don't come I shall feel myself injured.
