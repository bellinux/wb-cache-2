40|$|Free-space optical (FSO) {{communication}} {{is a very}} attractive technology offering very high throughput without spectral regulation constraints, yet allowing small antennas (telescopes) and tap-proof communication. However, the transmitted signal has to travel through the atmosphere where it gets influenced by atmospheric turbulence, causing scintillation of the received signal. In addition, climatic effects like fogs, clouds and rain also affect the signal significantly. Moreover, FSO being a {{line of sight communication}} requires precise pointing and tracking of the telescopes, which otherwise also causes fading. To achieve error-free transmission, various mitigation techniques like aperture averaging, adaptive optics, transmitter diversity, sophisticated coding and modulation schemes are being investigated and implemented. Evaluating the performance of such systems under controlled conditions is very difficult in field trials since the atmospheric situation constantly changes, and the target scenario (e. g. on aircraft or satellites) is not easily accessible for test purposes. Therefore, with the motivation to be able to test and verify a system under laboratory conditions, DLR has developed a <b>fading</b> <b>testbed</b> that can emulate most realistic channel conditions. The main principle of the <b>fading</b> <b>testbed</b> is to control the input current of a variable optical attenuator such that it attenuates the incoming signal according to the loaded power vector. The sampling frequency and mean power of the vector can be optionally changed according to requirements. This paper provides a brief introduction to software and hardware development of the <b>fading</b> <b>testbed</b> and measurement results showing its accuracy and application scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Friction {{material}} in a brake system {{plays an important}} role for effective and safe brake performance. Brake materials contain mainlyAlumina and other ingredients. This research attempts to examine mechanical properties of Boron mixed brake pads. Five groups of semi-metallic composite materials were studied. Friction coefficient of Boron mixed and commercial brake pads were significantly different. Average friction coefficient of Boron mixed pads was 0. 495, 0. 065 higher than commercial pad. Abrupt reduction of friction coefficient which is known as fade was more significant in the commercial pad samples than in Boron mixed pads. Fade occurred in commercial pad sample at the lower temperature as <b>first</b> <b>fade</b> was at 204 oC and second was at 159 oC resulted from earlier softening and degradation of Alumina material. All Boron pads were more stable and constant than their commercial counterparts. The study shows a slight reduction of friction coefficient at a temperature of 204 oC during the <b>first</b> <b>fade</b> and 238 oC on the second for Boron mixed pads. Both commercial and Boron mixed brake pads showed normal recovery stage in that they returned to their pre-fade friction coefficient levels with little temperature reduction. Properties of Boron mixed brake pads are better than Commercial brake pads.  2013 Trade Science Inc. - INDI...|$|R

30|$|The {{observance}} of these pigments has {{also led to}} {{a study of the}} lightfastness of Maki’s palette using visible light induced accelerated <b>fade</b> <b>testing</b> of an exemplar of his “Poem” series. This lightfastness study identified several inorganic pigments like chrome yellow and molybdate orange that are susceptible to loss of intensity and darkening upon exposure to light and demonstrated somewhat surprisingly the lightfastness of the somewhat fugitive aniline black when mixed with a carbonaceous black pigment. These studies highlight the importance of light in the appreciation of these vibrant modern woodblock prints, the utility of light-based analyses in understanding the artist’s material choices, the role of light in the degradation of these same artworks, and the importance of identifying artist’s materials for customizing stewardship practices.|$|R

In a recent work the same authors demonstrated that the environmental conditions, mainly temperature, can seriously affect the detector sensitivity. The temperature effect {{is to reduce the}} V ratio by decreasing the track etching velocity Vt. This causes a decrease in limit angle and efficiency.

Due to sampling limitations micro-destructive testing, or non-invasive analysis using PDA-UPLC, Raman Spectroscopy and PIXE were used to characterise the dye sources and metallic mordants. RBS was used to obtain additional information on the depth-profiling of the mordants in the keratin-based quill.

40|$|The {{application}} of the single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol to equivalent dose determination in coarse-grain feldspar is investigated. An outline of the protocol is presented, and basic tests of its performance are discussed. It is shown that the method is robust and yields results similar to those obtained with a single-aliquot additive-dose (SAAD) procedure. The use of the SAR procedure for <b>fading</b> <b>tests</b> is also discussed. We conclude that the SAR protocol for coarse-grain feldspar yields several advantages over previously used multiple-aliquot and single-aliquot methods. The method is fast and precise, the equivalent dose is obtained by interpolation, and the method corrects for sensitivity changes. The luminescence age obtained by SAR and additive-dose dating of the coarse-grain feldspar separates {{used in this study}} do, however, underestimate the independently estimated geological age of the samples.

5000|$|Glass plate negatives and ambrotypes {{are prone}} to breakage. Deterioration of film negatives, {{regardless}} of type, is humidity and temperature dependent. Nitrate film will <b>first</b> <b>fade,</b> then become brittle and sticky. It will then soften, adhere to paper enclosures, and produce an odor. Finally, it will disintegrate into a brown, acrid powder. Because of its flammability, it must be handled with particular care. Cellulose aetate, diacetate, and triacetate film produce acetic acid, which smells like vinegar. The deterioration process is therefore known as [...] "vinegar syndrome." [...] The negatives become very brittle and, in diacetate and triacetate film, the base shrinks, causing grooves (“channeling”).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to assess the relative effectiveness of two prompt-fading procedures for teaching difficult visual discriminations to autistic children. Both prompt procedures involved within-stimulus fading where manipulation occurred on the relevant component of the discrimination. One procedure involved <b>fading</b> <b>first</b> along the S+ stimulus, while holding the S− stimulus constant. The other procedure involved <b>fading</b> <b>first</b> along the S− stimulus, while holding the S+ stimulus constant. Eight autistic children were each taught two discriminations, one by each of the prompt procedures.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{features the}} development of signal processing strategies for the estimation of channel impulse responses and the equalization {{of the effects of}} channels on communications signals propagating through them using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The two strategies are developed as part of a wavelet-based signal processing platform, which can be used to enable reconfigurable radio transceivers. The approach taken is to recast standard discrete time-domain signal processing procedures into a DWT-based framework. To facilitate this, three equivalent techniques of DWT-based convolution that use both subband coding as well as polyphase filter implementations are devised. A DWT-based deconvolution procedure is derived analytically and is applied to perform estimation of several time-invariant multipath communications channels. Conditions of slow and fast fading are considered, and <b>faded</b> <b>test</b> signals are corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) that results in ratios of bit-energy-to-noise-power-density, 0 bE N, in the range of 0 to 30 dB.

40|$|ABSTRACT. During the braking phase, {{the heat}} {{produced}} by friction between pads and disc cannot be entirely dissipated. Consequently, the brake disc, especially if very hard braking occur, can accumulate {{large amounts of}} heat {{in a short time}} so producing high gradients of temperature on it. Under these conditions, functionality and safety of the brake system can be compromised. The object {{of this study is to}} investigate, under extreme working conditions, the thermomechanical behaviour of different brake rotors in order to evaluate their efficiency and stability and to identify any compromising weakness on them. In particular, by means of FEM thermo-mechanical coupled analyses, one full disc and three ventilated rotors with different shapes have been studied. A very hard (<b>fading)</b> <b>test</b> has been used to evaluate the performances of the discs in terms of temperature distribution, stresses and strains. Obtained results demonstrate that the analysed ventilated discs, unlike the full rotor, can be effectively used in very hard working conditions, always ensuring high safety levels. Among the studied rotors, the curved-vanes disc was found to be the best solution...|$|R
