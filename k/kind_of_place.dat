5|$|One {{common goal}} of early Daoism was to extend life by {{achieving}} immortality. The Celestial Masters believed {{that in order}} to achieve immortality, one was not supposed to extend life in the current world, but rather 'feign death' in this world, and be reborn on the other side. In order to feign death, an adept had to have perfectly harmonized internal spirits. When someone with refined internal spirits died in this world, their spirit would venture to the Palace of Grand Darkness where their form would be refined and then reborn in a perfected state on the other side. There are no surviving texts that describe what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> the 'other side' was. Those that failed to harmonize their internal spirits prior to death would be reborn in the underground earth-prisons, where they would be subject to eternal torment and toil.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unknown}} {{if in the}} case of the {{disappearance}} of the “pure” dingo the then existing hybrids will alter the predation pressure on other species. It is also not clear what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> these dogs will have in the Australian ecosystem and research results on this topic are rare. However, it is considered probable that the dynamics of the various ecosystems will not be disturbed by this. One example in this topic are the bush rats, where it is also seen as unlikely that there could be problems due to the dingo-hybrids, because these rodents had been exposed to the influence of the dingoes for thousands of years.|$|E

In general, a gay bath is mainly used for having a sexual activity rather than only bathing.|$|E

Cressida Cowell, the author of How to Train Your Dragon, spent childhood summers in [...] the Inner Hebrides and has stated that they are [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} places on Earth" [...] and [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where you expect to see dragons overhead".|$|E
500|$|After graduation, Nolan {{worked as}} a script reader, camera operator, and {{director}} of corporate videos and industrial films. He also made a third short, Doodlebug (1997), about a man chasing an insect around a flat with a shoe, only to discover when killing it {{that it is a}} miniature of himself. During this period of his career, Nolan had little or no success getting his projects off the ground; he later recalled the [...] "stack of rejection letters" [...] that greeted his early forays into making films, adding [...] "there's a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place...</b> Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry." ...|$|E
5000|$|The idea of [...] "absolute consideration" [...] {{states that}} some <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> soil, and thus some <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> {{are better than}} others for prayer.

5000|$|In Cambodia, a wat is used {{to refer}} to all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> <b>of</b> worship.

The Portland Mercury {{said the}} restaurant was a [...] "kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd". One Portland resident described the club as [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> {{where you can go}} with your sophisticated friends and look at the Daddy-O decor. Or you can go on a date and snuggle in a corner where the lighting is low.

500|$|Ndegéocello {{spent over}} a year writing the songs from Devil's Halo, being {{inspired}} in part by her trip to Ireland. [...] "I went {{to a couple of}} pubs and there were much older gentlemen playing the guitar and just singing these amazing, simple songs", Ndegéocello recalled. [...] "I really admired that. I wanted to get to that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where the song could just exist with a guitar and a vocal." [...] With Icelandic audio engineer S. Husky Höskulds, Ndegéocello proceeded to record the album in seven days, backed by a band that featured guitarist Chris Bruce, keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, and drummer Deantoni Parks. She later credited them with providing her inspiration and critique while keeping her [...] "clear about what is the real focus—in life and in music". Their instruments were recorded live without digital post-production, which New York Times critic Ben Ratliff said contributed to the music's raw and organic sound.|$|E
500|$|... "JJ" [...] {{was filmed}} in November 2008 {{in the same}} {{production}} block as the series' eighth episode, [...] "Effy". Ollie Barbieri did some research to help him in playing JJ, who has Asperger syndrome. He said that, in initial episodes, he played JJ as [...] "quite mad and I jumped around a lot", though by this episode his portrayal was [...] "watered down a bit". Charles Martin shot an unscripted scene that involved Barbieri destroying the set of JJ's bedroom; Martin believed this would help Barbieri to get into JJ's mindset. Barbieri was also able {{to learn more about}} his character by creating the collage in JJ's room himself, in which JJ has tried to organise his thoughts about his friends and his life. Martin said that he and Barbieri had a [...] "very involved director-actor relationship" [...] and that he enjoyed [...] "JJ" [...] the most out of all the episodes he directed in the series. According to runner Laurence Wigfield, JJ's clinic was described in the script as [...] "a desolate shabby place, the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> you went to die", with the bracketed suggestion of Fishponds Studio, where the Skins offices are. Though Wigfield initially [...] "couldn't believe" [...] this, the studio was used for filming the scene, which Wigfield admitted [...] "worked quite well". The scene in which JJ and Emily bond after meeting at the clinic was filmed in Bristol's Brandon Hill Park, near Cabot Tower.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{approaches}} {{the question of}} government and surveillance through a comparison between the control practices observable in two types <b>of</b> <b>places.</b> First, we focus on international airports, specifically the French international airport of Orly. Airports are maximum security zones where persons perceived as having no legitimate business are expelled and where suspicious objects are destroyed. The second <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> are the ones labeled as "no-go areas", violent pockets within urban space. Social housing projects located in the bleak suburbs of French cities are such dangerous zones. Both <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> - airports and no-go areas - have very different time and space features: people briefly pass through anonymous airports where relationships are kept at an impersonal minimum, whereas the population of a housing estate area is made of "permanent transients" pinned down by a shared fate of which there seems no escape...|$|R

500|$|Mother's Milk {{instantly}} garnered {{more attention}} than the band's previous records and, as such, the venues the band performed in were able to accommodate far larger crowds. For {{the first time the}} band also upgraded to a full-fledged tour bus and added backup musicians and singers. Longtime friend, Keith [...] "Tree" [...] Barry was added to play horns and backup singers Kristen Vigard and Vicki Calhoun (who appeared in the video for [...] "Knock Me Down") also joined the tour. When the band hit England, roadie Robbie Allen (nicknamed Rob Rule) would open for the band providing a comedy performance in which he would pretend to cut off his own penis. Allen would later become one of the band's backup singers on the One Hot Minute tour. The album's official launch, however, was held in New York City at a club called Tramps; following this, Red Hot Chili Peppers embarked on an introductory European tour which included a free show in Amsterdam's Dam Square that attracted over 10,000 attendees. On September 8, 1989 the band commenced their North American leg in Seattle. The leg saw an overwhelmingly positive response from critics across the country; following a concert in Portland, journalist John Foyston of The Oregonian noted the [...] "Hollywood-based quartet fomented an audience reaction that had to be seen to be believed. The stage-divers started rushing the stage from the moment the band walked on. Once on stage, it was an issue of luck and chutzpah." [...] Todd Caudle of the Colorado Springs newspaper The Gazette said the Chili Peppers' performance at the Colorado Indoor Sports Complex was [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where kids could be kids, and no one cared if soft drinks stuck to the floor and the rafters shook with a stunning barrage of decibels. People in the audience, steeped in sweat and pressing against the barricade in front of the stage, threw their arms up in unison and barked out approval of one fast, furiously-played song after another." ...|$|E

[...] Fairy tales were also an inspiration: the bluesy [...] "Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum" [...] is titled after the trademark exclamation of the giant in Jack and the Beanstalk.|$|E

2500|$|A {{worker at}} DC Central Kitchen saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard {{his desire to}} show he was sorry. She thought that the [...] "Kitchen" [...] {{would be a good}} place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and {{cleaning}} bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: [...] "It's the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{foundation}} of the Generator space was partially inspired by Montgomery's trips to Europe, in which he encountered likeminded multi-purpose venues (citing the Staaltape cassette shop in Amsterdam and the Gelbe Musik in Berlin as significant influences in this regard): [...] "I saw all these <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> and every time I came back to New York I got very frustrated, because it seemed like there was nothing like that here." ...|$|R
