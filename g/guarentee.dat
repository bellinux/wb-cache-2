The two-level local projection stabilization is considered as a one-level approach in which the enrichments on each element are piecewise poly-nomial functions. The dimension of the enrichment space can be significantly reduced without losing the convergence order. For example, using continuous piecewise polynomials of degree r ≥ 1, only one function per cell is needed as enrichment instead of r in the two-level approach.

40|$|Introduction: In {{anticipation}} of the draft guidelines ‘Sedation/analgesics outside the Operation Room’ a screeningsconsultation is started in 2009. This screeningconsultation is performed in Medisch Spectrum Twente (MST) by specialized nurses and has as primarily goal {{the reduction of the}} number of incidents and complications and thereby <b>guarentee</b> the safety of the procedure. In this investigation the incidents and complications, which are occurred during PSA in 2008 en 2009 are evaluated and are compared between screened and non-screened patients. Thereby the risk factors for the occurrence from sedation-related incidents are investigated even as the policy changes made during the consultations. Finally the opinion from patients about the screening consultation is examined. Methods: The effectivity from the screeningsconsultation has been investigated by a retrospective, comparative investigation. From all included gastro-intestinal PSA’s in 2008 and 2009 the incidents and complications and their potential risk factors are registred. The appreciation of the consultation among patients is investigated independetely by a questionnaire. Results: 9727 gastro-intestinal PSA’s were performed in 2008 en 2009. Sedation-related incidents occured in 0, 94 % and complications in 0, 03 % of the PSA’s. One patient died after a sedation-related complication. Multiple logistic regression revealed patient age (P< 0, 001) as an independent predictor of sedation-related incidents. This study also shows a reverse relation between sedation-related incidents and Dormicum (P< 0, 05) en Buscopan (P< 0, 05). Policy changes are made in 34, 1 % from all consultations. No significant difference is demonstrated in sedation-related incidents between screened and non-screened patients. The enquiry revealed an high appreciation (65, 1 %) and wish for continuation (95, 2 %) by the screened patients. Conclusion: Sedation-related incidents and complications are infrequent. No difference in sedation-related incidents and complications was found between screened and non-screened patients. Still, the fact that screened patients were selected on higher age and comorbidity may partly explain this lack of effect. Furthermore, the single fatality could have been prevented by a screening consultation. The screening consultation was highly appreciated by the screened patients. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{identify}} and define Zenith attacks, {{a new class}} of attacks on content-distribution systems, which seek to expose the popularity (i. e. access frequency) of individual items of content. As the access pattern to most real-world content exhibits Zipf-like characteristics [2], there is a small set of dominating items which account for the majority of accesses. Identifying such items enables an adversary to perform follow up adversarial actions targeting these items, including mounting denial of service attacks, deploying censorship mechanisms, and eavesdropping on or prosecution of the host or recipient. We instantiate a Zenith attack on the Kademlia and Chord structured overlay networks and quantify the cost of such an attack.

40|$|Prior {{research}} on novelty detection has primarily focused on algorithms to 2 ̆ 2 detect 2 ̆ 2 novelty {{for a given}} application domain. Effective storage, indexing and retrieval of novel events (beyond detection) are largely ignored as a problem in itself. In light of the recent advances in counter-terrorism efforts and link discovery initiatives, the need for effective data management of novel events assumes apparent importance. Automatically detecting novel events in video data streams is an extremely challenging task. The aim of this thesis is to provide evidence {{to the fact that}} the notion of novelty in video as perceived by a human is extremely subjective and therefore algorithmically illdefined. Though it comes as no surprise that current machine-based parametric learning systems to accurately mimic human novelty perception are far from perfect such systems have recently been very successful in exhaustively capturing novelty in video once the novelty function is well-defined by a human expert. So, how truly effective are these machine based novelty detection systems as compared to human novelty detection? In this paper we outline an experimental evaluation of the human vs machine based novelty systems in terms of qualitative performance. We then quantify this evaluation using a variety of metrics based on location of novel events, number of novel events found in the video, etc. We begin by describing a machine-based system for detecting novel events in video data streams. We then discuss the issues of designing an indexing-strategy or 2 ̆ 2 Manga 2 ̆ 2 (comic-book representation is termed as 2 ̆ 2 manga 2 ̆ 2 in Japanese) to effectively determine the 2 ̆ 2 most-representative 2 ̆ 2 novel frames for a video sequence. We then evaluate the performance of machine-based novelty detection system against human novelty detection and present the results. The distance metrics we suggest for novelty comparison may eventually aide a variety of end-users to effectively drive the indexing, retrieval and analysis of large video databases. It should also be noted that the techniques we describe in this paper are based on low-level features extracted from video such as color, intensity and focus of attention. The video processing component does not include any semantic processing such as object detection in video for this framework. We conjecture that such advances, though beyond the scope of this particular paper, would undoubtedly benefit the machine-based novelty detection systems and experimentally validate this. We believe that developing a novelty detection system that works in conjunction with the human expert will lead to a more user-centered data mining approach for such domains. JPEG 2000 is a new method of compressing images better than other image formats such as JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc. The main reason this format is in need for investigation is it allows metadata to be embedded within the image itself. The types of data can essentially be anything such as text, audio, video, images, etc. Currently image annotations are stored and collected side by side. Even though this method is very common, it brings up a lot of risks and flaws. Imagine if medical images were annotated by doctors to describe a tumor within the brain, then suddenly some of the annotations are lost. Without these annotations, the images itself would be useless. By embedding these annotations within the image will <b>guarentee</b> that the description and the image will never be seperated.

In this thesis we initially develop a metric to index novelty by comparing it to traditional indexing techniques and to human perception. In the second phase of this thesis, we will investigate the new emerging technology of JPEG 2000 and show that novelty stored in this format will outperform traditional image structures. One of the contributions this thesis is making is to develop metrics to measure the performance and quality between the query results of JPEG 2000 and traditional image formats. Since JPEG 2000 is a new technology, there are no existing metrics to measure this type of performance with traditional images...|$|E

We introduce various compatibility type conditions relating the J(i) and the lower and upper solutions and show each is sufficient to construct a compatible G which defines these boundary conditions. Thus our existence results apply. Almost all the standard boundary conditions considered in the literature assuming upper and lower solutions are, or can be, de fined by compatible G and their associated existence results follow from ours; in many cases we can improve these results by deleting some of their assumptions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new approach for reducing communication in Krylov subspace methods that consists of enlarging the Krylov subspace by a maximum of t vectors per iteration, based on the domain decomposition of the graph of A. The obtained enlarged Krylov subspace is a superset of the Krylov subspace. Thus {{it is possible to}} search for the solution of the system Ax=b in the enlarged Krylov subspace instead of the Krylov subspace. Moreover, we show in this paper that the enlarged Krylov projection subspace methods lead to faster convergence in terms of iterations and parallelizable algorithms with less communication, with respect to Krylov methods. In this paper we focus on Conjugate Gradient (CG), a Krylov projection method for symmetric (Hermitian) positive definite matrices. We discuss two new versions of Conjugate Gradient. The first method, multiple search direction with orthogonalization CG (MSDO-CG), is an adapted version of MSD-CG with the A-orthonormalization of the search directions to obtain a projection method that <b>guarentees</b> convergence at least as fast as CG. The second projection method that we propose here, long recurrence enlarged CG (LRE-CG), is similar to GMRES in that we build an orthonormal basis for the enlarged Krylov subspace rather than finding search directions. Then, we use the whole basis to update the solution and the residual. Both methods converge faster than CG in terms of iterations, but LRE-CG converges faster than MSDO-CG since it uses the whole basis to update the solution rather than only t search directions. And the more subdomains are introduced or the larger t is, the faster is the convergence of both methods with respect to CG in terms of iterations. For example, for t = 64 the MSDO-CG and LRE-CG methods converge in 75 % up to 98 % less iteration with respect to CG for the different test matrices. But increasing t also means increasing the memory requirements. Thus, in practice, t should be relatively small, depending on the available memory, {{on the size of the}} matrix, and on the number of iterations needed for convergence. We also present the parallel algorithms along with their expected performance based on the estimated run times, and the preconditioned versions with their convergence behavior...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{reform in}} European {{antitrust}} enforcement is embodied in Regolation n. 1 / 2003 / Ce and related Communications. Since 2004 {{when it came}} into force, some crytical assessments can already be made. The work starts from some technical analysis of the reform, under a procedural perspective, to assess the proceedings’ real impact on parties’ rights and to criticize its limits. Decentralisation has brought about more complicacies, since community procedural systems are not harmonized, neither in their administrative rules, nor in their civil proceedings, which are all involved in the European antitrust network. Therefore, antitrust proceedings end un as being more jurisdictional in their effects than in their <b>guarentees,</b> which is a flaw to be mended by legislators. National laws shoud be harmonized, community law should be clarified and the system should turn more honestly towards a rationalized jurisdiction-cented mechanism. Otherwise, parties defense rights and the overall efficiency are put into doubt. Italy is a good exemple of how many colmlicacies can outburst from national procedures and national decentralised application. An uncertain pattern of judicial control, together with unclear relationships among the institutions to cooperate in the antitrust network can produce more problems than they aim to solve. As to the private enforcement, Regulation n. 1 does not even attempt to give precise regulation to this underdeveloped sector. A continual comparison with U. S. system has brought the Commission to become aware both of the risks and of the advanteges of an increased civil antitrust litigation in fronto of national judges. In order to substain a larger development of this parallel and, presently, difficult way of judicial compensation, it is presently ongoing a consultation among states to find suitable incentives to make private enforcement more appealing and effective. The solution to this lack of private litigation {{is not to be}} sought in Regulation n. 1 which calls into action national legislators and proceedures to implement further improvements. As a conclusion, Regulation n. 1 is the outpost of an ambitious community design to create an efficient control mechanism over antitrust violations. It focuses on Commission proceedings, powers and sanctions in order to establish deterrence, then it highlights civil litigation perspectives and it involves directly states into antitrust application. It seems that more could be done to technically shape administrative proceedings in a more jurisdictionally oriented form, then to clarify respective roles and coordination mecanisms in order to prevent difficulties easy to forsee. Some of jurisprudential suggestions have been accepted, but much more is left {{to be done in the}} future to improve european antitrust enforcement system...|$|R
40|$|S. salivarius {{belongs to}} the viridans group streptococci and is a {{predominant}} inhabitant of the oral cavity. It produces bacteriocin-like inhibitory sustances (BLIS) - antimicrobial peptides that inhibit the growth of closely related bacteria. S. salivarius ssp. salivarius strain K 12 is highly active against S. pyogenes with lantibiotic salivaricin A 2. S. pyogenes, which is ß-hemolytic and in serogroup A, causes pharyngeal infections, particularly in children aged four to twelve, and occasionally complications as acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. To profit by the benefits of oral probiotic strain K 12, {{it is important to}} be able to monitor K 12 in a product or the environment with a highly sensitive and specific method. For this reason, first of all a species specific PCR on basis of the gene, encoding for dextranase, was tested in this study. 72 percent of the tested S. salivarius strains were detected. Furthermore, a strain specific method for detection of the industrial strain S. salivarius ssp. salivarius K 12 was developed. The method was tested in vitro and in vivo by colonization of a single representative individual with BLIS K 12 Throat Guard. Based on salivaricin A operon information for S. salivarius 20 P 3, conserved primers for amplification and sequencing of gene salA and salB of S. salivarius K 12 were designed. With the aid of the generated sequence fragment, three K 12 strain specific PCR methods were developed: a conventional PCR, a nested PCR and a quantative real-time (RTQ-) PCR. Our data showed that conventional PCR offers a method for detection of S. salivarius K 12 during phases of active colonization. In addition, patients can be tested on existing colonization with strain K 12 as high quantaty is <b>guarenteed.</b> To increase sensitivity, a strain specific nested PCR was developed. This double round PCR is able to detect even a small number of K 12 cells while specifity and reproducability are warranted. Avoidance of contamination has to be assured in the course of all laboratory processes. Futhermore, a strain specific real-time (RTQ-) PCR was established. The advantages in contrast to nested PCR are quantative determination of salivaricin A amplificats by using standard curves and safer working procedures in regard of contamination. Using nested PCR and real-time PCR, a colonization of the pharynx, the dorsum of the tongue and the saliva of the test person with S. salivarius ssp. salivarius strain K 12 could be shown for as long as 22 days. In conclusion, repeated administration of S. salivarius ssp. salivarius strain K 12 should be required at least every three weeks to achieve optimal probiotic effects against colonization and infection of S. pyogenes...|$|R
40|$|After the Treaty of Adrianople which {{declared}} {{the end of}} the Russo-Turkish War of 1828 - 1829, the Russian policy towards the Ottoman Empire has changed dramatically. Before the treaty was signed the Russian Tsar Nicholas I has formed a comitee composed of six eminent statesmen of Russia. The members of the committee were Kochubei, Golitsyn, Tolstoy, Nesselrode, Chernsyhev and Dashkov. Two different ways of policy towards the Ottoman Empire has been discussed in the meetings of the committee. One of them could be defined as the conventional policy of the Russian Empire which depends upon the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Another idea which was executed by the two significant members of the new comitee Nesselrode and Dashkov has been based on the presence of the Ottoman Empire. These two ideas were discussed through the meetings of the committee and it has been decided that the collapse of the Ottoman Empire was not convenient for the interests of Russia. This new policy of Russia depended upon the continuity of the Ottoman Empire was resulted in {{the end of the}} Russian expansionism through the Ottoman lands and this policy went on till the beginning of Crimean War in 1853. After the acceptance of the new policy Russia began to treat as the protector of the Ottoman Empire and the result of this new political trend was the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi in 1833. Especially the sign of Unkiar-Skelessi against the threat of Mehmed Ali Pasha of Egypt has made great effects on the politics of the European powers. BothEngland and France clearly accused Russia for agressive policy towards the Ottoman Empire. Even the best ally of Russia, the Austrian Empire has also declaredthe great suspicion since Russia was the sole protector of the Ottoman Empire after the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi. Indeed Russia has gained the position of first power in the Ottoman Empire by means of the new treaty. Especially the close of the Straits to the war ships of the countries which fought against Russia was a great advantage for the Russian Empire. All great powers has already {{declared the}}ir anxieties about Russia’s new position. That is to say Russia and her new advantages in the East were the basic problem or trouble for the European powers. Under these conditions Ottoman diplomacy had gained a great chance. While Russia was declaring a neutral policy towards the Ottoman Empire almost all European powers were strictly suspicious of Unkiar-Skelessi. It means that a very fertile atmosphere appeared to renew the Treaty of Adrianople which brings a heavy war indemnity and Russian occupation in Silistria. Sultan Mahmud II and the Sublime Porte has already explained their complaints about the Treaty of Adrianople. Because the Ottoman Empire had to pay an enormous war indemnity almost 10 million ducats and highly strategic city in the Balkans, Silistria, had been occupied by the Russian troops. On the other hand Wallachia and Moldovia were still under the control of Russia and the border in the Caucasus was also drawn so bad. All these realities proved that 1828 - 1829 War and the Treaty of Adrianople were the great disaster for the Ottomans. The Austrian foreign minister Clemens von Metternich has exppressed that the Treaty was a direct threat to the life and integrity of the Ottoman Empire. Since the Treaty of Adrianople was catastrophic the Ottoman administration began to search ways to change it. After UnkiarSkelessi the Sublime Porte has decided that a great chance had appeared because the Russian government was fear of the European intervention. The Sublime Porte explained its wishes to delibarete the conditions of the Treaty of Adrianople. Ahmed Fevzi Pasha was sent Petersburg to discuss and change the Treaty. He has reached Petersburg in December 1833. The meetings between Ottoman delegation and the Russian government started through the ends of December. After some discussions it was decided that a new treaty need to be signed which implied that the Treaty of Adrianople was premature. The Treaty of Petersburgsigned in February 1834 declares that the Ottoman Empire was saved from the deathful conditions of Adrianople. According to new treaty the war indemnity would be decreased from 10 million to four million ducats and the evacuation of Silistria would becompleted in a very short time. In addition to these new <b>guarentees</b> the Russiantroops in Wallachia and Moldovia would also evacuate the Principalities. Ahmed Fevzi Pasha left Petersburg through the ends of February withthe new and successful treaty which points out that the heavy conditions of Adrianople were thrown away...|$|R
40|$|D role in {{ensuring}} that these local human resources become permanent members of their respective local communities. In addition, enterprises and labor unions should change the existing industry-academic cooperation paradigm into one {{that is based on}} a form of enterprise (demander) -oriented industry-academic cooperation system through which actual business is conducted using the human resources and technologies developed in accordance with emerging types of industry-academic cooperation. Therefore, the provision of support to the academic sector should also encompass the integrated and comprehensive support needed to cover students, professors, and the human resources from enterprises. NGOs and citizen groups, in their capacity as monitors, should play the role of analyzing the HRD demands mad by local residents, preparing countermeasures, and inspecting the legality and transparency of the HRD policies in place in each individual field. In short, the legal and institutional devices, financial resources, and financial support needed to construct a cooperative network for regional HRD must be secured through the establishment of laws and institutions related to the regional HRD cooperative network, such as those pertaining to a cooperative network where human resources policy is concerned. To this end, the following suggestions are introduced herein: First, it is necessary to clearly separate the roles of the central and local governments, and to transfer the relevant authority and resources to local governments. Second, it is necessary to guarantee the representativeness of regions by establishing separate bodies such as a Vocational Education &Training Council, Regional HRD Council, and Lifelong Education Council, each with their own clear roles, and activating the organization and operation of a Regional HRD Council whose specialization can be <b>guarenteed.</b> Third, {{there is a need to}} restructure the functions of the HRD related departments in local autonomies in a manner that makes possible the full use of the regional HRD organizations that have been created within local autonomies. Fourth, there is a need to promote an awareness of the importance of regional HRD amongst residents, and to provide the various actors involved with pertinent information in a transparent and open-minded manner. The voluntary participation of residents is essential if government-government or public-private cooperation for regional HRD is to succeed. To this end, local governments should put in place and expand the windows through which regional organizations and residents can aggressively participate in the process of forging decisions relating to human resources development (HRD). 1. The Purpose of the Research and Necessity Thereof The rapid progression towards the knowledge-based society of the 21 st century has seen the possession and creation of knowledge emerge, along with competencies, as the core factors in terms of individual, organizational, and national competitiveness. The growing importance of human resources has in turn heightened individual countries interest in this particular factor. In the Korean case, the Participatory Government has identified human resources as the core factor in terms of fostering national development in the 21 st century, and has to this end attempted to establish various policies and strategies relating to a pan-national approach to the development of human resources. In addition, in the name of balanced national development and the expansion of the decentralization policy, the government has also established and implemented regional human resources development (Regional HRD) policies that meet the geographical, industrial, and economic characteristics of the targeted regions. At this level, the importance of regional HRD policies can be understood to lie in the fact that they are designed to alleviate existing unequal development between regions, foster a centralized policy for education and the use of human resources, and to establish a basis for balanced national development by educating human resources that mesh with regional characteristics and demands. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development has since 2004 supported regional human resources development centers in 13 cities and provinces outside of the capital area. Furthermore, in accordance with the Special Act on Balanced National Development, regional innovation councils(RIC) have been established in 16 cities and provinces. Sectional innovation councils closely related to regional HRD have in turn been established within 10 of these RICs. Nevertheless, the activities of these centers and councils have to date been limited. The linkage between the main actors involved in regional HRD has also been weak, thus rendering the conducting of effective operations difficult. This study is focused on the establishment of a local-specific HRD System to be brought about through the constructing of a multilateral cooperative network between the various main actors involved in the activation of Regional HRD. 2. Conclusion and Policy Suggestions There is an urgent need to construct a Regional HRD System between the local autonomies through which decentralization and balanced national development can be achieved. The participation of the main actors, and the construction of a cooperative network between these main actors, should be premised on the establishment of a regional HRD policy. It is particularly important that a direction for this regional partnership (governance) be established that makes it possible to go beyond the central-local relationship discussed above and foster the development of actual local human resources. In short, it is necessary to determine clear roles for each of these main actors (public sector, R&D sector, those in charge of use and effectiveness, and the civic sector). It is especially essential that the administrative and financial roles of the local autonomies regarded as the party or manager responsible for regional HRD be clearly spelled out. In order to construct a regional HRD partnership system, local autonomies should establish cooperative plans not only with regional actors, but also with the central government. Moreover, they should also play a leading or active supporting role in the implementation of such cooperative plans. For their part, universities and research institutes should focus on educating local human resources, while also playing an active R&참여정부는 21 세가 국가발전의 핵심요소로 '인적자원'을 규정하고, 국가인적자원개발과 관련한 다양한 정책과 전략수립 및 범국가적 인적자원개발을 위한 노력을 지속적으로 전개했다. 지역인적자원개발은 기존의 인재 양성 및 활용에서 지역적 편재 혹은 중앙집권적 정책을 바로잡고, 지역의 특성과 수요에 적합한 인재를 양성·공급하여 국가균형발전의 기반이 될 수 있도록 하는데 그 의의가 있다. 이에 본 연구는 지역인적자원개발 활성화를 위해 다양한 주체 간 다각적 협력망을 구축·운영하여 지역 특성에 적합한 인적자원개발 추진체제를 구축하는 방안 제시에 주 목적이 있다. 지역인적자원개발 정책은 지방분권과 지역균형발전을 성공적으로 수행하기 위하여 파트너십을 통한 정부가 ？지역인적자원개발 추진체계 구축이 중요하다. 이는 ？지역인적자원개발 정책수립과정에서 각 주체의 참여 보장 및 이들 간의 협력망 구축이 전제되어야 하고, 특히 기 논의되었던 중앙-지방간 관계를 뛰어넘어 실제 ？지역인적자원개발을 위한 지역 파트너십(거버넌스) 에 대한 방향성도 중요하기 때문이다. ○ 주요내용 - ？지역인적자원개발 협력망의 논리적 배경과 선행 연구 분석 - ？지역인적자원개발과 협의체 운영 현황 및 사례 분석 - ？지역인적자원개발을 위한 협력망 구축 방안요 약 제 1 장 서 론 제 1 절 연구의 필요성 및 목적 1 제 2 절 연구 내용과 연구 방법 3 제 2 장 지역인적자원개발 협력망의 논리적 배경과 선행 연구 분석 제 1 절 인적자원개발과 지역인적자원개발의 의의 7 제 2 절 협력망 구축의 논리적 배경 15 제 3 절 지역인적자원개발 관련 선행 연구 분석 42 제 4 절 협력망 구축 관련 지역의 문제점 70 제 3 장 지역인적자원개발과 협의체 운영 현황 및 사례 제 1 절 지역혁신협의회 77 제 2 절 충청북도 사례 99 제 3 절 지역인적자원개발 협력망 구축 관련 설문조사 결과 124 제 4 절 시사점 137 제 4 장 지역인적자원개발을 위한 협력망 구축 방안 제 1 절 협력망 구축의 배경과 전략 145 제 2 절 지역인적자원개발 협력망 구축 149 제 3 절 협력망 운영 및 개선 방안 162 제 5 장 결론 및 제언 SUMMARY 175 지역인적자원개발 협력망 구축을 위한 설문조사지 181 부산광역시 인적자원 개발 및 과학기술 진흥에 관한 조례 191 광주광역시 인적자원 개발 및 과학기술 진흥에 관한 조례 195 지방자치단체출연 연구원의 설립 및 운영에 관한 법률 197 참고문헌 20...|$|R
