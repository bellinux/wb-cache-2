50|$|In 1957, Christensen Diamond Products {{opened its}} {{manufacturing}} plant in Celle, Germany. The facility built diamond core heads and <b>drilling</b> <b>bits</b> and soon began producing stabilizers, drilling jars and other equipment. In 1977, the Celle engineering and manufacturing team introduced the Navi-Drill line of downhole drilling motors, {{which has led}} the drilling industry in performance and reliability for three decades. Other innovations developed in Celle include the industry's first steerable motor system, and the AutoTrak Rotary Closed Loop System. In 2007, the Celle Technology Center became Baker Hughes' leading research and engineering facility in the Eastern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|The company {{dates to}} 1909 when Howard Hughes, Sr. {{received}} two patents for his revolutionary oil well <b>drilling</b> <b>bits.</b> In 1913, Hughes and Walter Sharp incorporated the Sharp-Hughes Tool Company. In 1915, Hughes became the sole owner and renamed the company Hughes Tool Company. Hughes Sr. died in 1924, and was succeeded {{by his son}} Howard Jr. The younger Hughes became involved in many businesses, including aviation, motion pictures, radio and television broadcasting, and real estate. In the 1950s, Hughes acquired some vacant land in and around Las Vegas; in the 1960s, he moved to Las Vegas, where he lived in (and bought) the Desert Inn Hotel and Casino, acquired other casinos and hotels, and bought up more vacant land, which was left undeveloped during his lifetime.|$|E

25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit)</b> is a spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> (or a spot <b>drill</b> <b>bit,</b> as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> so that the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|R
25|$|Conventional twist <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> tend {{to wander}} when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit.</b> In wood, the lip and spur <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is another solution: The {{centre of the}} <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is given not the straight chisel of the twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit,</b> but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> in line.|$|R

25|$|Center <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> {{occasionally}} {{known as}} Slocombe <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> {{are used in}} metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> or to make a conical indentation {{in the end of}} a workpiece in which to mount a lathe center.

40|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> loader is {{described}} for loading a tapered shank of a <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> into a similarly tapered recess {{in the end}} of a drill spindle. The spindle has a transverse slot at the inner end of the recess. The end of the tapered shank of the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> has a transverse tang adapted to engage in the slot so that the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> will be rotated by the spindle. The loader {{is in the form of}} a cylinder adapted to receive the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> with the shank projecting out of the outer end of the cylinder. Retainer pins prevent rotation of the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> in the cylinder.

Its utilization began long ago, but because development and exploration show that fossil fuels are depletable in outlook of 40  50 years, it is needed to pay greater attention to perspective and economically advantageous energies, among which geothermal energy indisputably belongs.

Nanostructured WC/Co composites having high hardness and greater wear life synthesized by a spray conversion process, and consolidated by processing (i) below and (ii) above the eutectic temperature, have been examined by transmission electron microscopy.
