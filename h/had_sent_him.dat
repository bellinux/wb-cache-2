5|$|Bok was {{captured}} after his mother, Adut Al Akok, <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> {{to the village}} of Nyamlell to sell eggs and peanuts in the village market with some older siblings and neighbors. This was Bok's first trip to the village without his mother, {{and it was the first}} time he was allowed to sell some of the family's goods at the market.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius offered {{peace to}} Khosrow, presumably in 624, {{threatening}} otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrow rejected the offer. On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople {{to attack the}} Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea, marching through Armenia and modern Azerbaijan to assault the core Persian lands directly. According to Walter Kaegi, Heraclius led an army {{of no more than}} 40,000, and most likely between 20,00024,000. Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, in defiance of the earlier letter that Khosrow <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paulus van der Sloot {{was arrested}} on 22 June 2005, for {{questioning}} in Holloway's disappearance. He was ordered released on 26 June {{after three days of}} questioning. According to Aruba's chief prosecutor, one of the Kalpoe brothers told investigators that Paulus, who at the time was training to be a judge, advised that without a body, the police would have no case. Beth Holloway pursued Van der Sloot's parents in the ensuing media circus on Aruba. She said that Paulus acknowledged that they could not control their son and <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to a psychiatrist.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1840s, Mary Shelley {{found herself}} {{the target of}} three {{separate}} blackmailers. In 1845, an Italian political exile called Gatteschi, whom she had met in Paris, threatened to publish letters she <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him.</b> A friend of her son's bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi's papers, including the letters, which were then destroyed. Shortly afterwards, Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G. Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron. Also in 1845, Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley. He said he would suppress it in return for £250, but Mary Shelley refused.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, Naitō is {{found dead in}} prison. Sōta Sarushiro, a friend of Naitō, is {{suspected}} of the murder, but Edgeworth's attempt to investigate is stymied when judge Mikagami assigns prosecutor Yumihiko Ichiyanagi to the case in Edgeworth's place. To investigate, Edgeworth teams up with Tateyuki Shigaraki, a defense attorney and former protégé of Edgeworth's father Gregory. They suspect several inmates, including the assassin Ryōken Hōinbō, {{but it turns out}} that prison warden Marī Miwa killed Naitō, believing that Hōinbō <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to kill her. Sarushiro is freed, but Mikagami warns Edgeworth that he could lose his prosecutor's badge if he keeps investigating cases he is not assigned to.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than the}} typical anarchist interpretation, others have {{analysed}} the character as a Marxist (opposite to Batman's capitalist), arguing that anarchism requires the rejection of all authority in favor of uncontrolled freedom. The Joker rejects most authority, but retains his own, using his actions to coerce and consolidate power in himself and convert the masses to his own way of thinking, while eliminating any that oppose him. In The Killing Joke, the Joker is an abused member of the underclass who is driven insane by failings of the social system. The Joker rejects material needs, and his first appearance in Batman #1 sees him perpetrate crimes against Gotham's wealthiest men and the judge who <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to prison. Batman is wealthy, yet the Joker is able to triumph through his own innovations.|$|E

5|$|The {{first shot}} on goal was {{registered}} by Bonaventure Kalou, who forced a save out of Jens Lehmann. After 10 minutes, Shinji Ono spotted Lehmann off his line but sent his lofted shot wide of the target. This sparked Dortmund into life; they were thwarted when Patrick Paauwe intercepted Jan Koller {{just as he}} was looking to get his shot away. On 15 minutes, they came even closer to breaking the deadlock, when Amoroso picked out Tomáš Rosický; however, he shot straight at Edwin Zoetebier. On 19 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk came close to scoring with a free kick, which hit the right-hand post. Feyenoord's Tomasz Rząsa was then booked for dissent on 23 minutes, and following the resulting free kick, Evanílson came close to scoring, though his shot went over the crossbar after Ewerthon's pass <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> through.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of August 1914, Austro-Hungarian soldiers killed his father, mother, grandmother, his three sisters, and four of his brothers. His house was also set on fire.

25|$|In October 1890, von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a year's {{allowance}} in advance, {{along with}} a letter ending her patronage. She claimed bankruptcy. Most surprising about the break was its extreme suddenness. Barely a week beforehand, she <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> a typically intimate, loving and confessional letter. The letter dealt in large part with how her children were squandering their future inheritance.|$|E

25|$|The {{republic}} had a checkered {{history of}} coups and counter-coups against various factions. The Medici faction gained governance {{of the city}} in 1434, upon Cosimo de' Medici's counter-coup against the faction that <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> into exile the previous year. The Medici kept control of Florence until 1494. Giovanni de' Medici (later Pope Leo X) re-conquered the republic in 1512.|$|E
25|$|Now {{this same}} angel {{came up to}} the Servant (Suso) brightly, and said that God <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> down to him, to bring him heavenly joys amid his sufferings; adding that he must cast off all his sorrows from his mind and bear them company, and that he must also dance with them in heavenly fashion. Then they drew the Servant by the hand into the dance, and the youth began a joyous song about the infant Jesus...|$|E
25|$|William Baldwin donated generously to the {{collections}} of others, often exchanging some of his plants for plants that he desired. He contributed much to the herbaria if Muhlenberg, Elliott, Collins, and Darlington. He also sent specimens to Aylmer Bourke Lambert and Aime Bonpland, and in 1817, he sent some to James Edward Smith. Smith published several new species based on material that Baldwin <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him.</b> In 1811, he sent moss and lichen specimens to Olof Swartz and Erik Acharius. In 1815, he sent {{more of the same}} to Christian Friedrich Schwägrichen.|$|E

25|$|Saunière's {{renovation}} of his church and ostentatious construction programmes {{in a small}} hilltop village could not go unnoticed, and this attracted hostile reactions, with various complaints passed on by various sources to the Bishopric of Carcassonne. The Bishopric had warned Saunière about his selling of masses, and <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> two written warnings in May 1901. These written warnings were repeated in June 1903 and August 1904. In 1899 Saunière purchased a clergymen's directory (Annuaire du clergé français) through which he contacted both priests and religious communities across France to solicit Mass requests.|$|E
25|$|Sutcliffe had {{regularly}} {{used the}} services of prostitutes in Leeds and Bradford. His outbreak of violence towards them seems to have occurred because he was swindled out of money by a prostitute and her pimp. When interviewed by authorities, however, he claimed that the voice of God <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> {{on a mission to}} kill prostitutes. Sutcliffe carried out his murder spree over five years, during which time the public were especially shocked by the murders of women who were not prostitutes. After his arrest for driving with false number plates in January 1981, the police questioned him about the killings and he confessed that he was the perpetrator.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Morris {{was listed}} in The Observer {{as one of}} the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In 2005, Channel 4 aired a show called The Comedian's Comedian in which {{foremost}} writers and performers of comedy ranked their 50 favourite acts. Morris was at number eleven. Morris won the BAFTA for outstanding debut with his film Four Lions. Adeel Akhtar and Nigel Lindsay collected the award in his absence. Lindsay stated that Morris <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> a text message before they collected the award reading, 'Doused in petrol, Zippo at the ready'. In June 2012 Morris was placed at number 16 in the Top 100 People in UK Comedy.|$|E

25|$|On July 6, 1964, Bolden's trial {{opened in}} the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Secret Service agent Maurice G. Martineau, the first witness for the prosecution, testified that Spagnoli complained {{to him in a}} {{telephone}} call that the government was attempting to entrap him. According to Martineau, Spagnoli said he was visited by a stranger who said a Secret Service agent offered to sell him information for $50,000. He said his investigation led him to Frank W. Jones who told him Bolden <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to Spagnoli. Martineau testified that he confronted Bolden with the allegations of Spagnoli and Jones, and that Bolden denied them.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, Max Kämper, a young German mining engineer, {{arrived at}} the cave by way of New York. Kämper had just {{graduated}} from technical college and his family <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> on a trip abroad as a graduation present. Originally intending to spend two weeks at Mammoth Cave, Kämper spent several months. With the assistance of African-American slave descendant Ed Bishop, Kämper produced a remarkably accurate instrumental survey of many kilometers of Mammoth Cave, including many new discoveries. Reportedly, Kämper also produced a corresponding survey of the land surface overlying the cave: this information was to be useful in the opening of other entrances to the cave, as soon happened with the Violet City entrance.|$|E
25|$|The split {{over the}} treaty was deeply personal. Many {{of the leaders}} on both sides had been close friends and comrades during the War of Independence. This made their {{disagreement}} over the treaty all the more bitter. Michael Collins later said that Éamon de Valera <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> as plenipotentiary to negotiate the treaty {{because he knew that}} the British would not concede an independent Irish republic and wanted Collins to take the blame for the compromise settlement. He said that he felt deeply betrayed when de Valera refused to stand by the agreement that the plenipotentiaries had negotiated with David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. De Valera, for his part, was furious that Collins and Arthur Griffith had signed the treaty without consulting him or the Irish cabinet as instructed.|$|E
