40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Vacuum-Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) {{has become}} a widly used and rapidly growing {{manufacturing}} process for wind turbine blades. However, {{in the case of}} complex geometries, resin flow pattern during the VARTM process tends to be unpredictable. In addition, increasing the size and thickness of the blades is expected to result in additional technical difficulties. Therefore, use of flow pattern simulation tools {{has become a}} necessity in order to avoid costly and time-consuming trial-and-error procedures during manufacturing. In this thesis, a 3 -D non-isothermal framework for modeling the VARTM process for a wind turbine blade was developed. The model was utilized in a case study optimizing <b>inlet</b> gate <b>arrangement,</b> resin temperature, and mold temperature to shorten the filling time. Sequential filling scheme was assumed and different <b>inlet</b> gate <b>arrangements</b> and activation times were used in {{the first phase of the}} study. It was observed that, although increasing the number of the inlet gates tends to shorten the filling process, its effectiveness kept decreasing monotonically. The generally observed filling issue was the formation of dry spots in the sandwich region at the bottom of the part. In the sandwich region, the core splits the flow and forms two flow fronts, one on the top and another at the bottom of the sandwich region. The two flow fronts converge right after the core. For some cases, the slow moving flow front beneath the core was not able to reach its way out and converge with the flow front on the top of the core. To overcome the problem, activation of the auxiliary inlet gates located on the top of the core was postponed. In the second phase of the study, different resin temperatures were used. Increasing the temperature up to 325 °K resulted in shorter filling durations while increasing the temperature further produced dry spots beneath the core. From the flow pattern results in non-sandwich areas, it was concluded that resolving the issue of slow moving flow front at the bottom of the core vii makes it possible to decrease the filling time by 17 % through increasing the resin temperature by 20 °C. The effect of different mold temperatures on the filling time was examined in the third phase of the study. Increasing the mold temperature from the initial value (330 °K) did not result in shorter filling times. To investigate the necessity of employing 3 -D non-isothermal model, a 2. 5 -D non-isothermal model and a 3 -D isothermal model were developed and their results were compared to the results of the 3 -D non-isotheral model. The 2. 5 -D non-isothermal model was unable to accurately predict the flow behavior in the sandwich region. In addition, although the same <b>inlet</b> <b>arrangement</b> and activation times were used for all simulations, the predicted filling time using the 2. 5 -D model was 30 % shorter than the filling time using the 3 -D non-isothermal model. On the other hand, the predicted flow pattern for the 3 -D isothermal model was very similar to that for 3 -D non-isothermal model and the difference between the filling times was relatively small. However, since the model does not keep track of the temperature variations and curing during filling, the simulation of cure after the filling would not provide accurate results...|$|R

A TAGA 6000 E triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer, in both unmodified and differentially pumped <b>inlet</b> <b>arrangements,</b> {{was used to}} investigate CA and CAD during transfer through the atmosphere-vacuum interface and subsequent CAD in the tandem instrument. Melittin, which has a molecular weight (Mr) of 2846, is efficiently dissociated in the interface at higher nozzle-skimmer voltages, yielding fragmentation that can be assigned to the various charge states. Selection of such product ions formed in the interface for subsequent tandem mass spectrometry allows confirmation of earlier sequence assignments and extends the utility of these methods. Various charge states of larger polypeptides, such as human parathyroid hormone (1 - 44) (Mr 5064), can be efficiently collisionally dissociated in the second (rf-only) quadrupole. However, for molecular ions of this size, the low-energy collisions used for CAD yield only partial sequence information. For large molecules such as horse heart myoglobin (Mr 16, 951), the effects of nozzle-skimmer bias are explored, and it is shown that higher charge states (at ≤ m/z 1400) can be effectively dissociated in the interface. Initial results for both metastable (unimolecular) and CAD for myoglobin are reported. The potential and limitations of CAD for large biomolecular ions are discussed.

40|$|Gas-solid risers {{have been}} {{extensively}} used as multiphase reactors in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) system such as {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC) and Circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC). In FCC, a riser facilitates cracking reactions which take place between fluidized catalyst and vaporised vacuum gas oil. Similarly in CFBC, combustion of coal particle occurs in the riser. The gas-solid flow hydrodynamics in riser plays a dominant role in governing {{the conversion of the}} chemical process, and in turn the performance of the CFB system. Therefore, several experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on the hydrodynamics of riser. Since experimental studies have been costlier and time consuming, detailed hydrodynamic modelling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has emerged as a promising alternative to investigate flows in riser. Two types of CFD models can be identified i. e. (i) Eulerian-Langrangian (EL) and (ii) Eulerian-Eulerian (EE) models. The Eulerian-Eulerian model considers both phases as interpenetrating continua. As a result, it allows a use of grid size larger than length scales of the flow structures. Therefore, this approach requires less computational power, and can handle large-scale geometry. Due to its computational edge, the Eulerian-Eulerian approach has been widely used to conduct the CFD simulations of gas-solid flows in riser. A literature review on the previous simulation studies revealed several shortcomings, and therefore, investigations on the impact of different modelling parameters were found to be necessary before applying the EE model to industrial-scale simulations. In this study, the EE gas-solid flow model has been used to carry out CFD simulations of risers. The effect of modelling parameters such as boundary conditions, drag models and solid phase closure models have been investigated. Finally, the EE model has been used to carry out industrial scale simulation of the lift engager to study the parametric effect of the lift gas velocity on the catalyst lift rate. The effect of inlet boundary conditions was investigated by using three different types of inlets for both gas and solid phases. The <b>inlet</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{had a profound effect on}} mixing patterns of two phases and energy balances in 2 D riser. Furthermore, the effect of wall boundary conditions was also studied by considering the wall as a partial-slip or no-slip wall for the solid phase. A 3 D full-scale riser was also simulated by implementing the boundary conditions similar to the experimental set-up. Although both 2 D and 3 D simulations could qualitatively predict the radial profiles of solid velocity and volume fraction, they could not predict even qualitative trend of the axial profile of solid volume fractions. Previous studies (Yang et al., 2004, Andrews Iv et al., 2005) showed that the conventional drag model such as that of Gidaspow’s could not capture the axial heterogeneity; however a use of the multiscale drag could remove this draw back. Thus, the drag derived using the energy minimization multi-scale approach was evaluated in another part of the study. The structure-based drag models could capture both axial and radial profiles of voidages, but only qualitatively. Furthermore, the use of different cluster diameter correlations with the EMMS framework gave more accurate predictions with reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the EE model was applied to study hydrodynamics of a complex industrial-scale lift engager. In this part, the effect of lift gas velocity on the catalyst lift rate and fluctuations therein were investigated to optimise operating gas velocity. Before conducting the parametric study, the effects of modeling parameters such as drag models and frictional pressure models on the hydrodynamics of the lift engager were also investigated. In summary, the study has been conducted by performing rigorous CFD simulations of both 2 D and 3 D risers. The effects of modelling aspects such as boundary conditions and drag models on the hydrodynamics predictions were investigated. The EE model with a structured-based drag from the EMMS model was found to be more effective in capturing an inherent heterogeneity of riser flows. However, the quantitative disagreements between the flow predictions and experimental data still persist...|$|E

Two 8 -inch commercial multipath meters and two single-path meters were tested at locations downstream of single, double in-plane, and double out-of-plane elbows. Test results document the velocity profile and swirl distortions produced by typical meter station <b>inlet</b> piping <b>arrangements,</b> and show that more than 100 pipe diameters of straight pipe may be required upstream of a meter to reduce flow distortions to acceptable levels. Results also document the performances of all four meters in both undisturbed and distorted flow conditions.

Flow conditioners can reduce profile distortions, but do not always prevent error problems.

40|$|The {{design of}} a water based thermal store {{for use in a}} {{domestic}} central heating system has been investigated theoretically, experimentally and numerically. The transient operation of the store during both the space heating and domestic hot-water modes of operation have been investigated separately. Heat transfer correlations in terms of Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers have been developed in order to predict the natural convection heat transfer coefficient for the outside surface of the horizontal axis finned tube heat exchanger coil located within the store. These heat-transfer correlations can predict the value of the heat transfer coefficient with an accuracy of better than 5 % and are in good agreement with existing heat transfer correlations developed for the same geometry of finned tubes and modes of heat transfer. The effect of the water flow rate in the heat exchanger coil on the internal heat transfer coefficient is also investigated. This flow rate should be above 4 litre/minute to achieve a high rate of heat-transfer from the wall of the heat exchanger to the water in the pipe. A detailed investigation of the use of horizontal and vertical baffles to increase the effectiveness of heat delivery in the domestic hot water mode has been carried out. Some improvements can be achieved by the use of a horizontal flat plate located {{in the middle of the}} store. This plate, when correctly sized enhances stratification and hence improves the effectiveness of heat recovery. Vertical plate arrangements and a rectangular duct situated around the upper heat exchanger coil were found to be ineffective. However, due to an increased velocity of the water around the heat exchanger, the external heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger was increased by 12 %. The comparison of experimental observations with computer simulations of the development of the thermocline in the store during the space heating mode of operation showed the presence of a jet in the bottom region of the store at the return inlet. The jet induces a significant amount of mixing in the store which reduces the effectiveness of heat recovery. Correlations in terms of Richardson number and effectiveness of heat delivery have been developed to characterize the effect of this jet. An <b>inlet</b> <b>arrangement</b> designed to achieve a Richardson number exceeding 3 significantly reduces the mixing created by the jet and can increase the amount of heat delivered in the space heating mode by approximately 5 %...|$|R
40|$|The bottom charged side {{spillway}} is a {{new concept}} of spillway in which the excess water is spilled from the bottom level which is sediment rich water and the cleanest quality of water {{is sent to the}} turbine. It is different in a sense that it will remove sediments as well while getting rid of the excess water different than the conventional spillways which will spill the cleanest quality of water. The concept was developed by Professor Haakon Støle and so far not much work has been done concerning the concept. The main objective of the present study is to prepare a design guideline for bottom charged side spillway. Hydraulic Model Study Different calculations have been done for the design of canal, intake, surface charged spillway and bottom charged spillway considering different considerations. Detail design drawings were prepared based on design and model was constructed at NTNU/SINTEF lab. The present model of bottom charged spillway consists of the following modules. • <b>Inlet</b> <b>arrangement.</b> • Upstream canal section. • Surface charged side spillway section. • Bottom charged side spillway section. • Downstream canal section. • Outlet arrangement. • Instrumentation and measuring arrangements. Since the study is of a new concept, there has been no real prototype for the model but for ease of calculation and making the study more realistic all the calculations has been started considering some imaginary values. The prototype dimensions were then converted to model dimensions using Froude’s model law. Model Test Result It is observed from the study that the bottom charged spillway can be an efficient alternative for effectively spilling the excess water and parallel flushing of the sediments as well. The design of the model was conducted using different approaches. Since not much literature was available about the concept, some assumptions were made to proceed the design. Different approaches of general spillway approach, submerged side orifice approach and side spillway approaches were applied with modifications for bottom entry losses. The attempt were made to figure the relation for more accurate calculation. Some relations concerning the calculation of bottom entry losses were derived based on the model study but these need to be refined for better results. The most favorable approach by the model test was found to be the approach of side spillway with additional effect of bottom orificelosses. The calculation with side spillway approach gave less variation with the actual observed values. Downstream spillway end point was considered as the control point for the design. The depth and the Froude number at this point is the starting data for the design. The variation in the nature of flow among the surface charge spillway and bottom charge spillway was not observed. Hence {{it can be said that}} the bottom charge spillway will not add disturbances to the flow in canal. There is development of high turbulence at the spill pool due to which the flushing of the sediments may not be a problem. </p...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 158 - 169. Secondary {{settling}} tanks (SSTs) form {{a crucial part}} of wastewater treatment plants. Besides having to produce the separation of suspended solids and clarified effluent the secondary settling tank is used to concentrate and recycle the settled sludge to the biological reactor. The efficiency of the biological reactor in the waste water treatment system is determined by the efficiency of this final clarifying process. Hydrodynamic models have been developed for simulating secondary {{settling tanks}} in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the complex flow patterns in these tanks, and to make design and optimization of the SST internal features possible. These models use mainly the finite volume method. This thesis is concerned with the development and implementation of a finite element approach to the simulation of flows in SSTs. Although it is nowadays also possible to realise an unstructured grid within the FVM, the power of the finite element method (FEM) lies in its higher flexibility in fitting irregular domains and in providing local grid refinement. Generally, unstructured mesh procedures with the FVM require essential, additional orthogonality corrections, which affect the accuracy of the solution, and these corrections increase the computational cost due to the additional computations and increased iteration requirements. Structured mesh discretization may offer significantly shorter computation time. The FEM is therefore convenient for handling arbitrarily shaped domains and adaptation of complex internal features of SSTs, such as <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>arrangements...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} water in a {{rainwater}} tank {{is a matter of}} much speculation, however several techniques can be used to protect and enhance the quality. If these procedures are followed, tank water should conform to the World Health Organisation’s “Low Risk ” category. The primary contamination pathways are via vectors (such as lizards or frogs) directly entering the tank and via inlet water. This first of these is easily blocked for larger animals by screening all inlets and overflows. A more important path is via the water entering from the roof. As water passes through the air, onto the roof and flows to the tank, it picks up contamination and carries it into the tank. The contaminants tend to adhere to solid matter that is washed along with the water flow and can be filtered using simple techniques. There is also substantial evidence that water quality improves with time, therefore any system that prevents contaminated water from interacting with “aged ” water in the tank will also enhance water quality. This paper discusses <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>arrangements</b> for water tanks that can easily be incorporated in low-income countries, yet will substantially enhance water quality both by preventing contaminants from entering the tank and by aiding natural water purification occurring in the tank.

40|$|Currently {{waveguide}} probes {{are widely}} used in several turbomachinery applications ranging from the analysis of flow instabilities to the investigation of thermoacoustic phenomena. There are many advantages to using a waveguide probe. For example, the same sensor can be adopted for different measurement points, thus reducing {{the total number of}} sensors or a cheaper sensor with a lower operating temperature capability can be used instead of a more expensive one in case of high temperature applications. Typically, a waveguide probe is made up of a transmitting duct which connects the measurement point with a sensor housing and a damping duct which attenuates the pressure fluctuations reflected by the duct end. If properly designed (i. e. with a very long damping duct), the theoretical response of a wave guide has a monotone trend with an attenuation factor that increases with the frequency and the length of the transmitting duct. Unfortunately, the real geometry of the waveguide components and the type of connection between them have a strong influence on the behavior of the system. Even the smallest discontinuity in the duct connections can lead to a very complex frequency response and a reduced operating range. The geometry of the sensor housing itself is another element which contributes to increasing the differences between the expected and real frequency responses of a waveguide since its impedance is generally unknown. Previous studies developed by the authors have demonstrated that the replacement of the damping duct with a properly designed termination could be a good solution to increase the waveguide operating range and center it on the frequencies of interest. In detail, the termination could be used to balance the detrimental effects of discontinuities and sensor presence. In this paper an innovative waveguide system leading to a further increase of the operating range is proposed and tested. The system is based on the measurement of the pressure oscillations propagating in the transmitting duct by means of three sensors placed at different distances from the pressure tap. The pressures measured by the three sensors are then combined and processed to calculate the pressure at the transmitting duct <b>inlet.</b> The <b>arrangement</b> of the sensing elements and the geometry of the termination are designed to minimize the error of this estimation. The frequency response achieved with the proposed arrangement turns out to be very flat over a wide range of frequencies. Thanks to the minor errors in the estimation of pressure modulus and phase the probe is also suitable for the signal reconstruction both in frequency and time domain...|$|R
40|$|Sediment induced wear of hydro-turbines {{has been}} a major problem in {{utilizing}} the water resources in sediment loaded rivers around the world. The problems are more sever in Himalayan Rivers, which favor high head plants but are highly loaded with sediment. During wet season, there is ample of water available in these rivers carrying high concentration of sediment. The generation efficiency of the turbines decreases drastically when subjected to high sediment loads of monsoon season and maintenance costs are increased. Thus, besides the potential for high power generation with respect to the availability of water, the generation capability is reduced due to the decrease in the efficiency of the turbines. A considerable amount of research has been carried out to minimize these sediment related problems in power plants. A research on using hydro-cyclones for sediment handling in Himalayan River has been carried out by Hari Pandit (Pandit, 2009) in his Ph. D work. He worked on improving the performance of the hydro-cyclone by improving the <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>arrangements</b> for the hydro-cyclones. However, headloss over the efficient hydro-cyclone is quite significant which is in general not affordable by the existing power plants, hence making it impractical for application. A new concept called “Throttle Trap concept” has been developed by Professor Haakon Støle to overcome issues of application of a Hydro-cyclone based on its head requirement. It involves increasing velocity in a section of a waterway to such level that the increase in the velocity head and simultaneously decrease in pressure head is high enough to generate the head required in operating the hydro-cyclone. The pressure head is then gradually regained with decrease in the velocity and the kinetic energy is transformed back to potential energy in the waterway downstream. Thus the “Throttled Trap concept” involves splitting of these diment rich bottom flow from a waterway, process it in the hydro-cyclones and then finally return the processed flow to the waterway. The Throttled trap system can be placed anywhere in a pressurized waterway of a plant where pressure line above it is sufficiently higher than the head required by the hydro-cyclones to operate. In this thesis work a theoretical study on the hydraulic features of the concept has been carried out. Based on an in operation reference project, the Jhimruk Hydropower Plant of Nepal, an excel spreadsheet model has been prepared for preliminary dimensioning of the concept. Two different layout of the Throttle Trap concept has been prepared where it is applied to penstock and to tunnel setup. A model study on the concept has been carried out for the throttled trap in a penstock setup. The concept is functional based on the observations made in the model. The theoretically expected pattern of pressure drop in the pipe was achieved as expected. However, the headloss over the system was relatively high. The headloss over the branch flow was substantially high to achieve the head required by the cyclone to operate. Moreover, thepressure drop generated over the throttled trap system was not found to be fully utilized overthe hydro-cyclone. Based on these observations, modifications were made in improving the hydraulics of the system and optimizing the geometry for better utilization of the generated pressure drop under modification I and II respectively. The modifications improved the performance of the system generating an overall efficiency of around 19 % and the delivery efficiency of the branch flow arrangement to be about 78 %. However, there is still room for improvement and modifications have been suggested for further studies. The concept of locating Throttle Trap concept in a tunnel setup also seems to be very promising in regards to safety working at low pressure and flexibility in working on it relative to the existing embedded penstocks subjected to high pressure. However, the geological considerations are to be dealt with in detail. The selection of the best location of the concept is based on the available head in the waterway and the flexibility in working on it. Further studies are therefore recommended on the concept in a tunnel setup. This study involves only the steady state of flow in the waterway, hence further studies on the realistic scenarios are recommended. </p...|$|R
