Insurance is a way of managing losses associated with risks—for <b>example,</b> <b>floods,</b> network outages, and earthquakes—primarily by transfering risk to another entity—the insurer, for a price, the premium.

Con-sidering a natural probabilistic framework for the insurance problem, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on loss models such that the insurer can use the premiums she sets to remain solvent despite the losses taken on. Insurance {{is a way of}} managing losses associated with risks—for <b>example,</b> <b>floods,</b> network outages, and earthquakes—primarily by transfering risk to another entity—the insurer, for a price, the premium. The insurer attempts to break even by balancing the possible loss that may be suffered by a few (risk) with the guaranteed payments of many (premium). In 1903, Filip Lundberg [1] defined and formulated this scenario in its natural probabilistic setting as part of his thesis. In particular, Lundberg formulated a collective risk problem pooling together the risk of all the insured. There is an underlying risk model—a probability measure on loss sequences. Typically, the model itself is unknown, but can be imagined to belong to a known class of risk models. Suppose the insurance company sets some premium to be paid by the insured regularly—say, once at the beginning of every time interval. The losses incured by the insured will be of uncertain size (n...|$|E

Therefore, breeding rice varieties capable of surviving under flooded conditions during germination and early growth stages will improve the success of direct-seeding cultivation (Pandey et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|Tanzania {{like many}} African {{countries}} is highly vulnerable to global environmental change, particularly climate change. The impacts {{of particular concern}} are related to food production, human health and water resources. Agricultural production, which is essential to ensure food security, is weatherdependent, which has occasionally subjected the country to food shortage and insecurity in years with low rainfall. Food security varies spatially and temporally depending on rainfall patterns and other multiple stress factors such as soil conditions, types of crops grown, socio-economic and cultural factors. The southern highlands of Tanzania which are the grain basket for the country are highly vulnerable to impacts of global change, especially decrease in the amounts of rainfall. In some parts, extreme events (for <b>example,</b> <b>floods)</b> have destroyed infrastructure hence affecting food distribution and access by the affected communities. Environmental change has also impacted on human health {{in various parts of}} Tanzania. The rise in mean temperatures is an important factor for increased incidences of malaria in the highlands that were traditionally free from malaria.

For our research effort, we endeavored to prototype a distributed architecture that depends on a standardized communication protocol and applications program interface (API) that {{makes it easy for}} anyone to discover and access disaster related data. Providers can easily supply the public with their disaster related products by building an adapter for our API. Users can use the API to browse and find products that relate to the disaster at hand, without a centralized catalogue, for <b>example</b> <b>floods,</b> and then are able to share that data via social media. Furthermore, a longerterm goal for this architecture is to enable other users who see the shared disaster product to be able to generate the same product for other areas of interest via simple point and click actions on the API on their mobile device. Furthermore, the user will be able to edit the data with on the ground local observations and return the updated information to the original repository of this information if configured for this function. This architecture leverages SensorWeb functionality [1] presented at previous IGARSS conferences. The architecture is divided into two pieces, the frontend, which is the GeoSocial API, and the backend, which is a standardized disaster node that knows how to talk to other disaster nodes, and also can communicate with the GeoSocial API. The GeoSocial API, along with the disaster node basic functionality enables crowdsourcing and thus can leverage insitu observations by people external to a group to perform tasks such as improving water reference maps, which are maps of existing water before floods. This can lower the cost of generating precision water maps. Keywords-Data Discovery, Disaster Decision Support, Disaster Management, Interoperability, CEOS WGISS Disaster Architectur...|$|E
30|$|The authors {{adopted the}} scale and detail levels of CityGML (2017) that have been widely {{implemented}} {{in the field of}} 3 D modeling. CityGML is an open standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for 3 DCM encoding in which five levels of detail are defined, from LoD 0 to LoD 4 in ascending order of spatial detail and geometric precision of the data. To choose the adequate LoD for this study, we employed the hierarchical decision rule utilized by Kemec et al. (2009) in the scope of disaster management. This rule decides the level to use based on eight decision-making criteria to which values on a scale are assigned, according to the characteristics of the study area and the hazard to be addressed. The criteria are grouped in an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) decision tree: two elements of a spatial nature of the area under study (extension of urban area; population density), two aspects of the spatial nature of the hazardous event (spatial dispersion; affected area), three characteristics of the temporal nature of the hazard (speed of onset; duration; frequency), and a single criterion that is related to the penetration into a building’s interior space of hazardous material caused by the event under investigation. For <b>example,</b> <b>floods</b> and avalanches invade the interior of buildings with external material; earthquakes, by themselves, according to the referenced authors, do not. The interpretation of the indoor penetration criterion may be questionable, since shock waves produced by earthquakes do invade a building’s interior rupturing walls and leave debris behind. On the other hand, this fact is independent of the existence of windows or doors and of the configuration of interior walls in the 3 D model. So we adopted the interpretation of the cited authors, since the consideration of indoor penetration only influences the decision of modeling openings and interiors, which is not important in the present case.|$|E

30|$|A {{multitude}} of processes in water engineering involve {{more than one}} random variable. For <b>example,</b> <b>floods</b> are characterized by peak, duration, volume, and inter-arrival time, which are all random in nature. Droughts are described by their severity, duration, inter-arrival time, and areal extent, which are also random. Extreme precipitation events are represented by their intensity, amount, duration, and inter-arrival time, which are all random. Inter-basin water transfer involves transfer of excess water from one basin (say, donor) to a water deficient basin (say, recipient). The transfer involves the volume of water, availability of water in both donor and recipient basins, duration of transfer, rate of transfer, and time interval between water transfers which are all random variables. Water quality entails pollutant load, duration for which the load {{is higher than the}} protection limits, and peak pollutant concentration, which are all random variables. Likewise, erosion in a basin may be characterized by sediment yield, number of erosion events, duration of events, intensity of events, and time interval between two consecutive events. These are all random variables. Flooding in a coastal watershed may be caused by the simultaneous occurrence of high precipitation and high tides where both precipitation and tide are random variables. Examples of processes involving more than one random variable abound in hydrologic, hydraulic, environmental, and water resources engineering. There usually exists some degree of dependence among the random variables or at least among some of the variables. Often we are concerned with multivariate stochastic modeling and risk analysis of the systems and processes that involve the derivation of probability distributions of the random variables considering the dependence structure among them. Nowadays, these stochastic processes can be modeled with the copula–entropy theory that has proven to be more flexible and accurate than the traditional approaches. The objective of this paper therefore is to reflect on some recent advances made in the application of the copula–entropy theory and future challenges.|$|E
40|$|The risk {{management}} of complex coupled human-environmental systems essentially relies on discounting future losses and gains to their present values. These evaluations {{are used to}} justify catastrophic risks management decisions which may turn into benefits over long and uncertain time horizons. The misperception of proper discounting rates critically affects evaluations and may be rather misleading. Catastrophes are not properly treated within conventional economic theory. The lack of proper evaluations dramatically contributes to increasing the vulnerability of our society to human-made and natural disasters. Underestimation of rare low probability - high consequences potentially catastrophic scenarios (events) {{have led to the}} growth of buildings and industrial land and sizable value accumulation in flood (and other disaster) prone areas without paying proper attention to flood mitigations. A challenge is that an extreme event, say a once-in- 300 -year flood which occurs on average only once in 300 years, may have never occurred before in a given region. Therefore, purely adaptive policies relying on historical observations provide no awareness of the risk although, a 300 -year flood may occur next year. For <b>example,</b> <b>floods</b> in Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic in 2002 were classified as 1000 -, 500 -, 250 -, and 100 -year events. Chernobyl nuclear disaster was evaluated as 106 -year event. Yet common practice is to ignore these types of events as improbable events during a human lifetime. This paper analyzes the implications of potentially catastrophic events on the choice of discounting for long-term catastrophic {{risk management}}. It is shown that arbitrary discounting can be linked to "stopping time" events, which define the discount-related random horizon ("end of the world") of valuations. In other words, any discounting compares potential gains and losses only within a finite random discount-related stopping time horizon. The expected duration of this horizon for standard discount rates obtained from capital markets does not exceed a few decades and, as such, these rates cannot properly evaluate impacts of 1000 -, 500 -, 250 -, 100 - year catastrophes. The paper demonstrates that the correct discounting can be induced by the concept of stopping time, i. e. by explicit modelling of arrival time scenarios of potential catastrophes. In general, catastrophic events affect the induced discount rates, which alter the optimal mitigation efforts that, in turn, change events. The paper shows that stopping-time related discounting calls for the use of stochastic optimisation methods. Combined with explicit spatio-temporal catastrophe modelling, this induces the discounting which allows to properly focus risk management solutions on arrival times of potential catastrophic events rather then horizons of capital markets...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{precipitation}} estimation and rainfall monitoring {{based on}} meteorological data, potentially provided as continuous, high space/time resolution and large coverage data, are of high practical use. For efficiently monitoring intense rainy phenomena events over crucial basins of interest (urban areas for example), an unrealistic extremely dense {{rain gauge network}} should be needed. Alternatively, {{it is possible to}} use another tool able to provide an overview of the weather situation: the weather radar. More common C-band and S-band ground-based weather radar are able to monitor rain fields over wide areas, but they are normally characterized by limited space and time resolutions, not enough when they are used over urban areas where it is important to monitor small and intense precipitation cells in a very precise way, to avoid for <b>example</b> <b>floods</b> in the streets. Short-range, portable X-band radar systems are a more recent solution to monitor and observe rain events with good resolution in space and time. They can be used standalone as well as integrated with other already existing networks. The Remote Sensing Group at the Politecnico di Torino started to design and develop its first prototype of mini weather X-band radar in 2004. This system is a non-coherent, pulsed, one polarization only, non-Doppler radar system (10 KW peak power, 600 Hz PRF, maximum range 30 km), equipped with a fixed elevation parabolic antenna (34 dB gain, 3. 6 ° Half Power Beam Width). Several progresses and modifications were made in particular on the on-board software, actually leading to some fully operative installations. In particular two radars have been installed in heavily populated urban area: in the Turin town, and near the Foggia town. To achive good performances in detection and measurement of rain, it is important to control the stability of the overall radar system components. In fact, these systems may suffer some degradations due both to external factors (e. g. temperature fluctuations, humidity) and to equipment failure (e. g. frequency drift of the magnetron, de-tuning of the receiver filter). Therefore some techniques and periodic procedures for the radar stability control are necessary. This work presents some studies performed to control the radar signal stability through a statistical analysis of clutter echoes coming from a high number of ground targets during clear sky days. In these conditions, when the radar is calibrated, the daily average clutter echoes {{have been found to be}} almost stable from day to day. They vary significantly only after serious system "degradation". To monitor the radar stability has therefore been necessary to evaluate the variation in the intensity of clutter echoes acquired during clear sky days. In order to have a simple "tool" which give an immediate indication of the radar stability, different cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of clutter reflectivity are computed operatively on a daily basis, considering the overall observing area and different circular rings around the radar, in order to take into account of different types of ground clutter. Comparing and analyzing the behavior of the CDFs obtained it is possible to control the radar stability and to know if it is necessary to set up a calibration procedure. Some indicators have been computed considering the CDF in order to find out which is the best one to detect modifications on radar systems capabilitie...|$|E

40|$|It’s {{time for}} {{international}} leadership in better coordination {{of programs and}} efforts and increased capacity building in the Pacific Island nations, writes Lesley Russell •THE impact of the environment on health and the health consequences of global warming are issues that have become increasingly prominent in political and policy debates in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. These issues play out with even greater economic and social consequences in the developing countries of the Pacific Ocean, where fragile environments, failing economies, poor population health and a shortage of needed workforce skills mean there are fewer resources to prevent and manage them. Rapid population growth, limited natural resources, {{and the effects of}} natural disasters such as cyclones and floods have driven many people to migrate from smaller outer islands to larger islands and from rural areas to towns, especially capital cities, looking for employment and public services. Others migrate internationally, and remittances are traditionally very important for Pacific Island economies such as Tonga and Samoa where they account for over a quarter for GDP. While the numbers of people in the Pacific Island countries served with some form of improved sanitation and drinking water has increased, barely 50 percent of the population has access to sanitation, and less than 20 percent of the population has access to drinking water piped to households. There have been times when drinking water supplies have run out on some islands. It is ironic that a popular and expensive brand of bottled water in Australia and the United States is from Fiji, where up to one-third of the population does not have access to safe, clean drinking water. With increasing population growth and a decline in subsistence farming, the demand for food in the Pacific Islands is increasingly being met by imported food of poor quality and nutritional value. These changes in diet are contributing to the substantial and growing levels of overweight and obesity, and the cardiovascular diseases and diabetes which follow. Micronutrient deficiencies are also common in the region, leading to conditions such as anemia and goitre. These lifestyle diseases have attacked the Pacific Island way of life over the past few decades. Seventy to eighty percent of premature Islander deaths are from preventable, non-communicable diseases. The data are shocking: Tokelau, Nauru and American Samoa have gained the dubious crowns as the top three countries in the world with the highest percentage of obese people, with more than 93 percent of the population overweight or obese. In American Samoa, Tokelau and the Marshall Islands, more than 40 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 years old have diabetes. Unless action is taken, the number of diabetes cases is expected to double by 2025. A major contributory factor here has been that most health expenditure on non-communicable diseases is for tertiary care, with very little funding available for prevention and primary care. The Pacific Islands have some of the highest expenditures on health for developing countries; a significant number of countries spend more than 10 percent of their GDP on health. Much of this is spent on sending patients to Australia, New Zealand and the Unites States for specialist treatment. Many Pacific Island countries currently suffer high burdens from climate-sensitive health outcomes, including morbidity and mortality from extreme weather events and from vector, food and water borne diseases, and it is expected that these burdens will increase as a consequence of climate change. For <b>example,</b> <b>floods</b> and droughts are each associated with an increased risk of diarrhoeal diseases and the rates of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are increasing. The distribution and abundance of their disease vectors are affected by changes in ambient temperature, precipitation, vegetation and water availability. There is a positive correlation between the annual number of epidemics of dengue in the South Pacific and the Southern Oscillation Index, denoting El Niño conditions. Other increased health threats as a consequence of global warming include cholera outbreaks and an increased incidence of ciguatera poisoning from the consumption of reef fish. It’s clear that tackling these problems will require some new approaches. Realistically these will be driven by Australia, New Zealand and the United States as the countries that have the biggest investments – trade, aid, national security and health – in the area, and also the strongest government and cultural ties. The Pacific Islands are the most heavily aid-assisted part of the world on a per capita basis. But no-one – donors or recipients – gets real value under the current system. There is a plethora of plans for the Pacific Island nations, to the extent that efforts to implement all of these risk confusion, duplication and poorly directed spending. Although most countries have development strategies, these are not always implemented effectively and too often there are no accompanying financing plans. The 2009 AusAID Annual Review of Development Effectiveness found two challenges for program management: • A continuing proliferation of individual aid activities relative to overall funding, leading to a duplication of effort, insufficient investment and unsustainable outcomes; and• A lack of clarity in program objectives, with many objectives not clearly linked to the desired outcomes. It’s time for international leadership in better coordination of programs and efforts and increased capacity building in the Pacific Island nations.

This aspect is implicit with UNDHA (1992), but explicit in the three definitions from UNISDR (2004, 2009, 2017). This point is important in understanding from where disasters arise because some environmental processes and phenomena have hazardousness augmented due to human interventions. For river floods, dredging and building levees can increase parameters such as depth and speed, making any flood more hazardous, as witnessed {{in parts of the}} Mississippi River basin (Criss and Shock 2001). Many earthquakes are caused by human action including fracking, reservoirs, groundwater extraction, fossil fuel extraction, and nuclear tests (Ellsworth 2013). Urbanization affects wind speed and air temperature, exacerbating heat wave hazards in particular (Clarke 1972). The definitions of “hazard” accept that hazards might be entirely from nature (for example, a meteorite (unless it becomes a weapon in future wars)), entirely from human activity (for example, pollution), or a combination (for <b>example,</b> <b>flood</b> depth and speed augmented by channeling rivers).|$|R

To facilitate the scheme, we propose a clustering algorithm to cluster nodes that share similar interests, and a labeling algorithm to explicitly capture the clusters in the underlying overlays.
