50|$|Heat engines, {{including}} Stirling engines, {{are sealed}} machines using pistons within cylinders to {{transfer energy from}} a heat source to a colder reservoir, often using steam or another gas as the working substance. (See Carnot cycle.) The first illustration depicts a longitudinal section of a cylinder in a steam engine. The sliding part at the bottom is the piston, and the upper sliding part is a <b>distribution</b> <b>valve</b> (in this case of the D slide valve type) that directs steam alternately into {{either end of the}} cylinder.

5000|$|During the 1830s {{the most}} popular valve drive for {{locomotives}} was known as gab motion in the U.K. and V-hook motion in the U.S.A. The gab motion incorporated two sets of eccentrics and rods for each cylinder; one eccentric was set to give forward and the other backwards motion to the engine and {{one or the other}} could accordingly engage with a pin driving the <b>distribution</b> <b>valve</b> by means of the gabs: - vee-shaped ends to the eccentric rods supposed to catch the rocker driving the valve rod whatever its position. It was a clumsy mechanism, difficult to operate, and only gave fixed valve events. In 1841 two employees in Stephenson’s locomotive works, draughtsman William Howe and pattern-maker William Williams, suggested the simple expedient of replacing the gabs with a vertical slotted link, pivoted at both ends to the tips of the eccentric rods. To change direction, the link and rod ends were bodily raised or lowered by means of a counterbalanced bell crank worked by a reach rod that connected it to the reversing lever. This not only simplified reversing but it was realised that the gear could be raised or lowered in small increments, and thus the combined motion from the “forward” and “back” eccentrics in differing proportions would impart shorter travel to the valve, cutting off admission steam earlier in the stroke and using a smaller amount steam expansively in the cylinder, using its own energy rather than continuing to draw from the boiler. It became the practice to start the engine or climb gradients at long cutoff, usually about 70-80% maximum of the power stroke and to shorten the cutoff as momentum was gained to benefit from the economy of expansive working and the effect of increased lead and higher compression {{at the end of each}} stroke. This process was popularly known as [...] "linking up" [...] or “notching up”, the latter because the reversing lever could be held in precise positions by means of a catch on the lever engaging notches in a quadrant; the term stuck even after the introduction of the screw reverser. A further intrinsic advantage of the Stephenson gear not found in most other types was variable lead. Depending on how the gear was laid out, it was possible to considerably reduce compression and back pressure at the end of each piston stroke when working at low speed in full gear; once again as momentum was gained and cutoff shortened, so lead was automatically advanced and compression increased, cushioning the piston at the end of each stroke and heating the remaining trapped steam in order to avoid temperature drop in the fresh charge of incoming admission steam.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the problem of the {{response}} time of concrete pump distribution circuit unmatching pumping construcution requirement,which caused by selecting accumulator based on experience, the parameter configuration of the accumulator was quantitatively expressed. The response time of the distribution circuit is divided into switch time of S tube <b>distribution</b> <b>valve</b> and accumulated pressure differential time of the accumulator. In order to meet the requirements of the response time of the pumping construction, based on the existing parameter configuration of the accumulator, with dynamic characteristic equation and gas state equation respectively, the switch time of S tube <b>distribution</b> <b>valve</b> and accumulated pressure differential time of the accumulator is quantitatively calculated, and the parameters of the accumulator is configurated. Compared to the traditional accumulator choice method, namely selecting accumulator according to experience and testing whether the response time of the distribution circuit is reasonable, quantitative calculated parameter configuration of concrete pump accumulator is more accurate, and can fully meet the requirments of pumping construction. This method also provides theoretical basis for design and choice of engineering machinery accumulator...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to identify the dynamics of a Tenneco Automotive hydraulic damper valve and to predict valve performance. Accurate simulations of damper valve performance can be used to improve valve designs without the expense of physical testing. The Tenneco damper valve consists of thin shims and a spring preloaded disc that restricts fluid from exiting the main flow orifices. The deflection of the shims and spring are dependent on the flow-rate through the valve. The pressure distribution acting on the deformable valve components is investigated numerically using a dynamic modelling technique. This technique involves sequential geometry and simulation updating, while varying both the geometry and flow-rate. The valve deflection is calculated by post-processing the pressure <b>distribution.</b> <b>Valve</b> performance can be predicted by coupling the valve deflection with CFD pressure results...|$|E

The numerical analysis was performed by using the commercial code of CFD, and the numerical results show the complete flow field inside the valve. Axisymmetric as well as three-dimensional valve model was considered and the simulation results also are verified with experimental results.

40|$|ObjectiveDifferences in {{clinical}} presentation between patients with tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs) or bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs) and aortic valve disease are evident. Whether these differences {{can be attributed}} to differences in cardiovascular risks remains uncertain. MethodsPatient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, medical history, medication, and laboratory findings were evaluated in 702 patients with aortic valve and/or ascending aortic pathology; 202 also had concomitant coronary artery disease. ResultsA BAV was commonly found in patients with isolated valve disease (BAV 47 %, TAV 53 %) and frequently associated with ascending aortic dilatation (BAV 80 %, TAV 20 %). In patients with coronary artery disease, a TAV was commonly found (TAV 84 %, BAV 16 %). The combination of ascending aortic dilatation and coronary artery disease was markedly rare regardless of valve morphology (TAV, 7 out of 38; BAV, 6 out of 127). The <b>distribution</b> of <b>valve</b> pathology and clinical parameters was similar in patients with TAV and BAV with coronary artery disease (P ≥. 12). Without coronary artery disease, parameters associated with cardiovascular risks were more often seen in patients with TAV than in patients with BAV (P ≤. 0001). ConclusionsCoronary artery disease is uncommon in surgical patients with BAV, but it is associated with TAV, advanced age, and male gender. Coronary artery disease and ascending aortic dilatation rarely coexist, regardless of valve phenotype. Differences in the prevalence of coronary artery disease or ascending aortic dilatation between patients with TAV and BAV are not explained by differences in cardiovascular risks or the <b>distribution</b> of <b>valve</b> pathology...|$|R

40|$|A rotating, null gravity simulator, or Couette {{bioreactor}} {{was successfully}} {{used for the}} culture of mammalian cells in a simulated microgravity environment. Two limited studies using Lipomyces starkeyi and Streptomyces clavuligerus were also conducted under conditions of simulated weightlessness. Although these studies with microorganisms showed promising preliminary results, oxygen limitations presented significant limitations in studying the biochemical and cultural characteristics of these cell types. Microbial cell systems such as bacteria and yeast promise significant potential as investigative models to {{study the effects of}} microgravity on membrane transport, as well as substrate induction of inactive enzyme systems. Additionally, the smaller size of the microorganisms should further reduce the gravity induced oscillatory particle motion and thereby improve the microgravity simulation on earth. Focus is on the unique conceptual design, and subsequent development of a rotating bioreactor that is compatible with the culture and investigation of microgravity effects on microbial systems. The new reactor design will allow testing of highly aerobic cell types under simulated microgravity conditions. The described reactor affords a mechanism for investigating the long term effects of reduced gravity on cellular respiration, membrane transfer, ion exchange, and substrate conversions. It offers the capability of dynamically altering nutrients, oxygenation, pH, carbon dioxide, and substrate concentration without disturbing the microgravity simulation, or Couette flow, of the reactor. All progeny of the original cell inoculum may be acclimated to the simulated microgravity {{in the absence of a}} substrate or nutrient. The reactor has the promise of allowing scientists to probe the long term effects of weightlessness on cell interactions in plants, bacteria, yeast, and fungi. The reactor is designed to have a flow field growth chamber with uniform shear stress, yet transfer high concentrations of oxygen into the culture medium. The system described allows for continuous, on line sampling for production of product without disturbing fluid and particle dynamics in the reaction chamber. It provides for the introduction of substrate, or control substances after cell adaptation to simulated microgravity has been accomplished. The reactor system provides for the nondisruptive, continuous flow replacement of nutrient and removal of product.
