To resolve the deficiencies of the common law and deeds registration system, Robert Torrens, a member of the colony's House of Assembly, proposed a new title system in 1858, and it was quickly adopted. The Torrens title system was based on a central registry of all the land in the jurisdiction of South Australia, embodied in the Real Property Act 1886 (SA). All transfers of land are recorded in the register. Most importantly, the owner of the land is established by virtue of his name being recorded in the government's register. The Torrens title also records easements and the creation and <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortgages.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the effect of}} the share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending by individual banks (together with some control variables) on two measures of financial stability - the bank Z-score and the nonperforming loan ratio - for a sample of 212 banks in 19 emerging Asian economies for 2007 - 2013 from the Bankscope database. We find some evidence that an increased share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending is positive for financial stability, specifically by lowering the probability of default by financial institutions and reducing the nonperforming loan ratio, at least in noncrisis periods, for levels <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> shares up to 30 %- 40 %. For higher levels <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending shares, the impact on financial stability turns negative. We also find that the share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending can be a useful measure of both financial development and financial inclusion. This finding most likely reflects the effect of a higher share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending in diversifying the mix of banks' assets and, thereby, reducing overall risk. However, if the share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending is too high, then the diversification effect diminishes. Therefore, the challenge is to balance the expected improvement in financial stability due to asset diversification against negative impacts that might result from easier lending standards or overly rapid increases in mortgage lending that could trigger a bubble in the housing market. This highlights the need for prudent monetary policy and macroprudential policy measures to forestall the development of such bubbles...|$|R

The execution based on the agreement to sell the property on Parate Executie. 2. 	The execution based on executorial title that provided in the mortgage certificate. 3.

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s {{the volume}} of secured lending to {{households}} has expanded rapidly, both in absolute terms and in relation to household incomes. This paper examines the determinants of households' ability to service this stock of secured debt. It estimates a random effects probit model for the probability <b>of</b> households having <b>mortgage</b> payment problems. It is found that past experience of payment problems increases {{the probability that the}} household has difficulties servicing its secured debt today. At the household level, becoming unemployed, interest income gearing of 20 % and above, high loan to value ratios and having a heavy burden of unsecured debt are all associated with a significantly higher probability <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> payment problems. Saving regularly and having unsecured debt which is not a problem are both associated with a significantly lower probability <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> payment problems. The only non-household-specific variable to have a significant effect is mortgage interest rates - the probability of payment problems increases with the level <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> interest rates. An aggregate measure of debt at risk is calculated. This has decreased between 1994 and 2002, as falls in the probability <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> payment problems have more than offset increases in the stock <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> debt outstanding. It is found that the fall in the probability <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> payment problems has been greatest among the most highly indebted households. ...|$|R
