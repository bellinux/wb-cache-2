40|$|Databases are a {{critical}} part of Information Technology. Following a rigorous methodology in the database lifecycle ensures the development of an effective and efficient database. Conceptual data modeling is {{a critical}} stage in the database lifecycle. However, modeling is hard and error prone. An error could be caused by multiple reasons. Finding the reasons behind errors helps explain why the error was made and thus facilitates corrective action to prevent recurrence of that type of error in the future. We examine what errors are made during conceptual data modeling and why. In particular, this research looks at expertise-related reasons behind errors. We use a theoretical approach, grounded in work from <b>educational</b> psychology, <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> by a survey study to validate the model. Our research approach includes the following steps: (1) measure expertise level, (2) classify kinds of errors made, (3) evaluate significance of errors, (4) predict types of errors that will be made based on expertise level, and (5) evaluate significance of each expertise level. Hypotheses testing revealed what aspects of expertise influence different types of errors.

40|$|BackgroundIn a {{previous}} report, we demonstrated {{the efficacy of}} an educational intervention focused on increasing colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans. Despite participating in the intervention, however, nearly two-thirds of participants did not seek and receive screening. MethodsParticipants were African-Americans over age 49 (N= 257) {{who had not been}} screened for colorectal cancer according to guidelines. At baseline, participants completed tests measuring fatalism, perceived stress, self-esteem, attitudes/benefits/barriers, social support, and social network diversity. Those who completed the <b>educational</b> intervention were <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> by telephone to learn if they had been screened. We compared the scores on the psychometric tests of the participants who had been screened against the scores of those who had not. ResultsOnly the mean scores on the attitudes, benefits, and barriers scale distinguished participants who had been screened from those who had not (p = 0. 0816 on bivariate testing and p = 0. 0276 in the logistic regression model). ConclusionSocial interaction among participants or social cognitive learning may {{have played a role in}} determining which participants were screened, but we were not able to demonstrate this. The major factor distinguishing participants who were not screened was their attitude toward screening at baseline. ImpactThere is a subset of African Americans who are persistently resistant to screening, and their perspective in this regard must be addressed if colorectal cancer disparities are to be reduced.

DESIGN [...] Blood pressure was recorded at a medical screening examination after which pressor reactions to a psychological stress task were determined. <b>Follow</b> <b>up</b> measurement of {{blood pressure was}} undertaken, on average, 4. 9 years later. SETTING [...] 20 civil service departments in London. SUBJECTS [...] 1003 male civil servants aged between 35 and 55 years at entry to the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> screening. RESULTS [...] Reactions of systolic blood pressure to stress correlated positively with systolic blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> screening (r = 0. 22, P < 0. 01). The dominant correlate of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure was blood pressure at initial screening (r = 0. 60; P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure; r = 0. 59, P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> diastolic blood pressure). Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that reactions to the stressor provided minimal prediction of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure over and above that afforded by blood pressure at initial screening. In the case of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure, systolic reactions to stress accounted for only 1 % of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> variance; systolic blood pressure at initial screening accounted for 34 %. With regard to diastolic blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> the independent contribution from diastolic reactions to stress was less than 1 %.

Background. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) {{remains one of the}} most common childhood chronic infectious diseases worldwide, affecting diverse racial and cultural groups in both developing and industrialized countries. Aim of the Study. This study aimed to assess the impact of educational program on the management of children with CSOM. Subjects and Methods. An experimental study design was used. This study included 100 children of both sexes of 2 years and less of age with CSOM. Those children were divided into 3 groups: group I: it involved 50 children with CSOM (naive) who received the designed educational program; control group: it involved 50 children who were under the traditional treatment and failed to respond; group II: those children in the control group were given the <b>educational</b> program and <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> in the same way as group I and considered as group II. Tools of the Study. Tool I is a structured questionnaire interview sheet for mothers. It consists of four parts: (1) personal and sociodemographic characteristics of child and (2) data about risk factors of otitis media (3) assessment of maternal practice about care of children with suppurative otitis medi (4) diagnostic criteria for suppurative otitis media.

To {{determine the effect of}} repeated treatment on the <b>educational</b> performance we <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> children (aged 8. 0 - 8. 9 years) who were in the same school grade through a three-year period. The prevalence of infection in the cohort measured at 12 -monthly intervals with a session of treatment in between the screening were 69. 1 % {{at the beginning of the}} programme then 45. 2 % and 21. 6 % at the second and third yearly evaluation respectively. The school attendance rate in the cohort decreased from 86. 7 % at onset of treatment programme to 81. 1 % by the third yearly evaluation (p= 0. 24).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relation of}} cardiac autoantibody and disease status in a consecutive series of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by prospective antibody testing at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> METHODS: Antibody status was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence in 110 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (85 male, mean (SD) age 44 (13) years) at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> (mean (SD) 14 (12) months); in 57 of them cardiac specific anti-alpha myosin antibody titres were also measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients underwent complete evaluation at diagnosis and clinical and non-invasive assessment at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> including exercise testing with maximal oxygen consumption measurements. RESULTS: The frequency of cardiac specific antibodies by immunofluorescence was lower at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> than at diagnosis (28 (25 %) v 11 (10 %), P = 0. 002). Mean (SEM) anti-alpha myosin antibody titres at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> were also lower than at diagnosis (0. 24 (0. 02) v 0. 30 (0. 02), P = 0. 038); 24 % of patients at diagnosis and 14 % at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> had an abnormal ELISA result.

Moderation effects of emotional approach coping and social constraints were predicted based on a matching hypothesis for the fit between the demands of writing and individual differences (Niles et al, 2014) and the role of social constraints on disclosure (Lepore & Revenson, 2007). Cancer-related avoidance and cancer-related intrusive thoughts were examined as mediators on the relationships between social constraints and emotional well-being at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> and social constraints and quality of life at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Results showed that participants in the expressive writing condition reported increased emotional well-being at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> controlling for baseline levels of emotional well-being, but there were no differences in quality of life at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> between the two writing conditions, controlling for baseline quality of life. There were no differences in reported average negative affect post writing sessions between the two writing conditions. In a model predicting emotional well-being at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> expressive writing had a positive effect, social constraints had a negative effect, and emotional approach coping had no effect. The hypothesized moderation effects between emotional approach coping, social constraints and writing condition in predicting emotional well-being at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> were not detected and support for the matching hypothesis proposed by Niles et al (2014) was not found.
