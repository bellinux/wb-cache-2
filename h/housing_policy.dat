However, unlike Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Delta Theta has no exemption policy allowing chapters that meet certain standards, such as a cumulative GPA higher than 3.0, to have alcohol in the chapter house.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, the {{fraternity}} issued a progress report. Significant improvements {{have occurred in}} many areas of fraternity life and operations. Since the implementation of the alcohol free <b>housing</b> <b>policy,</b> the all undergraduate grade point average rose from 2.77 in 2000 to nearly 3.00 in 2005. The insurance premiums of individual members have also gone down as risk management violations have decreased. Perhaps the most telling area is in membership, where Phi Delta Theta showed an increase of new members. In 2004, Phi Delta Theta had 3,102 new members while other fraternities averaged 2,415. In 1990, chapters of Phi Delta Theta were 18% larger than the typical fraternity chapter. In 2004, they were 30% larger. Also, in 2004, Phi Delta Theta was one of only 13 national/international fraternities to show an increase in total undergraduates from the previous year with an increase of 4.2%. The significance of this is highlighted by the fact that Phi Delta Theta had fewer chapters than other fraternities. Competitively, Phi Delta Theta has remained a constant among others. In terms of new members, it ranked ninth in 1990, eighth in 2000, and ninth in 2004. Many alumni members have credited the alcohol free <b>housing</b> <b>policy</b> in continuing this trend.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the slums}} in today's world are {{a product of}} {{urbanization}} brought by colonialism. For instance, the Europeans arrived in Kenya {{in the nineteenth century}} and created urban centers such as Nairobi mainly to serve their financial interests. They regarded the Africans as temporary migrants and needed them only for supply of labor. The <b>housing</b> <b>policy</b> aiming to accommodate these workers was not well enforced and the government built settlements in the form of single-occupancy bedspaces. Due to the cost of time and money in their movement back and forth between rural and urban areas, their families gradually migrated to the urban centre. As they could not afford to buy houses, slums were thus formed.|$|E
25|$|When Phi Delta Theta {{announced}} {{the inception of}} an alcohol free <b>housing</b> <b>policy,</b> the announcement was met both by hope and skepticism. While some saw the banning of alcohol in housing facilities as a welcome return to the principles on which the fraternity was founded, others felt the drastic cultural shift would hurt social dynamics. The General Council and GHQ had expected resistance from both alumni and undergraduate members {{when it was first}} proposed. Among the most vocal chapters against the policy were the University of Virginia chapter, where a faction split off from Phi Delta Theta and chose to form a separate local fraternity known as the Phi Society, and the University of the South chapter, which formed the Phi Society of 1883 rather than adopt the policy. Phi Delta Theta returned to the University of Virginia one year later and formed a new chapter. Phi Delta Theta has not returned to the University of the South.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, <b>housing</b> <b>policy</b> {{has been a}} devolved matter, and state support for the homeless, {{together}} with legal rights in housing, have therefore diverged to a certain degree. A national service, called Streetlink, was established in 2012 to help {{members of the public}} obtain near-immediate assistance for specific rough sleepers, {{with the support of the}} Government (as housing is a devolved matter, the service currently only extends to England). Currently, the service does not operate on a statutory basis, and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities, with funding being provided by the government (and others) on an ad-hoc basis. A member of the public who is concerned that someone is sleeping on the streets can report the individual's details via the Street Link website or by calling the referral line number on 0300 500 0914. Someone who finds themselves sleeping on the streets can also report their situation using the same methods. It is important to note that the Streetlink service is for those who are genuinely sleeping on the streets, and not those who may merely be begging, or ostensibly living their life on the streets despite a place to sleep elsewhere (such as a hostel or supported accommodation).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this micro-ethnographic study was to bring to light the choices and {{strategies}} of poor people in reaction to what they imagined <b>housing</b> <b>policies</b> to be in Nicaragua. The analysis used four of Bourdieu‟s concepts which are Habitus, Capital, Field, and Agency and his structuralistic constructivism and interpretivism within a mainly phenomenological approach. Both approaches emphasized poor people‟s own subjective experiences and perceptions in terms of <b>housing</b> <b>policies.</b> The research questions dealt with what the meaning of <b>housing</b> <b>policies</b> for poor people in Nicaragua was and what the underlying motives/incentives affecting poor people‟s strategies in relation to <b>housing</b> <b>policies</b> were. The study was located in the Reparto Mariana Sanzon in a housing cooperative called Juntando Manos in Leon, Nicaragua. The main qualitative methods were participant observation and semi-structured interviews. These were complemented with focus groups and a field work diary. The outcomes were that poor people knew what they needed, but they were constrained by the field of <b>housing</b> <b>policies.</b> The choices did not help them to access a house due to low salaries, low position within the field to negotiate and informal jobs. So, poor people‟s strategies are based on: reliance on aid, denial of the state‟...|$|R

2500|$|Lack of {{affordable}} {{low cost housing}} and poor planning encourages the supply side of slums.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to give an overview of the most commonly used <b>housing</b> <b>policies</b> and to illustrate their economic impact. To facilitate the analysis, we first introduce a simple two-period housing demand model for owner-occupied houses and rental houses. We then add a standard stock-flow housing supply model. Using this modelling framework, we explain the qualitative effects of various <b>housing</b> <b>policies</b> on supply and demand. In the last section of the paper, we provide a quantitative estimation of the impact of each policy and assess its effectiveness using a simple analysis of cost effectiveness.
