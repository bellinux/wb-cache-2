50|$|After World War II, the stonelayer {{was given}} new names, “carpedolith,” “chert-line,” “nappes de gravats,” “lit de cailloux d’epaisseur,” “concentration de quartz,” “linea de piedras,” “nodular layer,” “stiensohle,” “biogenic marker horizon,” “gravel horizon,” and “pedisediment,” among others. The common {{presence}} in them of human artifacts, precious-semiprecious stones (diamonds, emeralds, etc.) and metals (gold, silver, tin, etc.) has piqued {{the interest of}} geologists, geographers, archaeologists, mining specialists, and engineers (Aleva 1983, 1987; Brink 1985; Brink et al. 1982; Johnson et al. 2005; Ruhe 1959, 1969). Some have attributed the explanatory controversy surrounding stonelayers to a perceived narrow and limiting 20th century theoretical-interpretive-explanatory tradition in pedology and soil science (Johnson et al. 2005; Johnson and Johnson 2006). According to this view, explanatory pedology has operated under a predominantly soil science utilitarian-conceptual approach, or model—the five factors (‘clorpt’) model—to map, classify, valuate, and “explain” soils (Jenny 1941; Soil Survey personnel 1951, 1975, 1991, 1993). While the model has greatly aided soil science, and spatially explains generalized soil-environmental relationships on landscapes, the device—supremely attractive in its parsimony—has constrained pedologic interpretation because its genetic-interpretive domain is constrained by its broad factorial (landscape context) tenets. The model allows for a wide-ranging generalized assessment of soilscapes, and is useful in soil chronosequence work (Birkeland 1974, 1984) but the biodynamic soil processes that are largely responsible in producing stonelayers are absent at a highest theoretical (five factors) level. Once mapped and classified, soils become static elements, which—while societally useful, scientifically misrepresents their true biodynamic nature. In a proposal to heal such Occam's razor wounds, process biodynamics supported with appropriate <b>genetic</b> <b>language</b> has been advanced to augment the traditional five factors genetic principles in pedology and soil-geomorphology. A process-biodynamic approach, with supporting <b>genetic</b> <b>language,</b> provides a way forward and fosters a fresh array of interpretive options.|$|E

50|$|A common visual {{representation}} of a language family is given by a <b>genetic</b> <b>language</b> tree. The tree model is sometimes termed a dendrogram or phylogeny. The family tree shows {{the relationship of the}} languages within in a family, much as a family tree of an individual shows their relationship with their relatives. There are criticisms to the family tree model. Critics focus mainly on the claim that the internal structure of the trees is subject to variation based on the criteria of classification. Even among those who support the family tree model, there are debates over which languages should be included in a language family. For example, within the dubious Altaic language family, there are debates over whether the Japonic and Koreanic languages should be included or not.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas S. Ray {{created a}} <b>genetic</b> <b>language</b> similar to earlier digital systems, but added several key {{features}} {{that made it}} more suitable for evolution in his artificial life system, Tierra. Primarily, he prevented instructions from writing beyond the privately allocated memory space, thus limiting the potential for organisms writing over others. The only selective pressure in Tierra was for rapid self-replication. Over the course of evolution, this pressure led to shorter and shorter genomes, reducing the time spent copying instructions during replication. Some individuals even started executing the replication code in other organisms, allowing those [...] "cheaters", which were originally referred to as parasites in Ray's work, to further shrink their genetic programs. This form of cheating was the first evolved ecological interaction between organisms in artificial life software. Ray's cheaters pre-dated the formal study of evolving ecological interactions using Tierra-like digital evolution platforms by 20 years.|$|E

40|$|For help in {{explaining}} our theoretical understanding of nature, Pauli once suggested to Bohr a gradual lessening of the ‘detachment of the observer’, {{a notion of}} Bohr based on his concept of complementarity. Pauli expected further steps in this direction. We suggest further such steps - in line with an epistemological development towards revelation of presuppositions rather than asking for fundamental truths. When taken to the basic presuppositions for communication, we reach language in its holistic conception and cybernetic realization, namely holistic cybernetics. That is a system of two holistic languages, one communication language and one <b>genetic</b> <b>language.</b> An essential presupposition is that the communication language is shared among a population of communicating individuals. The <b>genetic</b> <b>language</b> is responsible for this, and provides (via evolutionary adaptation) linguistic capacities that are shared (beyond complete description) among the communicating individuals. This explains induction as beyond deduction in the communication language.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that all forms of self-reference or {{autonomy}} are linguistic phenomena (under a general complementaristic conception of language). Autonomies do not naturally occur in non linguistic domains, like classical physics with its mechanistic modellings. However, in quantum physics, where language is beginning to enter the physical domain, as exemplified in Bohr´s notion of complementarity, self-referential phenomena are recognized. And in biology, with its <b>genetic</b> <b>language</b> and higher cerebral languages, self-reference problems abound, from self-reproduction to innospection. It is argued {{in terms of the}} linguistic complementarity, which obtains for all forms of language, that every consistent form of self-reference must be panial. Attempts at objectifying this partiality are made, in particular with the aid of two forms of the recursion theorem. Levels of partiality are discussed in terms of autology and autolinguistics. In particular, partialities of self-referential sentences such as those of Gödel, Rosser and Henkin are discussed. Viral self-reproduclion in bacteria is seen as a natural level of partiality in epigenesis. Phenomena of self-repair are referred to, and it is suggested that the level of partiality of DNA self-repair, which has been observed in genetics, does illuminate a basic difference, with respect to self-reference. between on the one hand <b>genetic</b> <b>language,</b> and on the other, "planning language" (natural language, formal language, programming language) ...|$|E

The result of this research show that there is a matrix code for insulin.

The issue of the existence of an insulin code and coding of the individual structural elements of this protein are discussed. Answers to the following questions are sought. Does the matrix mechanism for biosynthesis of this protein function within the law of the general theory of information systems, and what is the significance of this for understanding the <b>genetic</b> <b>language</b> of insulin?
