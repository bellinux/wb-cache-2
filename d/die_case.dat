In 1975, after drinking gin and tonics {{at a party}} and then taking Diazepam, Quinlan collapsed, suffered respiratory failure and irreversible brain damage, and, after being taken to the hospital, lapsed into a persistent vegetative state. After she had been kept alive on a ventilator for several months without improvement, her parents requested that the hospital discontinue such active care and allow her to die. The hospital refused, and the subsequent legal battles made newspaper headlines and set significant precedents. After the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in her parents' favor, Quinlan spent nine more years comatose in the hospital, before dying from pneumonia in 1985.|$|E

General statements by a person that he or she would not want to live in such a condition are not acceptable under the decision. The decision was criticized by right-to-die organizations as being too strict and unworkable, and taking decision-making away from family members. Wachtler was criticized for writing the decision while his own 86-year-old mother was recovering from a stroke.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study and analyze the effects of die most important characteristics of the tomato-greenhouse conditioned projects on the corresponding levels of productivity and production costs. The properties examined were: the type of cover, the number of cultivations per year, and farm size. The study relied on primary data drawn from a representative sample of tomato growers in the Riyadh and Kharj area. The study showed that: (1) The productivity of the examined greenhouses does not differ significantly as a result of having different cover types or different farm size. However, the only factor which was found to affect productivity levels is the number of cultivations per year. The study showed a significant increase in the don urn productivity of tomatoes when cultivated twice a year (26 tons) as opposed to only (11 tons) when cultivated once a year. (2) The production costs per donum were significantly higher in <b>die</b> <b>case</b> of tow cultivations per year than the case of one cultivation per year (48 thousand Rivals versus 34 thousand Rivals). (3) The farm size was found to possess an impact on these production costs. These costs were reduced from SO thousand Rivals to 42 thousand Rivals per donum when farm size increased from the 10 donums' set to the 10 - 20 donums' set. The costs went down further to 38. S thousand Riyals when the farm size was increased from the 10 donums' set to the over 20 donums' set. This is due to the reductions in the share of die donum of manpower, machinery depreciation, buildings depreciation, fertilization, maintenance, pesticides, and fuels. As a result of the previous findings, die achieved net returns per donum have increased by about 6. 183 thousand Riyals when switching from one cultivation per year to two. Moreover, the incomplete utilization of the whole project capacity (through cultivating die land once a year) resulted in a loss of 12 thousand Riyals per donum. Despite achieving losses in small farms (which are sized less than 10 donums), large farms (over 20 donums) achieved net returns of 11 thousand Riyals per donum. This implies that large farms should expand and cultivate tomatoes twice a year in order to increase productivity and to reduce production costs...|$|E
40|$|The {{inert gases}} Xe and ¿¿ {{constitute}} around 30 % of the fission product inventory in UO 2 nuclear fuel. At temperatures below about 1000 oC die gas atoms are disposed in die fuel matrix and cause lew problems. Above this temperatare part of tbe gas forms bubbles and part is release to free {{volume of the}} fuel rod. The fonnation of gas bubbles causes die fuel tø swell, which can lead tø increased mechanical interaction between the fuel and its containment, whilst high levels of fission gas release can cause over-pressurisation of tbe fuel rod. Both diese effects can lead to failure of die fuel rod. The fission gases Xe and Kr in a section of UO 2 fuel with an average bum-up of 65 MWd/kgHM have recently been analysed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The section exhibited a thin band of high bum-up structure (Rg. l) at the pellet rim [1]. SMS depth profiling carried out on the high bum-up structure revealed that the pores contained the fission gas lost from die fuel matrix (Fig. 2). fa Fig. 2 the intensity sinkes in tibe ¿¿¿ and ^Kr depth profiles mart the locations of bubbles in die high bum-up structure. Since the instrument measures the Xe and Kr ion signals consecutively, the number of gas bubbles encountered in the analysis is equal to die sum of die Xe and Kr intensity spikes in die two traces. The results for Kr in Figa are the first ever obtained for the behaviour of this fission gas in irradiated nuclear fuel. To confirm that Xe and Kr are together in die pores of the high bum-up structure, ion maps showing the distributions of mC& and ^b, which are die stable decay products of 133 Xe (half-life, 5. 3 days) and 85 Kr (half-life, 10. 8 yrs.), were produced. Unlike, die rare gases, which are ionized above die sample surface after release from die pores [2], Cs and Rb being solids at room temperature are ionized in-situ during the sputtering process, as is generally <b>die</b> <b>case</b> in SIMS. Ion maps for the distribution of mCs and ^Rb in the high bum-up structure are shown in Hg. 3. Circles mark pores that unambiguously show evidence of having contained 133 Xe and ^Kr. The concentration of retained Xe at {{the surface of the}} high bum-up fuel was analysed by SIMS and electron probe microanalysis (¿¿¿¿), fa Fig. 4 the radial variation of the ' 2 Xe ion intensity measured in the surface region of the fuel by SIMS depth profiling is superimposed on the ¿¿¿¿ Xe concentration profile. It can be seen that in die radial interval between r/r 0 = 0. 95 and die fuel surface, where tbe high bum-up structure was present, ¿¿¿¿ measured a sharp fall in the concentration of retained Xe. Ibis is because ¿¿¿¿ measures «üy die gas concentration in the fuel matrix (it does not detect the gas in die pores), fa contrast SIMS records a steep increase in tbe 133 Xe intensity in die same region since it detects all die gas present lbe rise in the gas concentration measured by SIMS is consistent with the increase in the local bum-up profile measured by ¿¿¿¿ at the pellet surface. Ibis agreement confirms that a large fraction (perhaps all) of (he Xe released from Ae UO 2 matrix is contained in the pores of die high bum-up structure. JRC. E. 2 -Hot cell...|$|E
