50|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War many {{industrial}} {{companies in}} South Yorkshire faced problems due to the decline in the need for their products. The large steel producers within the United Kingdom were nationalised in 1951 under the Labour Government, but, just two years later Steel, Peech & Tozer was de-nationalised. By the 1950s Templeborough's open hearth furnaces were in need of replacement and the United Steel Companies set about the task of updating its melting facilities. Plans, under the name “Operation SPEAR” (<b>Steel</b> Peech <b>Electric</b> <b>Arc</b> Reorganization), brought the most modern <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnaces to the company, six of these replacing the 14 open hearth furnaces. When completed Templeborough Melting Shop became the world's largest <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> <b>steel</b> making <b>plant</b> with a capability of producing 1.8 million tons per year.|$|R

In 1918 they merged with Samuel Fox and Company, based in Stocksbridge and Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company in Scunthorpe creating United Steel Companies (USC). The Templeborough steelworks was reputed to be a mile long. At its height in the mid-20th century, the company employed 10,000 people. In the 1950s as Templeborough's open hearth furnaces had become outdated USC set up “Operation SPEAR” (<b>Steel</b> Peech <b>Electric</b> <b>Arc</b> Reorganization), to inroduce six modern <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnaces to replace the 14 open hearth furnaces. This resulted in Templeborough Melting Shop becoming the largest <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> <b>steel</b> making <b>plant</b> in the world: they were capable of producing 1.8 million tons per year.

In this paper, the relevance of various determinants for the diffusion of <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnance <b>steel</b> (structural change) and for the energy-use of new technologies in the German steel industry sector is assessed econometrically. The empirical findings support the hypotheses that the diffusion of <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnane <b>steel</b> is accelerated by enery and material input prices and dampened by path dependencies.

40|$|The {{cementitious}} and pozzolanic {{behavior of}} <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnace <b>steel</b> slag, both as received and treated {{has been studied}} in detail. The as received slag was completely crystalline and multi-phasic with Fe-substituted monticellite as the predominant phase. Treatment of this slag, remelting and water quenching, results in reduction of Fe-oxide content coupled {{with an increase in}} basicity index which makes it more hydraulic compared to the as received slag. The remelted slag has several phases with merwinite as the dominant phase. Thermal analysis of the hydrated slag shows that treating the as received slag increases the water absorption capacity, a property essential for cementitious behavior. Compression strength of the slag blended cements was studied and it was found that substitution of 20 % ground granulated blast furnace slag with <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnace <b>steel</b> slag does not decrease the strength beyond 28 days. The control cement has a strength of 58. 6 MPa compared to 58 MPa for the cement comprising of 20 % untreated slag. The substitution of this untreated slag with treated slag exhibits the highest strength, 61 MPa and a potential for further strength increase after 28 days. In the case of cement mix with no blast furnace slag, substitution of 15 % clinker with steel slag does not decrease the strength significantly, 64. 4 MPa compared to 66. 5 MPa for the control cement Substituting 30 % clinker in the cement mix with <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnace slag however results in significant decrease in strength, 53. 4 MPa.

40|$|M. Ing. Steel {{products}} {{can be produced}} by either following the blast furnace with oxygen steel making route or the <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> <b>steel</b> making route. The blast furnace with oxygen route requires liquid iron to produce <b>steel</b> and the <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> route requires scrap metal as a major input. This in essence implies that for the blast furnace route if no liquid iron is produced, no steel products will be produced and similarly so for the <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> route. ArcelorMittal Vanderbijlpark Works produces its liquid iron from two furnaces namely blast furnace C and blast furnace D. However the reliability of these furnaces is in question as their daily operations are plagued with random failures of equipment and machinery. The main consequence of these failures is the unavailability of the furnaces to produce liquid iron. This is undesirable from a business perspective due to the inherent production losses, loss of potential earnings {{as well as the}} high costs incurred to restore the furnaces back into operation. This research dissertation will focus on the operation of these blast furnaces. The fundamental success criteria for this research document will be to identify opportunities to improve the reliable operation of these furnaces. The scope of the work will however be limited to blast furnace C and particularly at improving its charging system’s availability. The availability of the charging system can be improved by knowing what type of failures to expect and how to mitigate their effects. A starting point would then be to examine past failure data. Thus data from 2008 has been collected and analyzed making use of statistical methods, design analysis methods and research methodologies. The results suggest that the availability of the system has a direct correlation between its reliability and maintainability. The results obtained were then subjected to a risk analysis to identify measures that could be employed to improve the charging system’s availability...|$|R

40|$|In today`s steel {{industry}} {{about one third}} of the total steel production is produced by <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> <b>steel</b> making. The production of steel is a very energy intensive industry, but when considering the total cost of the final steel mill product, it is the cost of raw materials that are dominating. A global trend for the manufacturing industry isto produce more energy effective products by usinglow alloyed steels which in turn affects the scrap based {{steel industry}}. Thereforean increased need of iron ore based metallic, such as direct reduced iron (DRI) and hot briquetted iron (HBI), as scrap supplement is then needed formaintaining low levels of trace elements in the produced steel. The selection ofraw materials is a matter that affects the conditions for the entire productionsystem, product properties, slag properties, off gas and dust generation, energyuse and the conditions for processes downstream. For the integrated iron and steel industry and also for other energy intensiveprocess industry, research in the field of process integration has shown goodresults regarding optimization of energy use and material utilization. Theapplication of process integration as a method for the scrap based industry, andin particular for Höganäs AB:s production system, is discussed in the thesis. Mixed Integer Linear Programing has been used to develop system models foroptimization and evaluation of costs and energy usage. Also processes notpresent in Höganäs current production system have been developed for analysisof future raw material scenarios. The current system models include six mainprocess steps: a direct reduction process, an <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnace, a ladle furnace, a continuous casting process and a hot rolling mill. Among the presented results in this thesis, a major result is the models` ability to predict and constrain product quality in an improved way and show potentialcost- and energy savings for the modeled production system. Furthermore,another very useful result is the models` ability to minimize cost and energy usefor sequences of different product qualities, while taking stock levels intoconsideration. A constant concern for steelmakers is that raw material prices, composition and availability are changing and fluctuating over time. Therefore, system modeling {{can be seen as a}} good tool for helping to maintain flexibility in production units by taking advantage of these market fluctuations to keep conversion costs andenergy use at lowest levels possibleGodkänd; 2014; 20141103 (philin); Nedanstående person kommer att hålla licentiatseminarium för avläggande av teknologie licentiatexamen.
