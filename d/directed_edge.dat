25|$|It {{is often}} more {{convenient}} and conceptually appealing to pass to the barycentric subdivision of Y. The vertices of this subdivision correspond to the simplices of Y, so that each vertex has a group attached to it. The edges of the barycentric subdivision are naturally oriented (corresponding to inclusions of simplices) and each <b>directed</b> <b>edge</b> gives an inclusion of groups. Each triangle has a transition element attached to it belonging {{to the group of}} exactly one vertex; and the tetrahedra, if there are any, give cocycle relations for the transition elements. Thus a complex of groups involves only the 3-skeleton of the barycentric subdivision; and only the 2-skeleton if it is simple.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two basic}} {{approaches}} available for dealing with mutual couplings and active components. [...] In the first of these, Samuel Jefferson Mason in 1953 introduced signal-flow graphs. [...] Signal-flow graphs are weighted, directed graphs. [...] He used these to analyse circuits containing mutual couplings and active networks. [...] The weight of a <b>directed</b> <b>edge</b> in these graphs represents a gain, such as possessed by an amplifier. [...] In general, signal-flow graphs, unlike the regular directed graphs described above, do not correspond to the topology of the physical arrangement of components.|$|E

In this problem, one must choose time slots for the edges of a wireless communications network so that each node of the network can communicate with each neighboring node without interference. Using a strong edge coloring (and using two time slots for each edge color, one for each direction) would solve the problem but might use more time slots than necessary. Instead, they seek a coloring of the directed graph formed by doubling each undirected edge of the network, with the property that each <b>directed</b> <b>edge</b> [...] has a different color from the edges that go out from [...] and from the neighbors of [...] They propose a heuristic for this problem based on a distributed algorithm for -edge-coloring together with a postprocessing phase that reschedules edges that might interfere with each other.|$|E
