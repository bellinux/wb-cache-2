In this article, we identify three modes of theory {{building at the}} intersection and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We position these three modes relative to one another using the 2 ̆ 7 <b>impact</b> <b>wheel</b> 2 ̆ 7, which visually describes their influence on five domains: theory, field, discipline, researchers, and external stakeholders. Though impact on these domains varies across the three modes, maximum impact is created when theory building at the intersection uncovers new phenomena that revise the boundaries of existing disciplines and fields while giving birth to new ones. Such theorizing is infrequent and demands particular skills {{on the part of}} researchers to help organization science to realize more of its potential...|$|E

In this paper, the possiblity to monitor the <b>wheel</b> <b>impacts</b> due to short-wavelength defects such as wheel flats using such a system is theoretically presented through the simulations using a comprehensive non-linear vehicle-track interaction dynamics model. The method is restricted to tradtional three piece bogie rollingstock. A coal wagon is modeled and a section of track with the geometry irregularity class 5 is selected for the simulations. The simulation results show that the original acceleration measurements on the wagon car body include very high frequency components contributed by the friction elements in the wagon components, which hide the useful messages coming from the <b>wheel</b> <b>impact.</b> A filter has been designed to extract these useful messages. The processed data shows that the <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> patterns, even those caused by the smaller wheel flats, can be detected.

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{a new approach}} for constructing causal maps called the Collective Causal Mapping Methodology (CCMM). This methodology collects information asynchronously {{from a group of}} dispersed and diverse subject-matter experts via Web technologies. Through three rounds of data collection, analysis, mapping, and interpretation, CCMM constructs a parsimonious collective causal map. The article illustrates the CCMM by constructing a causal map as a teaching tool for the field of operations management. Causal maps are an essential tool for managers who seek to improve complex systems in the areas of quality, strategy, and information systems. These causal maps are known by many names, including Ishikawa (fishbone) diagrams, cause-and-effect diagrams, <b>impact</b> <b>wheels,</b> issue trees, strategy maps, and risk-assessment mapping tools. Causal maps can be used by managers to focus attention on the root causes of a problem, find critical control points, guide risk management and risk mitigation efforts, formulate and communicate strategy, and teach the fundamental causal relationships in a complex system. Only two basic methods for creating causal maps are available to managers today-brainstorming and interviews. However, these methods are limited, particularly when the subject-matter experts cannot easily meet in the same place at the same time. Managers working with complex systems across large, geographically dispersed organizations can employ the CCMM presented here to efficiently and effectively construct causal maps to facilitate improving their systems...|$|R

The accelerometer based methods for determining the <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> load resulting from wheel defect is commonly used in Australia. This method relies on the dynamic response of the track in determining {{the magnitude of the}} impact load imposed on the track by a defective wheel. This study compares the rail acceleration due to dynamic impact forces caused by wheelflat for different axle load, wheel mass and train velocity.

It is also found that for high axle load the rail acceleration spectrum is concentrated in the lowe r frequency region...|$|R

50|$|Wheel sensors {{along the}} tracks feel for flat {{spots on the}} train's wheels. Any flat wheel that becomes too {{dangerous}} to travel on (a big flat spot on the train wheel) will be counted as a defect. Typically, these systems utilise accelerometers, strain gauges, fibre optic methods, or the very latest (WIPD) <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> phase detector. A <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> load detector (WILD) measures impacts, but does not normalise these impact measurements against anything: simply the impact reading. They do not attempt to cater for differences in sprung mass, as they are measuring <b>wheel</b> defect <b>impact</b> rather than impact load. Therefore, the same wheel defect will register a much larger impact when a wagon is loaded, versus when it is empty.A wheel condition monitoring detector monitors {{the condition of the}} wheel independent of sprung mass - independent of load. They do this by subtracting the wheel mass to get the normalised impact value. These systems are therefore typically better at detecting smaller defects with greater resolution.|$|R

40|$|Railway {{sleepers}} in a {{track system}} are usually utilised to transfer any loading from the rails {{to the ground}} support. A wide range of loading conditions has been observed but the critical loading condition is the <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> force, which is often due to the wheel or rail irregularities. The railway industry has been aware of a high potential that an out-of-round, single-sided wheel defect may occur and cause cracking in the railway concrete sleepers. This paper presents the dynamic effects on the railway concrete sleeper in a track system due to a single <b>wheel</b> <b>impact.</b> In this study, the railway concrete sleeper is modeled using the beam on elastic foundation theory. The dynamic finite model makes use of the elements coupling with shear and bending deformations to represent the concrete sleeper, and features {{the use of the}} tensionless elastic support as the nature of ballast. The parametric investigations focus on the influences of both magnitude and duration of the transient loading. Using the robust finite element software STRAND 7, the finite element model of the railway concrete sleeper was previously established and validated against experimental data by the authors. The numerical simulations present the dynamic flexural moment magnification factor of the railway concrete sleeper under the asymmetrical wheel load patterns...|$|R
40|$|Cost-efficient and {{reliable}} heavy haul operation requires {{a minimum of}} operational disturbances. To this end, the current study focuses on wheel load management with the aim to establish wheel load monitoring and mitigation actions (in terms of limits on allowable wheel defects) that minimize traffic disruptions. As a first step, the relation between <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> load magnitudes (resulting from the out-of-round wheels) and critical rail crack sizes {{that would result in}} rail breaks is established. Variations in parameters such as track stiffness, rail temperature, impact load characteristics and hanging sleepers etc. are investigated and a “bad case scenario” that implies severe, but realistic operational conditions is established. In this manner allowable <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> load magnitudes can be linked to pertinent critical crack sizes that must be identified during inspections. An interesting finding is that thermal stresses have such a major effect that a seasonal variation in allowable wheel load limit seems justified. Predicted critical crack sizes (presuming allowed wheel load magnitudes) are then contrasted to critical crack sizes at operational rail breaks. A large scatter in operational critical crack sizes is found and reasons for this fact are discussed. Finally operational aspects of implementing the suggested limit values are discussed...|$|R

The purpose of the experimental tests {{was to investigate the}} crashworthiness characteristics of steering wheel armatures from a similar vehicle line in terms of peak loads, Crush Force Efficiency, elastic response, energy efficiency, specific energy absorption and the Energy Absorption Factor. In order to obtain comparable results a rigid plate was used to <b>impact</b> the steering <b>wheel</b> armatures. Based on the findings, a parametric study investigating the effects of dish depth and 3 o 2 ̆ 7 clock and 9 o 2 ̆ 7 clock spoke angle was conducted.
