40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} 81 species of Ilex is {{described}} in detail. The wood anatomical range encountered is presented in a generic description (p. 196). Data on ontogenetic changes in vessel member length and number of bars per perforation are given for three species. The great amount of variation in mainly quantitative but also in some qualitative features is hardly or not related with subgeneric classification but with latitudinal and altitudinal distribution. In both {{the northern and southern}} hemisphere and in both the Old and New World, temperate and subtropical species are characterized by conspicuous growth rings, numerous narrow vessels, relatively short vessel members and few bars per perforation plate, conspicuous spiral thickenings on both vessel and fibre walls, and the fibretracheids are frequently provided with rather numerous conspicuously bordered tangential wall pits. In tropical lowland species growth rings are absent or less marked, the vessels are scanty and wide, the vessel members are long and the number of bars per perforation plate is high. Spirals are lacking or faint, or occur only in a minor part of the axial elements. The fibre-tracheids have usually few pits with more reduced borders on the tangential walls. Tropical montane species resemble the temperate ones to a great extent, but this does not apply to growth rings, spiral thickenings, and frequency and size of <b>fibre-tracheid</b> pits. The only wood sample of a climbing Ilex species from the tropics studied deviates from the general trend in having few bars per perforation plate. The two temperate species I. serrata and I. verticillata are exceptional in lacking spiral thickenings. In all wood characters they resemble the genus Nemopanthus (also Aquifoliaceae) very closely. Comparisons with data from literature and original observations on Prunus, Symplocos, Vaccinium. Viburnum, and to some extent also on Hydrangea, support the view that the gradual differences between temperate and tropical Ilex species conform to a general trend also present in other taxa. Therefore a major climatic influence on wood structure is indicated. This is discussed with reference to the major trends of phylogenetic wood specialization. The fact that within Ilex and Symplocos the tropical lowland species have perforations with the most numerous bars cannot be brought in agreement with the general phenomenon of a rare occurrence of scalariform perforations in tropical lowland floras. Other items such as the parallel between the absence of spiral thickenings and the presence of entire leaf margins, the lack of a clear taxonomic pattern in the wood anatomical variation in Ilex, and observations by former students of Ilex wood anatomy are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} manuka growing in five {{different}} habitats was analysed to establish {{whether or not}} different anatomical forms exist. The study involved {{the use of the}} light microscope for obtaining vessel and fibre quantitative data such as their length, width, wall thickness, density of vessel elements in a transection and average grouping of vessels. The confocal microscope was used to measure the area of perforation plates of fibriform vessels and wide vessels. The study also involved the use of the scanning electron microscope for determining the presence of cell wall sculpturing in the walls of wide vessels. The data was analysed by univariate analysis to determine any variation of wood characters within a population and between populations in the five habitats. The habitats were margins of lowland forests, swamp, sand dune, subalpine and hot thermal soils. The study has established variations within each population in all the cell types. The study showed that plants differed anatomically in the average sizes of their cell length, width, wall thickness, abundance of vessels, area of perforation plates and the average grouping and the type of grouping of vessels. There was also variation of wood anatomy between populations in most cell characters except for the length of wide vessels, length of fibriform vessels and wall thickness of <b>fibre-tracheids.</b> In these characters the wood anatomy of manuka was more homogeneous. The significant trends were that margins of lowland forests had wide and thick walled cells in all the cell types and also had high average group of vessels and large area of perforation plates of fibriform vessels and small area of perforation plates for wide vessels. It had short libriform fibres and <b>fibre-tracheids.</b> The swamp habitat seemed to follow margins of lowland forests except that it had the longest <b>fibre-tracheids</b> and libriform fibres and had the greatest area of perforation plates for wide vessels. Both of these habitats had the lowest density of wide vessels. Sand dune, hot thermal soils and subalpine habitats had on average the smallest vessels in terms of diameter and wall thickness and area of perforation plates, but had high abundance or density of wide vessels. Sand dune had wide and thick walled libriform fibres like margins of lowland forests. Subalpine and hot thermal soils had comparatively small fibres in all dimensions. Even though variations were established in most of the cell characters, the correlation of wood with ecology was less pronounced as compared to that found in families and genera in past research. Significant trends were manifest in diameter, wall thickness and density of wide vessels. The margins of lowland forests and swamp (more mesic habitats) had great diameter and cell wall thickness. They also had low density of cells. The other habitats, sand dune, subalpine and hot thermal soils (less mesic habitats) had comparatively narrow diameter of wide vessels, thin cell walls and high levels of wide vessels densities. It was found that the other characters such as length, width, wall thickness of fibriform vessels, libriform fibres, and <b>fibre-tracheids,</b> grouping and area of perforation plates of wide vessels showed complex and overlapping ranges between the habitats and had no significant correlation with ecology. From this research it is clear that general trends of ecological adaptation were evident and also that manuka has its own specific ecological trends...|$|R
40|$|Recent insight in the {{phylogeny}} of the Rubiaceae, mainly {{based on}} macromolecular data, agrees better with wood anatomical diversity patterns than previous subdivisions of the family. The two main types of secondary xylem {{that occur in}} Rubiaceae show general consistency in their distribution within clades. Wood anatomical characters, especially the fibre type and axial parenchyma distribution, have indeed good taxonomic value in the family. Nevertheless, the application of wood anatomical data in Rubiaceae is more useful in confirming or negating already proposed relationships rather than postulating new affinities for problematic taxa.

The genus pair gaertnera/Pagamea differs obviously from the other genera and is wood anatomically clearly distinguished by the presence of <b>fibre-tracheids</b> and parenchyma bands. Chassalia, Chazaliella, Hymenocoleus and Psychotria have rather similar wood structure, although variation in vessel diameter, vessel arrangement, ray composition and axial parenchyma occurs.

40|$|The Vanguerieae is a tribe {{consisting}} of about 500 species ordered in 27 genera. Although this tribe is mainly represented in Africa and Madagascar, Vanguerieae also occur in tropical Asia, Australia, and the isles of the Pacific Ocean. This study gives a detailed wood anatomical description of 34 species of 15 genera based on LM and SEM observations. The secondary xylem is homogeneous throughout the tribe and fits {{well into the}} Ixoroideae s. l. {{on the basis of}} <b>fibre-tracheids</b> and diffuse to diffuse-in-aggregates axial parenchyma. The Vanguerieae include numerous geofrutices that are characterised by massive woody branched or unbranched underground parts and slightly ramified unbranched aboveground twigs. The underground structures of geofrutices are not homologous; a central pith is found in three species (Fadogia schmitzii, Pygmaeothamnus zeyheri and Tapiphyllum cinerascens var. laetum), while Fadogiella stigmatoloba shows central primary xylem which is characteristic of roots. Comparison of underground versus aboveground wood shows anatomical differences in vessel diameter and in the quantity of parenchyma and fibres. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Intervascular pit {{membranes}} {{were examined}} within Ericales {{to determine the}} distribution and structure of torus-like thickenings. Methods Forty-nine species representing 12 families of the order Ericales were investigated using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. They were compared with four species of Oleaceae to determine {{the true nature of}} the thickenings. Key Results Pit membranes with torus-like thickenings were observed in seven species of Ericaceae and were found to be amorphous, plasmodesmata-associated structures with an irregular distribution. These pseudo-tori show major differences compared with true tori with respect to their distribution and ultrastructure. Genuine tori, which are strongly correlated with round pit apertures in narrow tracheary elements, were found in two species of Osmanthus (Oleaceae). Conclusions The pseudo-tori found in some Ericaceae are considered to be similar to pit membrane thickenings previously recorded in Rosaceae. While true tori appear to be functionally significant in terms of efficiency and safety of water transport, the possible function of pseudo-tori could be associated with the role of plasmodesmata during differentiation of tracheids, <b>fibre-tracheids</b> or narrow vessels...|$|R
40|$|Vestures {{are small}} {{projections}} from the secondary cell wall associated with tracheary {{elements of the}} secondary xylem. They are usually associated with bordered pits and characterize various angiosperm families, including important timber species such as Dipterocarpaceae and Eucalyptus trees. The micromorphology and distribution of vestures is studied in 22 species representing all families within the order Myrtales based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Vestures are consistently present near the outer pit aperture of bordered vessel pits, suggesting the synapomorphic character of this feature for the entire order. It is unclear in which geological period this feature originated {{in the evolution of}} the pre-Myrtalean lineages. In some species vestures are associated with inner pit apertures, inner vessel walls, simple perforation plates, depressions of the cell wall, and bordered pits of tracheids or <b>fibre-tracheids.</b> A compact network of branched vestures almost completely filling the entire pit chamber is the most common vestured pit type in Myrtales, although considerable variation may occur within a wood sample. The micromorphology of vestures seems to some extent correlated with quantitative pit characters. Understanding the exact function of vestured pits with respect to hydraulic efficiency and safety remains a challenge. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Recent micromorphological {{observations}} of angiosperm pit membranes have extended {{the number and}} range of taxa with pseudo-tori in tracheary elements. This study investigates at ultrastructural level (TEM) the development of pseudo-tori in the unrelated Malus yunnanensis, Ligustrum vulgare, Pittosporum tenuifolium, and Vaccinium myrtillus {{in order to determine}} whether these plasmodesmata associated thickenings have a similar developmental pattern across flowering plants. At early ontogenetic stages, the formation of a primary thickening was observed, resulting from swelling of the pit membrane in <b>fibre-tracheids</b> and vessel elements. Since plasmodesmata appear to be frequently, but not always, associated with these primary pit membrane thickenings, it remains unclear which ultrastructural characteristics control the formation of pseudo-tori. At a very late stage during xylem differentiation, a secondary thickening is deposited on the primary pit membrane thickening. Plasmodesmata are always associated with pseudo-tori at these final developmental stages. After autolysis, the secondary thickening becomes electron-dense and persistent, while the primary thickening turns transparent and partially or entirely dissolves. The developmental patterns observed in the species studied are similar and agree with former ontogenetic studies in Rosaceae, suggesting that pseudo-tori might be homologous features across angiosperms. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{secondary}} xylem of Craterispermeae, Coussareeae, Morindeae s. str., Prismatomerideae, Pauridiantheae, Urophylleae, and Triainolepideae (Rubiaceae, Rubioideae) is described and illustrated in detail. Genera {{that were previously}} placed in the Morindeae or Psychotrieae such as Damnacanthus, Lasianthus, Saldinia, and Trichosfachys are also included. Wood anatomical characters are compared with recent phylogenetic insights into the study group {{on the basis of}} molecular data. The observations demonstrate that the delimitation and separation of several taxa from the former Coussareeae/Morindeae/Prismatomerideae/Psychotrieae aggregate is supported by wood anatomical data. The Coussareeae can be distinguished from the other Rubioideae by their scanty parenchyma, septate libriform fibres, and the combination of uniseriate and very high multiseriate rays with sheath cells. Axial parenchyma bands and <b>fibre-tracheids</b> characterise Gynochtodes and some species of Morinda (Morindeae sstr.), but the latter genus is variable with respect to several features (e. g. vessel groupings and axial parenchyma distribution). Wood data support separation of Rennelia and Prismatomeris from Morindeae s. str.; vessels in both genera are exclusively solitary and axial parenchyma is always diffuse to diffuse-in-aggregates. Damnacanthus differs from the Morindeae alliance by the occurrence of septate fibres, absence of axial parenchyma, and the occasional presence of fibre wall thickenings. There are interesting similarities between members of the Lasianfhus clade and the Pauridiantheae/Urophyleae group such as the sporadic occurrence of spiral thickenings in axial parenchyma cells...|$|R

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail {{on the basis of}} 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their <b>fibre-tracheids,</b> the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty paratracheal to aliform parenchyma. The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p. p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest vessel members of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, uniseriate rays, and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae apotracheal parenchyma bands (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; {{on the basis of the}} inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes. The family Crypteroniaceae s. s. (Axinandra, Crypteronia and Dactylocladus) is incorporated in Melastomataceae as a separate subfamily. The scalariform inter-vessel pits, present in palaeotropical Melastomataceae only, must be interpreted as a specialization from the alternate pattern. Raphides are present in one species of Bredia, B. tuberculata. Clustered crystals are observed in the axial parenchyma and rays of Dichaetanthera. Large elongate crystals are present in the parenchyma of the strands of axially included phloem of the Memecyloideae.

40|$|International audienceThe Permian aged osmundalean fern Palaeosmunda yunnanense Tian et Chang {{has been}} re-investigated {{based on the}} {{original}} specimens and demonstrated to represent a new genus within the extinct family Guaireaceae that we name Tiania yunnanense (Tian et Chang) gen. et. comb. nov. The stem of T. yunnanense is small, c. 30 mm in diameter, and comprises an ectophloic siphonostele without leaf gaps. Pith is bilayered and consists of longitudinally elongated cells. Cortex is not differentiated into an inner parenchymatous and outer sclerenchymatous zone characteristic {{of members of the}} Osmundaceae, and possesses longitudinally elongated cells and large secretory cells. Leaf traces are numerous (> 100) and adaxially curved, with two endarch protoxylem strands upon departing the stele, increasing to more than four protoxylem strands as the trace passes the cortex, all distributed along the adaxial side of the leaf trace. Leaf traces have more-or-less incurved lateral tips, and are encircled by a vascular bundle sheath. A mass of thick-walled, longitudinally elongated cells occur in the adaxial concavity of the leaf trace. Adventitious roots arise singly from the abaxial and lateral margin of individual departing leaf traces, and extend in a sinuous manner horizontally and longitudinally. Abundant tyloses-like contents occur in cells of the cortex and represent the first account of these within fossil Osmundales, but unlike other plant groups in which they occur within xylem, <b>fibre-tracheids</b> and lactifers, in T. yunnanense they occur in longitudinally elongated cortex cells where they presumably impeded fungal hyphae growth. Radially aligned ‘secondary’ parenchyma within the stem appears to represent a wound reaction in the cortex in the living plant. Due to its siphonostele without leaf gaps, Tiania is interpreted as an evolutionary intermediate between the protostelic thamnopterids and the more advanced dictyostelic osmundaleans. Biogeographic implications of Tiania are discussed from which it is concluded that the osmundalean diversity from the Late Permian of South China is unusually high and that these plants are likely to play an increasingly important role in our understanding of the early evolutionary history and systematic relationships of the Osmundale...|$|R
40|$|This book is {{designed}} as a practical guide for the identification of fossil and extant woods {{with the aid of}} a marginally perforated card key, based on the ones devised by Clarke and perfected in the well-known Hardwood and Softwood keys published by the Princes Risborough Laboratory in 1961 and 1948 (1966) respectively. Using the cards originally prepared for Metcalfe and Chalk’s Anatomy of the Dicotyledons, the Princes Risborough cards, and numerous additions to these sets, the authors have gained considerable experience with this time-honoured identification method. A microfiche of these cards can be purchased separately from the Botanical Museum of Harvard University. Besides general chapters and appendices on for instance wood structure and variability, and how to prepare wood for microscopic examination and how to use the key cards, the main body of the book consists of a richly illustrated catalogue of diagnostic characters to be used in wood identification. It is in this section that the book shows most of its weaknesses. This is because of numerous mistakes in the choice of illustrations or misleading legends to the latter. For instance: fig. 3 c (p. 24) is said to show abrupt latewood in Larix laricina, but the earlywood-latewood transition zone is not included in the photomicrograph; on p. 68 the vessels of Nyssa are said to be predominantly in multiples of four or more but the photograph illustrates vessel pairs alternating with fibres (i. e., vessel multiples in a distinct radial pattern; the latter feature is illustrated on p. 69 with examples showing no sign of such a pattern at all!); the tangential vessel arrangement of fig. 4 b, p. 70 is in fact oblique; Myrica is incorrectly credited with ephedroid perforations on p. 73; Sphenostemon pictured with the most beautiful example of scalariform intervessel pits is said to show spiral thickenings instead (p. 74); long and slender pit canals are mistaken for plasmodesmata on p. 83; essentially similar <b>fibre-tracheids</b> in Eucryphia are classified as belonging to two fibre types (p. 87); fibres of Sleumerodendron are mistaken for vascular tracheids and crystals in the Dicotyledons are illustrated with an example from Gnetum (p. 124).

40|$|Part I: Systematic {{distribution}} of pit membrane thickenings and vesturesChapter 1 : The micromorphology of pit membranes in tracheary elements of Ericales: new records of tori or pseudo-tori?Intervascular pit membranes were examined within Ericales {{to determine the}} distribution and structure of torus-like thickenings. Forty-nine species representing 12 families of the order Ericales were investigated using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. They were compared with four species of Oleaceae to determine {{the true nature of}} the thickenings. Pit membranes with torus-like thickenings were observed in seven species of Ericaceae and were found to be amorphous, plasmodesmata associated structures with an irregular distribution. These pseudo-tori show major differences compared to true tori with respect to their distribution, ultrastructure and chemical composition. Genuine tori, which are strongly correlated with round pit apertures in narrow tracheary elements, were found in two species of Osmanthus (Oleaceae). The pseudo-tori found in some Ericaceae are considered to be similar to pit membrane thickenings previously recorded in Rosaceae. While true tori appear to be functionally significant in terms of efficiency and safety of water transport, the possible function of pseudo-tori could be associated with the role of plasmodesmata during differentiation of tracheids, <b>fibre-tracheids</b> or narrow vessels. Chapter 2 : Micromorphology and systematic {{distribution of}} pit membrane thickenings in Oleaceae: tori and pseudo-toriRecent studies on the functional significance of pit membranes in water conducting cells have renewed general interest in their micromorphology. At least two types of pit membrane thickenings have been described in angiosperm families, i. e. genuine tori and pseudo-tori. This study explores the distribution and morphology of pit membrane thickenings in 69 species and 23 genera within Oleaceae using light and electron microscopy. Torus-bearing pit membranes are confirmed for Osmanthus, and new records are reported for Chionanthus retusa, Picconia azorica, and P. excelsa, but not for the other species of Chionanthus studied. This intrageneric variation suggests that tori represent a plastic feature that has evolved more than once within the family as the result of functional adaptation to efficient and safe water transport. Pseudo-tori are observed in species of Abeliophyllum, Fontanesia, Forsythia, Jasminum, Ligustrum, Menodora, and Syringa. Based on structural differences, we state that tori and pseudo-tori can be distinguished as non-homologous features. Chapter 3 : Torus-bearing pit membranes in species of OsmanthusTorus thickenings of pit membranes are found not only in gymnosperms, but also in certain genera of eudicots. One such genus is Osmanthus. Wood from 17 species of Osmanthus was examined for tori. Fourteen species from three of the four sections investigated showed torus thickenings. Ten of the species represent new records. Only the three New Caledonian species of section Notosmanthus lacked tori. This observation in combination with other characters suggests us to separate this section from the remainder of the genus. Chapter 4 : The phylogenetic significance of vestured pits in BoraginaceaeThe bordered pit structure in tracheary elements of 105 Boraginaceae species is studied using scanning electron microscopy to examine the systematic distribution of vestured pits. Forty-three species out of 16 genera show a uniform presence of this feature throughout their secondary xylem. Most vestures are small, unbranched and associated with the outer pit aperture of bordered intervessel pits. The feature is likely to have originated independently in the distantly related subfamilies Boraginoideae (tribe Lithospermeae) and Ehretioideae. The distribution of vestures in Ehretia agrees with recent molecular phylogenies: (1) species with vestured pits characterise the Ehretia I group (incl. Rotula), and (2) species with non-vestured pits belong to the Ehretia II group (incl. Carmona). The occurrence of vestured pits in Hydrolea provides additional support for excluding this genus from Hydrophylloideae, since Hydrolea is the only genus of this subfamily with vestured pits. Functional advantages of vestured pits are suggested to promote parallel evolution of this conservative feature, although the exact hydraulic benefits of poorly developed vestures remain unknown. Part II: Development of pseudo-toriChapter 5 : The ultrastructure and development of pit membranes with plasmodesmata associated thickenings in xylem elementsRecent micromorphological observations of angiosperm pit membranes have extended the range of taxa with pseudo-tori in tracheary elements. Since developmental studies on pseudo-tori have only been conducted on Pyrus and Sorbus (Rosaceae), it is unclear whether all pseudo-tori in angiosperms develop in a similar way and whether they are homologous structures. We studied the ontogeny of pseudo-tori using transmission electron microscopy in four species belonging to four different orders of flowering plants: Malus yunnanensis, Ligustrum vulgare, Pittosporum tenuifolium, and Vaccinium myrtillus. The developmental patterns observed in these four species are similar. A primary thickening is formed when the secondary cell wall formation is initiated followed by the deposition of a secondary cap. After hydrolysis of the pit membrane, the cap becomes persistent, partially covering the pit membrane. Our observations do not fully corroborate the earlier ontogenetic studies in Rosaceae. The formation of the primary thickening in Pyrus and Sorbus is completed before the secondary cell wall formation is initiated, which is not the case in our study. This developmental difference questions the homologous nature of pseudo-tori throughout the flowering plants. Part III: Structure-function relationships of bordered pits in angiosperm vesselsChapter 6 : Wood anatomical features associated with cavitation resistance across 10 species of PrunusWood of 10 Prunus species that were hydraulically studied by Cochard et al. (2008) were examined to study structure-function trade-offs regarding vulnerability to drought-induced cavitation. A detailed study of hydraulically relevant characters is conducted using light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Vessel network characters are most important in explaining cavitation resistance (quantified as P 50 value). Strong relations are demonstrated between P 50 and vessel grouping indices (VG, VS), vessel contact characters (FC), and vessel dimension characters (DH, LV). The most drought resistant Prunus species in our study tend to show vessels that are less grouped and more solitary than the more vulnerable species. Our results support the theoretical model on vessel connectivity of Loepfe et al. (2007), but provide no evidence for Carlquists vessel grouping hypothesis. At the pit level however, we found a strong negative correlation between P 50 and the thickness of intervessel pit membranes, although this correlation was not found significant and was not supported in PCA. No other pit related character (including AP) was found to be related with P 50. This is surprising since the rare pit hypothesis, linking P 50 with AP, is was originally formulated based on observations in Rosaceae (incl. Prunus), this hypothesis could not be fully corroborated in our study. status: publishe...|$|R
