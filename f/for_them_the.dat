5|$|The Latvian city of Mitau (Jelgava) fell to Polish-Lithuanian forces {{commanded}} by Aleksander Hilary Połubiński in January 1660 and the allies were preparing {{an invasion of}} Zeeland; the outlook was {{not good for the}} Swedes.

5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was made possible by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Children with high-functioning autism {{suffer from}} more intense and {{frequent}} loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief {{that children with}} autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. <b>For</b> <b>them,</b> <b>the</b> quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E

5|$|During the Bush War, the Rhodesian Army {{augmented}} {{its ranks}} with foreign volunteers, who were accepted into regular regiments {{with the same}} pay and conditions of service as locals. Most foreign recruits enlisted in the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), which launched an overseas recruitment programme in 1974, but required successful applicants to speak good English. The Army attempted to alleviate the strain on its troops during late 1977 by recruiting French-speakers as well, and formed a designated company in the Rhodesia Regiment <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> regiment already had six independent companies, so the Francophone unit became 7 Independent Company.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{time in the}} West was brief. President Johnson, {{unhappy with}} the way Republican generals were {{governing}} the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> general who offended Johnson the most was Philip Sheridan, and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking. Although neither man {{was pleased with the}} change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|In early 1916, UB-7 and UB-8 {{were still}} {{cruising}} in the Black Sea out of Varna. The Germans {{did not have}} good luck in the Black Sea, which was not a priority <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> Bulgarians, who saw {{the value of the}} submarines in repelling Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase UB-7 and UB-8. Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there. The transfer of UB-8 to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916, but for reasons unreported in sources, UB-7 remained under the German flag.|$|E
5|$|In early October the two {{companies}} reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> companies had to cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and the country's coastal defences {{received}} little attention. The Gorges family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward Gorges taking up the post in 1610, but the castle was neglected. In 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent, as only {{four or five of}} the castle's twenty-seven guns were functional, and the fort had no ammunition or powder <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> government replaced all the brass ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.|$|E

5|$|Known as {{the castle}} by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, {{with a side}} room called the pound, where new prisoners would wait until a room was found <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> front lodge led to a {{courtyard}} known as the park. This had been divided in two by a long narrow wall, so that prisoners from the common side could not be seen by those on the master's side, who preferred not to be distressed {{by the sight of}} abject poverty, especially when they might themselves be plunged into it at any moment.|$|E
5|$|Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested {{material}} {{through the}} mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> gut is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).|$|E

5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, the Persian army rebelled and overthrew Khosrow II, {{raising his}} son Kavadh II, {{also known as}} Siroes, in his stead. Khosrow was shut in a dungeon, where he {{suffered}} for five days on bare sustenancehe {{was shot to death}} slowly with arrows on the fifth day. Kavadh immediately sent peace offers to Heraclius. Heraclius did not impose harsh terms, knowing that his own empire was also near exhaustion. Under the terms of the peace treaty, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, and most importantly <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> <b>the</b> True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.|$|E

5|$|The final {{was held}} at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which was Roma's home ground. UEFA decided that the match would still be played at the stadium, despite it being Roma's home ground.
