5|$|At Berlin, Franck {{attended}} lectures by Max Planck and Emil Warburg. On 28 July 1904 {{he saved}} {{a pair of}} children from <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> the Spree River. For his Doctor of Philosophy (Dir. Phil.) under Warburg's supervision, Warburg suggested that he study corona discharges. Franck found this topic too complex, so he changed the focus of his thesis. Entitled Über der Beweglichkeit Ladungsträger der Spitzenentladung ("On the Mobility of Ions"), it would subsequently {{be published in the}} Annalen der Physik.|$|E

5|$|Early in its duration, Hurricane Florence {{produced}} large swells {{that affected}} the East Coast of the United States. Rip currents caused three deaths due to <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> North Carolina, {{all in the}} southern portion of the state. Seven other people needed rescue, {{and at least two}} beaches were closed. Florence contributed to a locally high number of rip current-related deaths in 2000; in response, the National Weather Service office in Wilmington implemented a new rip current warning system for the summer of 2001.|$|E
5|$|Late August, 1996– Hurricane Edouard {{produces}} strong swells to the coastline, causing two {{deaths from}} <b>drowning.</b> <b>In</b> addition, one computer model predicts the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This causes Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist {{weekend of the}} year, though the order never occurs.|$|E
50|$|The festival was {{the site}} of a major stampede at the 2010 event, as well as having five rowers <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> 2008 and a single rower <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> 2009 during the boat races.|$|R

5|$|The {{survivors}} at the shingle, many facing combat for {{the first}} time, found themselves relatively well-protected from small arms fire, but still exposed to artillery and mortars. In front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from the bluffs above. Morale naturally became a problem. Many groups were leaderless and witnesses {{to the fate of}} neighboring troops and landings coming in around them. Wounded men on the beach were <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> the incoming tide and incoming landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Olivia was {{considered}} the worst hurricane to hit Mazatlán, Sinaloa since 1943, {{in addition to being}} the strongest landfalling and costliest hurricane of the 1975 Pacific hurricane season. Olivia formed on October22 to the south of Mexico, quickly intensifying into a tropical storm. The storm moved northwestward initially, followed by a northeast turn. On October23, Olivia attained hurricane status, and the next day reached Category3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale just before moving ashore Mazatlán in northwest Mexico. Olivia destroyed 7,000houses in the region, leaving 30,000people homeless, and damage totaled $20million (1975USD, $ USD). The hurricane killed 30people, 20 of them from <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> shrimp boats.|$|E

5|$|Leigh Pitt, a print {{technician}} from Surrey, {{had died}} on 7 June 2007 rescuing nine-year-old Harley Bagnall-Taylor who was <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> a canal in Thamesmead. His colleague, Jane Michele (now Jane Shaka) approached the Diocese of London {{to suggest that}} Pitt would make a suitable addition to the memorial, and despite previous opposition from the Watts Gallery to proposals to complete the memorial, on 11 June 2009 a memorial to Pitt {{was added to the}} Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, the first new tablet added to the memorial since that of Herbert Maconoghu 78years earlier. A spokesman for the Diocese of London said that the Diocese would now consider suitable names {{to be added to the}} memorial in future.|$|E

The cricketer then wed Caryl Bond, whom he had met during the 1949–50 tour of South Africa, and the pair had two sons. Loxton later divorced Bond and wed his third wife Joan Shiels. In 2000, {{one of his sons}} and his third wife died on the same day, due to a shark attack in Fiji and <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> the family swimming pool, respectively. In later life he lived alone and was still mobile despite being almost blind. Loxton died on 3 December 2011.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E
5|$|The film Dr. No was {{released}} in 1962, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and directed by Terence Young. It was the first Bond film in the Eon Productions series; Sean Connery portrayed Bond, with Joseph Wiseman as Doctor No and Ursula Andress as Honeychile Rider. Although the story follows the same general storyline, there are some changes: the film shows No to be an operative of the fictional crime organisation SPECTRE and his island fortress is nuclear-powered; No is killed not by the mountain of guano, but by <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> reactor coolant. The novel was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in May 2008. The actor Toby Stephens played Bond, while No was played by David Suchet.|$|E
5|$|The upper-level low {{associated}} with the hurricane's remnants blanketed parts of the Alps with heavy snowfall, accumulating to several feet, and subsequently fueled torrential rains in the Balkans on October24 and25. Floodwaters caused by estimated rainfall totals nearing 6in (150mm) inundated entire villages in southeastern Bulgaria, forcing hundreds to evacuate, and there were widespread disruptions of power and water services. A woman in Burgas died from <b>drowning.</b> <b>In</b> the Greek capital city of Athens, the deluge filled streets with rushing water that swept away hundreds of vehicles. More than 300buildings were inundated in the Attica area.|$|E

5|$|Waves between 5 and 13feet (1.5–4meters) were {{reported}} along the East Coast of the United States from Florida to Maryland. A weather buoy in Outer Banks, North Carolina reported swells up to 10feet (3meters). One death occurred by <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> New Jersey. A 37‑year‑old man {{was reported missing}} in New York City and presumed dead after his houseboat capsized in the heavy surf. Another houseboat also capsized, drowning a 58‑year‑old woman. On shore, a large wave swept two fishermen into the sea, where they drowned. Overall, four fatalities occurred {{in the state of}} New York. In Rhode Island two teenagers were rescued by the United States Coast Guard after being swept into the water by the waves.|$|E
5|$|Camping for {{the night}} on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are {{collecting}} firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in a mockery of Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{throughout}} the Windward Islands were substantial, but most heavily concentrated in St. Lucia. There, gusts reached 69mph (110km/h), toppling trees and power lines. Torrential rainfall up to 26.3in (668mm) created mudslides and landslides that {{damaged or destroyed}} numerous structures, bridges, and vehicles. Most of the island's plantain and banana crops were destroyed. Up to 14 people were killed. Farther west in Curaçao, Tomas led to the most prolific rain event in four decades. An elderly man was killed after suffering {{a heart attack and}} <b>drowning</b> <b>in</b> his flooded vehicle, while a rescue worker died after a hospital wall collapsed. In Haiti, already ravaged by a catastrophic 7.0 MW earthquake less than a year prior, heavy rainfall flooded a refugee camp and triggered mudslides that destroyed homes and roads. Up to 35 people were killed there, though it was feared many more could die as Tomas exacerbated an already-deadly cholera outbreak.|$|E
