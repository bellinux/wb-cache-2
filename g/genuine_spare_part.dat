40|$|The {{study was}} {{initiated}} with assessing onion production practices {{and effects of}} N: P 2 O 5 :S, fertilizer rates on yield of Onion (Allium Cepa L.) under irrigated farming system in Dembyia, District, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. The work has two components namely assessing onion production practices in Sufankara, Guramba and Debir zuria kebeles and evaluating the effects of N: P 2 O 5 :S, fertilizer rates on yield and yield components of onion in Jenda kebele. The study was conducted during 2014 / 15 under irrigation. To assess onion production practices data was collected from 30 onion producing households using semi-structured questioners, focus group discussions, data on demographic structure and the whole value chain of onion production system were recorded and analyzed using SPSS version 20. In the experimental part twelve different N: P 2 O 5 :S fertilizer rates were tested. The experiment was laid down in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Data on vegetative and yield parameters were collected and analyzed using SAS version 9. 0 computer soft ware. The survey result indicated {{that most of the}} onion producers in the study area did not implemented the recommended irrigation cultural practices of onion, Limited supply of improved onion seeds also one of the important factor that contributes to low productivities of onion in the study area. Low rates of fertilizers application, low population of onion plants per unit area, high incidence of disease and insect pests, shortage of pesticides and their adulteration characterize the onion production system under farmer’s practice. As a result the productivity of onion under farmers was low (85. 6 q/ha) compared with the national production (101 q/ha). Besides the average crop water productivity was (1. 74 kg/m 3) which were relatively low with compared to other researches on onion crop water productivity (4. 62 kg/m 3)). Although the quantity of water is similar with the requirement of onion (4, 914 m 3 /ha), but the yield obtained is low. The major constraints of onion production in the study area were shortage of irrigation water, high costs of irrigation equipments, shortage of <b>genuine</b> <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> and accessories, shortage of pesticides and their adulteration, limited supply of improved onion seeds and lack of storage facilities, lack of skills and knowledge, high incidence of diseases and insect pests and weak extension and credit services. Results of N: P 2 O 5 :S, rate trial revealed that most of growth and yield parameters of onion were significantly influenced by N: P 2 O 5 :S fertilizer rates. The highest plant height (60. 1 cm), leaf length (50. 1 cm) and maturity days (142 days) were recorded in 73. 5 : 92 : 16. 95, 136. 5 : 119. 6 : 22 and 136. 5 : 119. 6 : 22 kg ha- 1 N: P 2 O 5 : S, application rates respectively. The highest bulb weight (198. 8 g), marketable yield (20. 8 t/ha), non marketable yields (0. 509 t/ha) and total bulb yield (21. 398 t/ha) were recorded offer 105 : 119. 6 : 22 kg ha- 1 N:P 2 O 5 :S application rate. Onion plants without N: P 2 O 5 :S, fertilizer applications were inferior in all growth and yield parameters. For enhancement of production and productivity of onion in Dembyia district and other similar environment, it is necessary to solve problems indicated above through training, extension activities and improving the supply of inputs. Application of N: P 2 O 5 :S fertilizer at the rate of 105 : 119. 6 : 22 N:P 2 O 5 :S kg ha- 1 was economically feasible and thus can be recommended for the production of onion in the study area.

The review starts with an introduction to the inventory systems terminology and follows with a categorization of the inventory systems with the aim of developing <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> inventory models. Moreover, a discussion about the computations related to the (Q,r) policy is provided. An algorithm is proposed to find the optimal re-order point/lot-size and a Monte Carlo simulation is designed to evaluate the mathematical optimization solutions including the new algorithm and the other classical methods. In the second part, a literature review related to <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management is presented. The literature review is organized in such a way that in the beginning the inventory control policies are introduced.

Also <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing as a strategic method to increase the profit of the suppliers is evaluated. In the third part, to investigate the profitability of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> business, the notion of renewal cost versus the replacement cost is proposed. The replacement cost of a product is defined as the current market price of the product and the renewal cost of a product is the acquisition cost of spares to completely renew the product excluding labor costs. These costs are calculated for some products with specific characteristics, and the ratio between the renewal cost and the replacement cost as a scale to evaluate the sustainability of the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing is determined which declares that the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing is unfair. In the last part, Game Theory as a tool to find ideal decision-making in <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management taking into account the interactions among <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> manufacturers. According to definite assumptions, <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> inventory games in the form of normal, cooperative and non-cooperative, non-zero-sum, evolutionary, and competitive fringes are studied. The proposed games study the OEMs 2 ̆ 7 decision-making on <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing strategies, inventory levels, batch productions and re-manufacturing efforts. ^ The proposed strategic <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing methods as an alternative for regular pricing can factor in customers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to purchase <b>spare</b> <b>parts,</b> demand uncertainty, market uncertainty, competitiveness of the parts in the market, stability of the cooperation or competition in price setting, marginal costs of designing an agreement for cooperation, and the marginal cost of production and inventory. Furthermore it is possible to add the notion of renewal cost and the replacement cost ratio to the price sustainability description and to include it in the suggested strategic pricing formulations as a factor that affects the demand and supply curves. ...|$|R

In response, Congress provided $ 1. 1 billion in additional funding to purchase <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> According to DLA, shortages are a result of aging systems and high operational tempo, which increase the total number of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> required. The number of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> the military services ordered declined between 1996 and 2000, but the dollar value increased by 18 percent. Further, <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> purchased were drawn from 70 of 78 stock groups. Defense officials told GAO that military downsizing was the primary reason for the decline and that credit card usage and contractor maintenance support also contributed. The reasons cited for the increase were (1) DLA shifts to a mix of more expensive <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> and (2) price increases due to inaccurate initial price estimates, long periods between procurements, and substantial changes in the quantity of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> purchased. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} fleet size on a joint policy of maintenance and <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> inventory when <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> are of varying quality. We consider N identical one-component systems subject to age-based replacement, and with a single echelon periodic review spare-parts policy. The joint policy is optimised {{with regard to the}} long-run total cost per unit time, where the cost components include both replacement and inventory related costs. In particular, we are interested in the effect of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> quality {{and the size of the}} fleet on the variability in the demand for <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> Furthermore, the effects of changing lead time, different failure characteristics, and simultaneous deployment of the N systems over a finite horizon on the optimal joint policy are investigated. We develop a stochastic simulation model to investigate these effects. We find that the scale effect varies with the quality of spare parts: the poorer the quality of <b>spare</b> <b>parts,</b> the smaller the scale effect. Our approach allows the value (e. g. cost of poor quality <b>spare</b> <b>parts)</b> in <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> provisioning for maintenance to be quantified...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper was to analyse and assess the internet market of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> for agricultural machines. The research {{was carried out in}} the group of the selected servicing centres, which offer sale of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> on the web sites. Differences in the assortment of specific on-line shops and the manner of presenting information concerning sale in the Internet was analysed. Assortment offer of on-line shops is varied. Possibility of selling <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> through the Internet constitutes an asset of an enterprise. On this basis, present directions of development of the web site department and sale of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> for farm tractors in Poland were determined.
