50|$|In the {{preamble}} of the resolution, the Security Council recognised progress in developing guidelines {{to protect children}} in armed conflict, but in practice, their rights were still violated with impunity and there was lack of progress on the ground. Furthermore, it highlighted connections {{between the use of}} children and <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{recognised}} {{the importance}} of addressing {{the root causes of}} armed conflict and the important role of the United Nations. There was concern at the destabilising effect of <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking</b> and therefore it was important in raising awareness of international humanitarian law. The Council also reiterated that preventive and post-conflict measures were part of a comprehensive conflict prevention strategy.|$|E
50|$|The Council {{pledged to}} {{consider}} the protection of children in armed conflict when discussing matters with which the Council was seized, and provisions for protecting children when considering the mandates of peacekeeping operations. It supported ongoing work by Secretary-General, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and others. The importance of unimpeded access for humanitarian organisations to areas of conflict, particularly for vulnerable groups, was stressed. It would also address the impact of sanctions on children. Furthermore, the Council intended to consider connections between armed conflict and terrorism, the illegal trade in precious minerals, <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking,</b> and other criminal activities.|$|E

It is an agreement to focus particularly on [...] "the worldwide conditions that pose severe threats to the sustainable development of our people, which include: chronic hunger; malnutrition; foreign occupation; <b>armed</b> conflict; <b>illicit</b> drug problems; organized crime; corruption; natural disasters; <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> trafficking; <b>trafficking</b> in persons; terrorism; intolerance and incitement to racial, ethnic, religious and other hatreds; xenophobia; and endemic, communicable and chronic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis."

5000|$|Although {{at times}} deadlocked, {{negotiations}} communicated via memorandums continued on {{a quid pro}} quo basis in which the British had the advantage; if the Ottomans were to accept Kuwait’s autonomous status and proposed boundaries, the British would have to accept Ottoman suzerainty, and in return, the northern islands of Warba and Bubiyan must be allocated to Kuwait, and so forth. [...] The waning influence of Istanbul in the Gulf forced it to make concessions without much to gain in return. The Ottoman Empire had faced a number of setbacks in the last few decades—a few of its provinces achieved independence, some were annexed by other countries, or many lost in conflict—and for internal political reasons it may have seemed important to maintain Kuwait as part of the empire, even if only symbolically. The Ottomans also felt that making this agreement would ensure British support on other more pressing issues, such as dealing with invasion by other European powers and conflicts {{in other parts of the}} Ottoman Empire. Furthermore, British pressures led the Ottomans to abandon the proposed extension of the railway line to Kuwait and instead opt for a Basra terminus. Plans for a Basra terminus created a new series of demands on behalf of the British, including the Ottoman renunciation of Qatar, and delineating its role in the wider Persian Gulf waters. Britain had wanted to conclude agreements with Sheikh of Qatar Jasim al-Thani about <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> <b>traffic</b> and maritime peace, and also sought to formally establish its dominance in the Gulf. By May 6, 1913 Britain and the Ottoman Empire initialed the compromise and the Anglo-Ottoman Convention was signed on July 29, 1913, two years exact from the first memorandum.|$|R
40|$|Organized {{crime is}} often {{conceptualized}} {{as a business}} enterprise formed by actors motivated by profits. The Balkans represents an ideal case for testing {{the extent to which}} assumptions about the image of actors involved in illegal arms trading can be extrapolated to the macro-level of analysis. Focusing mainly on public discourse, this paper points to several thematic categories of <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> trafficking: i) profit-oriented <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking</b> involving organized crime groups ii) <b>trafficking</b> of <b>arms</b> for the purpose of arming criminal-terrorist formations and iii) state-sponsored illegal <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Although economic incentives appear strong in many cases, other cultural, social and political issues also frame the <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> market in the region. We argue that both understanding and policing organized crime should also embrace the non-economic nature of this type of criminal behavior...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses U. S. efforts to combat <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking</b> to Mexico, {{is based on a}} GAO report, GAO- 09 - 709, that we are releasing today. In recent years, violence along the U. S. -Mexico border has escalated dramatically as the administration of President Felipe Calderon has sought to combat the growing power of Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTO) and curb their ability to operate with impunity in certain areas of Mexico. As illicitly trafficked firearms have fueled the drug trafficking violence, Mexican officials have come to regard illicit firearms as the number one crime problem affecting the country's security. According to the Department of Justice's (DOJ) 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment, Mexican DTOs represent the greatest organized crime threat to the United States, controlling drug distribution in many U. S. cities, and gaining strength in markets they do not yet control. In particular, law enforcement reporting indicates Mexican DTOs maintain drug distribution networks or supply drugs to distributors in at least 230 U. S. cities. (3) challenges faced by U. S. agencies collaborating with Mexican authorities to combat the problem of illicit arms; and (4) the U. S. government's strategy for addressing the issue. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{difficult}} {{transition to}} a new paradigm of Democratic Security and the subsequent process of military restructuring during the nineties led El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua to re-consider their old structures and functions of their armed forces and police agencies. This study compares the institutions in the four countries mentioned above to assess their current condition and response capacity {{in view of the}} contemporary security challenges in Central America. This report reveals that the original intention of limiting armies to defend and protect borders has been threatened by the increasing participation of armies in public security. While the strength of armies has been consolidated in terms of numbers, air and naval forces have failed to become strengthened or sufficiently developed to effectively combat organized crime and drug trafficking and are barely able to conduct air and sea operations. Honduras has been the only country that has maintained a proportional distribution of its armed forces. However, security has been {{in the hands of a}} Judicial Police, supervised by the Public Ministry. The Honduran Judicial Police has been limited to exercising preventive police duties, prohibited from carrying out criminal investigations. Nicaragua, meanwhile, possesses a successful police force, socially recognized for maintaining satisfactory levels of security surpassing the Guatemalan and El Salvadoran police, which have not achieved similar results despite of having set up a civilian police force separate from the military. El Salvador meanwhile, has excelled in promoting a Police Academy and career professional education, even while not having military attachés in other countries. Regarding budgetary issues, the four countries allocate almost twice the amount of funding on their security budgets in comparison to what is allocated to their defense budgets. However, spending in both areas is low when taking into account each country 2 ̆ 7 s GDP as well as their high crime rates. Regional security challenges must be accompanied by a professionalization of the regional armies focused on protecting and defending borders. Therefore, strong institutional frameworks to support the fight against crime and drug trafficking are required. It will require the strengthening of customs, greater control of <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking,</b> investment in education initiatives, creating employment opportunities and facilitating significant improvements in the judicial system, as well as its accessibility to the average citizen...|$|E
40|$|This paper assesses countries'' {{compliance}} with the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) international standard during the period 2004 to 2011. We find that overall compliance is low; there is an adverse impact on financial transparency created by the cumulative effects of poor implementation of standards on customer identification; and the current measurements of compliance do {{not take into account}} an analysis of ML/FT risk, thereby undermining their credibility and the relevance of some of the policy recommendations taken on their basis. Moreover, we also examine the key role of some cultural, institutional, and financial factors in boosting countries'' compliance using econometric analysis.

40|$|While Special Operations Forces are {{commonly}} {{identified with the}} pursuit of foreign policy, {{they may also be}} used within the domestic security infrastructure. Given the long-practiced use of the military in developing countries in internal security roles (inclusive of Jamaica), and given the rise to prominence of transnational threats over traditional threats in Jamaica, a need has arisen for an evolution in the military to adequately meet these new unconventional threats. Such a capability may be embodied in a SOF properly selected, trained, equipped and organized to mitigate these irregular threats such as terrorism, <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> and narcotics <b>trafficking,</b> and organized crime which currently face Jamaica. This study examines the value, utility, and possible roles of such a unit in the Jamaican security landscape, and makes recommendations for the establishment and employment of such a unit in Jamaica...|$|R

40|$|Small {{arms and}} light weapons {{are the primary}} cause of death in the violent {{conflicts}} raging today, but the small arms trade is difficult to track, and the illicit trade in small arms is doubly so. Nevertheless, information is available and research institutes like the Small Arms Survey and the Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers are at the forefront of efforts to collect and distribute this information. This paper focuses on the <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> trade and draws on a database I am developing, the <b>Illicit</b> <b>Arms</b> Transfer Database, which systematizes information contained in journalistic reports on <b>illicit</b> small <b>arms</b> transfers. This and previous studies, which employ some basic tools of social network analysis (SNA), reveal high profile positions occupied by former Soviet bloc countries in the <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> trade network.

40|$|The {{provision}} of arms {{for the commission}} of crimes {{is one of the}} typical forms of aiding and abetting. This article discusses <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking</b> as a form of aiding and abetting the commission of core crimes.

Furthermore, the article also analyses the regulation of legal <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking</b> in international and European law. Accordingly, the international criminal law further regulates illegal <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking</b> as an international crime and as complicity to core crimes. Therefore, the article first presents <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking</b> as an international crime and subsequently discusses <b>arms</b> <b>trafficking</b> as complicity in core crimes.
