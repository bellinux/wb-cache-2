5000|$|In {{his second}} study of progenitor-derivative pairs of species, Gottlieb {{looked at the}} {{putative}} progenitor diploid Clarkia rubicunda and its hypothesized derivative, diploid C. franciscana. In 1958 Lews and Raven hypothesized that C. franciscana, which was highly self-pollinating and geographically limited, {{was derived from the}} outcrossing and more widespread C. rubicunda by large chromosomal structural rearrangements. Lewis and Raven hypothesized that C. franciscana had rapidly speciated from C. rubicunda by a mechanism Harlan Lewis called [...] "catastrophic selection." [...] As with Stephanomeria, Gottlieb hypothesized that if C. franciscana was a derived species by [...] "rapid speciation," [...] then the derived species should have a genetic compliment that is similar to its progenitor, [...] "i.e., possess few novel alleles." [...] In fact, Gottlieb found that C. franciscana was genetically distinct from C. rubicunda; it did not, as expected, have a subset of the genes found in C. rubicunda. A subsequent analysis published in 1992 on another population of C. franciscana, unknown to Gottlieb 20 years earlier, led to similar conclusions. [...] Importantly Gottlieb ended his 1973 study of C. franciscana by stating: [...] "To strengthen phylogenetic analyses of rapid speciation, the criterion is proposed that a species accepted as having had a rapid and recent origin by chromosomal reorganization be substantially similar to its progenitor upon electrophoretic examination." [...] In this context Gottlieb equated [...] "electrophoretic examination" [...] with <b>genetic</b> <b>examination</b> by the use of isozymes. And, using this criterion, Gottlieb was not able to conclude that C. franciscana was derived from its putative progenitor C. rubicunda, as hypothesized by Lewis and Raven in 1958.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. We {{present the}} {{extremely}} rare {{case of a}} patient with three metachronous osteosarcomas within 22 years without evident pulmonary manifestation of disease 30 years after first diagnosis. Case Presentation. In 1983, a high-grade osteosarcoma of the left distal femur was diagnosed in an 18 -year-old Caucasian male. He received rotationplasty accompanied by pre- and postoperative chemotherapy. Ten years later, an osteoblastic osteosarcoma occurred in TH 12. En bloc resection and pre- and postoperative chemotherapy followed. In 2005, the patient developed another high-grade osteosarcoma in his right distal femur. Treatment included a wide resection and reconstruction with a tumour endoprosthesis as well as (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy. After the third tumour occurrence, cytogenetic and molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>examinations</b> (p 53, rb 1) were performed, showing a normal genetic pattern. Screening for metastases never showed clinical evidence of extraskeletal tumour manifestation. Discussion.

40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis I considered Ethic {{aspects of}} prenatal diagnostics. I {{focused on the}} existing care for pregnant women {{in the field of}} prenatal diagnostics. I focused on <b>genetic</b> <b>examination</b> of the fetus, which these women undergo nowadays. The theoretical part illustrates different views of prenatal diagnostics. It contains also a definition of basic conceptions and a description of genetic examinations and the most frequent genetic defects. The aim of my thesis is to identify views of some pregnant women on prenatal diagnostics and to determine to how much they were informed about the examinations they had passed. Another aim was to state, who and in what way informed them about results of the examination and if the pregnant women have got enough time for a thoughtful decision and a possible discussion with the doctor. In order to achieve the defined aims I used the qualitative research, method of an enquiry and techniques of a semi-structured interview. The interviews were made with randomly selected respondents at the age category of 27 years and older, which underwent genetic examinations during their pregnancy. The research showed that interviewed pregnant women wish to undergo the <b>genetic</b> <b>examination,</b> {{because they want to be}} sure that their baby will be born healthy. Next, I found that some pregnant women were not informed enough and the results of the genetic tests were communicated by telephone, by post or directly by their gynecologist. The women were allowed to discuss with a doctor but in most cases, although they signed an informed patientÂ´s approval with the examination, they had not got enough time for a thoughtful decision if they should have undergone the examination. Based of this information, doctors and health workers should change their access to the pregnant women. An individual approach to each pregnant woman would ensure a real understanding of both positive and negative aspects of the <b>genetic</b> <b>examination.</b> An individual approach would enable the pregnant women to think over, if they will undergo the examination or not. This change would help to remove a persisting paternalistic approach in the health service. The results of my research can serve as a basis for a further research of the current care for pregnant women...|$|E

40|$|The thesis evaluates {{theoretical}} and practical possibilities of laboratory examinations of the male infertility factor in a center of assised reproduction. Besides urological and <b>genetic</b> <b>examinations</b> the author tried to introduce, verify and evaluate {{the contribution of the}} hormonal profile of subfertile men. The spectrum of examinations in the andrological laboratory was enlarged by examination of biochemical parameters of seminal plasma and by microbiological examination. Among the biochemical parameters of seminal plasma, the highest importance (p= 0, 05) is to be seen in the examination of alpha-glucosidase, reflecting the function of epididymis. Together with the determination of fructose, a marker of seminal vesicles function, these examinations help to precise the diagnosis of obstructive azoospermia. Microbiological tests confirmed a negative influence of sperm infection by pathogens on the result of a therapeutic cycle of in vitro fertilization and embryotransfer and on the fertility of men. The question of the role of chlamydia infection in male infertility remains, in spite of developed diagnostic possibilities, solved only in part.

40|$|Objective: The cytological {{features}} of conventional monophasic spindle cell and biphasic synovial sarcoma have been defined {{in detail in}} several large series. The cytology of rare morphological variants, especially the subtypes of poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma, are insufficiently evaluated and diagnostically difficult to define. The objective {{of the present study}} was to call attention to the variable cytology of rare variants of synovial sarcoma. Furthermore, adjunctive diagnostic methods, necessary for a correct diagnosis, are discussed. Methods: Aspirates from four synovial sarcomas, with cytological features, which differed from those of conventional synovial sarcoma and from each other, were retrieved from our files and re-evaluated. Results: In three of the cases a correct diagnosis was not obtained from routinely stained aspirates. In the fourth case, the correct diagnosis was established by a combination of cytomorphology, immunocytochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed on the aspirated material. Conclusion: Ancillary diagnostic methods are necessary in the examination of aspiration smears from synovial sarcoma, especially of morphological variants with a cytomorphology that differs from conventional spindle-cell monophasic and biphasic tumours.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study using data from 285 community dwelling elderly women who underwent physical, biochemical, and <b>genetic</b> <b>examinations.</b> ResultsGenotype-unadjusted analysis revealed that the risk of glucose intolerance and diabetes in elderly women with elevated BMI was 1. 71 and 2. 82 times higher, respectively, whereas age and conicity index did not show predictive value. Prevalence ratios for glucose intolerance and diabetes across allelic variants of IL- 6 and TNF-Î± did not associate IL- 6 with unbalanced glucose levels, despite adjustment for BMI, age, and conicity index. Conversely, carriers of the TNF-Î± A allele were 2. 06 and 5. 58 times more likely to exhibit glucose intolerance and diabetes, respectively, compared to GG homozygotes. ConclusionOur results suggest that bearing the A allele of the - 308 G > A polymorphism of TNF-Î± predisposes to anthropometric measure-sensitive impaired glucose metabolism in older women...|$|R
