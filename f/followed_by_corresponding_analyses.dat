40|$|For both {{fundamental}} and technological reasons, {{there is strong}} desire to understand the overall behavior of complex macromolecular and biological soft-matter systems. From theoretical point of view, this task is highly nontrivial since processes in these systems occur {{over a wide range}} of length and time scales, while current modeling and analytical techniques are feasible over relatively limited scales only. To fill this gap, one has to develop ways to link different methods, an idea which has lead to concepts known as multiscale modeling and coarse-graining. The idea of multiscale modeling gives rise to the fundamental problem that there is no unique way to perform coarse-graining. We employ a method that allows us to perform controlled spatial coarse-graining <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>corresponding</b> temporal coarsegraining in a systematic well-defined fashion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of “learning-by-producing” on inventive {{activity}} and shows that, in both emerging (electrical equipment and supplies) and maturing (shoes and textiles) industries, the geographic association between invention andproduction was rather weak during the Second Industrial Revolution.

Instead, this paper finds that the geographic location of inventive activity tended to mirror the geographic distribution of individuals with advanced technical skills appropriate to the particular industry in question. Even in the craft-based shoe industry, much of the invention came from those with the advanced technical skills. The findings suggest that scholars have over-emphasized the importance of learningby-producing in accounting for the geographic differences in inventive activity, and underestimated the significance of technical skills or human capital amongst the population. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{paper is}} devoted to code {{optimization}} techniques with respect to various criteria. Code optimization is well studied for compiled languages; however, interpreted languages can also benefit when using optimization approaches. We provide {{a work in progress}} of how the code optimization can be effectively performed for the applications developed with the use of interpreted languages. Methods and techniques proposed in the paper rely on the use of formal models, and in particular state models. We propose some code optimization based on two different state models, namely weighted tree automata, and extended finite automata. The problem of extraction of such models is known to be hard, and in both cases we provide some recommendations of how such models can be derived for a code in an interpreted language.
