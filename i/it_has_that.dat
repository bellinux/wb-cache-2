5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E

500|$|Though {{critics have}} pointed out the song's {{similarities}} {{to some of the}} hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News that he did not intend to write anything mimicking by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, it came to him out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. [...] "I don't think it initially tried to sound like anybody else, but I picked up the guitar and just started playing ," [...] Mars explained. [...] "That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, and I started singing that, and I was up there in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get...". John Marx, a partner in the music division at William Morris Endeavor (WME), who was responsible for managing the Moonshine Jungle Tour said [...] "it's the type of song that really motivates people to purchase a ticket. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> live element to it; it was a very active track".|$|E

[...] But what finally emerges is often subtly different, with a flavour of its own. [...] Above all, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> ultra-Verdian quality of gathering momentum as it proceeds." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{government}} {{authority or}} private service provider may acquire an implied easement over private land {{by virtue of}} the public service it performs. [...] For example, a local authority may have the responsibility of installing and maintaining the sewerage system in an urban area. [...] Merely by the fact that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> responsibility, usually enshrined in some statute or local laws, may give the authority the right, by virtue of an implied easement, to enter private property to carry out installation and maintenance. [...] The location of the easement will not usually be described precisely, but its general position will be defined by the service route (i.e. the sewer pipes in this example). [...] Power and water lines may also have implied easements linked to them, but drainage and stormwater systems are commonly precisely defined in location and recorded in the title documents for private land.|$|E

Damon Caro, the stunt coordinator and fight choreographer from 300 and Watchmen, Snyder's previous films, was hired for the action design, stunt training and fight choreography for the movie. The other cast members started training without Hudgens while she was involved with other projects, including Beastly. Abbie Cornish said {{that the rest of}} the cast were training six hours a day, five days a week in martial arts, swords and empty hand choreography. Jena Malone has stated that her daily routine comprised four hours of warmups and mixed martial arts wushu training, then three hours of weight training, then firearms training and tactical positioning, and then pole-dancing lessons. Snyder said that when the girls are fighting, [...] " [...] they're on their way to kill a baby dragon, they've killed all of these orc-like creatures and they're entering a door [...] it's this classic, real Navy SEAL style room clearing. They have machine guns but they're fighting mythic creatures, impossible creatures. The hand to hand stuff is all brutal, because Damon [...] did all the [...] in Bourne and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> vibe to it."
