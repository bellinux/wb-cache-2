5|$|Ayesha Takia as Meera, {{the other}} protagonist. Coming from an {{orthodox}} Rajput family, {{she has to}} descend into a life <b>devoid</b> of joy.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{locations}} in the Solomon Creek watershed where mine drainage is discharged. Ten miles (sixteen kilometers) of the streams on the creek's watershed are rendered <b>devoid</b> of life by mine drainage.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} have {{a moderately}} flared, posteriorly protruding outer lip, which is considerably thickened and completely <b>devoid</b> of marginal spikes or plicae. The body whorl is roundly swollen at the shoulder, {{with a few}} anterior spiral grooves. The shell has a medium-to-high cone-shaped spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.|$|E
5|$|Busch biographer Joseph Kraus divided {{his work}} into three periods. He points out, however, that this {{classification}} is a simplification, as some works by their nature {{can be of}} a later or earlier period. All three periods show Busch's obsession with German middle class life. His peasants are <b>devoid</b> of sensitivity and village life {{is marked by a}} vivid lack of sentiment.|$|E
5|$|Curse of Enchantia was Core Design's {{first attempt}} in the {{adventure}} genre as {{they set up}} to compete with LucasArts and Sierra On-Line. The game features several highly unconventional and controversial game mechanics and design choices for an adventure title from that era, including having many simple action game style sequences and being practically <b>devoid</b> of in-game text and conversations.|$|E
5|$|On an {{international}} airline flight, an African man enters the bathroom, {{where he is}} attacked by a man exhibiting albino traits. The attacker leaves the bathroom with his normal black skin tone. Before the plane lands in the United States, a flight attendant discovers the victim in the bathroom, <b>devoid</b> of his skin pigmentation.|$|E
5|$|Puyoda (water of pus): Shudras (workmen-caste) {{and husbands}} or sexual {{partners}} of lowly women and prostitutes – who live like animals <b>devoid</b> of cleanliness and good behaviour – fall in Puyoda, the ocean of pus, excreta, urine, mucus, saliva and other repugnant things. Here, {{they are forced}} to eat these disgusting things.|$|E
5|$|Solomon Creek was <b>devoid</b> {{of fish in}} the 1970s. However, {{since then}} several fish species, {{including}} brook trout, have inhabited the creek and its tributaries. A number of varieties of aquatic insects are also present.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 NFL Draft was {{considered}} to be the worst draft class in many years, with only eight high-quality prospects, as compared to the normal 27 or 28. The popularity of the wishbone offense among college teams left the draft <b>devoid</b> of quarterback prospects. A drawing held the previous December gave the Buccaneers the rights to the first overall selection.|$|E
5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Nanticoke Creek is {{designated as a}} Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In the 1970s, the Operation Scarlift report for the creek noted that the creek was almost entirely <b>devoid</b> of aquatic life due to low water quality. However, the creek had potential for fish life.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermediate}} inclinations 60° < i < 140° are <b>devoid</b> {{of known}} moons {{due to the}} Kozai instability. In this instability region, solar perturbations at apoapse cause the moons to acquire large eccentricities that lead to collisions with inner satellites or ejection. The lifetime of moons in the instability region is from 10 million to a billion years.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{have been}} <b>devoid</b> of {{permanent}} residents since the automation of Flannan Isles Lighthouse in 1971. They are {{the location of}} an enduring mystery that occurred in December 1900, when all three lighthouse keepers vanished without trace.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle and}} upper reaches of Tangascootack Creek are nearly <b>devoid</b> of life due to acid mine drainage. However, the {{headwaters}} have some aquatic life, as they are further upstream. Brook trout and three other species of fish inhabit the creek. 13 species of benthic macroinvertebrate also inhabit it.|$|E
5|$|The top of Nescopeck Mountain was <b>devoid</b> {{of trees}} {{by the middle}} of the 1800s. Logging has been done on the ridge in the early 2000s and plans have been made to {{construct}} communication towers on the ridge. Local produce is sometimes traded over Nescopeck Mountain. The mountain is almost completely undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|A katipo bite {{produces}} the toxic syndrome latrodectism; symptoms include extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an antivenom is available, and no deaths {{have been reported}} since 1901. The katipo is particularly notable in New Zealand as the nation is almost entirely <b>devoid</b> of dangerous native wildlife; this unique status means the spider is well known, despite being rarely seen.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} {{in the years following}} the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was <b>devoid</b> of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria gallica may {{itself be}} parasitized by other soil flora. Several {{species of the}} fungus Trichoderma, {{including}} Trichoderma polysporum, T.harzianum and T.viride, are able to attack and penetrate and the outer tissue of A.gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become <b>devoid</b> of living hyphae about {{one week after the}} initial infection. Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A.gallica. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the E.abortivum hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.|$|E
5|$|As {{an example}} of Curcubita, raw summer squash is 94% water, 3% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with {{negligible}} fat content (table). In 100 grams, raw squash supplies 16 calories and is rich in vitamin C (20% of the Daily Value, DV), moderate in vitamin B6 and riboflavin (12–17% DV), but otherwise <b>devoid</b> of appreciable nutrient content (table), although the nutrient content of different Curcubita species may vary somewhat.|$|E
5|$|As {{regards the}} first question, in Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the Singapore High Court adopted four {{conditions}} {{set out in}} De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) {{to determine whether a}} legitimate expectation has been created. The public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and <b>devoid</b> of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models <b>devoid</b> of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became <b>devoid</b> of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather <b>devoid</b> of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí perfected his {{personal}} style, {{inspired by the}} organic shapes of nature, putting into practise {{a whole series of}} new structural solutions originating from his deep analysis of ruled geometry. To this he added a great creative freedom and an imaginative ornamental style. His works acquired a great structural richness, with shapes and volumes <b>devoid</b> of rational rigidity or any classic premise.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the sack}} of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the office's {{continuity}} was broken, {{and when it}} reappears in {{the sources of the}} Palaiologan period, it had lost any judicial functions and resembled more its original military character: according to the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the Grand Droungarios of the Watch was a subordinate of the Grand Domestic, charged with the night watch and with supervising the army's scouts. In reality, however, it had become more of a sinecure and was essentially a court dignity <b>devoid</b> of any but ceremonial duties.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bonnie was a {{long-lived}} {{storm in}} the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{was the third}} tropical storm (including the April subtropical storm) and second hurricane of the 1992 season. Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17. <b>Devoid</b> of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan, it was nearly stationary for over {{a week in the}} central Atlantic Ocean. On September 27, it began to slowly track east and northeast towards the Azores. Just before becoming extratropical, it affected the Azores on September 30, although no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are <b>devoid</b> of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.|$|E
5|$|In mass, {{the spores}} are whitish. The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, <b>devoid</b> of oil {{droplets}} (eguttulate), and have dimensions of 13–18 by 7–9µm. They are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro {{in the absence}} of external stimuli. The asci are 190–225 by 9–10µm. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, unbranched, and have irregular orange-brown granules, with tips up to 5µm wide, and are not forked or lobed. The hypothecium, the layer of cells below the hymenium, is made of densely packed, small irregular cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains. Although in 1977 Khlebnikov suggested {{it was due to}} an epidemic, it was difficult to ascertain if such a large territory had been affected all at once. By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that had high alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became <b>devoid</b> of the species, due to its low reproductive rate and the insular nature of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The end result of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is <b>devoid</b> of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Maiden {{described}} variety lucida in 1902, and Bailey described variety glabrescens in 1913. Both had diagnosed their varieties on {{the basis}} of their hairlessness. Maiden described a taxon totally <b>devoid</b> of hair, while Bailey described his as nearly glabrous (hairless). As Bailey's description more closely matched Dixon's findings (that these variants were only partly and not completely hairless), Dixon retained Bailey's name and reclassified it as Ficus rubiginosa forma glabrescens in 2001 as it differed only in the lack of hairs on new growth from the nominate form.|$|E
5|$|Later on August 11, {{the center}} of Etau became {{partially}} <b>devoid</b> of convection, with only a narrow band of shower and thunderstorm activity persisting to the southeast of the center. Increasing wind shear prevented convection from redeveloping and the storm continued to weaken. Early the following day, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Etau as they reported it had weakened to a tropical depression well {{to the east of}} Japan. Roughly 24hours later, the JMA also downgraded the system to a tropical depression. The final advisory on Etau was issued by the JMA early on August14 as it slowly tracked northward.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} {{attaining}} its peak intensity, Zeke began to weaken once more due to increasing westerly wind shear. By {{the early morning}} of October30, the center of circulation became <b>devoid</b> of thunderstorm activity and the system had turned eastward. Later that day, Zeke weakened to a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low pressure system. The NHC continued to monitor the low-level swirl of clouds associated with Zeke for several more days as the system meandered several hundred miles south of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|One Velociratoptor mongoliensis skull bears two {{parallel}} rows of small punctures that match the spacing {{and size of}} Velociraptor teeth. Scientists believe that the wound was likely inflicted by another Velociraptor during a fight. Further, because the fossil bone {{shows no sign of}} healing near the bite wounds, the injury probably killed it. Another specimen, found with the bones of an azhdarchid pterosaur within its stomach cavity, was carrying or recovering from an injury sustained to its ribs. From evidence on the pterosaur bones, which were <b>devoid</b> of pitting or deformations from digestion, the Velociraptor died shortly after, possibly from the earlier injury.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be <b>devoid</b> of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Political Economy, {{the first}} edition {{published}} in 1883, {{was one of the}} most widely used textbooks of the 19th century as a component of the American Science Series. Robert Solow criticized the third edition (1888) for being <b>devoid</b> of facts, figures, and mostly full of off-the-cuff judgments on the practices and capacities of Native Americans and immigrants, but generally embodying the state of the art of economics at the time.|$|E
5|$|Rosebery's {{own mother}} was horrified {{at the thought}} of a Jewish woman, even a Rothschild, in the family. Rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith; at this time, it was inconceivable that any {{children}} could be reared as Jews. Although it has been stated that Rosebery himself was <b>devoid</b> of any antisemitic views, this was not always true, especially in later life.|$|E
