500|$|Several critics {{interpreted}} the song's lyrics during their reviews. Its theme was noted {{to be about}} freedom.

[...] Kerrang! writer Steve Beebee wrote that Lee reaches a conclusion that [...] "Love will guide you home." [...] Talking about the lyrical content of the song, Laurie Tuffrey of NME opined: [...] "It's quite hard to tell what the song's about, with lots of references to 'the unknown' and 'the pain', and it confusingly switches between suggesting people 'do what you want you want, if you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> for better' in the first verse and the decidedly creepier final chorus where Lee seemingly gets an ex-lover on the blower, only to tell them 'Hello, hello, it’s only me, infecting everything you love'." ...|$|E

[...] He added that Taylor's [...] "attitude during the last 48 hours—as far as my small head is concerned—has been beyond imagination". Justifying the removal of the HNC, Khánh said they were [...] "exploited by counter-revolutionary elements who placed partisan considerations above the homeland's sacred interest."

500|$|... "What You Want" [...] {{opens with}} rapid drums and soon moves into a guitar-driven mode, {{accompanied}} by synthesizers. Throughout the song, Lee uses [...] "pseudo operatic" [...] and [...] "poppy" [...] vocals. In the opening lines, she sings: [...] "Do what you, {{what you want}} / If you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> for better / Do what you, what you want / 'Til you don't want it anymore." [...] Those sounds are followed by a hard rock surging guitar and strings which were noted {{to be part of}} the band's characteristic sound. The chorus is instrumentally complete with crashing cymbals, [...] "thrashing, high-wired rawk" [...] guitars, electric guitars, keyboards and piano as Lee sings, [...] "Hello, hello, remember me? I’m everything you can’t control / Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe we can break through." [...] At the end of the song, Lee shouts the hook [...] "Do what you, what you want," [...] as her vocals are echoed and eventually fade away. Laurie Tuffrey of NME summarized the song as a [...] "standard goth-pop fare, full of rapid drum breaks, swathes of fuzzy riffing and a catchy, chant-friendly chorus."

500|$|Lee shares writing credits {{with other}} members of the band on 11 of the standard-edition album's 12 songs.

Opening with drums and a synchronized synthesizer, Lee sings [...] "Do what you, what you want / If you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> for better / Do what you, what you want / 'Til you don't want it anymore" [...] before the song's rhythmic, guitar-driven beat. Lyrically, the song explores a relationship which is not working out, despite present love. [...] "Made of Stone", one of the album's oldest songs, has heavy-metal influences. [...] "The Change" [...] (originally entitled [...] "Purple"), which begins gently and grows more insistent, has been compared to [...] "Digital Bath" [...] by the American alternative metal band Deftones.

[...] Although Fatboy is in love with Mercy, he does not believe that Mercy sees him as more than a friend and may call off the wedding if he tells her. He does not think of the consequences, such as imprisonment. Norwood revealed that Fatboy has known Mercy since they were nine years old and he had feelings for her when EastEnders: E20 started, as he was upset when she got pregnant by someone else. He said that Fatboy would be heartbroken when Mercy leaves. Norwood told Inside Soap that the wedding creates more problems for the characters, rather than solving all their problems. The fact that they try so hard to prove they are genuine makes it [...] "very hard for them to be friends." [...] The wedding episode sees Fatboy <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> come true, {{but at the same time}} it is a nightmare for him. Knowing the wedding is a sham he is [...] "waiting for that monster to appear". Ashley turns up and is annoyed that Fatboy has kept the wedding a secret, and of this, Norwood stated: [...] "When [...] finds out what has happened he is pretty shocked. He tries to make Fatboy see the consequences of his actions, but Fatboy doesn't want to hear it—his dad has already betrayed him when it comes to Mercy." [...] Mercy is shocked to learn that Fatboy did not tell her that Ashley reported her. Although Norwood concluded that Fatboy [...] "will go to the ends of the earth to make this marriage work".|$|E
