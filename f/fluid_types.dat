50|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} utilized {{for the analysis}} of biological samples since the 1980s, and can be used as an effective technique for the identification and quantification of both known and unknown metabolites. For details on the principles of this technique, see NMR spectroscopy. In pharmacometabolomics analyses, NMR is advantageous because minimal sample preparation is required. Isolated patient samples typically include blood or urine due to their minimally-invasive acquisition, however, other <b>fluid</b> <b>types</b> and solid tissue samples have also been studied with this approach. Due to the minimal preparation of samples before analysis, samples can be completely recovered following NMR analysis. This permits samples to be repeatedly processed with extremely high levels of reproducibility, as well as maintaining precious patient samples for alternative analysis. The high reproducibility and precision of NMR, coupled with relatively fast processing time (greater than 100 samples per day), makes this process a relatively high-throughput form of sample analysis. One disadvantage of this technique is the relatively poor metabolite detection sensitivity compared to MS-based analysis, leading to a requirement for greater initial sample volume. Furthermore, the initial instrument costs are extremely high, for both NMR and MS equipment.|$|E

30|$|In the Niger Delta basin, {{the search}} for more {{hydrocarbons}} has, with time, shifted from onshore to near shelf and now to the deep water. Although, {{it is believed that}} the high cost of operations in deep water environments, followed by inability to characterize lithofacies and predict <b>fluid</b> <b>types</b> accurately across the basin depobelts are few major factors to contend with. Generally, the prediction of lithofacies and fluid type have over the years pose great challenge to reservoir geologists and geophysicists working on the old producing fields (discovered in the late 1950 s with oil production from 1961) in onshore Niger Delta basin. Although, recent advances in seismic technology have led to development of methods such as Poisson impedance (PI) inversion, lambda–mu–rho inversion, elastic impedance inversion, EI and rock physics template modelling, and RPT to help characterize lithofacies and predict <b>fluid</b> <b>types</b> (Coulon et al. 2006; Singh et al. 2007; Ekwe et al. 2012; Tian et al. 2010; Sharma and Chopra 2013; Farfour et al. 2015; Tucovic et al. 2016). Advances on the use of prestack migrated seismic (PreSTM) data have tremendously helped in characterizing lithofacies and predicting reservoir properties with minimum error thereby reducing the numbers of dry wells and drilling risks in some basins of the world (Ma 2002; Russell 2014). Characterizing lithofacies and predicting <b>fluid</b> <b>types</b> from the Niger Delta basin using prestack migrated seismic data and well logs requires great skill and better understanding of seismic inversion techniques. Numerous studies have been conducted on the use of different seismic inversion types to characterize lithology and predict <b>fluid</b> <b>types</b> in Niger Delta basin. Most of the studies focused on the use of simultaneous, deterministic and geostatistical inversion to construct reliable earth and petrophysical models (Omodu et al. 2007; Ujuanbi et al. 2008; Nwogbo et al. 2009). One main advantage of using prestack seismic inversion for constructing reliable earth model and characterizing lithofacies is based on the ability of the technique to extract more information (such as shear velocity, Vs) from seismic data to better discriminate reservoir and non-reservoir rocks that are not answered by poststack seismic inversion.|$|E

Understanding the association between <b>fluid</b> <b>type</b> and outcomes in general hospitalized patients may inform selection of <b>fluid</b> <b>type</b> in clinical practice. We sought to determine if the <b>type</b> of IV <b>fluid</b> administered to patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is associated with outcome. Methods This was a propensity-matched cohort study in hospitalized patients receiving at least 500 mL IV crystalloid within 48 hours of SIRS. Patient data was extracted from a large multi-hospital electronic health record database between January 1, 2009, and March 31, 2013. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, readmission, and complications measured by ICD- 9 coding and clinical definitions. Outcomes were adjusted for illness severity using the Acute Physiology Score. Of the 91, 069 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 89, 363 (98 %) received 0. 9 % saline whereas 1706 (2 %) received a calcium-free balanced solution as the primary fluid.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} initial lung {{flushing}} with intracellular and extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>type</b> solutions were studied in lungs stored with the University of Wisconsin solution. Excised Sprague-Dawley rat lungs (n = 39) were flushed first {{with one of}} the following solutions: (1) the University of Wisconsin solution (K+ = 140 mmol/L), (2) modified (low potassium) University of Wisconsin solution (K+ = 20 mmol/L), (3) phosphate buffered saline solution (K+ = 3. 9 mmol/L), (4) modified low-potassium phosphate-buffered saline solution (K+ = 20 mmol/L), (5) modified high-potassium phosphate-buffered saline solution (K+ = 40 mmol/L), and (6) Euro-Collins solution (K+ = 115 mmol/L) followed by secondary flush with storage solution and cold (4 ° C) storage in University of Wisconsin solution for 24 hours. The lungs were then reperfused in the isolated, pulsatile, blood-perfused working lung system for 2 hours or until lung failure. Blood gas analysis and shunt fraction, aerodynamic parameters (airway resistance, lung compliance, elastic work, and flow resistive work), and total pulmonary vascular resistance were measured throughout the perfusion period. The mean oxygen tensions (in millimeters of mercury) at 30 minutes after the onset of reperfusion for University of Wisconsin solution, modified University of Wisconsin solution, phosphate-buffered saline solution, modified phosphate-buffered saline solutions (20 and 40 mmol/L), and Euro-Collins solution were 56. 1 ± 4. 2, 72. 7 ± 9. 1, 87. 7 ± 6. 9 (p < 0. 01 versus University of Wisconsin solution; p < 0. 01 versus Euro-Collins solution), 86. 0 ± 9. 6 (p < 0. 01 versus University of Wisconsin solution; p < 0. 01 versus Euro-Collins solution), 87. 9 ± 7. 7 (p < 0. 01 versus University of Wisconsin solution; p < 0. 01 versus Euro-Collins solution), and 53. 5 ± 6. 0, respectively. All aerodynamic parameters in the lungs flushed with extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>type</b> solutions were superior to those flushed with intracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>type</b> solutions. We conclude that the efficacy of initial flushing was essential for successful lung preservation and that extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>type</b> solutions were superior to intracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>type</b> solutions, at least for flushing the lung before storage with University of Wisconsin solution.

30|$|The {{study area}} {{falls within the}} {{southern}} part of the Bumma Field (Fig.  1), which Reijers (2011) reported as being shalier than the northern part of the field, thus having lower chances of productive reservoirs. Shell Petroleum Development Company Internal Report, (2007) highlighted that the lack of productive reservoirs in {{the southern part of}} the field have significantly led to drilling marginal and dry wells (Table  1), so there is need to adopt an improved technique such as cross-plot analysis of Poisson impedance and its inversion to discriminate lithofacies and predict <b>fluid</b> <b>types</b> in Bumma Field. The Poisson impedance was first published by Quakenbush et al. (2006) and they derived the attribute seismically by combining the discrimination characteristics of Poisson’s ratio along with density, both of which are parameters useful in reservoir delineation. Also, several works have highlighted Poisson impedance as a very favorable attribute for identifying new prospect and characterizing clastic reservoir (Mazumdar 2007; Omodu et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2010; Zhou and Hilterman 2010; and; Sharma and Chopra 2013). Therefore, the main aim of this study is to use cross-plot analysis and seismic simultaneous inversion-derived Poisson impedance to discriminate lithofacies and predict <b>fluid</b> <b>types</b> associated with H-reservoirs (comprising of H 1, H 4 and H 5 sands) in Bumma Field.|$|E
