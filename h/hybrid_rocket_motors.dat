5000|$|Amateur {{rocketry}} sometimes {{known as}} amateur experimental rocketry or experimental rocketry is a hobby {{in which participants}} experiment with fuels and make their own rocket motors, launching {{a wide variety of}} types and sizes of rockets. Amateur rocketeers have been responsible for significant research into <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motors,</b> and have built and flown a variety of solid, liquid, and hybrid propellant motors. On May 17, 2004 Civilian Space eXploration Team (CSXT) successfully launched the first amateur high-power rocket into space, achieving an altitude of 72 miles (115 km). Prior to that the Reaction Research Society on November 23, 1996 launched a solid-fueled rocket, designed by longtime member George Garboden, to an altitude of 50 miles (80 km) from the Black Rock Desert in Nevada.|$|E
50|$|SpaceDev was {{developing}} the SpaceDev Streaker, an expendable small launch vehicle, and SpaceDev Dream Chaser, capable of both suborbital and orbital human space flight. Both Streaker and Dream Chaser use <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> that burn nitrous oxide and the synthetic rubber HTPB. SpaceDev {{was acquired by}} Sierra Nevada Corporation in 2009, becoming its Space Systems division, which continues to develop Dream Chaser for NASA's Commercial Crew Development contract. Sierra Nevada also developed RocketMotorTwo, the hybrid engine for SpaceShipTwo. On October 31, 2014 SpaceShipTwo was lost, initial speculation had suggested that its hybrid engine had in fact exploded and killed one test pilot and seriously injured the other. However investigation data now indicates an early deployment of the SpaceShip-Two feather system was the cause for aerodynamic breakup of the vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|HTPB is {{also used}} as a <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> fuel. With N2O (nitrous oxide, or [...] "laughing gas") as the oxidizer, {{it is used to}} power the SpaceShipTwo <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> {{developed}} by SpaceDev.

Scaled Composites lists the following components of the program: ...|$|R
50|$|The first work on <b>hybrid</b> <b>rockets</b> was {{performed}} in the late 1930s at I.G. Farben in Germany and concurrently at the California Rocket Society in the United States. Leonid Andrussow, working in Germany, first thought of {{the idea for a}} <b>hybrid</b> propellant <b>rocket.</b> O. Lutz, W. Noeggerath, and Andrussow tested a 10 kN <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> using a coal and gaseous N2O as the propellants. Oberth also worked on a <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> using LOX as the oxidizer and graphite as the fuel. The high heat of sublimation of carbon prevented these <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> from operating efficiently, as it resulted in a negligible burning rate.In the 1940s, the California Pacific Rocket Society used LOX in combination with several different fuel types, including wood, wax, and rubber. The most successful of these tests was with the rubber fuel, which is still the dominant fuel in use today. In June 1951, a LOX/rubber rocket was flown to an altitude of 9 km.|$|R
5000|$|Hybrid rockets avoid {{some of the}} {{disadvantages}} of solid rockets like the dangers of propellant handling, while also avoiding some disadvantages of liquid rockets like their mechanical complexity. Because {{it is difficult for}} the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids. Like liquid rocket engines, <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> can be shut down easily and the thrust is throttleable. The theoretical specific impulse (...) performance of hybrids is generally higher than solid motors and lower than liquid engines. [...] as high as 400s has been measured in a hybrid rocket using metalized fuels. Hybrid systems are more complex than solid ones, but they avoid significant hazards of manufacturing, shipping and handling solid rocket motors by storing the oxidizer and the fuel separately.|$|E
50|$|In the February 18, 2007 {{episode of}} Top Gear, a Reliant Robin {{was used by}} Richard Hammond and James May {{in an attempt to}} modify a normal K-reg Robin into a {{reusable}} space shuttle. Steve Holland, a professional radio-controlled aircraft pilot, helped Hammond to work out how to land a Robin safely. The craft was built by Senior members of the United Kingdom Rocketry Association (UKRA) and achieved a successful launch, flew for several seconds into the air and managed to successfully jettison the solid-fuel rocket boosters on time. This was the largest rocket launched by a non-government organisation in Europe. It used 6 x 40960 NS O Contrail Rockets motors giving a maximum thrust of 8 metric tons. However, the car failed to separate from the large external fuel tank due to faulty explosive bolts between the Robin and the external tank and the Robin subsequently crashed into the ground and seemed to have exploded soon after. In fact this explosion was added for dramatic effect as neither Reliant Robins nor <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> explode in the way depicted.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> offer {{many of the}} {{benefits}} of both liquid and solid rocket systems. Like liquid engines, <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> are able to be throttled, can be stopped and restarted, and are safer than solid rocket motors since the fuel and oxidizer are in different physical states. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> are similar to solid motors in that they are relatively simple and have a high density-specific impulse. One of the major drawbacks of <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> is a slower burning rate than solid rocket motors. Complex port geometries provide greater burning surface area to compensate for lower burning rates but are difficult and expensive to manufacture. Additive manufacturing can reduce manufacturing costs of these complex port geometry fuel grains. It has also been shown that the addition of energetic materials, such as aluminum, can increase the burning rate and density-specific impulse of the rocket motor. Previously, additive manufacturing was restricted to plastics or fast-setting paraffin wax, both with low solids concentrations. This paper investigates the process of printing hybrid rocket fuel grains and the differences in physical characteristics between printed and conventionally cast samples. Using a proprietary printing system, we have successfully printed 85 % solids loading aluminum and HTPB fuel samples. Material creep was significant and resulted in samples bulging and sagging as well as gaps between print lines being filled in more completely. The finish and cross sections of printed samples were of comparable quality to cast samples. This indicates that the manufacturing process has not significantly affected the physical characteristics of the fuel samples...|$|E

Now {{and in the}} {{foreseeable}} future rocket engine will be the most basic propulsion of space vehicle. Nowadays the most important condition in design of rocket engine is the cost reduction and increasing thrust to weight ratio as much as possible.
