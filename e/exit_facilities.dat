As {{noted in the}} 1991 Life Safety Code Handbook; [...] "...the Committee devoted its attention to a study of notable fires involving loss of life and to analyzing the causes of that loss of life. This work led to the preparation of standards {{for the construction of}} stairways,fire escapes, and similar structures; for fire drills in various occupancies and for the construction and arrangement of <b>exit</b> <b>facilities</b> for factories, schools and other occupancies, which form the basis of the present Code." [...] This study became the basis for two early NFPA publications, [...] "Outside Stairs for Fire Exits" [...] (1916) and [...] "Safeguarding Factory Workers from Fire" [...] (1918).|$|E
5000|$|A {{combination}} of a drop in scrap prices and a coincidental decline in sales prompted some concern in 1949 when Amity had to negotiate a bank loan of $25,000 to meet its financial obligations. The store had to sell $20,000 just pay for trucks and help. Other expenses had risen as well as then-President John Ostler explained, [...] "Our available cash reserves were completely used up in providing adequate fire <b>exit</b> <b>facilities</b> for the handicapped employed". Amity came on hard times {{after the war and}} the bank wanted to restrict Amity's borrowing, so Shiner went to the Synod of the Diocese of Niagara and asked them to back a mortgage of $25,000. They came and looked at the building and what we were doing and said [...] "yes". We then got in a manager, Mr. Oliver, and he completely turned things around at Amity and paid off the mortgage within 2-3 years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{committee}} {{found out}} that the major reason for the heavy casualty was the false tactics of the management to bring the other two school students to the aided primary school to mislead the inspecting authorities about the student-teacher ratio. The management was held responsible for the whole accident. The report pointed out that the teachers were not trained in disaster management and the prohibited thatch structure was close to the classrooms. It also stated that the schools had inadequate <b>exit</b> <b>facilities</b> and had no firefighting capabilities. Pulavar Palanichamy, the owner of the schools, was reported to have used his political clout and coalesced with the municipal and the revenue department officials getting the permits for the schools. Vijayalakshmi, the noon meal organizer and also the teacher of the English Medium school, was held accountable for not performing her duties of taking safety precautions. Vasanthi, the head cook lighted the oven in the absence of her assistant, Sivasankari, who usually lights it. There was contrasting reports on whether Sivasankari was present in the school during the event. The Tahsildar of Kumbakonam Taluk, Paramasivam, was reported [...] "dishonest" [...] for granting licence under the Tamil Nadu Public Buildings (Licensing) Act, 1965 to the school. The chartered engineer Jayachandran was also held dishonest of giving stability certificate to the building without visiting the school once. The additional assistant educational officer, Madhavan for allowing the school to run without recognition for 6 years. Sivaprakasam, the assistant elementary education officer, was held accountable for allowing Madhavan, who was not competent to allow permit to the school. Balaji, the deputy education elementary officer was accused of carelessly passing the papers signed by Madhavan. The local health officer r Dr. Sivapunyam was accused of giving false sanitary certificate to the school. Annadurai, a friend of Pulavar Palanichamy was accounted for advising circumvention of rules. Pingapani, the deputy educational officer, who inspected the high school, did not show interest in learning that the same campus had a primary school acting beyond rules. The other officers who were earlier responsible for permitting the nursery school against the rules during 1999, namely, Shanmughavelu, Sethuramachandran, Chandrasekharan and Dr.Palanivelu. The Deputy elementary educational officer, Durairaj and assistant elementary educational officer, Balakrishnan, were held less culpable for knowing about the thatched structure and the exargerated attendance, but not initiating any action.|$|E

40|$|The {{proportion}} of fine and very fine particles (PM 2. 5 and PM 1) emitted {{into the atmosphere}} has significantly increased in industrial areas, since more efficient filters towards coarse particles size fraction are set up in chimney <b>exit</b> <b>facilities.</b> These fine and very fine particles are very reactive and may represent a significant risk for human health and may contaminate the surrounding environments (air, soil, water, vegetable). The micronic and submicronic particles can deeply penetrate into the respiratory system and reach alveoli. Ingestion also represents a significant route of particles exposure through the consumption of contaminated vegetables. Studying the accumulation and transfer of particles trough foliar way in vegetables cultivated near factories emitting metal-rich particles is therefore of major interest. This work concerns the study of foliar accumulation of particles emitted by a lead battery recycling facility and their transfer into the leaf tissues. First, particles were characterized at the particle scale through the coupling of imaging and spectroscopic techniques. Results show that lead is predominantly found in finer size fraction (PM 1), mainly as sulfate compounds. We have demonstrated the formation of soluble lead compounds on the particles surface. Secondly, cabbage plants were exposed to particles in the facility courtyard for a 6 weeks period. Results show an important accumulation of lead containing particles in the leaves with sometimes the formation of necrotic areas enriched with metals. In some of these necrosis, Pb speciation changed. Finally, {{to better understand the}} bio-physicochemical phenomenon of foliar transfer, exposure of leaves cabbages to different types of monometallic particles were carried out in controlled conditions at the laboratory. The results were subjected to biological tests and have shown significant differences in term of genotoxicity regarding the metal specie considered...|$|E

40|$|This book {{chapter is}} {{published}} courtesy of WIT Press from WIT Transactions on The Built Environment, Volume 168, 2015, page 935 - 948. An injury analysis was undertaken of young and older transport users from 5 years of injury surveillance data collected at participating trauma hospitals in Victoria, Australia. The analysis was undertaken {{for inclusion in}} the UK project on Improving the Safety for Older Public Transport Users. Details of injuries were recorded on attendance including the patients’ account of the circumstances of the accident and causation factors. Results showed that injury risk was more common among bus passengers than those on either trams or trains. The most common injuries were to the head and face regions and upper and lower limbs. Chest injuries were especially problematic among older travellers and they sustained more multiple life-threating injuries than their younger counterparts. Entering or exiting the vehicle accounted for almost two-thirds of all injury-causing events. The most common mechanisms involved a slip, trip or fall while getting on and off the vehicle or while on-board or running to catch public transport. Being hit, struck or crushed by another person or an object was also noted. Injuries to older public transport users was positively correlated with increasing age. The majority of those injured required out-patient treatment at the participating hospital but was dependent on the participant’s age. Opportunities for intervention included improved boarding and <b>exiting</b> <b>facilities</b> at bus and tram stops and reducing hazardous structural members inside these vehicles would be helpful. A number of limitations in this study were noted and areas requiring further research were identified for future studies.

40|$|This article investigates {{one aspect}} of what the Dutch {{government}} can do to reduce the risks posed by Dutch jihadists who are currently fighting in Syria. The Dutch government has developed a comprehensive action programme to combat jihadism which outlines measures designed to combat the jihadist movement in the Netherlands. The comprehensive action programme includes plans to develop an <b>exit</b> <b>facility</b> to help people leaving the jihadist movement. Furthermore, a support facility needs to be created, based on the German network model. Of this network the Hayat programme will be analysed in-depth together with the EXIT-Deutschland programme. Hayat is a civil society programme that includes working with relatives of radicalised individuals and tries to de-radicalise these individuals. Hayat’s programme is amongst others based on experiences gained from EXIT-Deutschland, a de-radicalisation programme focusing on de-radicalising individual members of the radical right movement. The exit-facility that the Dutch government wants to create and the support facility are only explained vaguely and {{have not yet been}} introduced. This research investigates how and to what extent Hayat’s and EXIT-Deutschland’s elements can successfully be transferred to the Netherlands. This research recommends focusing on disengaging instead of de-radicalisation. The programme should be executed by an NGO with expert witness status. Furthermore, an active approach to contacting returnees is considered best in line with the Dutch government’s objectives. Important elements of the German programme can be transferred to the Netherlands. These elements include using a personal approach, providing returnees with alternatives and family counselling, and generally - apart from the already existing repressive measures - focusing on positive measures. This article also outlines the ways in which such a transfer of best practises can be best achieved...|$|R

30|$|A typical {{coal mine}} complex (underground mine shafts, drift portals and slopes and their {{associated}} coal preparation facilities) operates a closed loop water system. Although rainfall in Illinois greatly exceeds evaporation, a typical underground coal mine and associated preparation plan complex will often operate on net {{deficit of water}} {{during the course of}} a typical year. This is largely due to water lost during the mining process (dust suppression) and coal washing. Most water <b>exits</b> the <b>facility</b> either as evaporation water or surface moisture on the processed coal. To supplement their needs these operations add water from a fresh water impoundment or groundwater source. Periodic discharges (blow down) will occur typically from a single sedimentation control basin with an NPDES discharge. Often this blow down occurs during a period of high precipitation when waters with high TDS are acceptable. However, the primary need for blow down is to drain water that is detrimental to equipment operation.|$|R
