5|$|An {{unpublished}} {{study conducted}} by Vernon Meidlinger-Chin in 2013 suggested that previous studies lacked focus on endocranial details. The {{study found that the}} Cryolophosaurus fossil has a nearly complete, undistorted cranial cavity which is complete <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> an approximate shape and size of the living brain. The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving Cryolophosaurus a basal position in Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E

Despite the controversy, 1,065 Armenians voted for the Azerbaijani entry, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the country a single point. A total of 43 Azerbaijanis voted for the Armenian entry.|$|E

5|$|Scottish Premier League club Hibernian {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the fourth round. They began their campaign against Second Division leaders Cowdenbeath at Central Park, which was suggested as a possible cup upset due to Hibs' poor league form. Cowdenbeath took the lead after just 15 seconds, but Hibs recovered to win 3–2. Hibs then took on fellow SPL club Kilmarnock at their home ground, Easter Road, having made several signings in January 2012. An early goal by Irish striker Eoin Doyle was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Hibs a 1–0 win.|$|E

Immediately, The Powers of Pain chased The Bolsheviks from the ring. Slick, however, distracted The Powers of Pain long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> The Bolsheviks an advantage. Zhukov was then slammed to the mat back-first and headbutted from the top rope, which allowed The Barbarian to pin him.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 14-yard line, where the Yellow Jackets began their game-winning drive. The offense began slowly; Georgia Tech gained only nine yards in three plays, setting up a crucial fourth-down conversion. A failed try would give Clemson the ball deep in Georgia Tech territory, with little time remaining in the game for Georgia Tech to reply to any score. Instead, the Yellow Jackets converted the fourth down, keeping their drive alive. On the first play after the fourth-down conversion, Nesbitt completed a 21-yard pass to Dwyer, pushing Tech to near midfield. Eight plays later, Dwyer breached the Clemson defense for a 15-yard gain and the go-ahead score. A false start penalty on Georgia Tech's two-point conversion try prevented any extra points, but the touchdown's six points were <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Georgia Tech a 39–34 lead.|$|E
5|$|In the 1926–27 season, Cowan made 27 {{appearances}} as {{his club}} sought an immediate {{return to the}} top division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and Portsmouth both in contention for {{the second of the}} two promotion places. Cowan played in a resounding City win, an 8–0 victory against Bradford City. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5–1 win, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Portsmouth second place on goal average by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal. The club won the Second Division championship the following season, gaining promotion to the top flight. The Second Division championship was Cowan's first honour in professional football.|$|E

Once again, Villa's goal proved to be the {{difference}} as the match finished 1–0, while Spain booked a game with Germany in the semi-finals, where Spain recorded yet another 1–0 victory with the only goal coming from Carles Puyol.|$|E
5|$|Though the White House {{maintained}} public neutrality, privately Kennedy made {{it clear}} he desired a Liberal victory. Kennedy lent Lou Harris, his pollster to work for the Liberals again. On election day, April 8, 1963, the Liberals claimed 129 seats to the Tories' 95, five seats short of an absolute majority. Diefenbaker held to power for several days, until six Quebec Social Credit MPs signed a statement that Pearson should form the government. These votes would be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Pearson support of a majority of the House of Commons, and Diefenbaker resigned. The six MPs repudiated the statement within days. Nonetheless, Pearson formed a government {{with the support of the}} NDP.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season in}} 1995–96, Kartik {{had a more}} successful season for Railways Under-19s. He started with 5/73 and 5/55 against Madhya Pradesh and made it three five-wicket hauls in a row with 5/42 against Vidarbha. He took another five-wicket haul {{later in the season}} against Rajasthan and ended the competition with 38 wickets at 18.94 in seven matches. Railways made the final, where they faced Punjab. Kartik was Railways' most effective bowler, taking 4/57 in Punjab's first innings of 310. He then made 14 not out as Railways ceded a first innings lead, which was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Punjab the title as the match ended in a draw. Kartik took 3/138 in the second innings. After the final, newly crowned champions took on the Rest of India, and Kartik took 2/25 and 4/89 to help his team to a six-wicket victory. Kartik had a less successful time in the zonal one-dayers for Central, taking only one wicket in three matches. He also improved his batting marginally, scoring 57 and three other double-digit scores.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Johnson was City's leading goalscorer with 25 {{goals as}} the club sought an immediate {{return to the}} top division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and Portsmouth both in contention for {{the second of the}} two promotion places. Johnson starred in a resounding City win, scoring a hat-trick in an 8–0 victory against Bradford City. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5–1 win, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Portsmouth second place on goal average by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal. Johnson and his teammates overcame the disappointment of the preceding season in 1927–28, winning the Second Division to return to the top flight. His Second Division winner's medal was to be the only honour Johnson won in his Manchester City career. He reached the 20 goal mark for the third consecutive season, finishing joint-top goalscorer with Frank Roberts.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{originally}} had {{a capacity of}} about 12,000, but club officials decided that was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them any hope of joining the Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, but in 1891 Newton Heath used what little financial reserves they had to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000spectators. However, this transaction put the club {{at odds with the}} railway company, who refused to contribute any finance to the deal. The two organisations began to drift apart from then onwards, and in 1892 the club attempted to raise £2,000 in share capital to pay off the debts incurred by the expansion of the ground. The split also led the railway company to stop paying the rent due on the ground to the cathedral, who {{at about the same time}} decided to increase the rent. Under increasing financial pressure, especially as the cathedral authorities felt it inappropriate for the club to charge admission to the ground, an eviction notice was served on the club in June 1893. The club's management had been searching for a new stadium since the first eviction attempt in May the previous year, and they were able to move to a new ground on Bank Street, three miles away in Clayton. It proved impossible though to take the two grandstands to the new ground, and they were sold for £100.|$|E
