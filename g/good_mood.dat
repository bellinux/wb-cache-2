Does improved mood lead to improved health, or does good health lead to <b>good</b> <b>mood,</b> or both? Or does some other factor underlie both? In other words, a correlation can be taken as evidence for a possible causal relationship, but cannot indicate what the causal relationship, if any, might be.|$|E

Klein later told {{investigators}} that Crater was in a <b>good</b> <b>mood</b> that evening and gave no indication that anything was bothering him. The dinner ended a little after 9 p.m., shortly after the curtain rose on the show for which Crater had bought a ticket, and the small group went outside.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} life threat due to GHB overdose (with {{or without}} other substances) is respiratory arrest. Other relatively common {{causes of death}} due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional asphyxia, and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while {{driving under the influence}} of GHB). The risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. People are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. It is important to keep the victim awake and moving, who must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting. Frequently they will be in a <b>good</b> <b>mood</b> but this does not mean they are not in danger. GHB overdose is a medical emergency and immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed.|$|E

25|$|In psychology, {{capitalization}} {{refers to}} the process of drawing additional benefits (e.g., increases in <b>good</b> <b>mood)</b> from a positive event by sharing it with other people. Research shows that individuals who share news of a positive event (such as, for example, acceptance to graduate school or a promotion at work) with a close other and receive a supportive response from that person, show increases in positive emotions and personal well-being above and beyond the boost given by the positive event itself. Furthermore, support for positive event sharing has positive implications for relationship well-being. Specifically, receipt of such support increases feelings of trust and the endorsement of a more prosocial orientation (i.e., the willingness to respond positively in an unpleasant or conflict situation involving one's relationship partner). Additionally, support for positive event sharing is more strongly linked to higher levels of relationship quality and lower likelihood of break-ups in the future than support extended during discussion of negative events.|$|E
25|$|She is an {{extremely}} private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a <b>good</b> <b>mood</b> climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E

50|$|Although mood {{management}} {{suggests that}} individuals' behaviors often {{conform to the}} hedonistic assumption, this theory also makes clear that individuals are not necessarily aware of their motivation. Rather, people are thought to initially arrange their environments in a random fashion, and arrangements that are incidentally made during <b>good</b> <b>moods</b> and that extend or enhance the hedonically positive state leave a memory trace that increases the likelihood for making similar stimulus arrangements under similar circumstances (Zillmann, 1988a, 1988b). In other words, the formation of these preferences is controlled by a mechanism called operant conditioning, which refers {{to the use of}} consequences to modify the occurrence and form of behavior.|$|R
50|$|Mood {{can play}} an {{influential}} role in impression formation by affecting the way the primacy effect is used when making judgments. Being in a positive mood causes a person to process information in a holistic, all-inclusive fashion while being in a negative mood encourages more adaptive processing which accounts for each detail individually. Therefore, positive mood tends to increase the influence of early information while negative mood has the opposite effect. There is also evidence of a mood-congruent factor, where people in <b>good</b> <b>moods</b> form positive impressions and people in bad moods form negative impressions. This is most likely due to the selective priming of information associated with the current mood state, which causes mood-congruent biases in impression formation.|$|R

500|$|In 1955, O'Hara {{made her}} fourth picture with Ford, The Long Gray Line, which she {{considered}} being [...] "by {{far the most}} difficult" [...] due to declining relations with John Ford. John Wayne had originally intended co-starring, but due to a conflicting schedule O'Hara recommended Tyrone Power in replacement. Malone notes that the Irish accents by O'Hara and Power are overdone, {{and that there is}} little trace of a Donegal accent in it. The film production marked the lowest point of O'Hara's relationship with Ford, and each day he would greet her with [...] "Well, did Herself have a good shit this morning?". He would ask the crew if she was in a <b>good</b> <b>mood,</b> and if that was the case, he would say [...] "then we're going to have a horrible day" [...] and vice versa. He would provoke her by telling her to [...] "move her fat Irish ass". Their relationship deteriorated further when O'Hara reportedly saw him kissing an actor on set, and Ford knew that she thought he was a closeted homosexual. In The Magnificent Matador, O'Hara played a spoiled, wealthy American who {{falls in love with a}} brooding, tormented, about-to-retire matador (Anthony Quinn) in Mexico. Ava Gardner, who was dating a bullfighter in real life, Luis Miguel Dominguín, and Lana Turner were considered for O'Hara's part of Karen Harrison. The film was panned by the critics. One of her best-known roles came later year, playing Lady Godiva in Lady Godiva of Coventry. Contrary to what Universal claimed to the press, O'Hara was not nude in the film, wearing a [...] "full-length body leotard and underwear that was concealed by my long tresses".|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of anticipated social interaction on the regulation of moods. Study l induced happy and sad moods through exposure to music. All participants expected to perform a second, unrelated experimental task either by themselves or with another participant.

Study 2 confirmed this outcome, but showed it was confined primarily to anticipation of interaction with partners who {{are expected to be}} in neutral or <b>good</b> <b>moods</b> themselves. In Study 3, participants whose mood was not manipulated reduced self-exposure to cheerful or depressing videos when they expected to interact with another.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} the crucial role of affects (emotions, moods and affective dispositions) in economics. Firstly, we analyse the important question of the differentiated nature of what is called ?affect? in the psychological literature. Our review presents the different methods used recently by some economists in order to measure the valence of emotions or to induce ?bad or <b>good?</b> <b>moods</b> to their subjects before the beginning of the games. Secondly, we analyze the behavioural impact of incidental emotions in experimental economics. We focus on the role of affect in risky behaviour and social games (cooperation, negotiation, trust). Our review shows the crucial role of intentions, anticipations, emotion expressions, as well as unconscious processes or judgment biases, in observed behaviours in the laboratory. Thirdly, we examine the first attempts of introduction of the role of affects in economic behavioural theory (inter temporal choice, social preferences models). ...|$|R

40|$|Certain {{unpleasant}} emotional {{states do}} alter cognitive information processing strategies. High arousal negative moods and very high arousal positive moods {{seem to make}} people more attracted to higher risk. This actually leads to {{a higher rate of}} misfortunes or negative outcomes. Low arousal negative moods, on the other hand, seem to make people more risk averse. The influence of friends when sought out to improve mood, led to more risk-taking behaviors than when influenced by friends in <b>good</b> <b>moods.</b> It still seems to be a high arousal negative mood that causes the risk taking [...] fear or anxiety associated with rejection by friends. A series of three lab studies supported the possible link of risk taking to social anxiety. The studies supported the use of moods, when aware of them, in the decision-making process. Also, the other studies replicated our results for other low arousal negative moods. Strangers were the most influential in terms of risk taking, even with the risk averse mood of sadness.
