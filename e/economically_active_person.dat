This pattern of population distribution is same across various constituencies in the State and between urban and rural areas. In terms of age distribution, the 2002 CWIQ Survey indicates that 45.2% {{of the population was}} made up of young people below the age of 15; 49.0% between the ages of 15 and 59 while 5.8% were people aged 60 and above.

This implies that, on average, the households from the invaded Kebeles have relatively more labour force than those households from the non-invaded Kebeles. However, the treatment group of households showed a slightly lower average dependency ratio (1.030) than households from the control group (1.056). This implies that every <b>economically</b> <b>active</b> <b>person</b> in the Prosopis invaded households and non-invaded households had to support more than one economically inactive person.|$|E

Those who completed their training in a small firm are more likely th choose self-employment than those trained in large firms. Among other things, we attribute this to some peculiarities of small firms and the knowlegde they impart. We provide indirect evidence that the link between the size of training firm and choosing self-employment is mediated by different career prospects and costs of mobility associated with training in firms of different size.

The introduction of cashless wage payments has not only affected the payment behavior but also the savings behaviour of households. These changes were evolutionary rather than revolutionary, however.

40|$|The {{labor market}} of {{tomorrow}} {{will be determined by}} the transition from an industrial to a knowledge society. In this process, the accumulation of human capital becomes increasingly important whilst opportunities for low qualified staff steadily diminish. Globalization and technological advancement results in enhanced economic participation of highly qualified staff in the form of higher wages and better employment opportunities. In the literature, this is attributed to the “Skill-Biased Technological Change ” (SBTC) (Nikutowski, 2007). According to the “task approach ” (Autor et al. 2003), the technological change due to falling computer prices (computerization) leads to changes in task structures which favor a trend towards routinization (“routinization hypothesis”).

For this purpose, the Fraunhofer FIT developed a cohort component model (c.f. Whelpton 1936; Blien et al. 1990; more specifically for QuBe see also Kalinowski and Quinke 2010), which subdivides the population according to sex, age, and qualification characteristics and extrapolates the in- and outflows of these subgroups into the future (BIBB-FIT model). The movements between groups summarize ageing given births and deaths, migration, and qualification attainment behaviour. The latter is simulated with a nested transition model of the German education system. Here, pupils are allocated and transitioning between high school tracks, entering the vocational education system, switching between higher education and vocational training programs and, finally, according to the overall completion rates of the different programs finishing by obtaining a credential assigning them to a qualification level {{and according to the}} prevailing empiric rates of occupation attainment a training occupation, which they can use in the labour market to earn wage profits.

Refractive errors, if uncorrected, results in an impaired quality of life for millions of people worldwide, irrespective of their age, sex and ethnicity. Over the past decade, a series of studies using a survey methodology, referred to as Refractive Error Study in Children (RESC), were performed in populations with different ethnic origins and cultural settings. These studies confirmed that the prevalence of uncorrected refractive errors is considerably high for children in low-and-middle-income countries.

The level of impacts is, however, significantly influenced by the spatial and social distances of communities and individuals from the power plant.

40|$|Background: The recent {{economic}} recession has {{lead to an}} increased unemployment in many countries worldwide. In addition, {{research has suggested that}} economic recession can have an impact on an individual's health behaviors, including engagement in physical activity. Gävleborg County in southeast Sweden, experienced massive job losses owing to the closures of large industries and small companies, which resulted in an increased unemployment rate in 2010, at the pick of the economic recession. Objective: To investigate the differences in physical activity by employment status among <b>economically</b> <b>active</b> <b>persons</b> living in Gävleborg County in 2010. Materials and Methods: The data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey carried out in Gävleborg County, in 2010, among the residents aged 16 – 65 years (n = 4, 245). Data analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics and weighted logistic regression. Result: There was a statistically significant association between employment status and physical activity. People who were not employed in 2010 showed higher odds of physical inactivity when compared with their employed counterparts. The differences in physical activity behavior were explained, mainly, by health and socioeconomic and related factors. Conclusion: Being outside the labor market was associated with increased physical inactivity during a period of economic recession in Gävleborg County. From a policy perspective, our study suggests the need to promote physical activity during times of high unemployment in order to foster better health behaviors...|$|R

The main objective is to identify the relationship between capital stock value development, and agricultural sector performance in the individual analysed countries. The results of the analysis are as follows. The agricultural sector has significantly changed its structure and position within the national economy of individual new EU member states in the 20 years since the early 1990 s. The size of the agricultural sector reduced {{in each of the}} analysed countries, resulting in a reduction {{in the value of the}} agricultural sector performance. Despite the significant reduction of the agricultural sector in many analysed, some became more efficient in terms of their agricultural sector performance. Individual country’s agricultural sectors became more effective and more competitive. Individual country’s agricultural sector size and performance development are closely related to capital stock value in agriculture.

Freedom of movement and residence, with its rights and limitations, historically and legally accrued to <b>economically</b> <b>active</b> <b>persons.</b> Non-economically <b>active</b> <b>persons</b> have been given rights in secondary legislation to move and to reside subject to specified conditions and limitations. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, in accordance with which the link with economic in dependence and the freedom to move and reside has been broken, will be critically appraised. Resort to the principle of non discrimination on grounds of nationality in Article 12 of the European Community Treaty, read in conjunction with the citizenship provisions in Articles 17 and 18 EC, has resulted in legal rights for nationals of European Union Member States who are lawfully resident in, and who do not become an unreasonable burden on, the host Member State. Enforceable at the suit of individuals, EU citizenship has given rise to social advantages for non-economic actors. Citizenship has become a legal source of rights be yond those agreed to by the Member States, the legitimacy for which lies with the degree of financial solidarity accorded under the principle of non-discrimination and the level of integration of a particular EU citizen into the society of the host Member State. The need to establish a real link and the proportionate legitimate interests of the Member State are limits to citizenship as a source of rights. Nevertheless, it is the intention of this paper to examine the potential for citizenship to transform the polity of the European Union, from one based on economic and social rights, to one based on fundamental right...|$|R
40|$|Background: The type {{of payment}} {{is one of the}} {{important}} factors that has an effect on the health of employees, as a basic working condition. In the conventional research field of occupational safety and health, only the physical, chemical, biological, and ergonomic factors are treated as the main hazardous factors. Managerial factors and basic working conditions such as working hours and the {{type of payment}} are neglected. This paper aimed to investigate the association of the type of payment and the exposure to the various hazardous factors as an heuristic study. Methods: The third Korean Working Conditions Survey (KWCS) by the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute in 2011 was used for this study. Among the total sample of 50, 032 <b>economically</b> <b>active</b> <b>persons,</b> 34, 788 employees were considered for analysis. This study examined the relation between the three types of payment such as basic fixed salary and wage, piece rate, and extra payment for bad and dangerous working conditions and exposure to hazardous factors like vibration, noise, temperature, chemical contact, and working at very high speeds. Multivariate regression analysis was used to measure the effect of the type of payment on working hours exposed to hazards. Results: The result showed that the proportion of employees with a basic fixed salary was 94. 5 %, the proportion with piece rates was 38. 6 %, and the proportion who received extra payment for hazardous working conditions was 11. 7 %. Conclusion: The piece rate was associated with exposure to working with tight deadlines and stressful jobs. This study had some limitations because KWCS was a cross-sectional survey...|$|R
40|$|Conference paperLeadership is {{responsible}} for goal achievement, {{the ultimate goal of}} which is the survival and growth of the organisation. Growth is facilitated by innovation, which in turn drives employee engagement. Risk taking spurs innovation, while resources, especially engaged employees, are important in innovation. In addition, engaged employees are fundamental in shaping a competitive advantage, the hallmark of a sound strategy, the tool organisations use to achieve their goals. Hence, leadership should create an environment that encourages risk taking and employee engagement to achieve the long-term goals of the organisation. The study reported on here forms part of a larger study conducted in South Africa (2015 – 4099 respondents), measuring employee engagement at both the organisational and the individual levels. Data were collected from a convenience sample (an existing, permission-based database, comprising <b>economically</b> <b>active</b> <b>persons</b> employed in all sectors) by means of an electronic survey. The instrument was validated for the South African context. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the factor, strategy and implementation, which scored the lowest of all the factors measured, and its impact on employee engagement. The results (means and standard deviations) showed that ‘risk taking’ was ranked the lowest of all items comprising the factor, strategy and implementation. Top management perceived that risk taking was encouraged, while employees perceived risk taking as not being encouraged (ANOVA). The results of the regression analysis indicate that the dimension of strategy and implementation contributes significantly to employee engagement. The results demonstrate that leadership needs to reconsider ‘encouraging risk taking’ because of its favourable influence on innovation and employee engagement, which may lead to actions that can enhance organisational performance. Operations Managemen...|$|R

But has however stayed in a small population size, however notable during the wars the population drops. You can also say that the recent drop in population would also match the national trend of people moving out of rural areas and into urban ones. The census data also shows the population of Studley Roger to have a population in every age group, also in the different brackets of economic activity, with <b>economically</b> <b>active</b> full-time <b>persons</b> being the highest among the population of Studley Roger. Studley Roger currently has ten students aged four and over.
