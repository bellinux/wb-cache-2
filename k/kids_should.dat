[...] Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic praised Bleed American as [...] "an enjoyable, catchy mainstream rock album" [...] and noted its high replay value, particularly tracks such as [...] "Sweetness" [...] and [...] "Get It Faster". Aubin Paul of Punknews.org stated that unlike the band's prior albums, the second half of Bleed American was [...] "quite strong, and really fleshes out the musical ideas from the record." [...] While noting that those who dislike [...] "emo or 'poppier' music" [...] would dislike the album, Paul ultimately concluded that [...] "the punker-than-thou <b>kids</b> <b>should</b> stick with Static Prevails, but a catalog as impressive a J.E.W.'s can be appreciated by anyone without preconceptions." [...] Drowned in Sounds Terry Bezer called the album [...] "eleven of the finest songs you’ll hear this, or any other, year". AllMusic's Mark Vanderhoff praised its [...] "compelling lyrics, driving guitar work, and insanely catchy melodies".|$|E
500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that <b>kids</b> <b>should</b> have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E

50|$|School is {{considered}} to be the second learning home for kids. Every year {{a large number of people}} come to the United States. These groups of people are often families, including small children. In today’s world, cultural competency plays a very vital role in shaping the kids future. In the United States, there is an underlying difference among parents as to how a <b>kid</b> <b>should</b> be raised, but it is clear that cultural competency should be taught at a young age. The United States is not the front runner in cultural competency training amongst children, as Canada and Australia are seemingly far more progressive in this sector. Cultural competency training can be a huge help for the families who are thinking of adopting a foster child, specifically, if that child was born outside of United States. A school is a mixture of different races and cultures and as an educator, one must be sensitive to everyone’s needs. Different cultures act uniquely to the different situations, and as an educator, one has to not only value diversity, but also have a strategy for everyone to feel welcomed.|$|R
