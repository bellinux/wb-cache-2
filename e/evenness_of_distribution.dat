40|$|Design is {{fundamental}} to software development but can be demanding to perform. Thus to assist the software designer, evolutionary computing is being increasingly applied using machine-based, quantitative fitness functions to evolve software designs. However, in nature, elegance and symmetry {{play a crucial role}} in the reproductive fitness of various organisms. In addition, subjective evaluation has also been exploited in Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC). Therefore to investigate the role of elegance and symmetry in software design, four novel elegance measures are proposed based on the <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> of design elements. In controlled experiments in a dynamic interactive evolutionary computation environment, designers are presented with visualizations of object-oriented software designs, which they rank according to a subjective assessment of elegance. For three out of the four elegance measures proposed, it is found that a significant correlation exists between elegance values and reward elicited. These three elegance measures assess the <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> of (a) attributes and methods among classes, (b) external couples between classes, and (c) the ratio of attributes to methods. It is concluded that symmetrical elegance is in some way significant in software design, and that this can be exploited in dynamic, multi-objective interactive evolutionary computation to produce elegant software designs...|$|E

30|$|Our {{results from}} a lichen-dominated {{ecosystem}} in high alpine Sweden are therefore perhaps more directly comparable to trampling studies in maritime Antarctica, with a high coverage of bryophytes and/or lichens, than to other tundra ecosystems in, for example, Scandinavia, the Alps or America, with low amounts of non-vascular plants. As {{there are very few}} studies on species level of non-vascular plants, it is difficult to compare our results on the species richness of bryophytes and lichens with those of previous studies, where non-vascular plants are mostly treated as a group and data on species level are lacking.

Phytoplankton samples were collected from twelve stations during the wet (July, 2008) and dry (March, 2009) seasons. A typical freshwater condition prevailed in the study area during wet season with salinity of 0 parts per thousand (o/oo) at every station, whereas during the dry season, relatively high salinity levels were recorded from all the stations with decreasing trend toward the river mouth. The two seasons had the diatoms (Bacillariophytes) of the Orders Centrales and Pennales as the dominant phytoplankton taxa. A total of 2896 phytoplankton belonging to twenty-seven species, eight orders and four classes were recorded during wet season while the dry season had a total of 1550 phytoplankton, which cut across sixteen species, three orders and two classes.

Trawl collections from four nonconsecutive seasons in the period July 1980 to December 1982 indicated that the fish community {{is dominated by the}} family Sciaenidae, particularly juvenile forms. Spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) and Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) were the two most abundant species and dominated catches during all seasons. Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortin tyrannus) was also very abundant, but only seasonally (winter and spring) dominant in the catches. Elasmobranch fIShes, especially rajiforms and carcharinids, contributed to much of the biomass of fishes collected. Total fish abundance was greatest in winter and lowest in summer and was influenced by the seasonality of Atlantic menhaden and Atlantic croaker in the catches. Biomass was highest in spring and lowest in summer, and was influenced by biomass of spot. Fish density ranged from 321 individuals and 12. 2 kg per hectare to 746 individuals and 25. 2 kg per hectare.

In an attempt to assist the software designer, interactive (i. e. human in-the-loop) meta-heuristic search techniques such as evolutionary computing have been applied and show promising results. Recent investigations have also shown that Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) can outperform evolutionary computing as a potential search engine for interactive software design. With a limited computational budget, ACO produces superior candidate design solutions in {{a smaller number of}} iterations. Building on these findings, we propose a novel interactive ACO (iACO) approach to assist the designer in early lifecycle software design, in which the search is steered jointly by subjective designer evaluation as well as machine fitness functions relating the structural integrity and surrogate elegance of software designs. Results show that iACO is speedy, responsive and highly effective in enabling interactive, dynamic multi-objective search in early lifecycle software design. Study participants rate the iACO search experience as compelling. Results of machine learning of fitness measure weightings indicate that software design elegance does indeed {{play a significant role in}} designer evaluation of candidate software design.

However, cleared sites are often just left {{in the hope that}} revegetation will occur naturally. In riparian areas of Kruger National Park (KNP), the Working for Water (WfW) Programme has cleared IAPs on a regular basis, but little post-clearance monitoring has taken place. Thus investigating short-term effects of IAPs and IAP clearing on plant community diversity and vegetation recovery provided an ideal opportunity to assess feasible targets of natural ecosystem recovery in similar areas. Vegetation was sampled from twelve transects along the Sabie River in and adjacent to the KNP, before (March/April 2006) and after (March 2007) the annual clearing of IAPs by WfW. Rarefied species richness, alpha diversity and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> of species all declined with increasing density of IAPs (P< 0. 05). There was a mean reduction in IAP density of 80 % (S. EÂ± 6 %) (P= 0. 002) through the clearing by WfW. After clearing of IAPs, indigenous vegetation densities increased, with herbaceous growth forms showing the largest increase in transects that were previously heavily invaded. Thus, in this system, which is relatively undisturbed by human activities, initial recovery {{of indigenous}} vegetation can occur without further restorative interventions. This process is more than likely aided by the continuous clearing of IAPs by WfW as this acts to deplete alien seed banks and maintain IAPs at acceptable and manageable levels...|$|E

We tested the hypothesis that proximity to trails decreases plant cover, diversity and species richness of the canopy and the understory. We found {{a significant decrease in}} plant cover with proximity to the trail for the understory, but not for the canopy level, and significant decreases in the abundance of deciduous shrubs in the canopy layer and lichens in the understory. Proximity also had a significant negative impact on species richness of lichens. However, there were no significant changes in species richness, diversity or <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> in the canopy or understory with proximity to the trail. While not significant, liverworts, acrocarpous and pleurocarpous bryophytes tended to have contrasting abundance patterns with differing proximity to the trail, indicating that trampling may cause shifts in dominance hierarchies of different groups of bryophytes. Due to the decrease in understory cover, the abundance of litter, rock and soil increased with proximity to the trail. These results demonstrate that low-frequency human trampling in alpine heaths over long periods can have major negative impacts on lichen abundance and species richness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that trampling can decrease species richness of lichens.

DPM uses a round-robin algorithm (with optional filesystem weighting), for placing files across filesystems and servers. This does a reasonable job of evenly distributing files across the storage array provided to it. However, it does not offer any guarantees of the <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> of that subset of files associated with a given "dataset" (which often maps onto a "directory" in the DPM namespace (DPNS)).

The best case performance of the round robin algorithm is to maintain balance, it has no mechanism to improve balance. In the past year or more, larger DPM sites have noticed load spikes on individual disk servers, and suspected that these were exacerbated by excesses of files from popular datasets on those servers.

Size selective plots of the fiber elimination correlated with fiber diameters enables the mechanism of the fiber elimination (dissolution, fiber breakage, physical clearance) to be interpreted. The half-time of fiber elimination from the lung ranges from about 10 days for wollastonite to more than 300 days for crocidolite. The biodurability of man-made vitreous fibers (MMVF) is between these values and is dependent on the chemical composition of the fibers and the diameter and length distribution.

40|$|Constrained Random Verification (CRV) is {{becoming}} the mainstream methodology for the functional verification of complex System on Chip (SoC) designs. In order to achieve verification closure, CRV tools have to produce {{a large number of}} solutions, evenly distributed, in the search space. To attain this requirement, we propose a technique which analyzes the solution space by using consistency algorithm and splits the domain of variables into clusters. The proposed technique helps us to generate input stimuli which are evenly distributed in search space. Unlike other techniques, the proposed technique does not remove solutions with low probability from the search space. The experimental results show that the proposed technique helps to improve the <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> input stimuli <b>distribution,</b> <b>of</b> a state-of-art CRV tool. 1...|$|R
40|$|Deep litter manure {{contains}} considerable {{amounts of}} plant nutrients {{and is therefore}} used as a fertiliser in crop production. However, the manurial value of deep litter manure is reduced by ammonia volatilisation and uneven land spreading. Although storage before spreading may improve the spreading <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> deep litter manure, it may also influence the potential for ammonia losses. A study was therefore designed to investigate how storage of deep litter ma-nure influences spreading evenness and ammonia volatilisation following land spreading. The ammonia volatilisation following land spreading {{was found to be}} reduced by 44 % following storage, as the ammonium content of the deep litter manure had declined considerably during the storage period. The spreading <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> both mass and nutrient content of deep litter manure was found to be improved by storage. During spreading deep litter manure was found to be separated into bands of mainly straw or heavier material. However, this separation did not significantly influence the <b>evenness</b> in <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the nutrient content of neither stored nor unstored deep litter manure...|$|R
