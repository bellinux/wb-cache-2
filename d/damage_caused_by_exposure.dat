Oxidative attack on DNA generates both altered bases and damaged sugar residues that undergo fragmentation and lead to strand breaks.

40|$|Chemical {{pollution}} by pesticides {{has been}} identified as a possible contributing factor to the massive mortality outbreaks observed in Crassostrea gigas for several years. A previous study demonstrated the vertical transmission of DNA damage by subjecting oyster genitors to the herbicide diuron at environmental concentrations during gametogenesis. This trans-generational effect occurs through damage to genitor-exposed gametes, as measured by the comet-assay. The presence of DNA damage in gametes could be linked to the formation of DNA damage in other germ cells. In order to explore this question, the levels and cell distribution of the oxidized base lesion 8 -oxodGuo were studied in the gonads of exposed genitors. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV and electrochemical detection analysis showed an increase in 8 -oxodGuo levels in both male and female gonads after exposure to diuron. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the presence of 8 -oxodGuo at all stages of male germ cells, from early to mature stages. Conversely, the oxidized base was only present in early germ cell stages in female gonads. These results indicate that male and female genitors underwent oxidative stress following exposure to diuron, resulting in DNA oxidation in both early germ cells and gametes, such as spermatozoa, which could explain the transmission of diuron-induced DNA damage to offspring. Furthermore, immunostaining of early germ cells seems indicates that <b>damages</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>exposure</b> to diuron on germ line not only affect the current sexual cycle but also could affect future gametogenesis...|$|R

The aim of the current study is to observe the effect of CSE on biological behavior of EPCs and, further, to search for potential candidate agent in protection of proliferation of EPCs against the <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> CSE <b>exposure</b> in vitro. Methods. The proliferations of EPCs isolated from bone marrow of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were assessed by MTT after incubating the EPCs with a series of concentrations of CSE (1. 0 %, 2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, and 10. 0 %) for different times (3, 6, and 24 hours) as well as with 1. 0 % CSE in presence of 5 -AZA-CdR for 24 hours. Results. The proliferations of EPCs were significantly enhanced after 3 hours of exposure to concentrations of 1. 0 % and 2. 5 % CSE but depressed when exposed to concentrations of 5. 0 % and 10. 0 % CSE.

30|$|Temperature {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} environmental factors affecting the growth and development of E. coli. In protein expression systems based on E. coli, temperature affects both induction and protein expression. Although it was found that lower temperatures favor more lycopene formation (Kim et al. 2009; Vadali et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2004), when the strain EBI was grown at 37 ¬†¬∞C the lycopene content and DCW were both higher than at either 30 or 25 ¬†¬∞C. Low temperatures decrease the rate of nutrient consumption, and thus some metabolic processes, such as protein synthesis, slow down. Conversely, appropriately high temperatures can promote cell growth, balance enzyme expression and increase the activities of enzymes. It is well-known that carotenoids are important for the protection against photo-oxidative damage in non-photosynthetic organisms. Many non-phototrophic bacteria and fungi rely on carotenoids for protection when growing exposed to light and air (Marova et al. 2012). As with other carotenoids, the stability of lycopene is affected by light. Under illumination, lycopene decomposes via isomerization and oxidation, which protects the cells from oxidative <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>exposure</b> to strong light, but also decreases the concentration of lycopene in the cells (Hern√°ndez-Almanza et al. 2016).|$|E

These studies reveal that the conditions used for structure determination by x-ray crystallography cause serious damage specifically to the metal-site structure. The x-ray absorption spectra show that the structure changes from one that is characteristic of a high-valent Mn 4 (III 2,IV 2) oxo-bridged Mn 4 Ca cluster to that of Mn(II) in aqueous solution. This damage to the metal site occurs at a dose that is more than one order of magnitude lower than the dose that results in loss of diffractivity and is commonly considered safe for protein crystallography. These results establish quantitative x-ray dose parameters that are applicable to redox-active metalloproteins.
