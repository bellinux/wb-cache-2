40|$|With {{the recent}} {{volatility}} in {{crude oil prices}} and widespread concern regarding global warming, there is increased need for finding sustainable alternatives to petrochemical based fuels. One way to achieve this objective is through the production of biofuels such as ethanol by microbial fermentation. In this context, this study focuses on the anaerobic fermentation of renewable substrates; glycerol and lignocellulosic sugar mixtures {{for the production of}} ethanol by P. macerans. Further, metabolic flux analysis (MFA) was used as a systemwide tool to understand the role of various metabolic pathways in the fermentative utilization of these substrates. Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel and bioethanol production, which is an abundant, inexpensive and renewable substrate. In this study, we have shown that P. macerans can anaerobically ferment glycerol in the absence of external electron acceptors. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the fermentation samples identified the production of ethanol, formate, acetate, succinate, and 1, 2 -propanediol (1, 2 -PDO) from glycerol. Use of U- 13 C glycerol as substrate demonstrated the incorporation of glycerol in the cell biomass. <b>Glycerol</b> <b>fermentation</b> was stimulated in a medium formulation with low concentrations of potassium and phosphate, cultivation at acidic pH, and the use of a CO 2 -enriched atmosphere. Since the consumption of reducing equivalents in the production of 1, 2 -PDO balances the reducing equivalents generated in the production of cell biomass, the synthesis of ethanol and 1, 2 -PDO are proposed to be a metabolic determinant of <b>glycerol</b> <b>fermentation</b> in P. macerans. Hexose and pentose sugars make the largest portion of lignocellulosic biomass, which is the ideal substrate for the production of biofuels. Most microorganisms can not utilize hexose and pentose sugars simultaneously. In this study, we have shown that P. macerans N 234 A can ferment hexose (glucose) and pentose (xylose and arabinose) sugars individually in the absence of external electron acceptors. Additionally, we have shown that P. macerans N 234 A can simultaneously utilize the three sugars of lignocellulosic biomass. We have also identified the factors pH and temperature, which improve the simultaneous sugar utilization by this microorganism.

40|$|In the past, the {{fermentation}} {{activity of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae in substrates {{with a high}} concentration of sucrose (HSuc), such as sweet bread doughs, has been linked inversely to invertase activity of yeast strains. The present work defines the limits of the relationship between invertase activity and fermentation in hyperosmotic HSuc medium. Fourteen polyploid, wild-type strains of S. cerevisiae with different invertase levels gave a similar ranking of fermentation activity in HSuc and in medium in which glucose and fructose replaced sucrose (HGF medium). Thus, invertase is unlikely {{to be the most important}} determinant of fermentation in sweet doughs. Yeasts produce the compatible solute-osmoprotective compound glycerol when exposed to hyperosmotic environments. Under low sugar concentrations (and nonstressing osmotic pressure), there was no correlation between <b>glycerol</b> and <b>fermentation</b> activities. However, there was a strong correlation between the ability of yeasts to ferment in HSuc or HGF medium and their capacity to produce and retain glycerol intracellularly. There was also a strong correlation between intracellular <b>glycerol</b> and <b>fermentation</b> activity of yeasts in a medium in which the nonfermentable sugar alcohol sorbitol replaced most of the sugars (HSor), but the ability to produce and retain glycerol was greater when yeasts were incubated in HGF medium under the same osmotic pressure. The difference between the amounts of glycerol produced and retained in HSor and in HGF media varied with strains. This implies that high fermentable sugar concentrations cause physiological conditions that allow for enhanced glycerol production and retention, the degree of which is strain dependent. In conclusion, one important prerequisite for yeast strains to ferment media with high concentrations of sugar is the ability to synthesize glycerol and especially to retain it...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the mathematical modeling {{of two new}} Escherichia coli platforms with economical potential {{for the production of}} biofuels and chemicals, namely <b>glycerol</b> <b>fermentation</b> and the reversal of the β-oxidation cycle. With the increase in traditional fuel prices, alternative renewable energy sources are needed, and the efficient production of biofuels becomes imperative. So far studies have focused on using glucose as feedstock for the production of ethanol and other fuels, but a recent increase in glycerol availability and its consequent decrease in price make it an attractive feedstock. Furthermore, the reversed β-oxidation cycle is a highly efficient mechanism for the synthesis of long-chain products. These two platforms have been reported experimentally in E. coli but their mathematical modeling is presented for the first time here. Because mathematical models have proved to be useful in the optimization of microbial metabolism, two complementary models were used in this study: kinetic and stoichiometric. Kinetic models can identify the control structure within a specific pathway, but they require highly detailed information, making them applicable to small sets of reactions. In contrast, stoichiometric models require only mass balance information, making them suitable for genome-scale modeling to study the effect of adding or removing reactions for the optimization of the synthesis of desired products. To study <b>glycerol</b> <b>fermentation,</b> a kinetic model was implemented, allowing prediction of the limiting enzymes of this process: glycerol dehydrogenase and di-hydroxyacetone kinase. This prediction was experimentally validated by increasing their enzymatic activities, resulting in a two-fold increase in the rate of ethanol production.

One of these strains, P. macerans N 234 A, grew fermentatively on glycerol at a maximum specific growth rate of 0. 40 h 1 and was chosen for further characterization. The use of [U- 13 C]glycerol and further analysis of extracellular metabolites and proteinogenic amino acids via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy allowed identification of ethanol, formate, acetate, succinate, and 1, 2 -propanediol (1, 2 -PDO) as fermentation products and demonstrated that glycerol is incorporated into cellular components.

The incorporation of glycerol in cellular biomass was also investigated via nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of cultures in which either 50 % U- 13 C-labeled or 100 % unlabeled glycerol was used.

Recently, a study demonstrating the possibility of utilizing crude glycerol in fermentative butanol production has been published (Taconi et al. [2009]). However, growth and productivity were significantly lower compared to results obtained from fermentation of pure glycerol. In order to achieve a high productivity, upstream purification has been successfully applied (Venkataramanan et al. [2012]; Jensen et al. [2012]). Another approach is to develop strains capable of coping with the toxicity of the crude glycerol. To construct/develop such an organism a directed or a random approach can be used. Even though directed strain improvement by systems metabolic engineering may be necessary as reported by (Lee et al. [2005]) and Lee et al. ([2008]) {{the lack of a}} complete genome sequence and adequate tools limits the application on C. pasteurianum.|$|E
40|$|Crude {{glycerin}} {{has increased}} in availability as a feedstock for cattle {{as a result of}} expansion of the biodiesel industry in the United States. This byproduct, when ingested by cattle, is fermented by ruminal bacteria to yield volatile fatty acids that are used as sources of energy by cattle. The primary component of crude glycerin is <b>glycerol,</b> and the <b>fermentation</b> of <b>glycerol</b> is carried out by specific populations of microorganisms. Anecdotal observations from our previous research with crude glycerin in feedlot cattle have suggested that a period of adaptation may be necessary to achieve optimal utilization of the byproduct. Our objective in this study was to evaluate this adaptive response by measuring in vitro digestion by ruminal microbes that were obtained from cattle fed diets with or without added glycerin...|$|R
40|$|Various {{strains of}} {{oleaginous}} microorganisms, mainly fungi and yeast, {{have been widely}} used for the production of single cell oil (SCO) rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids or having an exceptional triacylglycerol structure. Difficulties for industrial scale production are related to the high cost of fermentation and oil extraction. The quantity of oil accumulated per unit of dry cellular mass is a critical factor that influences the final cost of SCO. The economics of these bioprocess become more favourable when zero or negative value waste substrates are utilized as carbon or nitrogen sources. Although utilisation of crude <b>glycerol</b> in the <b>fermentation</b> medium without prior purification offers a remarkable advantage against the traditional use of pure glycerol as substrate only few reports have appeared in the literature on the use of this substrate as sole carbon sources. The aim of current investigation was to assess the potentialities of valorisation of crude glycerol and lard, residues used as a carbon source by Yarrowia lipolytica strain in order to the production of SCO. Batch fermentations in 1 -L Erlenmeyer flasks were performed using pure glycerol, crude glycerol and lard as carbon sources, with different concentrations (20 g/L, 50 g/L and 80 g/L). Y. lipolytica W 29 was pre-grown overnight in YPD medium, centrifuged and resuspended in each carbon source medium, supplemented with yeast extract (0. 5 g/L). The production of SCO was carried out during 168 h at 27 ºC and 185 rpm. Yeast cells were able to grown on all carbon sources, although a slight inhibition with 80 g/L of pure and crude glycerol was observed. No significant differences on final cell dry weight were noted between the carbon sources, reaching approximately 5 g/L. The increase in carbon source concentration leads to an improvement in lipid accumulation inside the cells. The highest amount of reserve lipid was observed in medium with lard 80 g/L (21. 3 % of cell dry weight). The strain showed the tendency to degrade its storage lipids when grown on 20 g/L of each carbon sources, probably due to the early consumption of substrate. Crude <b>glycerol</b> batch <b>fermentation</b> at 50 g/L in a 2 -L bioreactor led to an accumulation of lipid content inside the cells of 37 % cell dry weight. The {{results of this study suggest}} that SCO could be produced by Y. lipolytica W 29 using low-cost substrates, such as crude glycerol and lard...|$|R
40|$|Crude {{glycerin}} as {{by-product of}} bio diesel fuels. For every 1 ton of biodiesel produced, approximately 100 kg of glycerol is also created. It is unworthily waste for most small-scale producers {{due to the}} large investment in technology necessary for the refining process, although {{it is possible to}} refine crude glycerin into a marketable product. In order to reuse it efficiently, we conducted a field trial to confirm an effect of crude glycerol as an accelerator material in composting of felled wood tips. Addition of 1 % and 10 % of crude <b>glycerol</b> gave high <b>fermentation</b> temperature by 5 ℃ and 10 ℃ than that of control for one month. As a result of fertilizer component analysis, crude glycerol treated compost has equivalent components to control. Furthermore, crude glycerol treated compost showed fertilizer efficacy as well as control in germination and growth test of carrot and Komatsu's green...|$|R
