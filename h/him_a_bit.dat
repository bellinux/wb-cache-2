While in a coma, Hawk has a dream that he was finally retiring and settling down with his wife Carolee, who in reality was long dead. He then visits Cobra Commander in prison, and the two argue before Cobra Commander moves from the shadows to reveal Hawk's face. When Hawk wakes up, he learns that he has an unretractable bullet lodged in his spine, which has left him paralyzed below the waist. This experience makes <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> crazed, intensifying his hatred for Cobra Commander. Unknown to Hawk, it was not Cobra Commander that shot him, for Zartan had switched places with the Commander shortly before the incident.|$|E

25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he felt like he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{moved into}} Terry Hunt's Athletic Club in Hollywood {{where he lived}} until 1948. Hollywood writer David [...] "Spec" [...] McClure befriended Murphy, [...] collaborating with him on Murphy's 1949 book To Hell and Back. McClure used his {{connections}} to get Murphy a $500 bit part in Texas, Brooklyn and Heaven. The agent of Wanda Hendrix, whom he had been dating since 1946, got <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> part in the 1948 Alan Ladd film Beyond Glory directed by John Farrow. His 1949 film Bad Boy gave him his first leading role. The film's financial backers refused to bankroll the project unless Murphy was given the lead; thus, Allied Artists put aside their reservations about using an inexperienced actor {{and gave him the}} starring role.|$|E
500|$|He bemoaned the Conservatives {{when they}} were in Opposition, criticising Michael Howard in particular: [...] "I knew Michael Howard {{was going to be a}} {{disaster}} as soon as he opposed top-up fees, either out of sentimentality or calculated expediency so that it might get <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of the student vote...Instead of backing Tony Blair, causing revolution in the Labour Party, the Conservatives have been whoring after strange gods, coming up with increasingly strange policies." [...] He likened Gordon Brown to the fictional Kenneth Widmerpool, continuing, [...] "It seems to me that with Brown there is a complete sense of humour and charm bypass."

2500|$|Bright {{was dropped}} {{for the second}} test against England in favour of Ian Chappell. He only took seven first class wickets over the summer {{at an average of}} 63.85. Greg Chappell thought this was a delayed {{reaction}} to [...] "intimidatory batting" [...] during World Series Cricket. [...] "A lot of spinners would probably have wilted in WSC but Brighty stood up to it well. WSC, though, probably changed his game a bit, got him bowling a bit more defensively and it eventually cost <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of his bite.

2500|$|Atlantic rests under [...] {{of water}} near Long Point. That fall, diver John Green {{was hired by}} American Express to dive the wreck and {{retrieve}} Atlantic safe and money known {{to be in a}} cabin, but his attempts failed. In 1855, Green returned with the schooner Yorktown, located the safe, and moved it out to the deck of Atlantic. But Green contracted a near-fatal case of the bends and was taken to a hospital; he was in recovery until the summer of 1856. When he returned to the wreck on 1 July he found the safe and money were gone. Another diver, Eliot Harrington, had found them both and hauled them to the surface. $36,700 was taken from Atlantic safe, at a time when a decent wage was a dollar a day. American Express went to court for the money; the ending settlement gave Harrington and the four others who worked with <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> under $2000 each, with American Express taking the rest.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{conventional}} in Herodotus's day for {{authors to}} [...] "publish" [...] their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to Lucian, Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games {{and read the}} entire Histories to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause {{at the end of}} it. According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian, Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of shade [...] by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression [...] "Herodotus and his shade" [...] to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus's recitation at Olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story {{to be found in the}} Suda: that of Photius and Tzetzes, in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy's father, [...] "Your son's soul yearns for knowledge." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{returning}} {{from high school}} one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past {{a group of us}} into a farmer's yard looking for a drink of water. The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn't recognize it so we cornered it. I hopped on the horse's back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. Where did you find him?" [...] I said, [...] "About four miles from here." [...] "How did you know you should come here?" [...] I said, [...] "I didn't know. The horse knew.

2500|$|Following his win in Hong Kong A Shin Hikari {{was off the}} racecourse for {{six months}} before being sent to France for the Prix d'Ispahan on 24 May. The race was run at Chantilly Racecourse as its usual venue, Longchamp, was being redeveloped. He was made the 7.4/1 fourth choice behind New Bay, Dariyan (Prix Ganay) and Vadamos (Prix du Muguet) whilst the other five runners {{included}} the Grand Prix de Paris winner Erupt. Racing on heavy ground he settled in second place behind Vadamos {{before going to the}} front 400 metres from the finish. He drew further and further away from his rivals in the straight and crossed the line ten lengths clear of Dariyan. After the race Sakaguchi said [...] "I had imagined he would jump to the front and lead the race, so I was surprised, but it was good judgement by Yutaka to run <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> away from the rail where the ground was not as bad. It was great to see that he could settle and race from second place, as well as win with that style. We can now proudly hold our heads high and go to England for the Royal Ascot meeting". Bookmakers responded by making the horse favourite for the Prince of Wales's Stakes. In the June 2016 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings A Shin Hikari was rated the best horse in the world, three pounds ahead of California Chrome and Winx.|$|E

2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] and when I looked up Harbahjan was right in my face giving me the finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at the most I would have given <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E

The lead, Reiji, is a complete smug and arrogant fool right from the beginning.
