5000|$|Goldsmith and Wu {{describe}} key {{changes in}} {{control over the}} Internet {{that occurred in the}} 1990s, beginning with consolidation of power by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1990s. A DoD subcontractor called Network Solutions, Inc., became the ultimate authority over <b>Internet</b> <b>naming</b> conventions in 1991. Although Postel remained functionally in control for a few more years, [...] "the transfer of partial authority to Network Solutions was a crucial turning point in Internet history. For the first time, administration of part of the <b>Internet's</b> <b>naming</b> system would {{be in the hands of}} a for-profit company" [...] (35).|$|R

40|$|The <b>Internet</b> Domain <b>Name</b> System (DNS) is an {{essential}} part of the Internet infrastructure. Each web site or email lookup involves traversing a tree-structured distributed database to complete the mapping from a hostname to an IP address. The root and top level domain (TLD) nameservers form the highest level of authority over the <b>Internet</b> <b>naming</b> hierarchy, and are thus potentially involved in reaching any and every URL or email address we seek. We use passive measurements to analyze performance of these critical nameservers from a client network's viewpoint...|$|R
50|$|A system {{administrator}} usually configures the operating system's name services using the file /etc/nsswitch.conf. This lists databases (such as passwd, shadow and group) {{and one or}} more sources for obtaining that information. Examples for sources are files for local files, ldap for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, nis for the Network Information Service, nisplus for NIS+, and wins for Windows <b>Internet</b> <b>Name</b> Service.|$|E
50|$|A DNS zone is {{implemented}} in the configuration system of a domain name server. Historically, it is defined in the zone file, an operating system text file that starts with the special DNS record type Start of Authority (SOA) and contains all records for the resources described within the zone. This format was originally used by the Berkeley <b>Internet</b> <b>Name</b> Domain Server (BIND) software package, and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035.|$|E
50|$|The {{format of}} a zone file {{is defined in}} RFC 1035 (section 5) and RFC 1034 (section 3.6.1).

50|$|The {{software}} was originally designed at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) {{in the early}} 1980s. The name originates as an acronym of Berkeley <b>Internet</b> <b>Name</b> Domain, reflecting the application's use within UCB. The software consists, most prominently, of the DNS server component, called named, a contracted form of name daemon. In addition the suite contains various administration tools, and a DNS resolver interface library. The latest version of BIND is BIND 9, first released in 2000.|$|E
50|$|GB 18030 is a Chinese {{government}} standard, {{described as}} Information technology — Chinese {{coded character set}} and defines the required language and character support necessary for software in China. GB18030 is the registered <b>Internet</b> <b>name</b> for the official character set of the People's Republic of China (PRC) superseding GB2312. As a Unicode Transformation Format (i.e. an encoding of all Unicode code points) compatible with legacy encodings including GB2312, CP936, and GBK 1.0, GB18030 supports both simplified and traditional Chinese characters.|$|E
5000|$|On January 28, 1998, Postel, as a test, emailed {{eight of}} the twelve {{operators}} of Internet's regional root nameservers on his own authority and instructed them to change the root zone server from then SAIC subsidiary Network Solutions (NSI)'s A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (198.41.0.4) to IANA's DNSROOT.IANA.ORG (198.32.1.98). The operators complied with Postel's instructions, thus dividing control of <b>Internet</b> <b>naming</b> between the non-government operators with IANA and the 4 remaining U.S. Government roots at NASA, DoD, and BRL with NSI. Though usage of the Internet was not interrupted, he soon received orders from senior government officials to undo this change, which he did. [...] Within a week, the US NTIA issued A proposal to improve technical management of <b>Internet</b> <b>names</b> and addresses, including changes to authority over the Internet DNS root zone, which ultimately, and controversially, increased U.S. control.|$|R

Since its initial release in 1993, GBK has been extended by Microsoft in Code page 936/1386, which was then extended into GBK 1.0.
