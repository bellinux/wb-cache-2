25|$|Chloroplasts {{have their}} own genome, which encodes a number of {{thylakoid}} proteins. However, {{during the course of}} plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial endosymbiotic ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the cell nucleus took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper stoichiometry and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, transcription of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by light. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by phosphorylation via redox-sensitive kinases in the thylakoid membranes. The translation rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by {{the presence or absence of}} assembly partners (control by <b>epistasy</b> of synthesis). This mechanism involves negative feedback through binding of excess protein to the 5' untranslated region of the chloroplast mRNA. Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain. The redox state of the electron carrier plastoquinone in the thylakoid membrane directly affects the transcription of chloroplast genes encoding proteins of the reaction centers of the photosystems, thus counteracting imbalances in the electron transfer chain.|$|E

MCA 1 proteolysis appears to be critical for the assembly-dependent regulation of cytochrome f synthesis, known as Control by <b>Epistasy</b> of Synthesis, which tightly couples its expression to that of its assembly partners...|$|E

The phenotypes of these strains {{reflected}} the <b>epistasy</b> of earlier blocking mutants over later ones and confirmed {{the order of}} gene sequence predicted from the phenotypes of single mutants. Oligosporo-genous mutants gave complex interactions, especially between brl and med mutants. These results indicated that (i) gene action overlapped in time, (ii) several parts of the conidial apparatus were interchangeable and (iii) nuclei leaving the vesicle were not irreversibly programmed. Structures produced by mutants were reminiscent of the conidial apparatus of other Aspergillus species and of related genera...|$|E
40|$|Photosystem I {{comprises}} 13 subunits in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, four of which—the major reaction center I subunits PsaA and PsaB, PsaC and PsaJ—are chloroplast genome-encoded. We {{demonstrate that}} PSI biogenesis involves an assembly-governed regulation of {{synthesis of the}} major chloroplast-encoded subunits where the presence of PsaB is required to observe significant rates of PsaA synthesis {{and the presence of}} PsaA is required to observe significant rates of PsaC synthesis. Using chimeric genes expressed in the chloroplast, we show that these regulatory processes correspond to autoregulation of translation for PsaA and PsaC. The downregulation of translation occurs at some early stage since it arises from the interaction between unassembled PsaA and PsaC polypeptides and 5 ′ untranslated regions of psaA and psaC mRNAs, respectively. These assembly-dependent autoregulations of translation represent two new instances of a control by <b>epistasy</b> of synthesis process {{that turns out to be}} a general feature of protein expression in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii...|$|E
40|$|The {{unicellular}} green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas) {{has become}} a popular organism for research in diverse areas of cell biology and genetics because of its simple life cycle, ease of growth and manipulation for genetic analysis, genomic resources, and transformability of the nucleus and both organelles. Mating strains is a common practice when genetic approaches are used in Chlamydomonass, to create vegetative diploids for analysis of dominance, or following tetrad dissection to ascertain nuclear vs. organellar inheritance, to test allelism, to analyze <b>epistasy,</b> or to generate populations {{for the purpose of}} map-based cloning. Additionally, genetic crosses are routinely used to combine organellar genotypes with particular nuclear genotypes. Here we demonstrate standard methods for gametogenesis, mating, zygote germination and tetrad separation. This protocol consists of an easy-to-follow series of steps that will make genetic approaches amenable to scientists who are less familiar with Chlamydomonas. Key parameters and trouble spots are explained. Finally, resources for further information and alternative methods are provided...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{thylakoid}} membrane of chloroplasts contains {{four major}} protein complexes, {{involved in the}} photosynthetic electron transfer chain and in ATP synthesis. These complexes are built from {{a large number of}} polypeptide subunits encoded either in the nuclear or in the plastid genome. In this review, we are considering the mechanism that couples assembly (association of the polypeptides {{with each other and with}} their cofactors) with the upstream and downstream steps of the biogenetic pathway, translation and proteolytic degradation. We present the contrasting images of assembly that have emerged from a variety of approaches (studies of photosynthesis mutants, developmental studies and direct biochemical analysis of the kinetics of assembly). We develop the concept of control by <b>epistasy</b> of synthesis, through which the translation of certain subunits is controlled by the state of assembly of the complex and address the question of its mechanisms. We describe additional factors that assist in the integration and assembly of thylakoid membrane proteins. © 2000 Société française de biochimie et biologie moléculaire / Éditions scientifiques et médicale...|$|E
40|$|Epistasis {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the genetic architecture of common human diseases. Most complex diseases are believed to have multiple contributing loci that often have subtle patterns which make them fairly difficult to find in large data sets. Disorders that follow purely epistatic models cannot be detected by cases/control studies based on individual analysis of susceptible loci. The computational complexity of performing exhaustive searches for detecting such models in genome-wide applications is practically unfeasible. Furthermore, with ever-increasing number of both genotypes and individuals on one side, and little knowledge of complex traits on the other, it is becoming fairly difficult and time consuming to perform systematic genome-wide studies on such traits. We present and discuss a convenient framework for modelling epistasis using information theoretic concepts and algorithms inspired by such an approach. These generalised algorithms, which are especially in favour of purely epistatic models, are applied to both simulated and real data. The real data represents the genotype-phenotype values for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) disease. Many two-locus purely epistatic patterns were found for AMD. A new visualisation approach is also presented for the purpose of better illustrating <b>epistasy</b> for cases where the number of loci is more than two or three...|$|E
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, AMP {{biosynthesis}} genes (ADE genes) are transcriptionally activated in {{the absence}} of extracellular purines by the Bas 1 p and Bas 2 p (Pho 2 p) transcription factors. We now show that expression of the ADE genes is low in mutant strains affected in the first seven steps of the pathway, while it is constitutively derepressed in mutant strains affected in later steps. Combined with <b>epistasy</b> studies, these results show that 5 ′-phosphoribosyl- 4 -succinocarboxamide- 5 -aminoimidazole (SAICAR), an intermediate metabolite of the pathway, is needed for optimal activation of the ADE genes. Two-hybrid studies establish that SAICAR is required to promote interaction between Bas 1 p and Bas 2 p in vivo, while in vitro experiments suggest that the effect of SAICAR on Bas 1 p-Bas 2 p interaction could be indirect. Importantly, feedback inhibition by ATP of Ade 4 p, catalyzing the first step of the pathway, appears to regulate SAICAR synthesis in response to adenine availability. Consistently, both ADE 4 dominant mutations and overexpression of wild-type ADE 4 lead to deregulation of ADE gene expression. We conclude that efficient transcription of yeast AMP biosynthesis genes requires interaction between Bas 1 p and Bas 2 p which is promoted {{in the presence of a}} metabolic intermediate whose synthesis is controlled by feedback inhibition of Ade 4 p acting as the purine nucleotide sensor within the cell...|$|E
40|$|A {{process that}} we refer to as control by <b>epistasy</b> of {{synthesis}} (CES process) occurs during chloroplast protein biogenesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: the synthesis of some chloroplast-encoded subunits, the CES subunits, is strongly attenuated when some other subunits from the same complex, the dominant subunits, are missing. Herein we investigate the molecular basis of the CES process for the biogenesis of the cytochrome b 6 f complex and show that negative autoregulation of cytochrome f translation occurs {{in the absence of}} other complex subunits. This autoregulation is mediated by an interaction, either direct or indirect, between the 5 ′ untranslated region of petA mRNA, which encodes cytochrome f, and the C-terminal domain of the unassembled protein. This model for the regulation of cytochrome f translation explains both the decreased rate of cytochrome f synthesis in vivo in the absence of its assembly partners and its increase in synthesis when significant accumulation of the C-terminal domain of the protein is prevented. When expressed from a chimeric mRNA containing the atpA 5 ′ untranslated region, cytochrome f no longer showed an assembly-dependent regulation of translation. Conversely, the level of antibiotic resistance conferred by a chimeric petA-aadA-rbcL gene was shown to depend on the state of assembly of cytochrome b 6 f complexes and on the accumulation of the C-terminal domain of cytochrome f. We discuss the possible ubiquity of the CES process in organellar protein biogenesis...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo foi avaliar, por simulação de dados, a eficiência de dialelos circulantes em relação aos completos, nas estimativas de capacidade geral de combinação (CGC) e capacidade específica de combinação (CEC). Foram simuladas 50 linhagens com 100 genes com distribuição independente, efeitos iguais, sem epistasia. Consideraram-se herdabilidades de 10 %, 20 %, 50 % e 75 %, em modelos com interação alélica aditiva e dominância completa. Utilizaram-se também dados de experimentos disponíveis na literatura, ambos comparados por meio de: correlação entre estimativas de CGC e CEC, e proporções de estimativas nos circulantes que ocorreram nos intervalos de confiança dos completos. Os resultados permitiram concluir que os dialelos circulantes são tão eficientes quanto os completos, tanto na classificação dos pais quanto à CGC e à CEC, como na {{magnitude}} desses parâmetros, e que o número de cruzamentos (s) afeta as estimativas de CGC e de CEC, embora com um valor pequeno de s seja possível obter boa concordância com as estimativas obtidas nos dialelos completos; com baixa herdabilidade, é vantajoso aumentar o número de cruzamentos de cada pai, embora com a metade do número de pais envolvidos já se consiga alta eficiência dos dialelos circulantes. This paper {{aimed to}} evaluate the efficiency of circulant diallel {{in relation to the}} complete ones, with data simulation based on estimates of general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA). Fifty lines with 100 independent genes of same effects and without <b>epistasy</b> were simulated. Heritabilities of 10 %, 20 %, 50 % and 75 % were considered, in models with addictive and complete dominant allelic interaction. Real data experiments presented in literature were used. They were compared by means of correlation between estimates of GCA and SCA, and also by means of proportions of estimates in the circulant that occurred in the confidence intervals of the complete ones. It was concluded that the efficiency is the same in both diallels, considering the parents classification in relation to GCA and SCA, and the magnitude of those parameters; that the number of crossings (s) affects the estimates of GCA and SCA, although with a small value of s it is possible to obtain good agreement with the estimates of the complete diallel; and, that with low heritability it is advantageous {{to increase the number of}} each parent crossings, although with the half of the number of parents involved, high efficiency of the circulant diallels is reached...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} an intelligent system for financial planning and cashflow optimization named ICF: Intelligent Cash Flow. ICF is a computational tool for decision support which provides short-term and long-term financial managing strategies, considering financial {{products of the}} market. The ICF system makes use of Genetic Algorithms to elaborate cash flow projections which improve the company's profit for a specific period. ICF helps {{to deal with the}} complex aspects of cash flow planning: the large number of alternatives to consider, i. e. the mix of investments which offer the higher profit rates over a period; the intensive numerical processing involved; the dynamic changes in the Financial Market (e. g. rates, terms and tax regulations); and the changes in the company's daily financial position. The ICF system integrates two models: the financial and the genetic models. The financial model is used to calculate the cash flow profitability, based on the IDC (Interbank Deposit Certificate), by projecting profits and taxes for each kind of investment, for any term in the considered period. The genetic model, on the other hand, is used to search for cash flow plannings which promote profitability and liquidity. The chromosome of the ICF genetic model consists of n genes. Each gene stands for a day in the considered period and has four fields. The first two identify an investment option and its term; the last two identify a resource taking option and its term. For each analyzed day, only two of these fields are used, which depends whether the operational balance is positive or negative that day. According to the Evolutionary Computation theory, problems such as the optimization of the cash flow are highly epistatic, which means that there is a strong interdependency between genes of the respective representation (for example, the investment on day d depends on the availability of financial resources that day, which can be due to the redemption made on day d-n). Such genes consist of genetic patterns that can be set apart by the crossover operator. In order to deal with the <b>epistasy</b> in this problem, the chromosome has been adapted in way that each gene is represented by its allele and by its locus (position in the chromosome). This kind of representation has the objective to relax the positional rigidity of the genes, increasing the chances of distant interdependent genes to come closer to each other. Thus, genetic patterns with high fitness have more chances to proliferate in forthcoming generations. To manipulate this chromosome structure we have employed an extension of the partially-mapped crossover (PMX) operator proposed by Goldberg, which explores important similarities of value and order simultaneously. The mutation operator applied in the ICF implements a random choice of a gene (day) and the random assignment of a new term and a new type of financial application (investment or loan). The fitness function calculates the liquid returns (profit or tax) of each suggested application/loan for each day in the considered period, projected to {{the last day of the}} same. A more satisfactory planning is obtained by finding the maximum return value to this function. ICF has been tested and is currently in use by a Brazilian company. The model manages to find cash flow plannings which present profits, in average, 38 % higher during evolution, making evident the importance of a such decision-supporting system. Comparing to the random search, the ICF in average leads to profits 50 % higher. Many experiments were made for different periods of the year. The results show that the profitability is obviously affected by the company's operational balance, but it is also strongly influenced by the planning strategy. In this point, the ICF was capable of identifying strategies, with matched operations of application and redemption, which increased the cashbox in days of the flow, in which there was the option of highly profitable investments. ...|$|E
