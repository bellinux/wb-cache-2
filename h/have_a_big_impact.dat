5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tesla Motors, almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they {{play a crucial role}} in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on how someone feels about a prospective purchase. Sales people have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars while they do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales. As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting this new technology.|$|E
5|$|Sir Alex Ferguson {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the starting line-up for Paul Scholes, after the midfielder had missed the 1999 final through suspension. Ferguson made one change from the team that had beaten Wigan Athletic to secure the league title 10 days earlier, with Owen Hargreaves starting {{on the right side of}} midfield in a 4–4–2 formation in place of Park Ji-sung, who did not even make the substitutes bench despite starting both legs of the semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo started on the left wing, where he was pitted against makeshift Chelsea right-back Michael Essien. This went against the prediction of The Guardians David Pleat, who thought a duel between Ronaldo and Ashley Cole would be key to the final. Ferguson hoped his substitutes might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on the match, just as Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær did in 1999, when the pair came off the bench to help Manchester United come from behind and beat Bayern Munich. A week before the game, Ryan Giggs was philosophical about his chances of being included in the starting line-up; he was eventually named as one of seven allowed substitutes.|$|E

500|$|Although not {{considered}} a [...] "ground breaking rule" [...] by some law reviewers, the case received responses from both proponents and opponents of gun control. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which was the only gun prevention group to file an amicus brief hailed the Court's decision as a victory over the “corporate gun lobby.” Dan Gross, {{the president of the}} Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated that the decision “will save lives by keeping guns {{out of the hands of}} dangerous people," [...] and that [...] "the Supreme Court rejected efforts by the corporate gun lobby to undermine federal gun laws, reaffirming that sensible laws can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> while being consistent with the Second Amendment.” Adam Winkler, writing for New Republic, also supported the ruling, stating that it is a [...] "relief to law enforcement." [...] However, others, like the National Rifle Association (NRA), [...] criticized the ruling, stating that it [...] "seemingly allows the government to require virtually any information it wants from a person buying a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, whether or not that information has any relationship to public safety or the policies of federal law." [...] John Lott, a gun rights advocate, criticized the Court's statement that collecting this [...] "information helps to fight serious crime," [...] claiming that registration doesn’t help solve crimes, since registered guns are rarely left at the scene. He noted, for example, that Hawaii's requirement to register guns hasn't solved a single crime in 50 years, though Lott cited no evidence to support his claim. According to Lott, the Court [...] "confirmed a horrible injustice, with no understanding of how gun tracing works, and without producing any increased safety for Americans." [...] A Harvard Law Review case note contended that, as a matter of law, the word [...] "person" [...] was properly interpreted by the majority, thus avoiding [...] "gutting key provisions of the statute," [...] and argued, against the dissent, that the majority's interpretation is also consistent with common English. However, the case note argued that a narrower reading of the second count was more appropriate, because the statute explicitly requires the name age and residence, and not anything else. Thus, the law review concluded, the Supreme Court established an unnecessary precedent.|$|E
