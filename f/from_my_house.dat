And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E

By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E

The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010, and according to West, {{is a response to}} thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. [...] "The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'.

500|$|The burning {{aeroplane}} in the book's opening, and the suspicions {{it immediately}} arouses, quickly introduces {{the problems of}} terrorism and international security. The day's political demonstration and the ubiquity of its news coverage provide background noise to Perowne's day, leading to him to ponder his relationship with these events. Christopher Hitchens {{pointed out that the}} novel is set on the [...] "actual day the whole of bien-pensant Britain moved into the streets to jeer at George Bush and Tony Blair" [...] and placed the novel as [...] "unapologetically anchored {{as it is in the}} material world and its several discontents". The Economist newspaper set the context as a [...] "world where terrorism and war make headlines, but also filter into the smallest corners of people's lives." [...] McEwan said himself, [...] "The march gathered not far <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> and it bothered me that so many people seemed so thrilled to be there". The characterisation of Perowne as an intelligent, self-aware man: [...] "..a habitual observer of his own moods' [...] is given to reveries about his mental processes," [...] allows the author to explicitly set out this theme.|$|E

She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [...] she was very funny. We didn't have to [...] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks.|$|E
