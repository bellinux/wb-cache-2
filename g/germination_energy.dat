The experiment was set up at two pH levels of water solution (4. 00 and 6. 00) and temperature levels of 10 °C and 20 °C using rolled filter paper method. Significant difference between cultivars (p= 0. 01, p= 0. 05) was determined for <b>germination</b> <b>energy,</b> seed germination and hypocotyls length. Cultivar Slavonka had the highest average values for <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> and seed germination, and the lowest for hypocotyls length. Cultivar Vuka had the lowest <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> (but with the same germination as Stela) and the longest hypocotyls.

Analysis of hybrid seed of four commercial combinations derived at the Maize Research Institute, Zemun Polje, grown in three locations, were {{done on the}} working sample of 4 x 100 seeds under laboratory conditions. The experimental data was processed for the mean and total variability (X and C. V.) for both seed traits and for each test variant. The total average values of <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> and germination {{in the period of}} investigation amounted to 94. 5 % and 94. 8 %, respectively. The coefficient of variation for <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> was 0. 67 %, while for germination it was 0. 39 %. In the five-year study, the hybrid combination ZP 704 had the highest values of <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> (95. 9 %) and total germination (96. 3 %). Test results indicate that coefficients of variations for both observed traits over years were low, which points out to homogeneity of the material. Significant effects of factors (hybrid and location) and their interaction on observed seed properties were established by the analysis of variance.

To prevent this, various techniques are used: seed heat treatment, ultrasound treatment, brush cleaning and seed dressing with plant extracts or natural chemicals. In 2008, the efficiency of wheat seed treatment with the stone meal was tested and the results of preliminary investigation are presented. Two tests were performed using the official procedure for seed health testing. Test 1 : Heavily infected wheat seed was treated with the stone meal EKORAST (particle size < 0. 08 mm). Dry and wet treatment procedures were applied: both with 1, 2, 10 and 20 %. Heavy application (10 and 20 kg per 100 kg of seed) significantly increased <b>germination</b> and <b>energy</b> of wheat seed, and it was effective against bacterial pathogens and some fungi, but only partially effective against heavy infection of Fusarium spp. However, the amounts of stone meal (10 and 20 %) are practically not applicable, and adhesion of stone meal to the seed should be improved.

5000|$|Gibberellins are {{involved}} in the natural process of breaking dormancy and other aspects of germination. Before the photosynthetic apparatus develops sufficiently {{in the early stages of}} <b>germination,</b> the stored <b>energy</b> reserves of starch nourish the seedling. Usually in germination, the breakdown of starch to glucose in the endosperm begins shortly after the seed is exposed to water. Gibberellins in the seed embryo are believed to signal starch hydrolysis through inducing the synthesis of the enzyme α-amylase in the aleurone cells. In the model for gibberellin-induced production of α-amylase, it is demonstrated that gibberellins (denoted by GA) produced in the scutellum diffuse to the aleurone cells, where they stimulate the secretion α-amylase. [...] α-Amylase then hydrolyses starch, which is abundant in many seeds, into glucose that can be used in cellular respiration to produce energy for the seed embryo. Studies of this process have indicated gibberellins cause higher levels of transcription of the gene coding for the α-amylase enzyme, to stimulate the synthesis of α-amylase.|$|R

Increasing salinity concentrations significantly reduced germination percentage, seedling vigor index, coefficient of velocity, mean germination time, shoot and root length, shoot and root fresh and dry weight. It could be concluded that germination efficiency i. e. final germination percentage, <b>germination</b> index, <b>energy</b> of <b>germination,</b> mean germination time, abnormal seed percentage, root and shoot length, seedling total fresh and dry weight, dry weight reduction and shoot length reduction were gradually decreased significantly when salinity increased...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{a two-year}} {{investigation}} (2005 and 2006) for the yield {{and quality of}} fenugreek seed (Trigonella foenum graecum L) obtained on the location in South Banat (around Pančevo) on marsh dark soil are presented in the paper. Fenugreek seed used in this investigation was produced {{in the collection of}} the Institute of Medicinal Plant Research "Dr Josif Pančić" in Pančevo. The effect of sowing date on yield (kg/ha) and quality of fenugreek seed (<b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> and total germination) were investigated. Sowing was carried out on seven dates, 10 days between dates of each sowing. Yield of fenugreek seed sowed on different dates differed in both years. Sowing carried out in the first two weeks in April resulted in considerably higher yield compared to sowing at the end of April and during May. The highest yield was produced in the second sowing date from April 10, then in the first (April 1) and the third sowing period (April 20). The lowest yield of fenugreek seed was recorded in sowing carried out at the end of May. Yield of fenugreek seed wasn't significantly different in study years. Earlier dates of sowing resulted in seed of better quality (better <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> and total germination). In the second sowing date fenugreek seed obtained was of best <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> and total germination (approx. 99 %). Later sowing dates gave seed of lower quality. So, sowing carried out at the end of May resulted in seed with the lowest value of <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> and total germination (approx. 91 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} results of {{laboratory}} {{analyses of the}} traits of seeds (germination and <b>germination</b> <b>energy)</b> and seedlings (root and hypocotyl length, total seedling length) of the two perennial ryegrass cultivars: diploid ‘Bartwingo’and tetraploid ‘Calibra’ before and after 9 months of storage at the temperatures of 10 ºC, - 20 ºC and - 80 ºC in tightly sealed containers. Seed traits were significantly different at different temperatures (p= 0. 01). For both cultivars germination and <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> gained the best results at - 80 °C {{in comparison to the}} values before storage. Obtained values of the seedling traits tested were significantly lower after 9 months storage (p= 0. 01). For the ‘Bartwingo’ cultivar, the slightest difference in the values of seedling traits before storage was gained at 10 °C, while the ‘Calibra’ cultivar gained the same at - 20 °C. After 9 months storage at different temperatures the ‘Bartwingo’ diploid cultivar showed higher values of germination and <b>germination</b> <b>energy,</b> while the ‘Calibra’ tetraploid cultivar developed longer root and hypocotyl length, and total seedling length. Such investigations provide an opportunity for preserving perennial ryegrass seeds at lower temperatures in long term storage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} grain {{dressing}} with humic substances {{contained in the}} preparation Humistar (Humifirst) on the <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> and capacity, as well {{the dynamics of the}} initial growth and development of wheat and barley were assessed in laboratory study. It was showed that the application of the preparation did not affect the proportion of kernals germinating normally in the laboratory assessment of <b>germination</b> <b>energy</b> and capacity of the tested cereal species. Dressing barley grain with Humistar stimulated elongation and growth in the germ mass as early as {{in the first week of}} germination, and of the root mass in the second week. A positive effect of the preparation on the growth of wheat seedling fresh mass was observed after 14 and 21 days of development...|$|E
40|$|In the {{presented}} research, {{fatigue tests}} were conducted in which a load was applied in the from of a mechanic impact. In the authors opinion, {{it is the best}} method to simulate natural conditions, where grains are subjected to multiple stress during the entire technological cycle. Significant emphasis in relation to the quality of sowing material requires the application of precise me-thods for the assessment of changes in biological quality (usually estimated through the strength and <b>energy</b> of <b>germination)</b> in the course of technological processes. However, such analysis requires a number of germination tests. The presented research results are a continuation of the scholarly search aimed at defining an objective, rapid method for assessing the fatigue resistance of wheat grain. The fatigue measurements conformed to the methods proposed in part one. The statistical analysis was made to define the correlation between resistance indicators and corresponding values of <b>germination</b> capacity and <b>energy.</b> The above revealed that the index, calculated following the 5 th impact, best describes grain behavior - from the viewpoint of fatigue resistance...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} results of the study of seeds quality of two Polish native species of the genus Betula L. (Betula pendula Roth and Betula obscura Kotula), growing on the semi-natural (low human activities) and anthropogenic (high human activities) habitats. In this study the generative phase has been investigated to find differences between studied taxa and try to find out why population of B. obscura is very rare. In this research we have checked the quality of the seeds from B. obscura and B. pendula and test the survival of seedlings sowed into the ground researched in laboratory conditions. Results of germination capacity shown significant difference between trees from the anthropogenic and semi-natural sites; the energy capacity indicated significant difference between trees: B. pendula and B. obscura from all study areas. Mixed-model ANOVA/MANOVA for seedlings growth showed statistically important effects of factors (species, area, months). The results show that B. obscura grows better on the anthropogenic habitats than B. pendula, but the latter had more of the fully developed seeds and higher <b>germination</b> and seeds <b>energy</b> capacity...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{physical}} factors for preplant stimulation of seeds increases vigor, germination and improves the yield of agricultural products. One of the {{effective ways to}} improve seed grain quality is to impact on the seeds using physical factors, in particular, an alternating electromagnetic field of industrial frequency of 50 Hz (EMF of IF of 50 Hz). We studied the impact of EMF of IF of 50 Hz on the <b>energy</b> <b>germination</b> of mid-ripening spring barley seeds of promising varieties Vakula, Vikont, Ratnik. Carrying out the experimental studies we used a laboratory setup with annular pole points of rectangular cross section. Our disperse analysis resulted in data on germinative energy of seeds of spring barley varieties Vakula, Vikont, Ratnik, which showed that while treating seeds of spring barley by an alternating electromagnetic field of industrial frequency of 50 Hz, we obtained the best values of germinative energy of seeds of Variety Vikont with a mode of processing being equal to W = 16 %, T = 2 c, L = 0, 03...|$|R
