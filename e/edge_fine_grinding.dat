40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> is that problem {{connected}} with the reduction of a rock material to a size such that the valuable mineral it contains may be satisfactorily extracted. <b>Fine</b> <b>grinding</b> {{is perhaps the most}} significant process in any milling operation, and forms a commensurate percentage of the unit milling cost. There has been for many years a wide divergence of opinion as to what constitute best operating conditions in a grinding plant. This divergence of opinion was mainly {{due to a lack of}} suitable methods of measuring the true efficiency of <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> operations. The efficiency of a <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> or crushing operation is the ratio of the amount of useful crushing work done to the amount of work (power) applied to the crushing operation. Modern experimental technique has made it possible to measure both of these factors, and though this technique is not available to general practise, much more certain information is being obtained for use in general practise. [ [...] . ] This study has led to a knowledge of the amount of work (power) absorbed in actual crushing and grinding. The measurement of the amount of useful crushing work done was a source of embarrassment to <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> investigators for many years.

Six diets, fed as total mixed rations, were identical except for the corn portion of the diet. Corn treatments were dry shelled corn, high moisture ensiled ear corn, and high moisture ensiled shelled corn, either coarsely or finely ground. The experimental design was a 6 × 6 Latin square with 36 cows. Eighteen cows were assigned to the six different treatments and were fed once daily. Within this group of 18 cows, six had a ruminal cannula and were used to evaluate nutrient digestibilities and ruminal fermentation. The remaining 18 cows, six of which were ruminally cannulated, were similarly assigned, except they were fed twice daily. In the group fed once daily, milk production and composition were not affected by treatment. Starch digestibility was greater with the high moisture and with the finely ground corn treatments. In addition, the high moisture ensiled corn treatments had reduced ruminal ammonia concentrations. In the group that was fed twice daily, milk production and protein yield were greatest for the finely ground high moisture ensiled shelled corn treatment.

40|$|The mineral {{liberation size}} of {{run of mine}} ores has {{dramatically}} reduced over recent years. As a result, the demand for <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> {{which is the most}} energy-intensive form of grinding has markedly increased in the minerals industry. Furthermore, the <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> costs increase exponentially with decreasing product particle size. As a result of the increased energy requirement for <b>fine</b> <b>grinding,</b> it is desirable to optimise <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> processes such as stirred media milling (ie IsaMill) to enhance energy efficiency, throughput and the product fineness. In the present study, the influence of slurry rheology, grinding media type and grinding media-to-feed size ratio on energy efficiency in a pilotscale IsaMill was investigated under certain industrially relevant pulp processing conditions. It was shown that a critical rheological state existed, below which the energy required to achieve an 80 per cent passing (ie P 80) 20 μm product size was unaffected by shear rheology (ie apparent viscosity and shear yield stress) whilst above which the grinding energy required increased dramatically with increasing shear rheology. Colorado River sand (3. 35 mm) showed higher energy efficiency than MT 1 ceramic media (2. 5 mm) for a target P 80 of 20 μm in the solids concentration range of 38 to 55 per cent by weight, but the former experienced more than four times the wear rate of the later. The high wear rate of the Colorado River sand may be due to its much lower hardness. For feeds with an 80 per cent passing (ie F 80) 70 to 110 μm, 2. 0 or 2. 5 mm MT 1 media appeared to be more energy efficient than 3. 5 mm MT 1 media whilst a media-to-feed size ratio of 41 to 53 is applicable for ~ 50 μm (ie F 80) feeds for effi cient grinding...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMeasuring {{the action}} of energy on matter is a complex problem, {{especially}} in the case of granular materials.
