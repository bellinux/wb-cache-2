50|$|James Lind FRSE FRCPE (4 October 1716 - 13 July 1794) was a Scottish physician. He was {{a pioneer}} of naval hygiene in the Royal Navy.

He also proposed that fresh water could be obtained by distilling sea water. His work advanced the practice of preventive medicine and improved nutrition.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a synthesis of}} results from different studies on effects of air pollution on crops in two regions of northern (Po Plain) and central (Tuscany) Italy. The methodologies used were: (1) biological monitoring of ozone with indicator plants; (2) ambient air pollution exclusion experiments with open-top chambers; (3) controlled <b>fumigation</b> <b>with</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide in greenhouse chambers. The results so far obtained indicate that: (1) photochemical air pollution is widespread at a regional level in northern and central Italy at levels above the thresholds for phytotoxicity; (2) ambient oxidant pollution is probably causing significant biological effects and yield losses to various crop species in the Po Plain (these effects are in some cases coupled to the typical injury symptoms caused by ozone-brown stipples or foliar flecks). In contrast, sulphur dioxide fumigation only affects plant growth and physiology at levels above those usually experienced at rural sites. It can be concluded that O 3 {{seems to be the}} most important phytotoxic gas at a regional level in northern and central Italy, and that the impact of this pollutant on crops is worthy of further investigation...|$|E
