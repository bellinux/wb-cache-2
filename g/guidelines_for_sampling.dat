40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the activity of radionuclides in radioactive waste is required for its disposal in final repositories. Easy-to-measure nuclides, like γ-emitters and high-energy X-rays, can be measured via non-destructive nuclear techniques from outside a waste package. Some radionuclides are difficult-to-measure (DTM) from outside a package because they are α- or β-emitters. The present article discusses the application of linear regression, scaling factors (SF) and the so-called “mean activity method” to estimate the activity of DTM nuclides on metallic waste produced at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Various statistical sampling techniques including simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified and authoritative sampling are described and applied to 2 waste populations of activated copper cables. The bootstrap is introduced {{as a tool to}} estimate average activities and standard errors in waste characterization. The analysis of the DTM Ni- 63 is used as an example.

40|$|Abstract – A pulp {{suspension}} {{flowing in}} a pipe {{has a tendency}} to form a profile: The properties of the pulp vary significantly in a cross-section of the flow. This causes problems both in online-measurements and sampling. The importance of representative sampling is further emphasized by the fact that samples taken are often used as reference in calibration of measurement instruments. The problem of representative sampling and the variation of quality in a pulp flow were studied using equipment with which it was possible to take samples from different depths in the flow and thus determine the variations. Experimental testing was conducted in different process conditions and with different pulp types. The results of the tests showed that the quality variations in a pulp flow were more profound than initially thought: Several pulp properties have significant profiles within the flow that depend on the type of the pulp and the flow conditions. The variation of pulp properties is large enough to somewhat affect all measurements made from the flow in question. The findings of the study suggest new <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>sampling</b> and installing instrumentation when a pulp suspension flow is measured...|$|E

40|$|Ochratoxin A is a {{mycotoxin}} {{often found}} in grapes and grape products. Since {{it was first reported}} in wines approximately 10 years ago, several developments have been reported in its analysis from grapes and their derived products. Methods for qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative analyses have been developed in different formats. Most of these methods involve five main stages: sampling, sample preparation, extraction, clean-up and quantification. Sampling and sample preparation are two of the most critical stages, since the material portion taken to the laboratory for analysis should represent as accurately as possible the whole lot. The design of subsequent stages will be very dependent on the measurement (separation, detection and quantification). The extraction stage aims at solubilizing the mycotoxin in an appropriate solvent, and – depending on the measurement method – various clean-up strategies are available. Highly specific and selective measurement will require less extensive clean-up and vice versa. Most of the methods rely on the general <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>sampling,</b> an extraction with an aqueous-based solvent, clean-up with immunoaffinity columns and quantification by a chromatographic method coupled with fluorescence or mass detection.

40|$|Most {{discussions of}} {{sampling}} protocols {{within the literature}} on monitoring aquatic parasites {{are based on the}} assumptions of simple random sampling. There has been a growing recognition within the fields of human and terrestrial veterinary epidemiology that data are often collected from individuals within clusters where such assumptions are not valid. These circumstances arise when monitoring ectoparasitic sea lice on Scottish salmon farms. In previous work the authors have demonstrated that significant intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) values are associated with cage-level abundance of sea lice, particularly when the parasite reaches its adult stage of development. In this paper two sets of data from Scottish farms with ICC values for adult L. salmonis of 0. 35 [0. 08 - 0. 72, 95 %CI] and for adult C. elongatus of 0. 42 [0. 14 - 0. 66, 95 %CI] are used to investigate the implications of clustering. A Monte Carlo simulation approach is used to illustrate the effect of various sampling approaches. The protocols simulated reflect those typically used across a range of countries and production environments in which salmon are currently reared. By illustrating clearly from empirical data sets what is known by theoretical argument it is hoped that <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>sampling</b> parasites, and disease monitoring more generally, within aquaculture will in future incorporate appropriate consideration of issues related to the clustering that is typically present in cage-based production systems.

40|$|Small-scale fleets (SSF) are {{important}} components of many ICES fisheries and are receiving growing attention within the CFP-reform and Marine Spatial Planning initiatives. In {{order to assess}} the importance of SSF within Europe, 2015 ICES WGCATCH compiled descriptions and data (effort, catch and value) of SSF fishing in EU waters, using 2012 as reference year and categorizing fleets by vessel length. The compiled information covered 17 countries describing a range of scenarios, spanning from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean. The < 10 m and 10 – 12 m vessels were ranked highest in importance in nearly all countries in terms of number of vessels and employment. They were generally involved in multi-gear and multi-species fisheries developing seasonal or part-time activities into coastal areas with generally more sensitive habitats as nursery grounds or spawning aggregations. SSF were also found to be important for several fisheries in terms of effort, value and landings, and to represent a significant share of some TAC-quota or catches of regulated species, even though their landings may be under-reported. Group members also described the way SSF are sampled and estimated in their countries. The wide diversity in methodologies used to sample and estimate the impacts of SSF creates challenges to harmonize and standardize data quality indicators across European countries.

40|$|The current paper {{presents}} Chapter 5 of {{the second}} edition of the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Cervical Cancer Screening, which deals with the histopathological diagnosis of lesions of the uterine cervix. It completes a series of publications in journals containing the contents of {{other parts of the}} European Guidelines. Histopathology provides the final diagnosis on the basis of which treatment is planned, and serves as the gold standard for quality control of cytology and colposcopy. It is also the source of the diagnostic data stored at the cancer registry and used for evaluation of screening programmes. It is therefore important that histopathology standards are monitored and based on agreed diagnostic criteria. Histology is required to diagnose the degree of abnormality in women with persistent low-grade abnormalities including HPV-lesions, as well as high-grade lesions. Cytology may also suggest either glandular abnormalities or be suggestive of high-grade CIN, AIS or invasive cancer. Histopathologists should be aware of, and familiar with, the nature of cytological changes which may be relevant to their reports. The accuracy of the histopathological diagnosis of tissue specimens depends on adequate samples, obtained by colposcopically directed punch biopsies (with endocervical curettage if necessary) or excision of the transformation zone or conisation. An accurate histological diagnosis further depends on appropriate macroscopic description, technical processing, microscopic interpretation and quality management correlating cytological and histological diagnosis.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the statistical sampling power of the submersible survey as a tool to discriminate density differences between trawlable and untrawlable habitats. A geophysical map of the study area was prepared with side-scan sonar imagery, multibeam bathymetry data, and known locations of historical NMFS trawl survey events. Submersible transects were completed at randomly selected dive sites located in each habitat type. Significant differences in density between habitats were observed for lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus), and tiger rockfish (S. nigrocinctus) individually, and for “all rockfish” and “all flatfish” in the aggregate.

Identification of past activity was typically based on the presence of growth anomalies in trees, with a focus on scars, stem tilting, trunk burial or apex decapitation.

40|$|Many {{methods for}} using diatoms for routine {{monitoring}} of water quality {{have been developed}} in Europe and in some countries, these {{are being used to}} enforce environmental legislation. In order to facilitate their wider use, particularly with respect to European Union legislation, steps are being taken to harmonize methodology. In this paper, the principles and practice of sampling are described in relation to the main habitat types encountered in Europe. Although details of methods and sampling programmes have to be tailored to particular circumstances and the overall objectives of the monitoring, a number of generalizations can be made. Where available, rocks and other hard surfaces are the preferred substrates and methods for sampling these are described. If such substrata are not available, then introduced ('artificial') substrata have many applications. Various types of introduced substrata can be used successfully, so long as some basic precautions are described. Other types of substrata such as macrophytes and macroalgae may also be useful under certain circumstances, although there is less consensus in the literature on the most appropriate methods, and of the validity of comparisons between indices computed from epiphytic and epilithic communities.

40|$|Purpose: Changes to {{sexuality}} can be profound, {{complex and}} far reaching. However, the {{evidence shows that}} this is often overlooked during the rehabilitation process often {{in the face of}} a ‘good recovery’, cognitively and physically speaking. It can also be suggested that this lack of support is due to the personal inhibitions of nurses working with post-stroke patients at the interface of care. This research proposes to explore, identify and explain the underpinning reasoning behind this gap in the provision of care. Methodology: Grounded theory methodology in Straussian form will be adopted in order to explore further the inhibiting, moderating and facilitating factors of the social process at work during discussion between nurses and post-stroke patients. This methodology outlines particular <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>sampling,</b> data collection and data analysis. Emerging theory will guide theoretical sampling, due to the nature of this technique, sample size will not be known until the end of the study. In-depth interviews will be utilised as the method of data collection, these will be largely unstructured to allow for maximum flexibility. The analysis process is split into 3 key components: open coding, axial coding and selective coding. Use of memoing and constant comparison will facilitate this process. Conclusion: It is hoped that theory generated from this study will be substantive and unique and could be utilised to inform the generation of a psychosocial training framework for nurses working with post-stroke patients experiencing alterations to their sexuality. By identifying and giving meaning to the deep rooted social processes that inhibit essential care to be given person-centred care should be enhanced.

But public and environmental health concerns, particularly those related to air emissions 2 and drinking water safety and security, 3, 4, 5 have sparked controversy in states such as Pennsylvania, where fracking is already being used to extract natural gas. At the fifth annual summit of the Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative, based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, stake holders worked in three breakout groups over two days to recommend best practices for policy makers, the fracking industry, and com-munity members in this and other states. 6 In summer 2012 the U.

40|$|There {{has been}} recent success in {{identifying}} disease-causing variants in Mendelian disorders by exome sequencing followed by simple filtering techniques. Studies generally assume complete or high penetrance. However, there are likely many failed and unpublished studies {{due in part}} to incomplete penetrance or phenocopy. In this study, the expected number of candidate single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in exome data for autosomal dominant or recessive Mendelian disorders was investigated under the assumption of “no genetic heterogeneity. ” All variants were assumed to be under the “null model,” and sample allele frequencies were modeled using a standard population genetics theory. To investigate the properties of pedigree data, full-sibs were considered in addition to unrelated individuals. In both cases, particularly regarding full-sibs, the number of SNVs remained very high without controls. The high efficacy of controls was also confirmed. When controls were used with a relatively large total sample size (e. g., N= 20,  50), filtering incorporating of incomplete penetrance and phenocopy efficiently reduced the number of candidate SNVs.
