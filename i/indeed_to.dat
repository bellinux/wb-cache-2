5|$|He was {{instrumental}} in the decision to purchase the de Havilland Comet, believing the efficiencies and benefits of jet powered military aircraft would be useful if replicated in a civilian environment, and recognising the outdated aircraft the airline would otherwise be left with. The early operation of the de Havilland Comet was characterised by the series of fatal crashes which would result in the resignation of Miles Thomas as chairman in 1955. The root cause was eventually attributed to metal fatigue and no blame was attached to either Smallpeice or <b>indeed</b> <b>to</b> Thomas. Smallpeice would initially retain his position as financial comptroller under the incoming chairman, Gerard d'Erlanger, this would be a temporary arrangement and in 1956 Smallpeice was promoted to the role of chief executive, albeit with the title managing director.|$|E

Moulamein, in the western Riverina, appears to make legitimate claims as the oldest town in the Riverina, and <b>indeed</b> <b>to</b> being older than Melbourne. The settlers often came into conflict with the indigenous inhabitants. In the Narrandera district, a battle took place between settlers and the local Narrungderra clan at a location now known as Massacre Island, reportedly leaving only one survivor.|$|E

Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, <b>indeed,</b> <b>to</b> reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E

25|$|To {{explain the}} {{categories}} in more detail, {{they are the}} preconditions {{of the construction of}} objects in the mind. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>to</b> even think of the sun and stone presupposes the category of subsistence, that is, substance. For the categories synthesize the random data of the sensory manifold into intelligible objects. This means that the categories are also the most abstract things one can say of any object whatsoever, and hence one can have an a priori cognition of the totality of all objects of experience if one can list all of them. To do so, Kant formulates another transcendental deduction.|$|E

Various experimental results demonstrate that the dance does convey information, but the use of this information may be context-dependent, and this may explain why the results of earlier studies were inconsistent. Researchers have also discovered other forms of honeybee dance communication, such as the tremble dance.|$|E

Following the deflation crisis which started in 1926, banks such as the Banco di Roma, the Banco di Napoli or the Banco di Sicilia were also assisted by the state. In 1933, Mussolini created the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) with the special aim of rescuing floundering companies. By 1939, the IRI controlled 20% of the Italian industry through government-linked companies (GLCs), including 75% of pig iron production and 90% of the shipbuilding industry.|$|E

25|$|By Talmudic {{times the}} {{practice}} of levirate marriage was deemed secondary in preference to halizah because of the brother's questionable intentions; <b>indeed,</b> <b>to</b> marry a brother's widow for her beauty was regarded by Abba Saul as equivalent to incest. Bar Kappara also recommends halizah. A difference of opinion appears among the later authorities, with Isaac Alfasi, Maimonides, and the Spanish school generally upholding the custom, while Rabbeinu Tam and the Northern school prefer halizah. A change of religion {{on the part of}} the surviving brother does not affect the obligation of the levirate, or its alternative, the halizah. Additionally, if the surviving brother is married, Ashkenazim, who follow the takkanah of Gershom ben Judah abolishing polygamy, would be compelled to perform halizah.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{earliest}} extant work of Arakanese literature in Arakanese (Burmese) script, Rakhine Minthami Eigyin ("Lullaby for a Princess of Arakan"), was written only in 1455, Arakanese chronicle tradition most likely began {{at least a}} century earlier. (The Burmese script had already been in use at the Arakanese court {{at least since the}} 1330s when the future King Swa Saw Ke of Ava was educated there. According to Pamela Gutman, the use of Burmese script appeared {{for the first time in}} the Le-Mro period (11th to 15th centuries) on stone inscriptions.) Much earlier Devanagari inscriptions exist (as early as c. 550 CE) but it does not appear that the Arakanese chronicles consulted the inscriptions in any case because later court historians could not read {{the earliest}} inscriptions. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>to</b> date, most of the inscriptions have not been fully examined, or translated.|$|E
25|$|The dating of Easter {{was modeled}} on {{that of the}} Jewish Passover, which marks the liberation of the Jews from Egypt and which {{traditionally}} falls in the Jewish lunar calendar on the 14th of the month of Nisan, {{the day of the}} first full moon after the vernal (spring) equinox. Roman Christians however had a twelve-month calendar, first the Julian calendar until 1582, and then the Gregorian calendar. Since the Council of Nicaea in 325, the Western Church had required that Easter be celebrated on the Sunday on or after the full moon following March 21, which at that time corresponded <b>indeed</b> <b>to</b> the vernal equinox. The Julian calendar being imprecise however, by the 16th century March 21 fell about 10 days after the vernal equinox, a problem that was solved by the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. (The Eastern Christian Church continues to date Easter by the Julian calendar.) Languet de Gergy, however, wished to verify independently the exact date of the vernal equinox through the gnomon in order to ascertain the date of Easter.|$|E

25|$|Psychoanalysis, a psychotherapeutic {{approach}} to behavior change developed by Sigmund Freud and modified by his followers, has also offered {{an explanation of}} substance abuse. This orientation suggests {{the main cause of}} the addiction syndrome is the unconscious need to entertain and to enact various kinds of homosexual and perverse fantasies, {{and at the same time}} to avoid taking responsibility for this. It is hypothesised specific drugs facilitate specific fantasies and using drugs is considered to be a displacement from, and a concomitant of, the compulsion to masturbate while entertaining homosexual and perverse fantasies. The addiction syndrome is also hypothesised to be associated with life trajectories that have occurred within the context of traumatogenic processes, the phases of which include social, cultural and political factors, encapsulation, traumatophilia, and masturbation as a form of self-soothing. Such an approach lies in stark contrast to the approaches of social cognitive theory to addictionâ€”and <b>indeed,</b> <b>to</b> behavior in generalâ€”which holds human beings regulate and control their own environmental and cognitive environments, and are not merely driven by internal, driving impulses. Additionally, homosexual content is not implicated as a necessary feature in addiction.|$|E
25|$|It {{would be}} a mistake to {{attribute}} the demise of Aegina solely to the development of the Athenian navy. It is probable that the power of Aegina had steadily declined during the twenty years after Salamis, and that it had declined absolutely, as well as relatively to that of Athens. Commerce was the source of Aegina's greatness, and her trade, which seems to have been principally with the Levant, must have suffered seriously from the war with Persia. Aegina's medism in 491 is to be explained by its commercial relations with the Persian Empire. It was forced into patriotism in spite of itself, and the glory won by the battle of Salamis was paid for by the loss of its trade and the decay of its marine. The completeness of the ruin of so powerful a state is explained by the economic conditions of the island, the prosperity of which was based on slave-labour. It is impossible, <b>indeed,</b> <b>to</b> accept Aristotle's (cf. Athenaeus vi. 272) estimate of 470,000 as the number of the slave-population; it is clear, however, that the number must have been much greater than that of the free inhabitants. In this respect the history of Aegina does but anticipate the history of Greece as a whole.|$|E
