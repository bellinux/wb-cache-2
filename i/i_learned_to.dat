25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam {{developed}} {{the story and}} wrote {{the first draft of}} the screenplay with Charles Alverson, who was paid for his work but was ultimately uncredited in the final film. For nearly 20 years, Gilliam denied that Alverson had made any material contribution to the script. But then when the first draft was published and original in-progress documents emerged from Alverson's files, Gilliam begrudgingly changed his story. This was too late for either credit on the film or a listing on the failed Oscar nomination for Alverson. He has said that he would not have minded the Oscar nomination, even though he didn’t think much of the script or the finished film. Gilliam, McKeown, and Stoppard collaborated on further drafts. Brazil was developed under the titles The Ministry and 1984 ½, the latter a nod not only to Orwell's original Nineteen Eighty-Four but also to 8½ by Federico Fellini, a director whom Gilliam often cites as one of the defining influences on his visual style when directing. During the film's production, other working titles floated about, including The Ministry of Torture, How <b>I</b> <b>Learned</b> <b>to</b> Live with the System—So Far, and So That's Why the Bourgeoisie Sucks, before settling with Brazil relating to the name of its escapist signature tune.|$|E

[...] "Playing against the men, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time."

500|$|... "Because of You" [...] is a piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and 39 seconds. It is set in common time and has a {{moderate}} tempo of 69 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of F minor, and then modulated to the key of G minor, with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from Ab3 to Eb5. Tony Heywood of MusicOMH noted that the song's piano arrangement is reminiscent of Tori Amos. Lyrically, [...] "Because of You" [...] is a fiery ode to Clarkson's father, and begins with Clarkson singing [...] "oohs" [...] over a somber piano which creates a [...] "wintry tone." [...] As the song launches into the chorus, the roaring guitar is evident, and the lyrics, [...] "Because of you I never stray {{too far from the}} sidewalk / Because of you <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> play on the safe side so I don’t get hurt," [...] were deemed as [...] "touching" [...] by Dave Donelly of Sputnikmusic.|$|E
500|$|According to Barry Miles, Lennon resented McCartney's {{direction}} of the band as well as how, aside from [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", he himself was now supplying [...] "songs to order" [...] rather than [...] "writing from the heart" [...] as he had on Revolver.

Speaking in 2000, Harrison said he {{had little interest in}} McCartney's concept of a fictitious group and that, after his experiences in India, [...] "my heart was still out there … I was losing interest in being 'fab' at that point." [...] Harrison added that, having enjoyed recording Rubber Soul and Revolver, he disliked how the group's approach on Sgt.

500|$|In September 1941, Presley entered {{first grade}} at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his {{instructors}} regarded him as [...] "average".

The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. Ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [...] "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, [...] "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{role was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese, noting [...] "Who would you rather make the argument [...] for mankind than John Cleese?" [...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I {{had to be able to}} write the equation, because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> carefully copy things down that mean nothing to me at all.
