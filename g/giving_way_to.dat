5|$|The {{headland}} at Braich y Pwll is {{the only}} known location on the British mainland of the spotted rock rose, which produces bright yellow petals that last only one day. The coast here has open grass heath land and mountain, <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> rugged sea cliffs and coves. There is a profusion of wildlife, {{and it is an}} ideal vantage point to watch the spring and autumn bird migrations. Choughs, peregrine falcons, kestrels, puffins, stonechats, guillemots and Manx shearwaters can be seen, and dolphins, porpoises and seals can be spotted in the water.|$|E
5|$|The rocky cliffs, common {{features}} downstream of the Minho's estuary, disappear in Póvoa de Varzim, <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a coastal plain. The plain {{is located in}} a cuspate foreland, an old marine plateau from the Plio-Pleistocene, conferring a sandy soil to the coastal lands. The sand dunes in the Northwestern coast formed during the Little Ice Age and started piling up in the 15th or 16th century. Wandering along the coast one discerns Cape Santo André, the tip of the cuspate foreland and the Avarus Promontory, referred to by Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{both were}} invited, neither Hirst nor Rhodes toured Australia {{in the winter}} of 1901–02 with Archie MacLaren's team, as the Yorkshire {{committee}} wanted both players to be well rested before the new season. Hirst was statistically less successful in 1902, but he nevertheless returned to the Test team. The summer was very wet, resulting in many rain-affected pitches, known as sticky wickets, which favoured slower bowlers and made batting difficult. Hirst scored 1,413 runs in the season, at an average of 31.11 with two centuries. He took fewer wickets than the previous year, partly as he was often used for a few overs early in an innings by Yorkshire before <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> slow bowlers Rhodes and Schofield Haigh, who topped the national first-class bowling averages for the season. In total, Hirst took 83 wickets at an average of 20.33.|$|E

5|$|Just east of Bradhurst Avenue, NY141 {{connects to}} the Taconic State Parkway {{by way of a}} partial interchange. The {{junction}} has only two connections; the first links NY141 to the southbound parkway, while the second leads from the northbound direction of the parkway to NY141 via West Cross Street. Continuing eastward, the highway passes under the parkway and enters the commercial center of Hawthorne. Here, NY141 crosses over the Metro-North Railroad before turning northward onto Elwood Avenue. Over the next , NY141 closely parallels the railroad's Harlem Line, serving its Hawthorne station as the road heads north. After three blocks, the road and railroad turn to the northeast and begin to run alongside the Saw Mill River Parkway. Elwood Avenue ends shortly after the curve, <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Commerce Street.|$|E
5|$|Sir George {{created a}} deer park that ranged far north of Radyr. Tenant farmers there were evicted, {{and the loss}} of rental income contributed to the decline in the family's fortunes. He had 24 children, eight of whom were illegitimate. Many were daughters, and Sir George needed large sums of money for their dowries. On his death Sir George's lands passed to his eldest son William, who also became a MP and {{invested}} in the Pentyrch ironworks. This was an astute move as feudalism was <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> early industrialisation. William's descendants inherited a diminishing fortune. Captain George Mathew, the last of the family to live in Radyr, married Elizabeth Poyntz, and the couple left Radyr to live on her estates at Thurles in County Tipperary, Ireland in 1625.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of the conflict in England gradually began to shift; by the late 1140s, the major fighting in the war was over, <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> an intractable stalemate, with only the occasional outbreak of fresh fighting. Several of Matilda's key supporters died: in 1147 Robert of Gloucester died peacefully, and Brian Fitz Count gradually withdrew from public life, probably eventually joining a monastery; by 1151 he was dead. Many of Matilda's other followers joined the Second Crusade {{when it was announced}} in 1145, leaving the region for several years. Some of the Anglo-Norman barons made individual peace agreements with each other to secure their lands and war gains, and many were not keen to pursue any further conflict.|$|E

5|$|The defeats {{suffered}} in February and March accelerated {{the disintegration of}} the GUNT. When in March, at a new round of OAU-sponsored talks held in the People's Republic of Congo, Goukouni failed to appear, many suspected the hand of Libya. These suspicions caused the defection from the GUNT of its vice president, Kamougué, followed by the First Army and the piecemeal FROLINAT Originel. In August, it was the CDR's turn to leave the coalition, seizing the town of Fada. When in October Goukouni's FAP attempted to retake Fada, the Libyan garrison attacked Goukouni's troops, <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a pitched battle that effectively ended the GUNT. In the same month, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, while his troops rebelled against Gaddafi, dislodging the Libyans from all their positions in the Tibesti, and on 24 October went over to Habré.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} royal burials to Thebes {{after the end}} of the Amarna period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the {{intermediate}} 'jogged axis' gradually <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western Valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for Akhenaten, but it is no more than a gateway and a series of steps. The tomb of Ay, Tutankhamun's successor is close by. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (its decoration is of a similar style) but later usurped for Ay's burial. This would mean that KV62 may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb.|$|E

Much of the route follows the contact point between the igneous granite of {{the western side of}} Wicklow and the metamorphic schists and slates of the eastern side. The principal habitat of the upland sections is a mixture of broadleaf and coniferous woodland, heath and blanket bog while in the lowland sections the hedgerows marking the boundaries between fields support a variety of wildlife. The Way also passes the Monastic City at Glendalough, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E

5|$|The boom in {{skyscraper}} construction {{began to}} falter following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, with fast economic growth <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the slump {{years of the}} Great Depression: construction of all sorts slowed considerably. The real estate market that lay behind new skyscraper builds collapsed, {{and the value of}} many properties dropped dramatically: the American Insurance Union tower cost $8 million ($1.2 billion in 2010 terms) to build in 1927, but was valued at only $3.5 million ($900 million) by 1933; the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building defaulted on its debts in 1935 and was put on sale for just $1.2 million ($240 m). The major bond house of S.W. Straus, behind many successful developments, defaulted on the $214 million ($47 billion) in bonds held by 60,000 investors; the Van Swerigan developer brothers went bankrupt. Vacancy rates began to increase as the recession bit, increasing from only one percent in central New York in early 1920 to 17 percent in 1931 and 25 percent by 1934.|$|E
5|$|According to the Bannatyne {{manuscript}}, the Fairy Flag {{was also}} unfurled during the Battle of Glendale, which the manuscript states {{to have been}} fought in about 1490. At one point during this conflict, both the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, and the MacLeods of Lewis {{were on the verge}} of <b>giving</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the invading MacDonalds. Just at this moment, the mother of Alasdair Crotach, chief of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, ordered the Fairy Flag to be unfurled. The result was that both MacLeod clans renewed the battle with redoubled fury and, despite immense losses, eventually won the battle. Among the MacLeod dead was the flag bearer, Paul Dubh, who carried the Fairy Flag throughout the conflict until his death. The Bannatyne manuscript relates that Paul Dubh was honourably buried in a deep stone coffin, with a metal grate — much like the account given in the c.1800 manuscript. The writer of the Bannatyne manuscript states that each successive flag bearer was buried within this tomb, and that the writer's own grandfather saw the old ceremony performed for the last time, in the 18th century. The Bannatyne manuscript states that the tomb is located in the north-east corner of the chancel at St Clements Church, in Rodel. R.C. MacLeod noted that there was no trace of such a coffin or tomb; although, he suggested that it could have been buried or possibly built within a wall.|$|E
