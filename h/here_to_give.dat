5|$|Bungie first {{introduced}} the Halo series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, {{a series of}} cryptic email messages, to the maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a fan site for one of Bungie's previous series, the Marathon Trilogy. The strategic use of cryptic messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in I Love Bees, a promotion for Halo 2. Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be canon, Cortana speaks {{many of the same}} lines in Halo 3. According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics, the studio used the character <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> story clues without actually revealing the story.|$|E
25|$|The Presa de la Olla is a dam {{that was}} {{constructed}} in the mid 18th century to supply the city with potable water. The area became a popular gathering place for young aristocrats, and later the lower classes as well. The area hosts the Feast of San Juan every 24 of June. The origin of this event dates from the colonial period when a poor miner came <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> thanks for the recent arrival of rains. The current event culminates with the “opening of the dam,” which attracts hundreds to watch the water flow. Today, the event stretches over {{the second and third}} week in June and has taken on new elements such as a beauty contest and dances with techno, reggaetón, Duranguese and Grupero music. The dam is used for water sports, and there is a park named Florencio Antillon Garden next to it.|$|E
500|$|General Sir Archibald Wavell {{instructed}} Morshead to {{hold the}} fortress for two months {{while the rest of}} Wavell's forces reorganised and mounted a relief mission. With the 9th Division, 18th Infantry Brigade and supporting forces from various Allied nations, Morshead's force decisively defeated Rommel's powerful initial assaults, and retained possession of the fortress. His strategy for the defence of Tobruk is still mentioned in officer training colleges around the world {{as an example of how}} to arrange and conduct in-depth defences against a superior armoured force. An important part of Morshead's tactics was conducting offensive operations when these were possible. His attitude was summed up in a reported remark, made when his attention was drawn to a British propaganda article entitled [...] "Tobruk can take it!" [...] Morshead commented: [...] "we're not here to take it, we're <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 12, a Ferguson October {{rally and}} service {{was held at}} Chaifetz Arena, located on Saint Louis University's campus. The stated purpose of the event was to [...] "call on the nation to repent for the sin of police {{brutality}} and support {{a new generation of}} youth activists." [...] Activists Suheir Hammad, Ashley Yates and Tef Poe spoke to the crowd along with Christian, Jewish, and Muslim clergy members. Younger activists criticized older activists for not being radical enough.

2500|$|Begin {{said that}} Shaw had been {{responsible}} for the failure to evacuate the hotel: [...] "A police officer called Shaw and told him, 'The Jews say that they have placed bombs in the King David.' And the reply was, 'I am <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> orders to the Jews, not to take orders from them.'" [...] The 1947 Irgun pamphlet Black Paper said that Shaw had forbidden anyone to leave the hotel: [...] "For reasons best known to himself Shaw, the Chief Secretary of the Occupation administration, disregarded the warning. That is, he forbade any of the other officials to leave the building, with the result that some of his collaborators were killed, while he himself slunk away until after the explosion. … Shaw thus sent nearly 100 people to their deaths—including Hebrews, including friends of our struggle." [...] Begin said that he had heard the information about Shaw from Israel Galili, Chief of Staff of Haganah, when they met on July 23, the day after the bombing. In an interview with Bethell, Galili said that his source for the Shaw story had been Boris Guriel, the future head of Israel's intelligence service, who had heard it in turn from the American Associated Press bureau chief Carter Davidson. Thurston Clarke interviewed both Galili and Guriel, the former in 1977. Guriel denied that he had been the source of the story. Galili was unable to produce any evidence that Shaw had received a warning. Carter Davidson died in 1958 and so could not be asked to confirm or deny what Galili had said. Clarke's assessment was that the story about Shaw was, in fact, [...] "a baseless rumour promoted by the Haganah in order to mollify the Irgun and fix responsibility for the carnage on Shaw." [...] Shmuel Katz, who {{had been a member of}} the Irgun's high command, later also wrote that [...] "the story can be dismissed." ...|$|E
