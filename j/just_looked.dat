25|$|The Floor Flipper - The Third Wars onwards - A {{powerful}} pneumatic flipper {{set into}} the floor, capable of throwing a robot across the arena. It was generally only used on robots {{that had already been}} defeated, but was occasionally fired during events such as the House Robot Rebellion. When originally introduced, it <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> like a part of the arena floor. For The Fourth Wars the flipper was given a yellow/black paint scheme similar to the redesigned Pit of Oblivion. For Extreme 1/Series 5 the power of the flipper increased, allowing it to hurl even the heaviest robots into the air, and flip featherweight robots out of the arena. For Series 8, this is no longer used as a coup de grace for defeated robots, but fires independently during a fight. It is positioned diagonally on the floor, and is capable not only of launching robots into the air but also trapping robots as it closes.|$|E
25|$|During in Huiyang, Holmes {{was under}} the command of Colonel (later Sir) Douglas Clague. He was {{assigned}} to deal with external affairs and to co-operate closely with the guerillas of the East River Column (東江縱隊). With the help from the guerillas, Holmes had organised a number of rescue plans trying to save the prisoners of war from the Japanese concentration camps and had conducted espionage in the Japanese-occupied region. According to the recollection of Paui Tsui, Holmes and his companions once secretly entered Hong Kong and reached the foot of Lion Rock. From the foot of the mountain, he used binoculars to spy the concentration camp far away in To Kwa Wan regardless the potential danger of being discovered by the Japanese. Fortunately, although Holmes was a Westerner, the Japanese had never recognised that the fluent Cantonese speaker was in fact a British. Tsui explained the reason was because Holmes was not huge physically and with the disguise of wearing bamboo hat and grey linen clothing, he <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> the same as a common Chinese farmer. His bravery was appreciated by the British government that he was awarded a Military Cross in early 1943 and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) of the Military Division a few months later. It was rare at that time to be decorated twice in a single year.|$|E

They actually counted the kills! And when it came time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted.

Darren <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> up and there she was!" [...] before Fox added [...] "I never {{thought they were going to}} last, but we just went for it full throttle". Fox later explained that the pairing [...] "was only ever intended to be quite a short-term thing".|$|E

[...] Up and down the line of the retreat, unit cohesion disappeared under attack and officers lost contact with their men. [...] There was screaming and moaning around him and some U.S. soldiers were being taken prisoner, but despite feeling overwhelming fear Rangel resolved to try to escape over an imposing mountain: [...] "From the rim of that gully it <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> like everything had to be better {{on the other side of}} that damn mountain." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{of these}} {{paintings}} depict {{women who had}} adopted some elements of male dress.

[...] Women such as Gluck, Troubridge, and Brooks used variations of the masculine mode, not to pass as men, but as a signala way of making their sexuality visible to others. At the time these paintings were made, however, it was a code that only a select few knew how to read. [...] To a mainstream audience, the women in these paintings probably <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> fashionable.|$|E
500|$|The rock monster {{climax of}} the film was {{ultimately}} dropped due to difficulties during filming. The monster, dubbed the Rockman, was a large latex rubber suit that breathed fire on command. Effects personnel smoked cigarettes and blew smoke into the suit's tubing, loading it with smoke that it would slowly emit, obscuring some obvious rubber parts. On {{the last day of}} location shooting, the Rockman began suffering mechanical problems; the suit stopped breathing fire, and the desert wind dissipated the smoke. The result, Shatner wrote, was that [...] "our guy in the silly rubber suit ultimately <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> like... well, a guy in a silly rubber suit." [...] With no time to return to the location, Shatner was forced to get wide shots and hope that the setting could be reproduced in the studio, but admitted that it was likely it was not going to work for the film.|$|E

Very hang-dog, droopy shoulders, slouchy, very sad, inward-looking creatures." [...] He said that they were only allowed out [...] "at certain times of day that would be adjudicated to be the least likely time when DM [...] would run into them if he was on the property. They would march out to Old Gilman House to take a shower and come back because they had no shower facilities inside the Hole. Later that got upgraded to let them go down to the garage." [...] Sometimes executives were allowed out for a short time to attend Church events, but many ended up spending months or even years in the Hole.|$|E

The realistic design of the new puppets has been praised by Vincent Terrace and criticised by others. Certain members of the production staff had the impression that they lacked the charm of the earlier generation of puppets due to the authentic proportions that were now being used. Director David Lane's initial thoughts on a prototype, sculpted by head puppet-maker John Brown, were, [...] "it was as if there was a little dead person in ... because it was perfect in all its proportions it <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> odd." [...] Brown remembers placing the prototype next to the Lady Penelope puppet from Thunderbirds and gauging the response from colleagues: [...] "When they saw it, some people were horrified by the difference. Some didn't like it, some did." [...] Commentators have noted that facial expression was sacrificed in favour of a realistic design, a result on which Terry Curtis remembers: ...|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to cast the role of Jason, Ari Lehman, who had {{received}} a part in Sean Cunningham's Manny's Orphans, arrived to read for the character of Jack. Before he could get started, Cunningham walked in and offered him a different part: Jason. Without having read a single word, Cunningham <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at Ari and said, [...] "You're the right size, you've got it." [...] In the original Friday the 13th, Ari Lehman is seen only in a brief flashback as the surprise ending. Subsequent actors who portrayed a young Jason include Timothy Burr Mirkovich in Jason Takes Manhattan and Spencer Stump in Freddy vs. Jason. The adult role of Jason Voorhees has been played by various actors, some not credited, others taking great pride in their parts. Due to the physical demands the adult character requires, and the lack of emotional depth depicted, many of the actors since have been stuntmen. The most well-known among them is Kane Hodder, who is cited as the best to play the role.|$|E

The film {{became one of}} the biggest box office hits in India, earning , and grossed over [...] abroad, the biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. The Indian Express concurred that this was successful: [...] "The lady has not <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> glamorous but she has walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness. Who would have thought that the bubbly girl could so skilfully shed her age-old tag and walk away as the don't-mess-with-me lass. So, all those who are in search of the peppy Preity, well, guys you've dialed the wrong number this time." ...|$|E

After the film released, my dad called me up saying 'you know The New York Times are calling it the worst film of the year." [...] He recalled that both he and Madonna chose to overlook {{the failure of the}} film, and remembered one incident when he met Madonna at a hotel lobby. [...] "She <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> to me once and said, 'So it's a flop right?' That's the only time she ever mentioned the film. Even Sean also never mentioned it in front of her." [...] In another article in The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that Madonna's real personality is of a [...] "knowing, shrewd, pragmatic young woman, a performer of invigorating energy who still looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe, even with short hair, but who has much more in common with the enthusiastic, unembarrassed, comic tartness of Jean Harlow, somehow let loose on the streets of New York in the 80's." [...] However, he felt that Who's That Girl failed to portray that image, leading to its failure. The first half of the film showed a different personality of Madonna, trying to be comical, which was not accepted by the public.|$|E
500|$|Law & Order: Criminal Intent {{is not an}} {{ensemble}} series, and therefore differs from Law & Order and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit which respectively featured six and eight actors receiving star billing during the same broadcast season. Movie actor Vincent D'Onofrio was offered the lead role of Detective Robert Goren, a hyper-intuitive contemporary Sherlock Holmes-type investigator {{who used to work}} for the US Military Police. Other than a 1998 guest role on [...] that earned him an Emmy nomination, this was D'Onofrio's first major television role. Goren's partner, former vice squad detective Alexandra Eames, was played by Kathryn Erbe who had just completed a role on Oz as convicted murderer Shirley Bellinger. Balcer stated Eames was cast because [...] "she <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> like a real cop." [...] Courtney B. Vance plays Assistant District Attorney Ron Carver, a graduate of John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Jamey Sheridan was the last actor to be cast in a main role, taking the part of James Deakins, a [...] "seasoned" [...] NYPD Captain. In a recurring role, Leslie Hendrix appeared as Assistant Chief Medical Examiner Elizabeth Rodgers, the same character she had played in the other two series.

500|$|Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were {{hesitant}} though, as {{they had}} sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at each other like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and {{for him as a}} rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful." [...] Originally composed as a song to be sung, Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R and soul artist Alicia Keys. Hunte said, [...] "She's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice." [...] Keys also contributed to writing [...] "Empire State of Mind"s new bridge.|$|E
