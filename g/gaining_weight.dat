Jack congratulates her on her weight, and Jenna enjoys her new {{friendship}} with him. While talking to Liz, Jenna begins to worry about losing weight, and fears her popularity will decline. Upset that Jenna is losing weight, Jack sends Kenneth to follow her around and make sure she keeps her weight on. Liz tells Kenneth to insult Jenna if he wants her to eat more, and writes down {{a list of things}} to say to Jenna to hurt her. Jenna takes the insults as compliments, and tries to seduce Kenneth.|$|E

25|$|Anorexia nervosa is {{an eating}} {{disorder}} that is characterized by low appetite and {{a strong desire to}} lose weight, be thin, and fears of <b>gaining</b> <b>weight.</b> People suffering from anorexia nervosa frequently have an abnormally low body weight, which can cause muscle dysfunction and weak osmoregulation. It can also accompany emotional symptoms such as depression.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} growth {{abnormalities}} associated with 1p36 deletion syndrome. One common problem is delayed growth or difficulty in <b>gaining</b> <b>weight.</b> Even {{though some of}} the children may eat well, they still may not grow normally. In contrast, some children may develop hyperphagia, which is overeating, and may become obese. These children clinically resemble children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Developmental delay has also been severe in the patients with the Prader-Willi like characteristics.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1735, the Duchess of Bedford started {{experiencing}} symptoms of what she believed was her third pregnancy. Whether or not her morning sickness {{was the result of}} a pregnancy is uncertain, but it soon became apparent that the Duchess had contracted tuberculosis. The illness progressed rapidly, and the Duchess was drastically losing rather than <b>gaining</b> <b>weight.</b> The Dowager Duchess insisted that her granddaughter be moved to Southampton House in Bloomsbury Square. She died there intestate on 27 September 1735, aged 25 and leaving no surviving issue.|$|E
25|$|Some phlogiston proponents {{explained}} this by concluding that phlogiston had negative mass; others, such as Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, gave the more conventional argument {{that it was}} lighter than air.

25|$|Anorexia nervosa, often {{referred}} to simply as anorexia, is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, fear of <b>gaining</b> <b>weight,</b> and {{a strong desire to}} be thin, resulting in food restriction. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.|$|E

40|$|Background: While <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> during {{pregnancy}} {{is regarded as}} important, {{there has not been}} a prospective study of measured <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> in pregnancy in Australia. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate pregnancy-related <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> against the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations in women receiving antenatal care in a setting where ongoing weight monitoring is not part of routine clinical practice, to describe women's knowledge of <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> recommendations and to describe the health professional advice received relating to gestational <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> (GWG). Methods: Pregnant women were recruited ≤ 20 weeks of gestation (n = 664) from a tertiary obstetric hospital between August 2010 to July 2011 for this prospective observational study. Outcome measures were <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> from pre-pregnancy to 36 weeks of gestation, <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> knowledge and health professional advice received. Results: Thirty-six percent of women <b>gained</b> <b>weight</b> according to guidelines. Twenty-six percent <b>gained</b> inadequate <b>weight,</b> and 38...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} to college {{has been identified}} as a critical period for weight gain; however, {{only a limited number of}} studies have examined this phenomenon. The college setting may promote <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> thus the purpose of the present study was to quantify changes in BMI in first year students during their first semester of college and to understand factors associated with <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> such as eating behaviors, physical activity, and body shape ideals. Significant changes in weight were detected between Time 1 and 2 with a mean <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> of 1. 24 kg. The majority of participants (73. 1 %) <b>gained</b> <b>weight</b> and the percentage of participants categorized as overweight increased from 23. 1 % to 3 1. 4 %. Regression models did not reveal significant predictors of <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Paired t-tests revealed significant decreases in disinhibition, binge eating, and number of days of physical activity over the semester. Participants who <b>gained</b> <b>weight</b> had greater body image dissatisfaction than those who did not <b>gain</b> <b>weight.</b> These findings underscore the need for more studies on factors related to <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> and prevention efforts in the college population...|$|R
25|$|A woman {{develops}} large breasts usually during thelarche (the pubertal breast-development stage), but large breasts {{can also}} develop postpartum, after <b>gaining</b> <b>weight,</b> at menopause, and at any age. Whereas macromastia usually develops in consequence to the hypertrophy (overdevelopment) of adipose fat, {{rather than to}} milk-gland hypertrophy. Moreover, many women are genetically predisposed to developing large breasts, the size and weight of which often are increased either by pregnancy or by weight gain, or by both conditions; there also exist iatrogenic (physician-caused) conditions such as post–mastectomy and post–lumpectomy asymmetry. Nonetheless, it is statistically rare for a young woman to experience virginal mammary hypertrophy that results in massive, oversized breasts, and recurrent breast hypertrophy.|$|E
25|$|Outcomes have {{generally}} indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The {{main reason for}} this detrimental effect {{is the issue of}} body image. As they physically develop, <b>gaining</b> <b>weight</b> in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to be thin, the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, boys may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{was born}} {{about five years}} after her brother, around the time that her father began to isolate {{himself and his family}} from others. At birth she was in the 50th {{percentile}} for weight. The following day she showed signs of Rh incompatibility and required a blood transfusion, but had no sequelae and was otherwise described as healthy. A medical appointment at three months showed that she was <b>gaining</b> <b>weight</b> normally, but found a congenital hip dislocation which required her to wear a highly restrictive Frejka splint from the age of 4½ to 11 months. The splint caused Genie to be late to walk, and researchers believed this led her father to start speculating that she was mentally retarded. As a result, he made a concerted effort not to talk to or pay attention to her, and strongly discouraged his wife and son from doing so.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is generally {{attributed to the}} authors of a 1956 report of a professional poker player who, after <b>gaining</b> <b>weight,</b> became somnolent and fatigued and prone to fall asleep during the day, as well as developing edema of the legs suggesting heart failure. The authors coined the condition [...] "Pickwickian syndrome" [...] after the character Joe from Dickens' The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club (1837), who was markedly obese and tended to fall asleep uncontrollably during the day. This report, however, was preceded by other descriptions of hypoventilation in obesity.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> in a stressful environment (i. e., following compulsory {{enrollment in the}} Greek army). It was predicted that higher levels of mindfulness and self-compassion would relate negatively to <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> whilst negative automatic thoughts and intolerance of uncertainty would positively relate to <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> This research also explored the strength of independent variables when predicting <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> plus the additional contribution of self-compassion when controlling for the effect of mindfulness on <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Ninety-seven military recruits completed the psychological scales {{on the first day}} of enrollment. Their height and weight were measured at baseline and after 5 weeks to record <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Results revealed that 43 participants <b>gained</b> <b>weight,</b> whilst 54 lost weight. Those who lost weight reported significantly higher scores in mindfulness and self-compassion, whereas those who <b>gained</b> <b>weight</b> reported significantly higher scores in negative automatic thoughts and intolerance of uncertainty. Furthermore, negative automatic thoughts and intolerance of uncertainty did not significantly predict <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> after mindfulness and self-compassion were taken into account. Also, self-compassion uniquely contributed to the negative prediction of <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> once mindfulness was taken into account. This research concluded that negative cognition may play a role in weight gain; however, mindfulness and self-compassion may be more useful traits in predicting <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> given that once they are taken into account, negative cognition stop being significant predictors...|$|R
