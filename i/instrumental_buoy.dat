This is the only system for real-time monitoring of fish schools within a horizontal omnidirectional plane about a vessel or a buoy. Between 1996 and 2001, we used two standard omnidirectional sonars and developed new methodologies for exploiting their specific acoustic data according to two main sampling schemes: ‘prospecting’, including fishing and searching operations, and ‘drifting’, as with an <b>instrumental</b> <b>buoy</b> system or aboard a stationary vessel.

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} for assessing wave climate variability have been broadly focused on aggregated or statistical parameters such as significant wave height, wave energy flux, or mean wave direction. These studies, although revealing the major general modes of wave climate variability and trends, {{do not take}} into consideration the complexity of the wind-wave fields. Because ocean waves are the response to both local and remote winds, analyzing the directional full spectra can shed light on atmospheric circulation not only over the immediate ocean region, but also over a broad basin scale. In this work, the authors use a pattern classification approach to explore wave climate variability in the frequency–direction domain. This approach identifies atmospheric circulation patterns of the sea level pressure from the 31 -yr long Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and wave spectral patterns of two selected buoys in the North Atlantic, finding one-to-one relations between each synoptic pattern (circulation type) and each spectral wave energy distribution (spectral type). Even in the absence of long-wave records, this method allows for the reconstruction of longterm wave spectra to cover variability at several temporal scales: daily, monthly, seasonal, interannual, decadal, long-term trends, and future climate change projections. The authors are grateful to Puertos del Estado (Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Infrastructures) for providing us the <b>instrumental</b> <b>buoy</b> data. This work was partially funded by the project IMAR 21 (CT M 2010 - 15009) from the Spanish Government...|$|E

Two cases of data analysis are considered: the first on a school-by-school basis, the 'single school' mode; the second taking into account all fish schools detected within the sonar sampling volume, the 'cluster' mode. Elementary sonar information is divided into five categories that comprise 24 survey and sonar parameters and 55 school, cluster and fisher behaviour descriptors. We review the applications of these categories and discuss perspectives for their use in fisheries science. If the sonar system enables the evaluation of the effects of vessel avoidance on fish school biomass assessment, no accurate abundance estimate can be provided by a simple sonar echo-integration process. Omnidirectional sonar data can be used to analyse collectively the fish schools' swimming speed, kinematics in terms of diffusion and migration, aggregative dynamics as school splitting and merging indexes, spatial characteristics of clusters such as school density, 2 D structure and fisher behaviour. The prospect of integrating such data into a fish school database, including multifrequency echo-sounder and lateral multibeam (3 D) sonar data combined with a species recognition method, will enable a complete view of fish school behaviour and consequently the adoption of accurate fisheries management methods...|$|E
40|$|Global {{studies have}} shown that there is a {{widening}} of the tropics and a poleward expansion of the Southern Hemispheric Hadley Circulation in the mid-latitudes (Seidel et al., 2007), and a marked poleward displacement of the Southern Hemisphere westerly wind and storm front tracks over the Southern Ocean (Thompson and Solomon, 2002), and related wave fields (Young et al., 2011, Hemer et al., 2010). The behaviour of the Subtropical Ridge is unclear with some studies showing pressure intensification but {{there appears to be no}} significant poleward shift in its core location (Timbal and Drosdowski, 2012). These often quoted trends are more complex when viewed on a seasonal time scale, while at decadal scale they include the effects of the mid- 1970 s climate shift. The latitude of the STR is an important driver of Tasman Sea wave climate, effectively dividing the region into Easterly vs Westerly generated wind-waves. We present a synoptic typing of wave climate clustered against the latitude of the STR parameter. We examine the relationship between modal wave climate and the STR on seasonal to decadal timescales using <b>instrumental</b> waverider <b>buoy</b> data and ERA-INT reanalysis data. We also apply the approach to eight storm wave types, previously identified (Shand et al., 2011) and large scale drivers (Browning and Goodwin, 2013), and discuss the observed trends in the frequency of storm wave types with respect to the STR variability. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Coastal systems behave on {{timescales}} from days to centuries. Shelf {{and coastal}} wave climatological {{data from the}} Tasman Sea are only available {{for the past few}} decades. Hence, the records are too short to investigate inter- and multidecadal variability and their impact on coastal systems. A method is presented to hindcast monthly mid-shelf mean wave direction (MWD) for southeastern Australia, based on the monthly, trans-Tasman mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) difference between northern NSW (Yamba) and the north island of New Zealand (Auckland). The MSLP index is calibrated to <b>instrumental</b> (Waverider <b>buoy)</b> MWD data for the Sydney shelf and coast. Positive/negative trans-Tasman MSLP difference is significantly correlated to southerly/easterly Sydney MWD, and to long/short mean wave periods. The 124 -year Sydney annual (MWD) time series displays multidecadal variability, and identifies a significant period of more southerly annual MWD during 1884 to 1914 than in the period since 1915. The Sydney MWD is significantly correlated to the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The correlation with the SOI is enhanced during periods when the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) is in its negative state and warm SST anomalies occur in the southwest Pacific region. The Sydney MWD was found to be associated with Pacific basin-wide climate fluctuations associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Southerly/easterly Sydney MWD is correlated with low/high MSLP anomalies over New Zealand and the central Pacific Ocean. Southerly/easterly Sydney MWD is also correlated with cool/warm SST anomalies in the southwest Pacific, particularly in the eastern Coral Sea and Tasman Sea.
