5|$|In ancient Hebrew, Saturn {{is called}} 'Shabbathai'. Its angel is Cassiel. Its <b>intelligence</b> <b>or</b> {{beneficial}} spirit is Agiel (layga) and its spirit (darker aspect) is Zazel (lzaz). In Ottoman Turkish, Urdu and Malay, its name is 'Zuhal', derived from Arabic زحل.|$|E
5|$|One staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, {{had already}} {{submitted}} such {{a proposal to}} General Sir John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

The raiders failed to gather any <b>intelligence</b> <b>or</b> damage any German equipment; their only success was in killing two German sentries.|$|E

5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS {{or simply}} Tourette's) {{is a common}} neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple motor tics {{and at least one}} vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. Tourette's does not adversely affect <b>intelligence</b> <b>or</b> life expectancy.|$|E
5|$|Adan met Ya'iri at Adan's former command post. Adan briefly {{explained}} the situation and, {{in a short}} discussion, Ya'iri laid out his plan. He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur. At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, acting {{with a sense of}} urgency, had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient <b>intelligence,</b> <b>or</b> performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait for one to arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E

5|$|As they progress, players gain {{experience}} points through defeating {{enemies and}} completing quests for non-player characters (NPCs) scattered around environments: these raise a character's experience level, which grant access to fresh skills and points {{that can be}} used to upgrade character attributes such as health and energy levels, dexterity, <b>intelligence,</b> <b>or</b> strength. If the player dies, they respawn at rebirth fountains scattered through the world, although they lose some accumulated experience points. Quests are divided into Main Quests related to the central narrative, and side quests unique to particular areas of the world. Other NPCs can be found in towns and cities that act as Merchants selling equipment and items: these can be both bought and sold. Player characters have multiple equipment slots, which can take armor for limbs and torso, weapons or shields, and accessories that grant passive boons.|$|E
5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had <b>intelligence</b> <b>or</b> not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{considered}} Operation Hump to be {{the least}} successful operation in which the Australian battalion had participated, and he criticised it as being badly conceived from the start, and mounted with too little <b>intelligence</b> <b>or</b> prior reconnaissance. Indeed, from the initial landing zone being occupied by the Viet Cong, failures in the passage of information, the heavy losses suffered by the US 1/503rd Battalion and the subsequent difficulties with casualty evacuation, the operation had not run smoothly. The Australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead; however, with 1 RAR absorbed into other operations the planned battalion attack on Hill 82 never occurred. Regardless, further operations followed in the months afterwards, with 1 RAR subsequently employed on Operation New Life in November and December, and later Operation Crimp in the Ho Bo Woods in January 1966. Operation Hump was Brumfield's last, with an old football injury forcing his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. He was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece.|$|E
50|$|Means of {{information}} gathering are both overt and covert and may include espionage, communication interception, cryptanalysis, cooperation with other institutions, {{and evaluation of}} public sources.

5|$|Combat is turn-based, {{with each}} {{character}} in the player's party receiving action points {{at the beginning of}} the player's turn. The number received is dependent on the items the player character has equipped and the skills the character or creations possess. Each action uses a specific number of points, for example, moving one square takes a single point and attacks or spells take five. Attacking or spellcasting with fewer than ten action points immediately ends the character's turn, otherwise a character can continue to act until they run out of points. Most enemies will attack the player on sight, retreating in terror if they reach a certain threshold of damage without being killed. Other specialized behaviors are also present, including creatures which call for help, or creatures which act as sentries and retreat to an ambush location when threatened. Creations made by the player character can also be controlled by a similar artificial <b>intelligence,</b> <b>or</b> the player can invest more essence in the creation's intelligence and control them manually.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{release of}} the puzzle game Puyo Puyo and replaces all of its {{characters}} with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial <b>intelligence</b> <b>or</b> a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured beans together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange beans into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, the beans in the group will disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player drops a group of beans on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and will drop to the lowest point on the board. The player may also flip a group of falling beans horizontally or vertically.|$|E

By showing that his conclusions are nothing more than logical deductions, Aaron argues that they precede his own work, which is nothing more than the confirmation of established truths.|$|R
