25|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> (Rhea americana) is a flightless bird {{found in}} eastern South America. Other {{names for the}} <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> include the grey, common, or American rhea; ñandú (Guaraní and Spanish); or ema (Portuguese). One of two species in the genus Rhea, in the family Rheidae, the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is endemic to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It inhabits a variety of open areas, such as grasslands, savanna or grassy wetlands. Weighing , the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is the largest bird in South America. In the wild, the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> has a life {{expectancy}} of 10.5 years. It is also notable for its reproductive habits, and {{for the fact that}} a group has established itself in Germany in recent years. The species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.|$|E
25|$|The rheas in Germany {{are legally}} {{protected}} {{in a similar}} way to native species. In its new home, the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is considered generally beneficial as its browsing helps maintain the habitat diversity of the sparsely populated grasslands bordering the Schaalsee biosphere reserve.|$|E
25|$|Main subspecific {{differences}} are {{the extent of}} the black coloring of the throat and the height. However, subspecies of the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> differ so little across their range that, without knowledge of the place of origin, it is essentially impossible to identify captive birds by subspecies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>rheas</b> have a fluffy, tattered-looking plumage, that is gray or brown, {{with high}} {{individual}} variation, The head, neck, rump, and thighs are feathered. In general, males are darker than females. Even in the wildparticularly in Argentinaleucistic individuals (with white body plumage and blue eyes) {{as well as}} albinos occur. Hatchling <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> are grey with dark lengthwise stripes.|$|R
25|$|International {{trade in}} wild-caught <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> is {{restricted}} as per CITES Appendix II.|$|R

25|$|Farmers {{sometimes}} {{consider the}} <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> pests, {{because they will}} eat broad-leaved crop plants, such as cabbage, chard and bok choy. Where they occur as pests, farmers tend to hunt and kill greater rheas. The burning of crops in South America has also contributed to their decline.|$|E
25|$|In {{fields and}} {{plantations}} of plants {{they do not}} like to eat, e.g., cereals or eucalyptus, the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> can be a species quite beneficial to farmers. It will eat any large invertebrate it can catch; its food includes locusts and grasshoppers, true bugs, cockroaches, and other pest insects. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed cerrado and agricultural land in Minas Gerais (Brazil), R. a. americana was noted to be particularly fond of beetles. It is not clear whether this applies to the species in general but for example in pampas habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while Orthoptera might be more important. The <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is able to eat Hymenoptera in quantity. These insects contain among them many who can give painful stings, though the birds do not seem to mind. Sometimes, greater rheas will gather at carrion to feed on flies; they are also known to eat dead or dying fish in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.|$|E
25|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> derives its {{scientific}} name from Rhea, a Greek goddess, and the Latinized form of America. It was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, Systema Naturae {{under the name}} Struthio camelus americanus. He identified specimens from Sergipe, and Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, in 1758. They are from the family Rheidae, and the order Rheiformes. They {{are closely related to}} other ratites such as emus, ostriches, cassowaries, and kiwis, along with the extinct forms: moas and elephant birds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>rheas</b> have a fluffy, tattered-looking plumage, that is gray or brown, {{with high}} {{individual}} variation, The head, neck, rump, and thighs are feathered. In general, males are darker than females. Even {{in the wild}} - particularly in Argentina - leucistic individuals (with white body plumage and blue eyes) as well as albinos occur. Hatchling <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> are grey with dark lengthwise stripes.|$|R
5000|$|In the [...] "South America" [...] (Sydamerika) section, {{visitors}} can see {{species such as}} capybaras, guanacos, <b>greater</b> <b>rheas,</b> Patagonian maras, southern screamers and giant anteaters. They all have access to one common area, modeled after the South American pampas.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2010, Santa Ana Zoo {{opened a}} new exhibit, Tierra de las Pampas or [...] "Land of the Grasses." [...] It {{is the first in}} a series of new exhibits. Covering 2 acre, Tierra de las Pampas houses giant anteaters in one exhibit, and <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> and guanacos in the larger one, with a {{footpath}} between them.|$|R
25|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is {{a silent}} bird except during mating season, {{when they make}} low booming noises, and as chicks, when they give a mournful whistle. During the non-breeding season they will form flocks of between 10 and 100 birds. When in flocks, {{they tend to be}} less vigilant, but the males can get {{aggressive}} towards other males. When chased they will flee in a zigzag pattern, alternately raising one wing then the other. These flocks break up in the winter in time for breeding season.|$|E
25|$|The natural predators {{of adult}} greater rheas {{are limited to}} the cougar (Puma concolor), which are found in most areas {{inhabited}} by greater rheas and are certain to be their leading predator, and the jaguar (Panthera onca), which are found with greater rheas and opportunistically hunt them in the Paraguayan chaco, central Bolivia and the Brazilian cerrado. Feral dogs are known to kill younger birds, and the southern caracara (Caracara plancus) is suspected to prey on hatchlings. Armadillos sometimes feed on <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> eggs; nests have been found which had been undermined by a six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) or a big hairy armadillo (Chaetophractus villosus) and the rhea eggs were broken apart. Predation on young rheas has also been reportedly committed by greater grisons (Galictis vittata).|$|E
25|$|A small {{non-indigenous}} {{population of}} the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> established itself in Germany. One male and five females escaped from a farm in Groß Grönau, Schleswig-Holstein, in August 2000. These birds survived the winter and succeeded in breeding in a habitat sufficiently similar to their native South American range. They eventually crossed the Wakenitz river and settled in Nordwestmecklenburg {{in the area around}} and particularly to the north of Thandorf village. A biosurvey conducted in late 2012 found the population had grown to more than 100 and was settling in permanently. In early 2017 the population reached about 220 birds. As local farmers suffered harvest losses due to the birds, some farmers were granted an allowance to destroy the eggs of the birds to stop the population from growing further.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} farmed in North America and Europe {{similar to the}} emu and ostrich. The main {{products}} are meat and eggs, but rhea oil is used for cosmetics and soaps and rhea leather is also traded in quantity. Male <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> are very territorial during the breeding season. The infant chicks have high mortality in typical confinement farming situations, but under optimum free-range conditions chicks will reach adult size by their fifth month.|$|R
50|$|Rheas {{are from}} South America only and are limited within the {{continent}} to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. They are grassland birds and both species prefer open land. The <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> live in open grasslands, pampas, and chaco woodlands. They prefer to breed near water and prefer lowlands, seldom going above 1500 m. On the other hand, the lesser rhea will inhabit most shrubland, grassland, even desert salt puna up to 4500 m.|$|R
50|$|Ostriches {{have the}} <b>greatest</b> dimorphism, <b>rheas</b> show some dichromatism during the {{breeding}} season. Emus, cassowaries, and kiwis show some dimorphism, predominantly in size.|$|R
25|$|Favorite food plants include {{native and}} {{introduced}} species from {{all sorts of}} dicot families, such as Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Bignoniaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae or Solanaceae. Magnoliidae fruit, for example of Duguetia furfuracea (Annonaceae) or avocados (Persea americana, Lauraceae) can be seasonally important. They do not usually eat cereal grains, or monocots in general. However, the leaves of particular grass species like Brachiaria brizantha can be eaten in large quantities, and Liliaceae (e.g. the sarsaparilla Smilax brasiliensis) have also been recorded as foodplants. Even tough and spiny vegetable matter like tubers or thistles is eaten with relish. Like many birds which feed on tough plant matter, the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> swallows pebbles which help grind down the food for easy digestion. It is much attracted to sparkling objects and sometimes accidentally swallows metallic or glossy objects.|$|E
2500|$|Big Birds was a {{short-lived}} exhibit which preceded the [...] "Rare Animal Range" [...] {{in the late}} 1990s that focused on large ratites. The featured species were emu, ostrich, <b>greater</b> <b>rhea,</b> and double-wattled cassowary.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is {{endemic to}} Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. There are also feral {{populations of the}} <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> in Germany, Cuba and Honduras. This species inhabits {{grassland}} dominated by satintail (Imperata) and bahiagrass (Paspalum) species, as well as savanna, scrub forest, chaparral, and even desert and palustrine lands, though it prefers areas with at least some tall vegetation. It is absent from the humid tropical forests of the Mata Atlântica and planalto uplands {{along the coast of}} Brazil and extends south to 40° latitude. They prefer lower elevations and seldom go above [...] During the breeding season (spring and summer), it stays near water.|$|E
40|$|Anti-Toxoplasma gondii {{antibodies}} {{were evaluated}} in <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> (Rhea americana) from the Reproduction Centre for Wild Animals {{located at the}} Universidade Federal Rural do Semiárido {{in the city of}} Mossoró, Rio Grande do Norte, by the modified agglutination test (MAT ≥ 25). It was verified that, from the 69 examined birds, 4. 3 % (three rheas) tested positive. The research about ratites toxoplasmoses are scarce, this way, the results showed the importance of the T. gondii diagnosis in wild birds...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} species of endemic birds.The Mar Chiquita lake and the Dulce River swamps are {{designated}} a Ramsar wetland {{that is a}} key site for endangered neotropical birds.The wetland supports a rich and diverse fauna with 138 known species of birds, including large breeding groups of Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis).Native species include guanacos, <b>greater</b> <b>rheas,</b> and giant anteaters.Endangered amphibians include blunt-headed salamander (Ambystoma amblycephalum).Endangered birds include yellow cardinal (Gubernatrix cristata), Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus) and Eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis).|$|R
5000|$|Pampas Plains- This new exhibit {{opened in}} 2015 and is phase {{one of the}} zoo's [...] "South American Adventure". It {{features}} a raised walkway to allow for better viewing and is home to maned wolves, giant anteaters, Chacoan peccaries, and <b>greater</b> <b>rheas.</b> The zoo also plans to add vicuña to the exhibit, making them {{one of the few}} zoos in the country to exhibit the species. An anteater was born at the zoo on February 13, 2016, the first in the zoo's history.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is {{considered}} a Near Threatened species according to the IUCN, {{and they have a}} decreasing range of about [...] The species is believed to be declining due to increased hunting and the conversion of central South American grasslands to farmland and ranchland. The populations of Argentina and Uruguay are most seriously affected by the decline.|$|E
2500|$|Captive-bred greater rheas exhibit {{significant}} ecological naïvete. This fearlessness renders them highly {{vulnerable to}} predators if {{the birds are}} released into the wild in reintroduction projects. Classical conditioning of <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> juveniles against predator models can prevent this to some degree, but the personality type of the birds [...] whether they are bold or shy [...] influences the success of such training. In 2006, a protocol was established for training greater rheas to avoid would-be predators, and for identifying the most cautious animals for release.|$|E

50|$|The area is characterised by four {{distinct}} seasons. Winter brings chilly, occasionally frosty nights. Humid, temperate weather characterizes {{spring and}} fall. Summer days {{can be extremely}} hot. The natural vegetation comprises meadows of high grass with isolated forests (locally referred to as montes) of algarrobos, talas and chanares, {{which used to be}} common in areas near the main rivers but have been mostly cut down during the 20th century. The <b>great</b> <b>rhea</b> lives in the pampas of Argentina and eats plants, lizards, insects, frogs, small birds and snakes.|$|R
2500|$|In Mapudungun, the {{language}} of Patagonian Mapuches, {{the name of the}} Southern Cross is Melipal, which means [...] "four stars".

Acrux and Mimosa make up one foot of the <b>Great</b> <b>Rhea,</b> a constellation encompassing Centaurus and Circinus along with the two bright stars. The <b>Great</b> <b>Rhea</b> was a constellation of the Bororo of Brazil. The Mocoví people of Argentina also saw a rhea including the stars of Crux. Their rhea is attacked by two dogs, represented by bright stars in Centaurus and Circinus. The dogs' heads are marked by Alpha and Beta Centauri. The rhea's body is marked by the four main stars of Crux, while its head is Gamma Centauri and its feet are the bright stars of Musca. The Bakairi people of Brazil had a sprawling constellation representing a bird snare. It included the bright stars of Crux, the southern part of Centaurus, Circinus, at least one star in Lupus, the bright stars of Musca, Beta and Delta Chamaeleonis, Volans, and Mensa. The Kalapalo people of Mato Grosso state in Brazil saw the stars of Crux as Aganagi angry bees having emerged from the Coalsack, which they saw as the beehive.|$|R

5000|$|In Greek mythology, Melisseus ("bee-man"), {{the father}} of the nymphs Adrasteia and Ide (or Aega, {{according}} to Hyginus) who nursed the infant Zeus on Crete, was the eldest and leader of the nine Kuretes of Crete. They were chthonic daimones of Mount Ida, who clashed their spears and shields to drown out the wails of infant Zeus, whom they received from the <b>Great</b> Goddess, <b>Rhea,</b> his mother. The infant-god was hidden from his cannibal father and was raised in the cave that was sacred to the Goddess (Da) celebrated by the Kuretes, whose name it bore and still bears.

2500|$|Rhea eggs measure about [...] {{and weigh}} [...] on average; they are thus {{less than half}} the size of an ostrich egg. Their shell is greenish-yellow when fresh but soon fades to dull cream when exposed to light. The nest is a simple shallow and wide scrape in a hidden location; males will drag sticks, grass, and leaves in the area {{surrounding}} the nest so it resembles a firebreak as wide as their neck can reach. The incubation period is 29–43 days. All the eggs hatch within 36 hours of each other even though the eggs in one nest were laid perhaps as much as two weeks apart. As it seems, when the first young are ready to hatch they start a call resembling a pop-bottle rocket or even fireworks, even while still inside the egg, thus the hatching time is coordinated. <b>Greater</b> <b>rheas</b> are half-grown about three months after hatching, and sexually mature by their 14th month.|$|R
