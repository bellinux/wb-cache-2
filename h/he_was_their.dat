5|$|The Historia syntomos of Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople {{mentions}} {{a single}} brother of Heraclius the Elder, named Gregoras, {{who was the}} father of Nicetas.

Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
