The nine tower floors were only accessible via the ground level, from the dorm's primary entrance hall.

5|$|Adult {{birds in}} Asia can be {{confused}} with the similar lesser whistling duck, although that species is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the neck. Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to physical jobs, women {{were also asked}} to cut back and ration. Silk and nylon were used for the war efforts, creating a shortage of stockings. Many women actually painted lines <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> their legs to create the illusion of wearing the fashionable stockings of the time.|$|E
25|$|Tendinitis usually {{involves}} {{disruption of the}} tendon fibers. It is most commonly seen in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) in a front legâ€”the tendon that runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the leg, closest to the surface. Tendinitis is uncommon in the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of a front leg or either the SDFT or DDFT in a hindleg.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is {{especially}} useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The navicular bone lies behind the coffin bone {{and under the}} small pastern bone. The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the navicular bone before attaching {{to the back of}} the coffin bone. The DDF tendon flexes the coffin joint, and the navicular bone acts as a fulcrum that the DDF tendon runs over.|$|E

60|$|The thunder boomed, the {{lightning}} glared, the storm-winds raged, <b>the</b> deluge poured <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> mimic royalty on the stage, with their soaked satins clinging to their bodies, slopped about ankle-deep in water, warbling their sweetest and best, the fiddlers under the eaves {{of the stage}} sawed away for dear life, with the cold overflow spouting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> their necks, and the dry and happy King sat in his lofty box and wore his gloves to ribbons applauding.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the stock delivery, an arm ball is delivered with rolling the fingers <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the ball on release. This means the ball has backspin on it, {{and it does not}} turn appreciably off the pitch. Instead, it travels straight on {{in the direction of the}} arm, from which it derives its name. However, by keeping the seam upright, the bowler can also hope to obtain some outswing away from the right-handed batsman, thereby confusing the batsman who expects the ball to turn.|$|E
25|$|In general, the stirrup {{is placed}} on the ball of the foot, {{allowing}} the rider to let his weight flow <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the leg into the heel by way of the flexible ankle. This provides the rider {{with the support of the}} stirrup while still allowing for him to easily absorb the shock of the horse's motion. If the stirrup is too far forward, on the toes, the rider risks losing if he pushes with too much pressure (forcing it off the foot) or too little (allowing it to simply slide off).|$|E
25|$|Boots {{and wraps}} are worn by almost all horses, {{due to the}} fact that they may easily injure their legs when landing or when making tight turns at speed. Open-fronted tendon boots usually are worn on the forelegs, because they provide {{protection}} for the delicate tendons that run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the leg, but still allow the horse to feel a rail should it get careless and hang its legs. Fetlock boots are sometimes seen on the rear legs, primarily to prevent the horse from hitting itself on tight turns.|$|E

25|$|Wired gloves. These {{can provide}} input to the {{computer}} about the position and rotation of the hands using magnetic or inertial tracking devices. Furthermore, some gloves can detect finger bending {{with a high degree}} of accuracy (5-10 degrees), or even provide haptic feedback to the user, which is a simulation of the sense of touch. The first commercially available hand-tracking glove-type device was the DataGlove, a glove-type device which could detect hand position, movement and finger bending. This uses fiber optic cables running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the hand. Light pulses are created and when the fingers are bent, light leaks through small cracks and the loss is registered, giving an approximation of the hand pose.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{engagement}} Graham commissioned William Hogarth to paint as a conversation picture a cabin portrait {{to celebrate his}} victory, probably using the cabin of the Nottingham as a setting. Hogarth painted Graham smoking his pipe in his cabin before dinner, while listening to pipe and tabor music played by his black servant, while his chaplain and clerk sing. Two dogs are visible, one is Graham's own, which joins in the singing. The other is Trump, Hogarth's dog, which is shown wearing Graham's wig, holding a scroll, and reading from a sheet of music propped against a wine glass. A steward, holding a plate of fowl, looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, and drops gravy <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the chaplain's neck. The painting has several political and social allusions in Hogarth's satirical style. Cabin scenes in oil are rare, and Hogarth's is considered by the current owner, the National Maritime Museum, {{to be the most}} famous in British art.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, {{a slider}} {{is a type}} of {{delivery}} bowled by a wrist spin bowler. Whereas a topspinner is released with the thumb facing the batsman, a slider is bowled in a similar manner to a legbreak, but instead of imparting sidespin with the third finger, the bowler allows his fingers to roll <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the ball, providing a mixture of sidespin and backspin. Whereas a topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a normal delivery, a slider does the opposite: it carries to a fuller length and bounces less than the batsman might expect. The sliders will typically head towards the batsman with a scrambled seam (with the ball not spinning {{in the direction of the}} seam, so the seam direction is not constant, unlike in conventional spin bowling). This has less effect on the flight and bounce but absence of leg spin may deceive the batsman. Frequently the slider is bowled with a mixture of side spin and backspin. This has the effect of making the ball harder to differentiate from the leg break for the batsmen without reducing the mechanical effects caused by the backspin. This delivery may skid straight on or it may turn a small amount.|$|E

25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.|$|E

500|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck is [...] long; {{the male}} weighs , and the female averages marginally lighter at [...] It is a long-legged duck, mainly golden-brown with a darker back and an obvious blackish line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> its neck. It has whitish stripes on its flanks, a long grey bill and grey legs. In flight, the wings are brown above and black below, with no white markings, and a white crescent on the rump contrasts with the black tail. All plumages are fairly similar, but the female is slightly smaller and duller-plumaged than the male. The juvenile has paler underparts, and appears generally duller, especially on the flanks. There is a complete wing moult after breeding, and birds then seek the cover of dense wetland vegetation while they are flightless. Body feathers may be moulted throughout the year, although each feather is replaced only once annually.|$|E

60|$|Sparrer was of {{the same}} opinion, so they sat before the fire and speculated on what was {{happening}} {{out there in the}} forest. Sparrer was plied with questions about his adventure and told the story over so graphically that the thrill of it sent little shivers <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> his listeners. At times they sat in silence wondering if they might hear distant rifle shots. And so the night wore on, the most exciting night in their experience, and yet a night in which so far as they were concerned nothing happened.|$|R

500|$|The body of M. inclemens is only sparsely {{covered with}} hairs and scales. A female of Maevia inclemens is [...] long, her {{carapace}} is light brown, her legs are pale and unmarked. The {{top of her}} abdomen is chalky or rusty colored, and along each side is a black band, often thinly covered with orange scales. Sometimes there is series of chevrons (V-shaped markings) along {{the middle of her}} abdomen. She has a prominent white stripe below the foremost eyes. There are spines on the first and second pair of her legs, but her body never has tufts of hair. Males are [...] long, and their carapaces are light to dark brown, with a black line around the edge. There usually is a pair of large lighter areas between the last pair of eyes halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the carapace. The eyes are surrounded by black. [...] Males occur in two forms, a very rare phenomenon in zoology. The [...] "tufted" [...] morph has a totally black body, black pedipalps, white legs and three tufts of bristles on the front part of the cephalothorax. The [...] "gray" [...] male morph has a black and white striped body, a prominent white stripe on the foremost eyes, striped legs and bright orange pedipalps, and no tufts.|$|E
500|$|The {{upper section}} of the column is the sculpted figure of a squat, bare-footed {{individual}} standing upon the bat's head. The figure wears a loincloth bound by a belt and decorated with a large U symbol. An elaborately carved chest ornament with interlace pattern descends from the neck across the waste. The style is somewhat rigid and is reminiscent of formal olmec sculpture, and various costume elements resemble those found on Olmec sculptures from the Gulf Coast of Mexico. The figure has oval eyes and large earspools, the nose and mouth of the figure are damaged. It wears two bands that cross {{on the back and}} are joined to the belt and the shoulders, they support a small human figure facing backwards. The position and characteristics of this smaller figure are very similar to those of Olmec sculptures of infants, although the face is elderly. This secondary figure is wearing a type of long skirt or train that is almost identical to one worn by an Olmec-style dancing jaguar figure found at Tuxtla Chico in Chiapas, Mexico. This train extends down into the middle {{section of the}} column, continuing halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the bat's head. The position of the shoulders and the face of the principal figure are not anatomically correct, leading the archaeologists to conclude that the [...] "face" [...] is actually a chest ornament and that the actual head of the main figure is missing. Although the upper section of the column contains many Olmec elements, it also lacks some distinctive features that are found in true Olmec art, such as the feline expression that is often depicted.|$|E
2500|$|Skirts were {{supported}} by a hybrid of the bustle and crinoline or hooped petticoat sometimes called a [...] "crinolette". The cage structure was attached around the waist and extended down to the ground, but only extended <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the wearerâ€™s legs. The crinolette itself was quickly superseded by the true bustle, which was sufficient for supporting the drapery and train {{at the back of}} the skirt.|$|E
