50|$|Noble {{had assumed}} the cotters {{were too small}} and had not been driven up hard in the first place, but on the {{chattering}} ties the cotters were loose, and even if driven fully in would not fill the slot and put the bar under tension. By fitting an additional packing piece between loose cotters and driving the cotters in, Noble had re-tightened loose ties and stopped them chattering. There were over 4,000 <b>gib</b> <b>and</b> <b>cotter</b> joints on the bridge, but Noble said that only about 100 had had to be re-tensioned, most in October-November 1878. On his last check in December 1879, only two ties had needed attention, both on piers north of the high girders.Noble had found cracks in four column sections - one under the high girders, three {{to the north of}} them - which had then been bound with wrought iron hoops. Noble had consulted Bouch about the cracked columns, but not the chattering ties.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lower Ordovician cyclic {{carbonate}} {{strata of}} southern Mis-souri were deposited in a warm, shallow, epeiric sea on a fully ag-graded carbonate platform. Sedimentological characteristics distin-guish the Jefferson City <b>and</b> <b>Cotter</b> dolomites from the underlying Gasconade and Roubidoux formations. Mixed carbonate–siliciclastic sedimentation characterizes the Roubidoux Formation, with sand-stones accounting {{for up to}} 60 % of sedimentation. The Gasconade, Jefferson City, <b>and</b> <b>Cotter</b> dolomites exhibit an increased occurrence of chalcedonic chert nodules in very similar shape and texture to the gypsum and anhydrite nodules common on modern sabkha supratidal flats. Casts of halite and ghosts of gypsum laths also exist in the Jef-ferson City <b>and</b> <b>Cotter</b> strata but are rarely found in the underlying units. Facies analysis from drill cores and outcrop sections provides the basis for identifying two major meter-scale cycle types. Type I cycle...|$|R

40|$|Background: Patients who {{not only}} survive a warfarin-associated {{gastrointestinal}} tract bleeding (GIB) event but also have an ongoing risk for thromboembolism present 2 clinical dilemmas: whether and when to resume anticoagulation. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the incidence of thrombosis, recurrent <b>GIB,</b> <b>and</b> death, as well as the time to resumption of anticoagulant therapy, during the 90 days following a GIB event. Methods: In this retrospective, cohort study using administrative and clinical databases, patients experiencing GIB during warfarin therapy were categorized according to whether they resumed warfarin therapy after <b>GIB</b> <b>and</b> followed up for 90 days. Variables describing the management and severity of the index GIB were also collected. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to estimate the survival function of thrombosis, recurrent <b>GIB,</b> <b>and</b> death between the "resumed warfarin therapy" and "did not resume warfarin therapy" groups, with Cox proportional hazards modeling to adjust for potentially confounding factors. Results: There were 442 patients with warfarin-associated index GIB included in the analyses. Following the index GIB, 260 patients (58. 8...|$|R
