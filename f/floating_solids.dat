A baffle {{may be used to}} retain the <b>floating</b> <b>solids</b> removed. There are two types of settling basins, based on the method of removing solids. With one type, the solids are removed mechanically (after the free water has drained away), usually with a front-end or skid-steer loader. The other type uses hydraulic (pump) removal of the solids. Typically, pumping is initiated when the basin is half full of solids and the remainder is water. Vigorous agitation is needed to mix the liquid and the solids, preferably by propeller-type agitators or pumps with agitation nozzles.|$|E

During the primary (mechanical) treatment step in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), coarse suspended or <b>floating</b> <b>solids</b> are removed from the wastewater by screens or sieves. Sand and other heavy particles are retained in sand traps; floating material is removed in grease separators [84]. Coarse screens have openings of approx. 20 – 50  mm, intermediate screens of approx. 10 – 20  mm and fine screens of approx. 2 – 10  mm [84, 85]. Such screens are suitable for removing macroplastics from wastewater [72, 86, 87], while they will—based on the opening sizes mentioned above—not be able to capture smaller microplastics. Still, microplastics may be captured, if other materials are clogging the screens. Mintenig et al. [31] suggested that buoyant microplastics may be removed in the grease separating step.

40|$|We {{examine the}} melting of {{commensurate}} and incommensurate vortex lattices interacting with square pinning arrays {{through the use}} of numerical simulations. For weak pinning strength in the commensurate case we observe an order-order transition from a commensurate square vortex lattice to a triangular <b>floating</b> <b>solid</b> phase as a function of temperature. This <b>floating</b> <b>solid</b> phase melts into a liquid at still higher temperature. For strong pinning there is only a single transition from the square pinned lattice to the liquid state. For strong pinning in the incommensurate case, we observe a multi-stage melting in which the interstitial vortices become mobile first, followed by the melting of the entire lattice, consistent with recent imaging experiments. The initial motion of vortices in the incommensurate phase occurs by an exchange process of interstitial vortices with vortices located at the pinning sites. We have also examined the vortex melting behavior for higher matching fields and find that a coexistence of a commensurate pinned vortex lattice with an interstitial vortex liquid occurs while at higher temperatures the entire vortex lattice melts. For triangular arrays at incommensurate fields higher than the first matching field we observe that the initial vortex motion can occur through a novel correlated ring excitation where a number of vortices can rotate around a pinned vortex. We also discuss the relevance of our results to recent experiments of colloidal particles interacting with periodic trap arrays. Comment: 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|Wastewater {{management}} {{encompasses a}} broad range of efforts that promote effective and responsible water use, treatment, and disposal and encourage the protection and restoration of our nation's watersheds. Wastewaters generated in areas without access to centralized sewer systems rely on on-site wastewater systems. These typically comprise a septic tank, drain field, and optionally an on-site treatment unit. Widely used terminology refers to three levels of wastewater treatment: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or advanced). Primary (mechanical) treatment is designed to remove gross, suspended and <b>floating</b> <b>solids</b> from raw sewage. Secondary (biological) treatment removes the dissolved organic matter that escapes primary treatment. Tertiary treatment is simply additional treatment beyond secondary. A “decentralized” wastewater treatment program is one that utilizes wastewater management solutions as close to the sources of the wastewater as possible. This is often realized by utilizing a number of on-site or shared systems to treat relatively small volumes of wastewater, generally from individual buildings or groups of buildings, at or near the source.

This system is a model system for highly anisotropic interactions. From measurements of the half-widths of the low-energy electron diffraction spot profiles a phase diagram is derived for the whole submonolayer region of coverage in the temperature range 100 - 500 K. The commensurate low-coverage phases below theta= 0. 6 form chains normal to the troughs of the substrate. The commensurate p(4 X 1) phase, which is completed at a coverage, theta, of 0. 25 monolayers (ML), seems to he truly long range ordered, whereas the p(2 x 1) phase at theta= 0. 5 still contains domain boundaries even at the lowest temperature of 100 K. Both undergo temperature driven order-disorder phase transitions. In contrast, the incommensurate phases existing in the coverage range theta= 0. 66 - 0. 90 form chains along the troughs, which are only weakly coupled normal to the troughs of the substrate. These phases exhibit two coverage-driven phase transitions from rectangular to oblique units cells and back at critical coverages of 0. 66 and 0. 85, respectively, and represent <b>floating</b> <b>solids.</b> As a function of temperature, they undergo a two-dimensional melting transition.

One the vertical transport of ammonia in the tanks {{were used for the}} modeling. Transport in the non-convective settled solids and <b>floating</b> <b>solids</b> layers is assumed to occur primarily via some type of diffusion process, while transport in the convective liquid layers is incorporated into the model via mass transfer coefficients based on empirical correlations. Mass transfer between the top of the waste and the tank headspace and the effects of ventilation of the headspace are also included in the models. The resulting models contain a large number of parameters, but many of them can be determined from known properties of the waste configuration or can be estimated within reasonable bounds from data on the waste samples themselves. The models are used to extract effective diffusion coefficients for transport in the nonconvective layers based on the measured values of ammonia from the RGS apparatus. The modeling indicates that the higher concentrations of ammonia seen in bubbles trapped inside the waste relative to the ammonia concentrations in the tank headspace can be explained by a combination of slow transport of ammonia via diffusion in the nonconvective layers and ventilation of the tank headspace by either passive or active means. Slow transport by diffusion causes a higher concentration of ammonia to build up deep within the waste until the concentration gradients between the interior and top of the waste are sufficient to allow ammonia to escape at the same rate at which it is being generated in the waste...|$|E
