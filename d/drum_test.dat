30|$|Assumptions {{and ideal}} {{simplifications}} of simulation model {{can cause the}} simulation errors. In addition, the errors between the simulation results and the real car <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> are simultaneously attributed to the CVT variogram and CVT efficiency model. The variogram used for the simulation of fuel economy should be an optimal economic variogram. In this study, such variogram is generated based on the original CVT variogram at incomplete throttle openings. However, the variograms used in the Transmission Control Unit (TCU) of the real car calibrated by the transmission factory are more complicated and consider more driving conditions, temperature conditions, and altitude conditions. The variogram used in the simulation is optimized based on the boundary conditions of vehicle performance, road conditions and the driving behavior of the driver, but numerous elements such as temperatures and altitudes are not fully considered. Consequently, the errors between the variogram generated {{in this study and}} the variogram used in the TCU are unavoidable. The contrastive results shown in Figures  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 indicate that the simulation ratio does not completely follow the real ratio, thereby resulting in errors in input torques and input speeds between the simulations and the real car drum tests, which can lead to fuel economy calculation errors. Similarly, the contrastive results of the ratios, input torques, and input speeds under constant velocity condition shown in Figures  25, 26 indicate that the errors are attributed to the same reason. Moreover, the ratio errors between the simulation results and <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> results affect fuel economy forecast more evidently, particularly at 90  km/h and 120  km/h in driver control mode. In addition, the CVT efficiency model is based on the efficiency bench test within an ideal oil temperature range of 80 ± 2  °C and the effects of temperatures on transmission efficiency are also not considered in the preceding assumption. The oil temperatures collected from CAN signals in the real car <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> are between 69  °C and 109  °C, which are influenced by working time and conditions. The longer the time and the higher the speed of CVT runs, the higher the oil temperature is. Therefore, the errors between the temperatures of the simulations and drum tests lead to the errors in real-time CVT efficiencies, which affect fuel economy forecast. To decrease errors, a better optimization algorithm that considers more conditions should be used to generate a better CVT variogram and a better CVT efficiency model that considers more temperature conditions should be built in future works.|$|E
30|$|Researchers face {{difficulties}} {{in studying the}} effects of driveline efficiency on car fuel economy via bench and road tests because of long working periods, high costs, and heavy workloads. To simplify the study process and shorten test cycles, a car fuel economy simulation forecast method for combining computer simulation forecasting with bench tests is proposed. Taking a continuously variable transmission (CVT) as the research object, a transmission efficiency model based on a bench test is constructed. An optimal economic variogram based on the original CVT variogram, the boundary conditions of vehicle performance, the road conditions and the driving behavior of the driver is generated in the Gear Shift Program (GSP)-Generation module in AVL Cruise. And on this basis a driveline simulation model that can calculate the fuel consumption based on the driveline data of a test car is built. The model is used to forecast fuel consumption and calculate real-time CVT efficiency under different conditions. Contrastive analyses on simulation results and real car <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> results are made. The largest error between simulation results and <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> results in driving cycles is 4.099 %, which is 5.449 % under constant velocity condition in driver control mode and 4.2 % under constant velocity condition in automatic cruise mode. The results confirm the feasibility of the method and the good performance of the driveline simulation model in accurately forecasting fuel consumption. The method can efficiently investigate the effects of driveline efficiency on car fuel economy. Moreover, this research provides instruction for accurately forecasting fuel economy as well as references for studies {{on the effects of}} drivelines on car fuel economy.|$|E

The investigation consisted of eight apparently healthy 20 to 37 -year-old males were recruited for this investigation. Information gathered during the <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> was average VO 2, VO 2 peak, HR in beats per minute (bpm), metabolic equivalents (METs), and energy expenditure (EE) expressed in calories (kcals) per minute and per hour. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was used in addition to VO 2 and HR values to assess physical demand. The Bruce Protocol maximal treadmill test was administered to compare the participants VO 2 max to their VO 2 peak while drumming. The EE during the 40 -minute <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> was 387. 05 + 83 kcals with an estimated hourly EE of 567. 33 + 111. 7 kcals. VO 2, VO 2 peak, VE, and HR was 21. 4 + 4. 1 ml/kg/min, 33. 9 + 8. 1 ml/kg/min, 63. 5 + 19 L/min, and 150. 4 + 13. 6 bpm respectively. The average MET level reached was six. RPE was 13. 8 + 1. 2 and is expressed as “somewhat hard” in difficulty according to the ACSM. Those categorized as having an average level of fitness reached 50 - 59 % of their VO 2 max while the two individuals categorized as having an excellent level of fitness reached 42 - 45 % of their VO 2 max.

40|$|Abstract Background The recent {{increased}} interest in consuming green vegetable sprouts has been tempered {{by the fact that}} fresh sprouts can in some cases be vehicles for food-borne illnesses. They must be grown according to proper conditions of sanitation and handled as a food product rather than as an agricultural commodity. When sprouts are grown in accordance with the criteria proposed from within the sprout industry, developed by regulatory agencies, and adhered to by many sprouters, green sprouts can be produced with very low risk. Contamination may occur when these guidelines are not followed. Methods A one year program of microbial hold-and-release testing, conducted in concert with strict seed and facility cleaning procedures by 13 U. S. broccoli sprout growers was evaluated. Microbial contamination tests were performed on 6839 drums of sprouts, equivalent to about 5 million consumer packages of fresh green sprouts. Results Only 24 (0. 75 %) of the 3191 sprout samples gave an initial positive test for Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 or Salmonella spp., and when re-tested, 3 <b>drums</b> again <b>tested</b> positive. Composite testing (e. g., pooling up to 7 <b>drums</b> for pathogen <b>testing)</b> was equally sensitive to single <b>drum</b> <b>testing.</b> Conclusion By using a "test-and-re-test" protocol, growers were able to minimize crop destruction.

30|$|In {{the present}} work, cokes made from {{different}} coal blends and straight coals {{with a wide}} range of properties were examined.

These pore properties have a strong effect on its strength. It was observed that total porosity is important because high porosity indicated a reduction of strength. Pore shape is also a very important parameter; angular edges pores are more prone to stress concentration.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Infantile {{malignant}} osteopetrosis is a fatal disease {{caused by}} lack of functional osteoclasts. In most of patients, TCIRG 1, encoding a subunit of a proton pump essential for bone resorption, is mutated. Osteopetrosis leads to bone marrow failure and blindness due to optic nerve compression. Oc/oc mice have a deletion in Tcirg 1 and die around 3 to 4 weeks, but can be rescued by neonatal stem cell transplantation (SCT) after irradiation conditioning. However, as irradiation of neonatal mice results in retinal degeneration, we wanted to investigate whether conditioning with busulphan prior to SCT can lead to preservation of vision and reversal of osteopetrosis in the oc/oc mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant dams were conditioned with busulphan and their litters transplanted with 1 x 10 (6) normal lineage-depleted bone marrow cells intravenously or intraperitoneally. Mice were followed in terms of survival and engraftment level, {{as well as with}} peripheral blood lineage analysis, bone and eye histopathology and a visual-tracking <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> to assess vision. RESULTS: Busulphan at 15 mg/kg was toxic to oc/oc mice. However, six of seven oc/oc mice conditioned with busulphan 7. 5 mg/kg survived past the normal lifespan with 10 % engraftment, correction of the skeletal phenotype, and normalization of peripheral blood lineages. Busulphan, in contrast to irradiation, did not have adverse effects on the retina as determined by histopathology, and 8 weeks after transplantation control and oc/oc mice retained their vision. CONCLUSION: Low-dose busulphan conditioning and neonatal SCT leads to prolonged survival of oc/oc mice, reverses osteopetrosis and prevents blindness even at low engraftment levels...|$|E
