50|$|If market trade {{consisted}} only {{of simple}} exchange (the exchange of things of equal value by the direct producers themselves), then balancing production effort, output and demand {{would be a}} <b>fairly</b> simple, <b>straightforward</b> matter. But in reality {{it is not so}} straightforward precisely because capitalist market trade is not simple exchange. Production effort, output and demand can be balanced in capitalism, only if sufficient profits are made and the accumulation of capital grows. In reality, products are constantly being sold above or below their value, according to what makes the best possible profit on the turnover, given market fluctuations.|$|R
25|$|Ash {{content of}} coal is the {{non-combustible}} residue left after coal is burnt. It represents the bulk mineral matter after carbon, oxygen, sulfur and water (including from clays) {{has been driven}} off during combustion. Analysis is <b>fairly</b> <b>straightforward,</b> with the coal thoroughly burnt and the ash material expressed {{as a percentage of}} the original weight. It can also give an indication about the quality of coal.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union allowed {{international}} {{activities on the}} archipelago from 1990, with non-Russians given <b>fairly</b> <b>straightforward</b> access. A cooperative venture between the Academy of Sciences, the Norwegian Polar Institute and the Polish Academy of Sciences {{was the first of}} several archaeological expeditions organized by the Institute of Culture in Moscow. That year also saw the reopening of the base at Tikhaya Bay organized jointly by the three countries.|$|E

As it stands {{a number of the}} CSME members are already in a currency union with the Eastern Caribbean dollar and the strength of most regional currencies (with the exception of Jamaica's and Guyana's) should make any future exchange-rate harmonization between CSME members <b>fairly</b> <b>straightforward</b> as a step towards a monetary union.|$|E

There are several escaping schemes that can be used depending on where the untrusted string needs to be placed within an HTML document including HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping, CSS escaping, and URL (or percent) encoding. Most web applications that do not need to accept rich data can use escaping to largely eliminate the risk of XSS attacks in a <b>fairly</b> <b>straightforward</b> manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{half-life}} of the radioisotopes {{produced by}} fusion {{tends to be}} less than those from fission, so that the inventory decreases more rapidly. Unlike fission reactors, whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself, which would be dangerous for about 50 years, and low-level waste for another 100. Although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 years than fission waste, the very short half-life makes the process very attractive, as the waste management is <b>fairly</b> <b>straightforward.</b> By 500 years the material would have the same radiotoxicity as coal ash.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{pressure}} blending using {{ideal gas}} calculations is <b>fairly</b> <b>straightforward.</b> The required mixture is chosen, {{either as a}} best mix which optimises the decompression advantages for acceptable oxygen exposure based on the planned dive profile, or selected {{from a range of}} standardised mixes suitable for a range of depths and times, or optimised to suit available gas stocks or other constraints. The mixture is specified in terms of gas fractions of the component gases, and the convention is to specify the type, (nitrox, trimix or heliox) and composition as percentage by volume of oxygen, helium if present, and nitrogen. The remainder of nitrogen is not always specifically stated, and is assumed to be the balance.|$|E
25|$|Firuz Shah Tughlaq built a {{new capital}} city {{on the banks of}} the Yamuna River in 1351 and called it Firuzabad. The {{architecture}} of the fort was <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>straightforward.</b> The city had three palaces and a citadel known as Feroz Shah Kotla. The king's as well as his wife's quarters were situated along the riverfront. The structures within the enclosure walls of the fort were barracks, armories, servant's rooms, halls for audience, an imposing mosque as well as public and private baths and a stepped well or baoli. An Ashokan pillar brought from Topara, Ambala was mounted on top of a pyramidal three-tiered construction. No gates of this period exist.|$|R
40|$|If {{schools are}} going to help {{students}} seeking to become career ready, they will need to implement literacy programs that reflect the demands of the workplace. Students need to possess strong thinking, problem-solving, and literacy skills. Simply creating the career- and collegeready standards and assessments and introducing them to schools, parents, and communities will not be enough. The issue is <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>straightforward.</b> Students graduating without the necessary literacy and academic skills will be unable to hold the productive jobs that are open now and that will be available in the future. According to statistics maintained by the Association for Manufacturing Excellence, there are well over 100, 000 manufacturing jobs open right now for those who have the academic skills to be trainable for this kind of work.

40|$|Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTD) {{refers to}} a large {{category}} of disorders of the muscles, tendons, or nerves and are the summary results of microtrauma caused, precipitated, or aggravated by repeated exertion or movements of the body. They go by many names in the literature. They have {{become a matter of}} urgent ergonomic concerns for manufacturers, insurance companies, health care provides, and government agencies. Since CTD are usually caused by repeated and/or forceful exertions, often in the hand-arm-shoulder region. They predominantly occur to soft tissues, such as tendons and ligaments, and to nerves and blood vessels. They are commonly associated with certain occupational and leisure activities. Many CTD can be avoided by a set of <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>straightforward</b> ergonomic procedures. In this presentation, the author will share his views on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment including the ergonomic measures to avoid CTD...|$|R
25|$|<b>Fairly</b> <b>straightforward</b> {{statistics}} provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
25|$|Contact {{rules are}} <b>fairly</b> <b>straightforward</b> and {{are similar to}} other contact sports. Tackles are legal between the knees and shoulders. A player may not {{initiate}} a tackle with two hands. All tackles must be initiated from the front side of the opposing player. Any back tackles made {{will result in a}} yellow card, however, if the player turns their back into the tackle, it is not considered illegal. Players can only tackle other players of their same position (with keepers considered chasers) if they have the ball. Pushes are allowed if the arm is held straight; it is illegal to push if the arm is bent and then extended when pushing another player. Players are not allowed to dive for balls, trip opposing players, or initiate contact around the neck. If a player is found making any of these offenses it will result in a card depending on the severity of the offense.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacotherapy {{research}} for unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma offers new treatment possibilities. In {{addition to the}} advances with recently approved agents, ongoing research into combination therapy, such as dabrafenib and trametinib, may reveal a more effective and better-tolerated option for patients with metastatic melanoma. One important pathway in melanin synthesis involves the transcription factor MITF. The MITF gene is highly conserved and is found in people, mice, birds, and even fish. MITF production is regulated via a <b>fairly</b> <b>straightforward</b> pathway. UV radiation causes increased expression of transcription factor p53 in keratinocytes, and p53 causes these cells to produce melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which binds to melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1R) on melanocytes. Ligand-binding at MC1R receptors activates adenylate cyclases, which produce cAMP, which activates CREB, which promote MITF expression. The targets of MITF include p16 (a CDK inhibitor) and Bcl2, a gene essential to melanocyte survival. It {{is often difficult to}} design drugs that interfere with transcription factors, but perhaps new drugs will be discovered that can impede some reaction in the pathway upstream of MITF.|$|E
40|$|A sphere mesh, {{hereafter}} called {{simply a}} spheroid, is a rectangular array of processors with the rows wrapped around {{to form a}} ring, and the columns extended and meeting at a node at both the top and bottom. The appearance {{is that of a}} ball. The top node is the north pole and the bottom node is the south pole. A new algorithm is presented to recognize a spheroid. A program was written to determine if the new spheroid recognition algorithm is valid. The program was written in C and tested using a representation of a network's nodes and their neighbors. The program tests several spheroids of different dimensions and different spheroid-like structures. The program found the spheroids and rejected the non-spheroids on the test data. The algorithm presented here is <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>straightforward.</b> However, its true importance {{lies in the fact that}} it forms the foundation for algorithms for recognition of more complex mesh like structures, such as, torus, and 3 -dimensional mesh...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since its}} first known usage during the {{so-called}} 2 ̆ 2 Jew Bill 2 ̆ 2 controversy concerning the naturalization process for English Jews in the 1750 s, the term Jewish Question has connoted a <b>fairly</b> simple, <b>straightforward</b> idea: How should a state craft policies to 2 ̆ 2 properly 2 ̆ 2 handle its Jewish population. However, its inherent subjectivity {{and the sheer}} multitude of possibilities ensured that no correspondingly simple, straightforward answer to the Jewish Question was offered in any country throughout Europe. Mired in centuries-old religious strife, constantly shifting boundaries and mounds of legislation, Russia 2 ̆ 7 s encounter with the Jewish Question stands out {{as one of the}} most complex— capable of perplexing even its most dedicated and knowledgeable scholars. Given this track record of bewilderment, historian Simon Dubnow questioned Tsar Alexander III 2 ̆ 7 s request for the formation of the High Commission for the Study of Existing Laws on the Jews in early 1883, which followed two years of heavy anti- Jewish pogroms centered in southwestern Russia. As a student of history, the quick-witted Dubnow recognized that the group better known as the Pahlen Commission faced a 2 ̆ 2 Sisyphus task 2 ̆ 2 that previous 2 ̆ 2 bureaucratic creations 2 ̆ 2 in Russia had promptly abandoned due to the perceived impossibility of the task. Despite these well documented difficulties, one member of the Pahlen Commission single-handedly drafted an explanation of the Jewish Question that belied its perceptions as an endlessly confusing labyrinth of religion and policy...|$|R
25|$|In another {{episode that}} focused on myths {{surrounding}} electronic security devices, there was a segment on defeating biometric fingerprint readers using various methods. One of these techniques involved creating a fake 3D fingerprint from a 2D image of the authorized print. After some trial and error, the team successfully cast a viable ballistics gel reproduction using a copper-coated circuit board, {{a picture of the}} fingerprint printed on acetate, and a photochemical acid etching process. After the reproduction was shown to defeat both fingerprint scanners, and although the chemicals used during the etching process are never identified, the narrator still hints at an important step having been edited out and discourages viewers from trying it themselves. None of the other techniques that successfully defeated the fingerprint scanners or the other security devices tested in the episode were censored or obfuscated, perhaps because the rest were all <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>straightforward</b> methods, such as holding up a bedsheet or moving extremely slowly to hide from ultrasonic motion detectors or holding up a pane of glass to defeat thermal motion detectors.|$|R
25|$|The {{oscillating}} universe theory—that {{the universe}} {{will end in}} a collapse or 'big crunch' followed by another big bang, and so on—dates from 1930. Cosmologists such as professor Alexander Vilenkin from Tufts University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Max Tegmark suggest that if space is sufficiently large and uniform, or infinite as some theories suggest, and if quantum theory is true such {{that there is only}} a finite number of configurations within a finite volume possible, due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, then identical instances of the history of Earth's entire Hubble volume occur every so often, simply by chance. Tegmark calculates that our nearest so-called doppelgänger, is 1010115 meters away from us (a double exponential function larger than a googolplex). In principle, {{it would be impossible to}} scientifically verify an identical Hubble volume. However, it does follow as a <b>fairly</b> <b>straightforward</b> consequence from otherwise unrelated scientific observations and theories. Tegmark suggests that statistical analyses exploiting the anthropic principle provide an opportunity to test multiverse theories in some cases. Generally, science would consider a multiverse theory that posits neither a common point of causation, nor the possibility of interaction between universes, to be an ideal speculation. However, it is a fundamental assumption of cosmology that the universe continues to exist beyond the scope of the observable universe, and that the distribution of matter is everywhere the same at such a large scale (see cosmological principle).|$|E

5000|$|Michael Dibdin {{writing in}} The Independent {{explains}} that [...] "The title puns on the Elizabethan sense of 'juggle': to play tricks {{so as to}} cheat or deceive somebody. Everyone in the novel does this to some extent, wittingly or not, {{as they try to}} juggle the details of their lives, keeping all the balls in the air, holding the pattern together. The most daring and skilful juggler of all is Barbara Trapido herself, who puts her characters through dizzying permutations of gender, identity, background and relationships, both personal and genetic. The pace increases imperceptibly, creeping up on the reader, until what started as a <b>fairly</b> sober and <b>straightforward</b> study of generational conflicts ends in a pyrotechnic climax which exploits every Shakespearian device - identical twins, lost siblings, transposed parents, unlikely couples, outrageous coincidences and brazenly expedient plotting - to an extent which might have made even the Bard blush."

40|$|The Abbott government’s tough {{stance on}} border {{protection}} doesn’t only apply to asylum seekers arriving by boat For almost five years, Solomon Islander Francesca Teua {{has been trying}} to convince the federal government to let her stay in Australia with her two Australian-citizen children, Kamoa, aged nine, and Alexandra, two. Teua’s hope is that the new immigration minister, Peter Dutton, will use his discretion to grant her a permanent visa, but she has already had similar requests knocked back twice. And there is no telling {{how long it will take}} the minister to consider his position. It might come as a surprise that the mother of two children, both of whom are Australian citizens by birth, doesn’t also have an automatic right to live in Australia. At the very least, given the federal government’s professed focus on families, close parental relationships and the best interests of the child, it would seem safe to assume that Teua, in the absence of serious health or security concerns, would be able to traverse a <b>fairly</b> short and <b>straightforward</b> path to a permanent visa.

40|$|One {{can recall}} the not too distant past when {{knowledge}} {{was thought to}} be an innocent reflection of “reality ” and the process of its production and transmission <b>fairly</b> benign and <b>straightforward.</b> While there had been occasional doubts expressed, the foundation of scholarship on the whole rested on such a bedrock. Revolutionary and evolutionary changes in recent decades, however, swept the whole intellectual world and sent the house of old certainties almost crumbling under the weight of incessant attacks. The “postie” 1 waves have pushed the pendulum to the opposite extreme. All knowledge now tend to be seen as politicized, oftentimes indiscriminately so. Among bodies of knowledge, history is one of those that have reached the highest level of politicization. Its nature being repository of a nation’s (or certain group’s) identity/ies makes it a fiercely contested terrain among those who have axes to grind. Suspicion of such nature has been expressed relatively early but systematic study of ideological underpinnings of writing and teaching of history began to flourish only several decades back.

The two databases in my focus will be the elexiko-project by the IdS (=Institute for the German Language), Mannheim, and the DWDS-project by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Letters & Sciences. Both items are corpus-based and by self-definition claim to be comprehensive word information systems of German. Eventually, I would like to put the user perspective on a scholarly level and I will try to pursue the view of a professional user – {{in this case a}} linguist and/or German philologist. I will apply two <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>straightforward</b> search-queries derived from linguistic research to both resources. Thereby, first, I will try to show what kind of material and information can be obtained from both databases in their present state. Second, an attempt to summarize the specifics to be fulfilled {{in order to meet the}} needs of a professional in like databases will be made and a conclusion in the form of some statements will be given of what can be expected from web-based word-information-systems, what can – and what should – be provided to embrace the needs of the professional user. Hitherto, aspects of the (professional) usability of web-based lexicographical/lexicological databases have not been examined widely; I will stress on the importance of the anticipation of user-needs and the application of user typology for the design and concept of such projects...|$|R
40|$|Tritium {{labelled}} compounds {{are widely used}} in the physical and life sciences. The preparation of such compounds {{is a very important}} area of chemistry. Although the methods are, on the whole, <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>straightforward,</b> there is still a need for improvement. The same applies as far as the analysis of the tritium distribution is concerned. High resolution 3 H NMR spectroscopy of solutions is now a well established technique. However many compounds exist as solids which are either insoluble or sparingly soluble in organic solvents, consequently {{there is a need to}} develop high resolution 3 H NMR spectroscopy of solids. The thesis therefore consists of four chapters. The first is a review dealing with the properties of tritium, the various labelling methods and tritium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the second chapter an account is given of the way in which complex metal tritides and tritiated methyl iodide, an important reagent which enables one to introduce three tritium atoms in a single step and therefore obtain products of very high specific activity, are prepared. In the third chapter an account is given of the synthesis and attempted tritiation of two potential 5 -HT re-uptake inhibitors, prior to their use in biological studies. Whilst the synthesis of the two compounds N-[[[l-[(l-bromo- 2 -naphthalenyl) methyl]- 4 -piperidinyl]amino]carbonyl]- 3 -pyridinecarboxamide, and N-[[[l-[(l-bromo- 6 -fluoro- 2 -naphthalenyl) methyl] - 4 -piperidinyl]amino]carbonyl]- 3 -pyridinecarboxamide, was successful the tritiation procedure led to unforseen difficulties.

40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) {{has been}} in the heartof medical research for the last 5 years. These studies seek forcommon variants in the genome that are linked to risk for commoncomplex diseases (CCDs). Although GWAS has defined a numberof interesting genetic loci for a range of CCDs, the current GWASanalysis has limitation such as investigating the DNA variantsone-by-one focusing on the most significant DNA variants. As aconsequence, most risk variants for CCDs are, in my belief, stillhidden in the GWAS data. Herein, I use a method of GWASanalysis that considers risk-enrichment for groups of functionallyassociated genes defined by for example gene networks, believedto play a role in CCDs. In this method, a set of expression SNP (single nucleotidepolymorphism) was selected from genes which are known to berelated to coronary artery disease (CAD) in a way that a singleeSNP was chosen for each gene. Then using the data availablefrom the International HapMap Project and a GWAS data available,it is possible to find SNPs which are in strong linkage withthe initial set, which we call it expanded set. Depending on theassociation of the initial set to the CAD, expanded set can showan enrichment score greater or smaller compared to the null distributionset of SNPs with same properties of the expanded set. In conclusions, CCDs are not a consequence of isolated geneticvariants/genes in isolated pathways but instead sets of geneticvariants/genes acting in conjunction, cause CAD. Genetic riskenrichment analysis is a <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>straightforward</b> methodto determine to what extent a group of functionally associatedgenetic variants/genes are enriched for a given CCD. In addition,this analysis can perhaps help to decipher some of the 90 - 85 % ofrisk variation in populations that remains unaccounted...|$|R
