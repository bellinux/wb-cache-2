25|$|Two-tone, striped masonry. Russian architects {{borrowed}} the Byzantine tradition of adorning <b>flat</b> <b>wall</b> surfaces with horizontal striped patterns. Usually, wide bands of dark red base brickwork were interleaved with narrow stripes of yellow of grey brick, slightly set {{back into the}} wall. Reverse (dark red stripes over grey background) was rare, usually associated with Georgian variety of churches built in NicholasII period. The importance of colour pattern increased with building size: it was nearly universal in large cathedrals but unnecessary in small parish churches.|$|E
25|$|Externally, Concourse C and Concourse B {{before their}} {{reconstruction}} were radically {{different than the}} terminal structure, consisting of straight radial spokes clad with white panels. Concourse C included a circular end which invokes {{the appearance of the}} terminal, whereas Concourse B terminated at a <b>flat</b> <b>wall.</b> The concourse walls had relatively few windows, typically at waiting and dining areas. The presence of multiple shops, restrooms and service areas reduced the need for windows in the concourses. Jetways were used {{for the majority of the}} gates and aircraft, though Delta Connection and United Express used stairs leading to the tarmac to board flights on regional jets (currently all flights at the new concourses use jetways). Passenger gates and services are located on the second floor with airside baggage handling and aircraft servicing on the ground level.|$|E

It was a long, narrow parallelogram, which had a <b>flat</b> <b>wall</b> at one end and ought to have had a <b>flat</b> <b>wall</b> at the other; but that end was broken by a wedge or angle of space, like the prow of a ship. After three days of silence and cocoa, this angle at the end began to infuriate Turnbull. It maddened him to think that two lines came together and pointed at nothing. After the fifth day he was reckless, and poked his head into the corner. After twenty-five days he almost broke his head against it. Then he became quite cool and stupid again, and began to examine it like a sort of Robinson Crusoe.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of the {{velocity}} {{characteristics of the}} flows in two curved diffusers of rectangular cross section with C and S-shaped centerlines are presented and related to measurements of wall heat transfer coefficients along the heated <b>flat</b> <b>walls</b> of the ducts. The velocity results were obtained by laser-Doppler anemometry in a water tunnel and the heat transfer results by liquid crystal thermography in a wind tunnel. The thermographic technique allowed the rapid and inexpensive measurement of wall heat transfer coefficients along <b>flat</b> <b>walls</b> of arbitrary boundary shapes with an accuracy of about 5 percent. The results show that an increase in secondary flow velocities near the heated wall causes {{an increase in the}} local wall heat transfer coefficient, and quantify the variation for maximum secondary-flow velocities in a range from 1. 5 to 17 percent of the bulk flow velocity...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} simulational {{methodology}} allowing for simulation of the pressure-driven {{flow in the}} pore with <b>flat</b> and polymer-modified <b>walls.</b> Our approach is based on dissipative particle dynamics and we combine earlier ideas of fluid-like walls and reverse flow. As a test case we consider the oligomer flow through the pore with <b>flat</b> <b>walls</b> and demonstrate good thermostatting qualities of the proposed method. We found the inhomogeneities in both oligomer shape and alignment across the pore leading to a non-parabolic velocity profiles. The method is subsequently applied to a nano-channel decorated with a polymer brush stripes arranged perpendicularly to the flow direction. At certain threshold value of a flow force we find a pillar-to-lamellar morphological transition, {{which leads to the}} brush enveloping the pore wall by a relatively smooth layer. At higher flow rates, the flow of oligomer has similar properties {{as in the case of}} <b>flat</b> <b>walls,</b> but for the narrower effective pore size. We observe stretching and aligning of the polymer molecules along the flow near the pore walls. Comment: 14 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

The greater part of the sculpture here is exclusively ornamentation of a <b>flat</b> <b>wall,</b> or of door panelling; {{only a small portion}} of the church front is thus treated, and the sculpture has no more to do with the form of the building than a piece of a lace veil would have, suspended beside its gates on a festal day; the proportions of shaft and arch might be altered in a hundred different ways, without diminishing their stability; and the pillars would stand more safely on the ground than on the backs of these carved animals.|$|E

The land, even in the month of November, smiled under its influence. A steep but regular ascent led from the terrace to the neighbouring eminence, and conducted Mannering to the front of the old castle. It consisted of two massive round towers projecting deeply and darkly at the extreme angles of a curtain, or <b>flat</b> <b>wall,</b> which united them, and thus protecting the main entrance, that opened through a lofty arch in the centre of the curtain into the inner court of the castle. The arms of the family, carved in freestone, frowned over the gateway, and the portal showed the spaces arranged by the architect for lowering the portcullis and raising the drawbridge. A rude farm-gate, made of young fir-trees nailed together, now formed the only safeguard of this once formidable entrance. The esplanade in front of the castle commanded a noble prospect.|$|E

60|$|The cabbage is a solid; {{it can be}} {{approached}} from all sides at once; it can be realized by all senses at once. Compared with that the sunflower, {{which can only be}} seen, is a mere pattern, a thing painted on a <b>flat</b> <b>wall.</b> Now, it is this sense of the solidity of things that can only be uttered by the metaphor of eating. To express the cubic content of a turnip, you must be all round it at once. The only way to get all round a turnip at once is to eat the turnip. I think any poetic mind that has loved solidity, the thickness of trees, the squareness of stones, the firmness of clay, must have sometimes wished that they were things to eat. If only brown peat tasted as good as it looks; if only white firwood were digestible! We talk rightly of giving stones for bread: but there are in the Geological Museum certain rich crimson marbles, certain split stones of blue and green, that make me wish my teeth were stronger.|$|E
60|$|Root-climbers.--A {{good many}} plants come under this class, and are {{excellent}} climbers. One {{of the most}} remarkable is the Marcgravia umbellata, the stem of which in the tropical forests of South America, as I hear from Mr. Spruce, grows in a curiously flattened manner against the trunks of trees; here and there it puts forth claspers (roots), which adhere to the trunk, and, if the latter be slender, completely embrace it. When this plant has climbed to the light, it produces free branches with rounded stems, clad with sharp- pointed leaves, wonderfully different in appearance from those borne by the stem as long as it remains adherent. This surprising difference in the leaves, I have also observed in a plant of Marcgravia dubia in my hothouse. Root-climbers, as far as I have seen, namely, the Ivy (Hedera helix), Ficus repens, and F. barbatus, have no power of movement, not even from the light to the dark. As previously stated, the Hoya carnosa (Asclepiadaceae) is a spiral twiner, and likewise adheres by rootlets even to a <b>flat</b> <b>wall.</b> The tendril-bearing Bignonia Tweedyana emits roots, which curve half round and adhere to thin sticks. The Tecoma radicans (Bignoniaceae), which is closely allied to many spontaneously revolving species, climbs by rootlets; nevertheless, its young shoots apparently move about more than can be accounted for by the varying action of the light.|$|E

"When I woke up {{shortly after}} midnight his warning {{came to my}} mind with its hint of danger that seemed, in the starred darkness, real {{enough to make me}} get up for the purpose of having a look round. On the hill a big fire burned, {{illuminating}} fitfully a crooked corner of the station-house. One of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks, armed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness, showed the exact position of the camp where Mr. Kurtz's adorers were keeping their uneasy vigil. The monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration. A steady droning sound of many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from the black, <b>flat</b> <b>wall</b> of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses. I believe I dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke me up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut short all at once, and the low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence. I glanced casually into the little cabin. A light was burning within, but Mr. Kurtz was not there.|$|E
40|$|Magnetotactic {{bacteria}} {{have the}} potential to controllably reach stagnant fluids inside the human body and achieve targeted drug delivery. In this application, motion of the magnetotactic bacteria is influenced by the near-surface effects such as the background flows and surface interactions. Here, we provide a hydrodynamic model of bipolarly-flagellated magnetotactic bacteria (Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense strain MSR- 1) based on the resistive-force theory to resemble the helical body and the two flagella bundles, and investigate their swimming characteristics in two environments, i. e., free-space and near <b>flat</b> <b>walls.</b> The free-space is studied using capillary tubes with depth of 200 ßm, whereas the effect of the <b>flat</b> <b>walls</b> is investigated using microfluidic chips with depth of 5 μm.

We show that BPS-domain walls in 5 D, N = 4 supergravity can never be curved if they are supported by the supergravity scalar only. Furthermore, a purely Abelian gauge group or a purely semisimple gauge group can never lead to a curved domain <b>wall,</b> and the <b>flat</b> <b>walls</b> for these gaugings always exhibit a runaway behavior...|$|R
60|$|The declining sun {{had shifted}} the shadows from {{west to east}} amongst the houses of the town. It had shifted them upon the whole extent of the immense Campo, with the white walls of its haciendas on the knolls {{dominating}} the green distances; with its grass-thatched ranches crouching {{in the folds of}} ground by the banks of streams; with the dark islands of clustered trees on a clear sea of grass, and the precipitous range of the Cordillera, immense and motionless, emerging from the billows of the lower forests like the barren coast of a land of giants. The sunset rays striking the snow-slope of Higuerota from afar gave it an air of rosy youth, while the serrated mass of distant peaks remained black, as if calcined in the fiery radiance. The undulating surface of the forests seemed powdered with pale gold dust; and away there, beyond Rincon, hidden from the town by two wooded spurs, the rocks of the San Tome gorge, with the <b>flat</b> <b>wall</b> of the mountain itself crowned by gigantic ferns, took on warm tones of brown and yellow, with red rusty streaks, and the dark green clumps of bushes rooted in crevices. From the plain the stamp sheds and the houses of the mine appeared dark and small, high up, like the nests of birds clustered on the ledges of a cliff. The zigzag paths resembled faint tracings scratched on the wall of a cyclopean blockhouse.

60|$|And {{the first}} broad {{conclusion}} we shall deduce from observance of natural color {{in such cases}} will be, that it never follows form, but is arranged on an entirely separate system. What mysterious connection there may be between {{the shape of the}} spots on an animal's skin and its anatomical system, I do not know, nor even if such a connection has in any wise been traced: but to the eye the systems are entirely separate, and in many cases that of color is accidentally variable. The stripes of a zebra do not follow the lines of its body or limbs, still less the spots of a leopard. In the plumage of birds, each feather bears a part of the pattern which is arbitrarily carried over the body, having indeed certain graceful harmonies with the form, diminishing or enlarging in directions which sometimes follow, but also not unfrequently oppose, the directions of its muscular lines. Whatever harmonies there may be, are distinctly like those of two separate musical parts, coinciding here and there only--never discordant, but essentially different I hold this, then, for the first great principle of architectural color. Let it be visibly independent of form. Never paint a column with vertical lines, but always cross it.[13] Never give separate mouldings separate colors (I know this is heresy, but I never shrink from any conclusions, however contrary to human authority, to which I am led by observance of natural principles); and in sculptured ornaments I do not paint the leaves or figures (I cannot help the Elgin frieze) of one color and their ground of another, but vary both the ground and the figures with the same harmony. Notice how Nature does it in a variegated flower; not one leaf red and another white, but a point of red and a zone of white, or whatever it may be, to each. In certain places you may run your two systems closer, and here and there let them be parallel for a note or two, but see that the colors and the forms coincide only as two orders of mouldings do; the same for an instant, but each holding its own course. So single members may sometimes have single colors: as a bird's head is sometimes of one color and its shoulders another, you may make your capital of one color and your shaft another; but in general the best place for color is on broad surfaces, not on the points of interest in form. An animal is mottled on its breast and back, rarely on its paws or about its eyes; so put your variegation boldly on the <b>flat</b> <b>wall</b> and broad shaft, but be shy of it in the capital and moulding; in all cases it is a safe rule to simplify color when form is rich, and vice versâ; and I think it would be well in general to carve all capitals and graceful ornaments in white marble, and so leave them.|$|E
6000|$|Can the {{transports}} {{of first}} love be calmed, checked, {{turned to a}} cold suspicion of the future by a grave quotation from a work on Political Economy? I ask--is it conceivable? Is it possible? Would it be right? With my feet on the very shores {{of the sea and}} about to embrace my blue-eyed dream, what could a good-natured warning as to spoiling one's life mean to my youthful passion? It was the most unexpected and the last too of the many warnings I had received. It sounded to me very bizarre--and, uttered {{as it was in the}} very presence of my enchantress, like the voice of folly, the voice of ignorance. But I was not so callous or so stupid as not to recognise there also the voice of kindness. And then the vagueness of the warning--because what can be the meaning of the phrase: to spoil one's life?--arrested one's attention by its air of wise profundity. At any rate, as I have said before, the words of la belle Madame Delestang made me thoughtful for a whole evening. I tried to understand and tried in vain, not having any notion of life as an enterprise that could be mismanaged. But I left off being thoughtful shortly before midnight, at which hour, haunted by no ghosts of the past and by no visions of the future, I walked down the quay of the Vieux Port to join the pilot-boat of my friends. I knew where she would be waiting for her crew, in the little bit of a canal behind the Fort at the entrance of the harbour. The deserted quays looked very white and dry in the moonlight and as if frost-bound in the sharp air of that December night. A prowler or two slunk by noiselessly; a custom-house guard, soldier-like, a sword by his side, paced close under the bowsprits of the long row of ships moored bows on opposite the long, slightly curved, continuous <b>flat</b> <b>wall</b> of the tall houses that seemed to be one immense abandoned building with innumerable windows shuttered closely. Only here and there a small dingy cafe for sailors cast a yellow gleam on the bluish sheen of the flagstones. Passing by, one heard a deep murmur of voices inside--nothing more. How quiet everything was at the end of the quays on the last night on which I went out for a service cruise as a guest of the Marseilles pilots! Not a footstep, except my own, not a sigh, not a whispering echo of the usual revelry going on in the narrow unspeakable lanes of the Old Town reached my ear--and suddenly, with a terrific jingling rattle of iron and glass, the omnibus of the Jolliette on its last journey swung round the corner of the dead wall which faces across the paved road the characteristic angular mass of the Fort St. Jean. Three horses trotted abreast with the clatter of hoofs on the granite setts, and the yellow, uproarious machine jolted violently behind them, fantastic, lighted up, perfectly empty and with the driver apparently asleep on his swaying perch above that amazing racket. I flattened myself against the wall and gasped. It was a stunning experience. Then after staggering on a few paces in the shadow of the Fort casting a darkness more intense than that of a clouded night upon the canal, I saw the tiny light of a lantern standing on the quay, and became aware of muffled figures making towards it from various directions. Pilots of the Third Company hastening to embark. Too sleepy to be talkative they step on board in silence. But a few low grunts and an enormous yawn are heard. Somebody even ejaculates: [...] "Ah! Coquin de sort!" [...] and sighs wearily at his hard fate.|$|E
