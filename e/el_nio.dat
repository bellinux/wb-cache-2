The {{results indicate that the}} MJO exhibits distinct features during eastern Pacific (EP) <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events, as compared to central Pacific (CP) <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events. First, the intensity of the MJO is weakened during EP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> winters from the tropical eastern Indian Ocean to the western Pacific, but enhanced during CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> winters. Second, the range of the MJO eastward propagation is different during the two types of <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events. During EP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> winters, the MJO propagates eastwards to 120 A degrees W, but only to 180 A degrees during CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> winters. Finally, the frequency in eight phases of the MJO may be affected by the two types of <b>El</b> <b>Nio.</b> Phases 2 and 3 display a stronger MJO frequency during EP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> winters, but phases 4 and 5 during CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> winters...|$|E
40|$|Recent studies {{report that}} {{two types of}} <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events have been observed. One is the cold tongue <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> or Eastern Pacific <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> (EP <b>El</b> <b>Nio),</b> which is {{characterized}} by relatively large sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the eastern Pacific, {{and the other is}} the warm pool <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> (a. k. a. 'Central Pacific El Nio' (CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio)</b> or 'El Nio Modoki'), in which SST anomalies are confined to the central Pacific. Here the vertical structure variability of the periods during EP and CP is investigated based on the GFDL_CM 2. 1 model in order to explain the difference in equatorial wave dynamics and associated negative feedback mechanisms. It is shown that the mean stratification {{in the vicinity of the}} thermocline of the central Pacific is reduced during CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio,</b> which favours the contribution of the gravest baroclinic mode relatively to the higher-order slower baroclinic mode. Energetic Kelvin and first-meridional Rossby wave are evidenced during the CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> with distinctive amplitude and propagating characteristics according to their vertical structure (mostly first and second baroclinic modes). In particular, the first baroclinic mode during CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> is associated to the ocean basin mode and participates to the recharge process during the whole <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> cycle, whereas the second baroclinic mode is mostly driving the discharge process through the delayed oscillator mechanism. This may explain that the phase transition from warm to neutral/cold conditions during the CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> is delayed and/or disrupted compared to the EP <b>El</b> <b>Nio.</b> Our results have implications for the interpretation of the variability during periods of high CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> occurrence like the last decade...|$|E
40|$|Our {{early work}} (Wang and Wang in J Clim 26 : 1322 - 1338, 2013) {{separates}} <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> Modoki events into <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> Modoki I and II because they show different impacts on rainfall in southern China and typhoon landfall activity. The warm SST anomalies {{originate in the}} equatorial central Pacific and subtropical northeastern Pacific for <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> Modoki I and II, respectively. <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> Modoki I features a symmetric SST anomaly distribution about the equator with the maximum warming in the equatorial central Pacific, whereas <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> Modoki II shows an asymmetric distribution with the warm SST anomalies extending from the northeastern Pacific to the equatorial central Pacific. The present paper investigates {{the influence of the}} various groups of <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events on the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Similar to canonical <b>El</b> <b>Nio,</b> <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> Modoki I is associated with a weakening of the Walker circulation in the Indo-Pacific region which decreases precipitation in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean and maritime continent and thus results in the surface easterly wind anomalies off Java-Sumatra. Under the Bjerknes feedback, the easterly wind anomalies induce cold SST anomalies off Java- Sumatra, and thus a positive IOD tends to occur in the Indian Ocean during canonical <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> and <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> Modoki I. However, <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> Modoki II has an opposite impact on the Walker circulation, resulting in more precipitation and surface westerly wind anomalies off Java-Sumatra.

40|$|Most of {{the annual}} {{rainfall}} over India occurs during the Southwest (June-September) and Northeast (October-December) monsoon periods. In March 2008, however, Southern peninsular India and Sri Lanka received the largest rainfall anomaly on record since 1979, with amplitude comparable to summer-monsoon interannual anomalies. This anomalous rainfall appeared to be modulated at intraseasonal timescale by the Madden Julian Oscillation, and was synchronous with a decaying La Nia event in the Pacific Ocean. Was this a coincidence or indicative of a teleconnection pattern? In this paper, we explore factors controlling rainfall over southern India and Sri Lanka between January and April, i. e. outside of the southwest and northeast monsoons. This period accounts for 20 % of annual precipitation over Sri Lanka and 10 % over the southern Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Interannual variability is strong (about 40 % of the January-April climatology). Intraseasonal rainfall anomalies over southern India and Sri Lanka are significantly associated with equatorial eastward propagation, characteristic of the Madden Julian Oscillation. At the interannual timescale, we find a clear connection with El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); with <b>El</b> <b>Nios</b> being associated with decreased rainfall (correlation of - 0. 46 significant at the 98 % level). There is also a significant link with local SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean, and in particular with the inter-hemispheric sea surface temperature (SST) gradient over the Indian Ocean (with colder SST south of the equator being conducive to more rainfall, correlation of 0. 55 significant at the 99 % level). La Nias/cold SSTs south of the equator {{tend to have a}} larger impact than <b>El</b> <b>Nios.</b> We discuss two possible mechanisms that could explain these statistical relationships: (1) subsidence over southern India remotely forced by Pacific SST anomalies; (2) impact of ENSO-forced regional Indian Ocean SST anomalies on convection.

This study used passive {{microwave remote sensing}} data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS), providing observations under all weather conditions, to investigate the LST over the Amazon and Congo rainforests. The SSM/I and SSMIS {{data were collected from}} 1996 to 2012. The morning and afternoon observations from passive microwave remote sensing facilitate the investigation of the interannual changes of LST anomalies on a diurnal basis. As a result of the variability of cloud cover and the corresponding reduction of solar radiation, the afternoon LST anomalies tend to vary more than the morning LST anomalies. The dominant spatial and temporal patterns for interseasonal variations of the LST anomalies over the tropical rainforest were analyzed. The impacts of droughts and <b>El</b> <b>Ni?os</b> on this LST were also investigated. Differences between early morning and late afternoon LST anomalies were identified by the remote sensing product, with the morning LST anomalies controlled by humidity (according to comparisons with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data).

The Holocene {{history of}} the North American Monsoon: 'known knowns' and 'known unknowns' in {{understanding}} its spatial and temporal complexity. Quaternary Science Reviews, 120, 1 - 27. Evidence for climatic change across the North American Monsoon (NAM) and adjacent areas is reviewed, drawing on continental and marine records {{and the application of}} climate models. Patterns of change at 12, 000, 9000, 6000 and 4000 cal yr BP are presented to capture the nature of change from the Younger Dryas (YD) and through the mid-Holocene. At the YD, conditions were cooler overall, wetter in the north and drier in the south, while moving into the Holocene wetter conditions became established in the south and then spread north as the NAM strengthened. Until c. 8000 cal yr BP, the Laurentide Ice Sheet influenced precipitation in the north by pushing the Bermuda High further south. The peak extent of the NAM seems to have occurred around 6000 cal yr BP. 4000 cal yr BP marks the start of important changes across the NAM region, with drying in the north and the establishment of the clear differences between the summer-rain dominated south and central areas and the north, where winter rain is more important. This differentiation between south and north is crucial to understanding many climate responses across the NAM. This increasing variability is coincident with the declining influence of orbital forcing. 4000 cal yr BP also marks the onset of significant anthropogenic activity in many areas. For the last 2000 years, the focus is on higher temporal resolution change, with strong variations across the region. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) is characterised by centennial scale ?megadrought? across the southwest USA, associated with cooler tropical Pacific SSTs and persistent La Ni?a type conditions. Proxy data from southern Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean reveal generally wetter conditions, whereas records from the highlands of central Mexico and much of the Yucatan are typified by long -term drought. The Little Ice Age (LIA), in the north, was characterised by cooler, wetter winter conditions that have been linked with increased frequency of <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o's.</b> Proxy records in the central and southern regions reveal generally dry LIA conditions, consistent with cooler SSTs in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. This synthesis demonstrates that in some periods, one major forcing can dominate across the whole area (e. g. insolation in the early-mid Holocene), but at other times there is strong variability in patterns of change due to the differential impact of forcings such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on precipitation seasonality. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

Since the Pacific Ocean {{appears to be the}} cradle of <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> events, most research efforts have been centered on this body of water and its surrounding landmasses. Fewer studies have sought to determine if <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> and ENSO have had an effect in the Indian Ocean during the last several decades, and until this thesis no research has investigated wind conditions in the Indian Ocean during historic <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> and ENSO episodes. This study specifically addresses the question: "Did the voyage durations of the Dutch East India sailing ships during the 17 th and 18 th centuries, traveling between the Cape of Good Hope and Batavia and from Ceylon to the Cape of Good Hope show anomalies during <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> and/or ENSO periods?" The voyage durations of the Dutch merchant sailing ships are used as a proxy indicator to determine if wind conditions in the Indian Ocean changed during 17 th and 18 th century <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> and ENSO events. Because sailing vessels during that time were exclusively wind-powered, their sailing schedules, directions and durations can reflect the prevailing wind conditions during their journeys. With statistical analyses using the independent t test, voyage durations of the Dutch East India Company vessels during <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> and ENSO episodes are compared to those during non-El Ni??o and non-ENSO periods. Journey durations during the year immediately prior and succeeding <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> and ENSO are examined as well. The results of the statistical t tests suggest that the tradewinds in the southern Indian Ocean weakened in the year prior to 17 th and 18 th century ENSO events, while the westerlies seem to be unchanged.

40|$|Slow {{modulation}} of interannual variability and {{its relationship}} to El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is investigated for the period of 1870 - 2007 using ship-board surface meteorological observations along a frequently travelled track across the North Indian Ocean (NIO; from the Gulf of Eden through Malacca Strait) and the South China Sea (to Luzon Strait). During the decades in the late 19 th-early 20 th century and in the late 20 th century, the <b>El</b> Niño-induced <b>NIO</b> warming persists longer than during the 1910 s-mid 1970 s, well into the summer following the peak of El Niño. During the epochs of the prolonged NIO warming, rainfall drops and sea level pressure rises over the tropical Northwest Pacific in summer following El Niño. Conversely during the period when the NIO warming dissipates earlier, these atmospheric anomalies are not well developed. This supports the Indian Ocean capacitor concept as a mechanism prolonging El Niño influence into summer through the persistent Indian Ocean warming after El Niño itself has dissipated. The above centennial modulation of ENSO teleconnection to the Indo- Northwest Pacific region is reproduced in an atmospheric general circulation model forced by observed SST. The modulation is correlated not with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation but rather with the ENSO variance itself.

An eight member ocean reanalyses (SODA 2. 2. 6) from 1871 to 2008 {{is produced by}} using forcing from eight ensemble members of an atmospheric reanalysis. The ensemble reanalysis shows that <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o</b> has prominent decadal variability. Weak El Ni?os occur throughout the entire record whereas the occurrence of strong El Ni?os varies, with strong <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o</b> {{at the beginning and}} end of the record. The strength of La Ni?a is weaker than for <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o,</b> and has less variability. Although for any given <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o</b> year all ensemble members show the occurrence of <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o,</b> in some ensemble members the <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o</b> is strong while in others it is weak. When the timing of the onset of Westerly Wind Bursts (WWBs) occurs earlier in the year and the strength of WWBs is stronger, strong <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o</b> occurs. To study the importance of the background state in the tropical Pacific Ocean on ENSO, long-term trends of tropical Pacific SST, wind stress, subsurface temperature and the sub-tropical cells (STCs) are analyzed. The reanalysis shows that there is a slight cooling trend of SST in the central tropical Pacific due to an enhanced tropical Pacific circulation. Subsurface temperature also has a cooling trend. The STCs, which consist of equatorial upwelling, Ekman transport, extra-tropical subduction and pycnocline transport from the sub-tropical to the tropical region, strengthen from 1900 to 2008. When the STCs are accelerated, equatorial upwelling increases bringing cold water from the subsurface that cools the surface. ENSO variability is also analyzed in the CMIP 5 historical experiments. Results show that most of the models have a realistic representation of the strength of ENSO; however, the location of warming generally extends too far to the west. Overall, properties of ENSO do not show a significant change in most of the CMIP 5 models.

O instrumento, composto por quatro subtestes de execu??o (racioc?nio verbal, l?gico, num?rico e mem?ria) pertencentes ? Provas de Avalia??o da Intelig?ncia para Crian?as Deficientes Visuais (PAIC- DV) e pela Escala de Percep??o de Professores da Intelig?ncia de Crian?as deficientes visuais (EPIC-DV), foi alvo de uma s?rie de estudos visando a investiga??o das suas qualidades psicom?tricas. Diferentes amostras foram utilizadas para alcan?ar esses objetivos: 195 crian?as, sendo 30 deficientes visuais (tipo: adquirida n= 8; cong?nita n= 12; grau: baixa vis?o n= 23; cegueira n= 7) com idades entre sete e 12 anos (M= 9, 76; DP= 1, 81) e 165 crian?as normovisuais, com idades entre sete e 12 anos (M= 11, 57; DP= 0, 41); 15 professores, sendo 10 especializados no atendimento a deficientes visuais e 5 professores de ensino regular, os quais responderam a escala avaliando cada uma das 195 crian?as, assim como um grupo de ju?zes especialistas na ?rea de avalia??o psicol?gica. Os resultados do conjunto PAIC-DV apontaram adequa??o psicom?trica da estrutura fatorial do instrumento, dentro de um modelo com fator de segunda ordem (intelig?ncia geral) e tr?s fatores espec?ficos relacionados aos subtestes Racioc?nio Verbal, L?gico e Num?rico. Foram encontradas diferen?as significativas em rela??o ao total de acertos de cada subteste em rela??o a grupo (crian?as normovisuais apresentaram melhores resultados em todos os subtestes em compara??o com as crian?as com defici?ncia visual), o mesmo n?o ocorrendo em rela??o ao tipo de defici?ncia (somente o subteste de Mem?ria apresentou diferen?as significativas a favor das crian?as com baixa vis?o). Foram encontradas correla??es significativas positivas de {{magnitude}} moderada e fraca para a maioria dos resultados na compara??o entre PAIC-DV e BPR- 5, bem como entre o conjunto PAIC-DV e as notas escolares, tomados como crit?rio externo. ?ndices de consist?ncia interna entre 0, 85 e 0, 88 foram encontrados para cada fator, indicando boa precis?o do instrumento. Os resultados da EPIC-DV, por sua vez, apresentaram evid?ncias de validade de conte?do, por meio da an?lise de ju?zes e evid?ncias de validade de construto por meio de um modelo com fator de segunda ordem (intelig?ncia geral) e quatro fatores espec?ficos relacionados aos subtestes Racioc?nio Verbal, L?gico, Num?rico e Mem?ria. Diferen?as significativas em rela??o ao desempenho em todos os subtestes, com exce??o do racioc?nio num?rico, a favor das crian?as com defici?ncia visual em todos os fatores (com exce??o do racioc?nio num?rico). Em rela??o ao tipo de defici?ncia, diferen?a significativa foi encontrada apenas para o racioc?nio verbal, com melhor desempenho das crian?as com defici?ncia cong?nita e, em rela??o ao grau, n?o foram encontradas diferen?as significativas para nenhum fator. Em rela??o ?s notas escolares, poucas correla??es e de baixa magnitude foram encontradas. A precis?o, por meio da consist?ncia interna variou entre 0, 94 e 0, 97 para cada fator, indicando boa precis?o do instrumento. An?lise complementar, por meio da investiga??o de evid?ncias de validade convergente, usando-se a Bateria de Provas de Racioc?nio 5 indicou correla??es significativas negativas e de magnitude fraca da PAIC-DV com o fator Racioc?nio L?gico e Racioc?nio Num?rico, bem como do Total da EPIC-DV com a prova de Racioc?nio Num?rico. Por fim, foi realizada an?lise de congru?ncia entre os instrumentos que comp?em a bateria, cujos resultados indicaram correla??es significativas positivas moderadas e fracas entre os instrumentos, de modo a indicar a possibilidade de que ambos sejam usados de forma complementar na avalia??o cognitiva de crian?as com defici?ncia visual. Conclui-se que os estudos desenvolvidos com o instrumental trouxeram dados relevantes quanto ? import?ncia de um instrumento espec?fico de avalia??o da intelig?ncia para crian?as com defici?ncia visual e que, estudos com amostras maiores podem enriquecer e contribuir para a expans?o do uso do instrumento constru?do. Considering {{the importance}} of the inclusion of the visually impaired regarding issues investigated by Psychology, this research had the objective of continuing a process of building a battery to assess cognitive abilities of visually impaired children. The instrument, consisting of four subtests (verbal reasoning, logical, numerical and memory) which belong to the Intelligence Assessment Battery for Visually Impaired Children (PAIC-DV) and the scale of Teacher?s Perception of Visually Impaired Children?s Intelligence (EPIC-DV), was the target of a series of studies aiming for the investigation of its psychometric qualities. Different samples were used to achieve these goals: 195 children, with 30 visually impaired (type: acquired n = 8; congenital n = 12; degree: low vision n = 23; blindness n = 7) aged between seven and 12 years (M = 9. 76; DP = 1. 81) and 165 normal vision children, aged between seven and 12 years (M = 11. 57; DP = 0. 41); 15 teachers, with 10 specialized in service to the visually impaired and 5 regular education teachers, which responded to scale evaluating each of the 195 children. The results of the PAIC-DV pointed to psychometric suitability of the instrument?s factorial structure, inside a model with second-order factor (General Intelligence) and three specific factors related to the subtests Verbal Reasoning, Logical and Numeric (the Memory subtest was not inserted in the analysis). Significant differences were also found related to total scores of each subtest within the group, and normal vision children showed better results in all subtests when compared to children with visual impairment. Significant positive correlations were found in moderate magnitude and weak for most of the results in the comparison between PAIC-DV and BPR- 5, as well as between the PAIC-DV and school grades and levels of internal consistency amongst 0. 85 and 0. 88 for each factor, indicating good precision of the instrument. EPIC-DV results showed content evidence validity through the analysis of judges and construct validity evidence by means of a model with second-order factor (General Intelligence) and four specific factors related to the subtests Verbal Reasoning, Logical, Numerical and Memory. Significant differences were found regarding the performance subtests at all, with the exception of numerical reasoning. The evaluations carried out by the teachers showed better performance of children with visual impairment in all factors (with the exception of numerical reasoning), compared to the evaluations carried out for normal vision children. Regarding the type of disability, a significant difference was found only for verbal reasoning, with better performance of children with congenital deficiency and, in relation to the degree, {{no significant differences were found}} for any factor. Considering school grades, few correlations and low magnitude have been found. The reliability, by means of internal consistency ranged from 0. 94 to 0. 97 for each factor, indicating good accuracy of the instrument. Supplementary analysis made through the investigation of convergent validity evidence, used the BPR- 5 that indicated significant negative correlations and weak magnitude from the PAIC-DV with Logical Reasoning and Numerical Reasoning, as well as of the total score of the EPIC-DV with Numerical Reasoning test. Finally, congruence analysis was applied concerning the instruments that structure the battery, whose results indicated significant correlations as moderate positive and weak among the instruments, indicating the possibility that both are used as complements when assessing cognitive aspects of children with visual impairment. We conclude that the studies developed with the instruments brought relevant data about {{the importance of}} a specific intelligence assessment instrument for children with visual impairment, and studies with larger samples can enrich and contribute to the expansion in use of the built instrument. Teniendo en cuenta la importancia de la inclusi?n de la discapacidad visual en las cuestiones investigadas por la psicolog?a, esta investigaci?n tuvo como objetivo continuar con el proceso de construcci?n de una bater?a de pruebas para evaluar las capacidades cognitivas de los ni?os con discapacidad visual. El instrumento consta de cuatro pruebas de rendimiento (razonamiento verbal, l?gico, num?rico y memoria) que pertenece a la Bater?a de Evaluaci?n de Inteligencia para ni?os con discapacidad visual (PAIC-DV) y la Escala de Percepci?n de Maestros acerca de la inteligencia de ni?os con discapacidad visual (EPIC -DV), que fue objeto de una serie de estudios para investigar sus cualidades psicom?tricas. Diferentes muestras se utilizaron para alcanzar estas metas: 195 ni?os, 30 discapacitados visuales (tipo: Adquirida n = 8; cong?nita n = 12; grado: baja visi?n n = 23; ceguera n = 7) con edades comprendidas entre siete y 12 a?os (M = 9. 76, SD = 1. 81) y 165 ni?os videntes, con edades comprendidas entre siete y 12 a?os (M = 11, 57, SD = 0, 41); 15 profesores, 10 especializados en el servicio a personas con discapacidad visual y 5 maestros de escuelas regulares, que respondieron a la escala de evaluaci?n de cada uno de los 195 ni?os. Los resultados de la PAIC-DV se?alaron adecuaci?n psicom?trica de la estructura factorial del instrumento dentro de un modelo con un factor de segundo orden (inteligencia general) y tres factores espec?ficos relacionados con las pruebas de razonamiento verbal, l?gico y num?rico (prueba memoria no fue insertado en el an?lisis). Tambi?n se encontraron diferencias significativas en relaci?n al total de cada prueba en relaci?n con <b>el</b> grupo. Los <b>ni?os</b> con visi?n han obtenido mejores resultados en todas las pruebas en comparaci?n con los ni?os con discapacidad visual. En cuanto al tipo de discapacidad, no se encontraron diferencias significativas, y s?lo la prueba de la memoria mostr? diferencias significativas a favor de los ni?os con baja visi?n. Se encontraron correlaciones significativas positivas de magnitud moderada y baja para la mayor?a de los resultados en comparaci?n entre PAIC-DV y BPR- 5, as? como entre PAIC-DV y los a?os escolares. Los ?ndices de consistencia interna estuvieron entre 0, 85 y 0, 88 para cada factor, lo que indica buen instrumento de precisi?n. Los resultados de EPIC-DV mostraron evidencia de la validez de contenido, a trav?s del an?lisis de los jueces y validez de contenido de pruebas por medio de un modelo con un factor de segundo orden (inteligencia general) y cuatro factores espec?ficos relacionados con las pruebas razonamiento verbal, l?gico, num?rico y la memoria. No se encontraron diferencias significativas con respecto al rendimiento en todas las pruebas, excepto por el razonamiento num?rico. La evaluaci?n hecha por los profesores indicaron un mejor rendimiento de los ni?os con discapacidad visual en todos los factores (excepto para el razonamiento num?rico), en comparaci?n con las evaluaciones para los ni?os videntes. En cuanto al tipo de discapacidad, no se encontraron diferencias significativas, s?lo para el razonamiento verbal, con un mejor rendimiento de los ni?os con discapacidad cong?nita y en relaci?n al grado, no hubo diferencias significativas para cualquier factor. En cuanto a los a?os escolares, se encontraron pocas correlaciones y baja magnitud. La precisi?n a trav?s de la consistencia interna vari? de 0, 94 a la 0, 97 para cada factor, lo que indica buen instrumento de precisi?n. Posterior an?lisis de investigaci?n de validez convergente con la BPR- 5 ha indicado correlaciones significativas negativas y de baja magnitud de PAIC-DV con el Razonamiento L?gico y el factor de Razonamiento Num?rico, as? como el total de la EPIC -DV con la prueba de Razonamiento Num?rico. Por ?ltimo, se realiz? un an?lisis de congruencia entre los instrumentos que componen la bater?a y la escala. Los resultados mostraron correlaciones significativas moderadas y d?biles positivas entre los instrumentos de forma que indique la posibilidad de que ambos se utilizan de manera complementaria en la evaluaci?n cognitiva de los ni?os con discapacidades visual. Se concluye que los estudios llevados a cabo con el instrumento trajeron datos relevantes sobre la importancia de un instrumento espec?fico para evaluar la inteligencia de los ni?os con discapacidad visual y que los estudios con muestras m?s grandes pueden enriquecer y contribuir a la expansi?n del uso del instrumento construido...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{there is}} an {{independent}} component of MJO associated with <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is investigated using Xie-Arkin precipitation and NCEP reanalysis pentad data. The analysis tool employed here is the cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function (CSEOF) technique. As {{a result of the}} analysis, the evolution of the precipitation pattern for the Asian-Pacific domain is found to consist of annual cycle, an MJO component of which the interannual variation is almost the same as the Southern Oscillation (SO) and other MJO components which evolve independently of SO. The former MJO becomes stronger and attains maximum amplitude over the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific during the mature stage of ENSO due to an intensified zonal circulation change. Positive MJO anomalies passing through the Indian continent during summer are found to be important because they tend to strengthen the onset of Indian summer monsoon prior to an ENSO warm event. In the winter of <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> years, convective anomalies associated with MJO, in general, propagate further eastward in the equatorial Pacific.

Experienced around the world, climate events such as <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation can greatly influence {{the growth of a}} species. Previous studies have shown that species of fish can either thrive or dramatically decline during these shifts between warm and cool phases. Proper management of fisheries requires information regarding the interaction between a species and its environment. White seabass (Atractoscion nobilis) is a prominent commercial and recreational fishery species in Southern California. Largely attributed to overfishing, by 1982 the population had dramatically declined and both fisheries collapsed. Recent studies have shown signs that the native population is in recovery and may benefit from an <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> event through increased growth rates. I addressed the question, ???do environmental conditions cause variation in year-class strength in white seabass???? This study determined the population structure of white seabass over a 12 -year period (1997 - 2008) and revealed that year-class strength was the greatest in 1996 and 1997. Reports of commercial landings for the species have shown a steady increase following the strong 1997 <b>El</b> <b>Ni??o</b> event, suggesting a relationship between year-class strength and commercial landings on a ten-year lag.

40|$|This work {{attempts}} to reconcile {{in a common}} and comprehensive framework the various conflicting results {{found in the literature}} regarding Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) rainfall-Sea Surface Temperature (SST) relationships, especially the links with El-Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). To do so, we first examine the linear relationships between ISM rainfall and global SST anomalies during 1950 - 1976 and 1979 - 2006 periods. Our results highlight the existence of significant modulations in SST teleconnections and precursory patterns between the first (June-July, JJ) and second part (August-September, AS) of the monsoon. This JJ-AS rainfall dichotomy is more pronounced after the 1976 - 1977 climate regime shift and tends to blur the global ISM-ENSO signal during the recent period, leading to an apparent weakening of this relationship at the seasonal time scale. Although ISM rainfall in JJ and AS is still strongly linked to ENSO over both periods, the lead-lag relationships between ENSO and AS Indian rainfall have changed during recent decades. Indeed, ENSO variability in the preceding boreal winter has now a significant impact on rainfall variability {{during the second half of}} ISM. To evaluate in more details the impact of this JJ-AS dichotomy on the ISM-ENSO-IOD relationships, ISM correlations are also examined separately during <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> and La Nia years. Results indicate that the early onset of <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> during boreal spring causes deficient monsoon rainfall in JJ. In response to weaker monsoon winds, warm SST anomalies appear in the west equatorial IO, generating favorable conditions for the development of a positive IOD in AS. Local air-sea processes triggered by the SST anomalies in the eastern node of IOD seem, in turn, to have a more active role on AS rainfall variability, as they may counteract the negative effect of <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> on ISM rainfall via a modulation of the local Hadley circulation in the eastern IO. The JJ-AS rainfall dichotomy and its recent amplification may then result from an enhancement of these IO feedbacks during recent <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> years. This explains why, although <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events are stronger, a weakening of the ISM-ENSO relationship is observed at the seasonal scale after 1979. Results during La Nia years are consistent with this hypothesis although local processes in the southeast IO now play a more prominent role and act to further modulate ISM rainfall in AS. Finally, our results highlight the existence of a biennal rhythm of the IOD-ENSO-ISM system during the recent period, according to which co-occurring <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> and positive IOD events tend to be followed by a warming of the IO, a wet ISM during summer and, finally, a La Nia event during the following boreal winter...|$|E

The evolutions of short decaying <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o</b> and La Ni?a are approximately a mirror image with a rapid decline in the following summer for the warm and cold events. However, a robust asymmetry was found in long decaying cases, with a prolonged and re-intensified La Ni?a in the following winter. The asymmetry for long decaying cases starts from the westward extension of the zonal wind anomalies in a mature winter, and is further contributed to by the air-sea interaction over the tropical Pacific in the following seasons...|$|E
40|$|The impacts and {{cooperative}} effects of volcanic eruptions and ENSO (El Nio/Southern Oscillation) are analyzed in a millennium simulation for 800 - 2005 AD using the earth system model (ESM) ECHAM 5 /MPIOM/JSBACH subject to anthropogenic and natural forcings. The simulation comprises two ensembles, a first with weak (E 1, five members) {{and a second}} with strong (E 2, three members) variability total solar irradiance. In the analysis, the 21 most intense eruptions are selected in each ensemble member. Volcanoes with neutral ENSO states during two preceding winters cause a global cooling in the year after eruptions up to - 2. 5 A degrees C. The nonsignificant positive values in the tropical Pacific Ocean indicate an El Nio-like warming. In the winter after an eruption, warming is mainly found in the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Sea in E 2 warming extends to Siberia and central Asia. The recovery times for the volcano-induced cooling (average for 31 eruptions) vary globally between 1 and 12 years. There is no significant increase of <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events after volcanic eruptions in both ensembles. The simulated temperature and the drought indices are compared with corresponding reconstructions in East Asia. Volcanoes cause a dramatic cooling in west China (- 2 A degrees C) and a drought in East China during {{the year after the}} eruption. The reconstructions show similar cooling patterns with smaller magnitudes and confirm the dryness in East China. Without volcanoes, <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events reduce summer precipitation in the North, while South China becomes wetter; La Nia events cause opposite effects. <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events in the winters after eruptions compensate the cooling caused by volcanoes in most regions of China (consistent with reconstructions), while La Nia events intensify the cooling (up to - 2. 5 A degrees C). The simulated and reconstructed drought indices show tripole patterns which are altered by <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events. The simulated impact of the Tambora eruption in 1815, which caused the "year without summer" of 1816 in Europe and North America and led to coldness and famines in the Chinese province Yunnan, depends crucially on the ENSO state of the coupled model. A comparison with reconstructed <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events shows a moderate cool climate with wet (in the south) and extreme dry anomalies (in the north) persisting for several years...|$|E
40|$|The {{modulation}} {{of tropical}} cyclogenesis over the southern South China Sea (SSCS) by the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is examined in October-December (OND), when tropical cyclone (TC) activities are most active in this region. The results reveal {{that there were}} more TCs formed over the SSCS during La Nia years and less TCs during <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> years. How different environmental factors (including low-level vorticity, mid-level relative humidity, vertical wind shear, and potential intensity) contribute to this influence is investigated, using a genesis potential (GP) index developed by Emanuel and Nolan. Composite anomalies of the GP index are produced for <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> and La Nia years separately, which could account for the changes of TC frequency over the SSCS in different ENSO phases. The degree of contribution by each factor is determined quantitatively by producing composites of modified indices in which only one of the contributing factors varies, with the others set to climatology. The results show that the mid-level relative humidity makes the largest contribution to the ENSO modulation of tropical cyclogenesis over the SSCS. Although warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and larger amount of evaporation from the ocean surface were observed over the SSCS during <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> years, anomalous descending motions due to the anomalous Walker circulations inhibited the upward transports of water vapor and led to less moisture contents in the middle troposphere, which suppressed TC formations...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of simulations of the interannual variability of tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific (WNP) and {{its association with}} El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), {{as well as a}} subsequent diagnosis for possible causes of model biases generated from simulated large-scale climate conditions, are documented in the paper. The model experiments are carried out by the Hurricane Work Group under the U. S. Climate Variability and Predictability Research Program (CLIVAR) using five global climate models (GCMs) with a total of 16 ensemble members forced by the observed sea surface temperature and spanning the 28 -yr period from 1982 to 2009. The results show GISS and GFDL model ensemble means best simulate the interannual variability of TCs, and the multimodel ensemble mean (MME) follows. Also, the MME has the closest climate mean annual number of WNP TCs and the smallest root-mean-square error to the observation. Most GCMs can simulate the interannual variability of WNP TCs well, with stronger TC activities during two types of El Nio-namely, eastern Pacific (EP) and central Pacific (CP) El Nio-and weaker activity during La Nia. However, none of the models capture the differences in TC activity between EP and CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> as are shown in observations. The inability of models to distinguish the differences in TC activities between the two types of <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events {{may be due to the}} bias of the models in response to the shift of tropical heating associated with CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio...</b>|$|E

The model domain covers the coast of South America to 96 ?W, including the Galapagos Islands, and from 15 ?S to 15 ?N. An experiment based on a run from January 1990 to December 1999 is conducted using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version sparse input. 2 (SODAsi. 2) 5 day data sets for the initial and boundary conditions. For surface forcing the 20 CRV 2 (20 th Century Reanalysis version 2) daily data set is used. The model results are compared with observations from a buoy {{that is part of}} the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) project located at 95 ?W and over the equator, the model captures the main features of annual and interannual variability, although there are some notable discrepancies. At the surface we can identify the most important features of the domain of study that are the equatorial cold tongue, the Costa Rica Dome and the east Pacific warm pool. In the subsurface the thermal distribution agrees with the typical behavior of the east Pacific Ocean such as strong stratification and a shallow thermocline. The results show strong anomalies of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH) during <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o.</b> Changes in conditions at the surface and subsurface demonstrate the strength of the 97 - 98 <b>El</b> <b>Ni?o</b> event, especially when compared with the weaker 1991 - 92 event.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the results of {{modeling}} of <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events using a simple model of a classical oscillator with decay under external forcing. The sea surface temperature in the East Pacific and the mean thermocline depth in the Equatorial Pacific correspond to {{the roles of the}} momentum and position, respectively. The external forcing of the system is determined by two factors: the short-period meridional mass fluctuations in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean due to the joint effect of the atmospheric variability over the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, bottom topography, and coastlines; and the variability of western winds in the tropics. Under such conditions, oscillations of <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> type arise in the model as a result of propagation of signals generated in the Southern Ocean (due to the fluctuations of meridional transport fluxes and the variability of western winds in the tropics). These signals propagate over the Equatorial Pacific as fast wave processes.

40|$|The {{observed}} winter (DJF) precipitation in Southeast China (1961 - 2010) {{is characterized}} by a monopole pattern of the 3 -monthly Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI- 3) whose interannual variability is related to the anomalies of East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) systems. Dynamic composites and linear regression analysis indicate that the intensity of EAWM and Siberia High (SH), the position of East Asian Trough (EAT), and <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over South China Sea (SCS) influence different regions of anomalous Southeast China winter precipitation on interannual scales. The circulation indices (EAWM index, SH index, and EAT index) mainly affect the winter precipitation {{in the eastern part of}} Southeast China. <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> events affect the South China winter precipitation due to the anticyclone anomalies over Philippines. The effect of SCS SST anomalies on the winter precipitation is mainly in the southern part of Yangtze River. Thus, a set of circulation regimes, represented by a handful indices, provide the basis for modeling precipitation anomalies or extremes in future climate projections...|$|E

One is the cold tongue <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> or Eastern Pacific <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> (EP <b>El</b> <b>Nio),</b> which is characterized by relatively large sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the eastern Pacific, and the other is the warm pool <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> (a. k. a. 'Central Pacific El Nio' (CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio)</b> or 'El Nio Modoki'), in which SST anomalies are confined to the central Pacific. Here the vertical structure variability of the periods during EP and CP is investigated based on the GFDL_CM 2. 1 model in order to explain the difference in equatorial wave dynamics and associated negative feedback mechanisms. It is shown that the mean stratification {{in the vicinity of the}} thermocline of the central Pacific is reduced during CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio,</b> which favours the contribution of the gravest baroclinic mode relatively to the higher-order slower baroclinic mode. Energetic Kelvin and first-meridional Rossby wave are evidenced during the CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> with distinctive amplitude and propagating characteristics according to their vertical structure (mostly first and second baroclinic modes). In particular, the first baroclinic mode during CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> is associated to the ocean basin mode and participates to the recharge process during the whole <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> cycle, whereas the second baroclinic mode is mostly driving the discharge process through the delayed oscillator mechanism. This may explain that the phase transition from warm to neutral/cold conditions during the CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> is delayed and/or disrupted compared to the EP <b>El</b> <b>Nio.</b> Our results have implications for the interpretation of the variability during periods of high CP <b>El</b> <b>Nio</b> occurrence like the last decade...|$|E
