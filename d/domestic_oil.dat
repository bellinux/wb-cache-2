25|$|In addition, the US oil {{marketing}} hub at Cushing {{was flooded}} with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to {{take it from there}} to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing, which is the main benchmark for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as Brent Crude and Dubai Crude. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media as the price of oil, this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being lower than they were, and the supply being better than it was internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the US in that offshore oil was cheaper than <b>domestic</b> <b>oil,</b> so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper <b>domestic</b> <b>oil</b> sands production from Alberta to the east coast.|$|E

As tank production and Allied supplies made up for the losses of 1941, the cavalry was merged with tank units, forming more effective strike groups. From 1943–1944, cavalry gradually became the mobile infantry component of the tank armies. By the end of the war, Soviet cavalry was reduced to its pre-war strength.

The constants of evaporation of pure products were determined {{as well as the}} influence of the proportion of DFO fraction on the mechanisms of vaporization process of cottonseed oil in the temperature range of 578 Ke 917 K under atmospheric pressure. The results show that the DFO evaporates completely in the range of temperatures considered in contrast to vegetable oils that vaporize completely only for temperatures higher than or equal to 773 K. Above 873 K, the behaviour of vegetable oils becomes similar to a single component product and the d 2 law is respected. At a given temperatures range, constants of evaporation of the three vegetable oils are of the same order of magnitude. The results also show that blends of cottonseed oil and DFO vaporize following a sequential distillation mechanism: DFO is evaporating first, followed by a transient phase, and then cottonseed oil vaporizes following the same trends than observed for pure vegetable oils. For low percentages of cottonseed oil (_ 40 %) in the mixture, formation of bubbles can be observed {{at the end of the}} process at 684 K. When the concentration of vegetable oil in the droplet increases, the mechanism of pure diffusion becomes predominant. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
