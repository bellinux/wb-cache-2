25|$|However, if no {{possible}} arrangement of ground conditions {{leads to the}} port conditions, the circuit might not behave the same way. The improvement factors (1 + βFB AOL) for determining input and output impedance might not work. This situation is awkward, because a failure to make a two-port may reflect a real problem (it just is not possible), or reflect a lack of imagination (for example, <b>just</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> think of splitting the emitter node in two). As a consequence, when the port conditions are in doubt, at least two approaches are possible to establish whether improvement factors are accurate: either simulate an example using Spice and compare results with use of an improvement factor, or calculate the impedance using a test source and compare results.|$|E
25|$|When the Old Scots Navy {{merged with}} Royal Navy {{there was some}} dispute over the {{seniority}} of the Scottish captains. It was finally agreed that their time would count from when they received their commissions as captains from Queen Anne. This meant that four years at sea did not count and the dispute continued for some time. The Scottish vessels were renamed Edinburgh and Glasgow since the Royal Navy already had vessels named Royal William and Royal Mary. Ships under these names still operate in the Royal Navy today. A third Royal Scots Navy ship was allowed to retain her name of Dumbarton Castle. Their absorption into the English navy was unpopular with many Scots seamen. One hundred of Gordon's men mutinied at Leith having got it into their heads {{that they would be}} sent to the West Indies or elsewhere outside of home waters.

500|$|Even with statehood, {{there was}} still slavery in Indiana. [...] Despite slavery and indentures {{becoming}} illegal in 1816 due to the state constitution, the 1820 federal census listed 190 slaves in Indiana. [...] Many Hoosier slaveholders felt that the 1816 constitution did not cover preexisting slavery; others <b>just</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> care if it was illegal. [...] In eastern Indiana nearly all slaveholders immediately freed their slaves. [...] But the majority of slaveholders in western counties, especially in Knox, decided to keep their slaves. [...] The Vincennes newspaper Western Sun had numerous times advertised [...] "indentured Negroes and other slaves", {{a sign of the}} approval of slavery in the area. [...] "In Knox County, virtually all of the (slave) suits were denied by the County Court in 1817 and 1818." [...] A black woman known as Polly was held slave by French trader Hyacinthe Lasselle of Vincennes. [...] Polly sued in 1820 for her freedom, but was denied in the Knox County Court. [...] She appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court, who ruled in her favor that she should be free. [...] But even after this decision, there was slavery in Indiana. [...] The federal census of 1830 still showed three slaves in Indiana: one each in Orange County, Decatur County, and Warrick County. A separate local census in Knox County in 1830 showed the presence of 32 slaves.

Duff McKagan added that they can neither [...] "confirm or deny" [...] Taylor's membership in the band but believes that Taylor is the [...] "real deal". Slash has since ruled Corey out as the possible new vocalist explaining that [...] " [...] just wasn't right" [...] although he does love him.
