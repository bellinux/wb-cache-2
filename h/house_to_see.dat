5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Marge.|$|E

25|$|Reprieve, a London-based {{human rights}} group, {{said it had}} talked to two sources from the raided village, {{who said that the}} raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year-old {{partially}} blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who had come out of his <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what was going on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were “still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, but {{what we do know is}} that Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.” A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated.|$|E

500|$|Fred Dibnah, Steeplejack won the 1979 BAFTA {{award for}} best documentary, {{and over the years}} Haworth {{returned}} to film more documentaries. With his newly found fame, however, came distractions from his work. Visitors would arrive at his <b>house,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his garden. He began to receive fan mail; one individual wrote to offer Dibnah a steam-powered machine he no longer wanted. One company, who were apparently disturbed to see Dibnah's matches being extinguished by the wind while {{at the top of a}} chimney, sent him a sample of their windproof matches. Filming would also interfere with his work. Cameraman Martin Lightening would climb with [...] Dibnah to the top of a chimney—with a 16mm film camera—and film him at work, often hundreds of feet above the ground.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Smith and Dupont arrived at Government <b>House</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Gibbs, Whitehall had {{instructed}} the Governor to formally dismiss Smith and his ministers for treason. Gibbs complied without hesitation. Smith and his ministers ignored this, holding {{that under the}} new 1965 constitution Gibbs [...] "no longer ha any executive powers in Rhodesia", and his reserve power to sack them no longer existed. The Rhodesian government hoped that Gibbs might obligingly resign {{in light of his}} impotent situation, but he did not; following orders from London, he remained at his post at Government House. Gibbs told the Rhodesian military's senior officers, some of whom were troubled by the perceived choice between Queen and country, to remain at their posts to maintain law and order. Wilson briefly flirted with the idea of sending Lord Mountbatten to Rhodesia to support Gibbs as a direct representative of the Queen, but this was dropped after Gibbs asked for somebody [...] "higher up" [...] in the royal family instead. [...] "Not likely", Wilson retorted.|$|E
500|$|Adam Williams is {{a serial}} womaniser who lives a {{carefree}} lifestyle until he settles down with Rachel—though {{he is still}} tempted by the next-door neighbour and women in fast cars. Bullen based Adam's womanising personality on how he saw himself during his twenties. He is diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer during the second series, a storyline developed by Bullen to directly contrast Adam's Lothario characterisation. Adam marries Rachel in Series 3 and their son, Matthew, is born in Series 4. In Series 5, Adam's estranged father Bill Williams arrives in Manchester. Adam moves to patch up the relationship after Bill comes out as a bisexual. After Rachel's death, Adam and Matthew leave their old <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Bill. Adam's backstory was inconsistent; the first series established that Adam and Pete {{had known each other}} since their childhood when they attended the same school in Manchester. To justify Adam's accent, his Northern Irish origins were developed in Series 3 and it was explained on screen that he spent his school holidays there. His background is reinforced when his father is introduced in Series 5. Bullen admitted that Adam's biography was never fully planned but conceded that Cold Feet was [...] "full of gaffes".|$|E

500|$|Needing {{money to}} pay for a repair after Bart damages the gas line, the Simpson family visits [...] "Cockamamie's", an offbeat {{collectibles}} shop, hoping that it will purchase one of the family's heirlooms (an [...] "authentic" [...] American Civil War doll which {{turns out to be a}} decorative liquor bottle). Homer meets John, the antiques dealer, who explains that much of the merchandise is there because of its camp value. Bart and Lisa take an instant liking to John, and Homer invites him to the Simpsons' <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the campy items that the family owns. The next morning, Homer tells Marge that he likes John and suggests they invite him and [...] "his wife" [...] over for a drink some time. Marge tries to hint repeatedly to an oblivious Homer that John is gay, and when she eventually can't, she tells him face to face and Homer is horrified. Homer's attitude towards John changes completely, and he turns against him, refusing to join his tour of Springfield. The rest of the family joins John and has a good time, but Homer is upset with the family upon their return. The rest of the Simpson family continue to enjoy John's company, especially Bart, who starts wearing Hawaiian shirts and dancing in a woman's wig. This makes Homer uneasy, and he begins to fear Bart is gay.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a girl (a young Underwood) {{studying}} at home. Her abusive father arrives and asks her if she needs help. She declines his offer and starts gathering her things to leave the room, however; as she stands up, he grabs her arm. She manages to pull away and leave. Underwood stated that this scene had no script. She and the actor acted it out the way they thought it might have happened. Underwood revealed that she left the filming location with bruises on her arm- [...] "I had finger marks on my arm when I left {{at the end of}} the day, so I was like, 'Wow.' ... It was intense. I wasn't just imagining it, it was really intense." [...] As the video continues, the girl is seen standing in the middle of a cemetery, walking around and staring at the clouds as a thunderstorm forms in the sky. She runs back to her house through an old, destroyed yellow-brick road, similar to the one of Wizard of Oz. She enters the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her father sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of alcohol. She sits next to him, recalling the times he let his drunkenness and anger get out of hand. She tries to wake him up but fails. She realizes that he has passed out. She looks through the window and notices the thunderstorm getting worse, so she leaves her father and runs to the cellar alone to protect herself. She's seen lying in an old bed and crying, as she hears the tornado coming closer, with her father still passed out. The next day, there are no traces of the house, and she calmly walks away.|$|E

The King and the Duke of York were at the play. But so great performance of a comical part was never, I believe, in the world before as Nell do this, both as a mad girl, then most {{and best of all}} when she comes in like a young gallant; and hath the notions and carriage of a spark the most that ever I saw any man have.

2500|$|The {{prospective}} partners either date {{each other}} or in stricter communities {{they go to a}} [...] "bashow" [...] or sit in. A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just want to see if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people. The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many bashows while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} alley is the Callejón del Beso. Located {{on the slopes}} of the Cerro del Gallo hill in a {{neighbourhood}} that dates back to the 18th century, it is only [...] wide in places with balconies that nearly touch each other. Folklore states that couples who kiss on the third step (painted in red) are guaranteed seven years of happiness together. The name, which means Alley of the Kiss, comes from a legend of two young lovers who come to a tragic end: Doña Carmen and Don Luis. Doña Carmen’s father forbade the courting of his daughter by the young Luis, threatening to send Carmen to a convent if she left the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. Carmen’s balcony reached over this alley and nearly touched the balcony of the neighboring house. Luis found out who owned it and arranged access. One evening, while the two were on these balconies, Carmen’s father discovered them as Luis held Carmen’s hand between his own. Enraged, Carmen’s father stabbed her, leaving the shocked Luis holding the hand of his beloved as it grew cold and lifeless, giving it one final kiss.|$|E
2500|$|In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, {{he takes}} refuge in his ancient family home at 12, Grimmauld Place, which he allows {{to be used}} as the Order of the Phoenix headquarters. His {{confinement}} (on Dumbledore's orders) causes depression, and he is frequently withdrawn and antagonistic. He hates the House-Elf Kreacher, who for him represents the house he hated. Kreacher meanwhile resents Sirius for his rejection of the Black Family. When Sirius briefly leaves the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Harry off to Hogwarts, his Animagus form is recognised by Draco and Lucius Malfoy, resulting in more threats and warnings. Sirius acts as an older brother figure to Harry throughout the book but, according to Rowling, [...] "what Harry craves is a father". Sirius encourages Harry to oppose Dolores Umbridge and her reforms, and strongly approves of Harry starting the secret defensive tutorial group for students, Dumbledore's Army. He demonstrates a high level of trust in and respect for Harry, willingly answering his questions about the Order and Voldemort. With his growing power, Voldemort implants a false vision into Harry's mind that Sirius is captive and under torture at the Department of Mysteries. Determined to rescue Sirius, Harry and his friends gain access to the Department of Mysteries, but are ambushed by Death Eaters. Snape, however, alerts the Order that the students have gone to the Ministry after confirming that Sirius is safe at Grimmauld Place. Several Order members arrive at the Ministry, Sirius among them, and battle the Death Eaters. During a frenzied duel with his hated cousin Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius taunts her for failing to harm him. Bellatrix strikes Sirius with a curse, sending him backwards into an enchanted archway in the Death Chamber, killing him. [...] Harry finds it hard to recover from this event. Sirius's will stated that his possessions, home and house-elf Kreacher are to be inherited by Harry.|$|E
