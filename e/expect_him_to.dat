5|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, where he {{received}} marginal care. He had lost , was in a chest cast, and his gray hair had turned as white as snow. McCain {{was sent to a}} different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi. In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans who did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> live more than a week. In March 1968, McCain was placed into solitary confinement, where he would remain for two years.|$|E

25|$|Chairman Chris Grant added: “To {{beat the}} {{attention}} of opposition counties to the signature of a standout overseas player in Rana Naved is a massive coup for the club. “Rana {{has proved to be}} a charismatic character and an inspirational performer in Twenty20 cricket around the world, as well as boasting exceptional pedigree at one-day international level with Pakistan. “Not only do I <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> help us win matches, he is also a very entertaining player to watch.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, under Boras's supervision, {{high school}} {{prospect}} Landon Powell earned his GED following {{his junior year}} of high school and then filed the necessary paperwork to make him eligible for that year's draft. Powell went undrafted, since the major league teams did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be draft eligible, making him a free agent. Whether because of Powell's ability, his pricetag, or internal resentment within Major League Baseball about his successful end-run around the draft, Powell did not sign, instead enrolling at the University of South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|Australia was 151 {{for seven}} – {{and the man}} wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth to make him look like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E

In June 2010 he pushed a funding amendment which would require President Barack Obama to provide for a draw-down plan before any further funding would be authorized. [...] "Let us not waste, you know, more resources, more lives, on a policy that quite frankly {{is going to lead}} us nowhere," [...] said McGovern. [...] "We need to let Afghan President Hamid Karzai know that we're not a cheap date. We <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> clean up his government." ...|$|E
500|$|Professional teams coveted Gyorko for his hitting ability, {{though they}} did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play shortstop at the {{professional}} level. Though his throwing arm was viewed as strong enough {{to allow him to}} play at any position in the infield, analysts believed that Gyorko would not have sufficient range or speed to play shortstop professionally, and Gyorko understood he would likely change positions. Regarding his defense, Gyorko said [...] "where I play [...] isn't a big concern for me. I'm just ready for this chance to live a dream and it will all work out." ...|$|E
500|$|MacInnis {{left home}} in 1979 {{to join the}} Regina Pat Blues of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL). He {{appeared}} in 59games, scoring 20goals and 48points with the Pat Blues, and appeared in two Western Hockey League (WHL) games with the Regina Pats. He then moved to Ontario and joined the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Following a season in which he scored 39points in 47games and winning the league Championship with Kitchener in the 1980–81 OHL season, MacInnis was rated as the second best defensive prospect at the 1981 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected by the Calgary Flames in the first round, 15th overall. [...] The Flames invited him to their training camp, although they did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play for them immediately, and he was returned to junior.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{played on}} the Stafford Indians {{football}} team as a quarterback, running back, wide receiver, cornerback, kickoff returner, and punt returner. In Stafford's 2004 game against King George, Smith opened with a 54-yard kickoff return, played quarterback, and scored on a 63-yard punt return. His coach, Roger Pierce, said, [...] "Torrey can do those type of things for us. We <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do those things." [...] During his senior year in 2006, Smith had 155carries for 815yards and 12touchdowns, completed nine of 25passes for 230yards and twotouchdowns, and made three receptions for 81yards. Over {{the course of his}} interscholastic career, Smith returned six kickoffs for touchdowns. He earned all-state kick returner honors as a sophomore, all-district honors as a junior, and honorable mention All-Northwest Region quarterback honors, all-district, and all-area honors as a senior.|$|E
500|$|Jon Povill wrote {{up a list}} of {{possible}} directors for the project, which included Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Lucas and Robert Wise, but all were busy at the time or unwilling to work with a $7.5 million budget. Although his agent did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do it, Philip Kaufman signed on to direct. Roddenberry introduced him to the series by showing him ten episodes, including those he felt were the most representative and popular of the series: [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever", [...] "The Devil in the Dark", [...] "Amok Time", [...] "Journey to Babel", [...] "", [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles", [...] "", [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", [...] "" [...] and [...] "". On signing, Kaufman was pleased to direct Star Trek. He discussed it with Lucas, and said that he [...] "felt he could go through the roof". NASA employee Jesco von Puttkamer was hired as an advisor on the film.|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night. Hall, who was having personal worship time during the drive, recounts that he wondered [...] "Who am I to think I can just call up to God whenever I want, from the middle of nowhere, and <b>expect</b> <b>Him</b> <b>to</b> hear me?" [...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is gone in a day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand that my life is a vapor, and me being able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me". [...] "Who Am I" [...] was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman. It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, William Houston of The Globe and Mail wrote, [...] "The best of {{the group}} is Soviet star winger Pavel Bure, a {{spectacular}} player with outstanding speed. He is compared to Vladimir Krutov and also the late Soviet superstar of the 1970s, Valeri Kharlamov." [...] NHL organizations were afraid he would not leave the Soviet Union {{to play in the}} NHL thus deterring teams from selecting him early, although scouts and analysts believed he could have been selected as high as the second round had he defected. Many analysts compared him to Valeri Khalarmov. Edmonton Oilers' scout Barry Fraser commented, [...] "From what I've seen of him, Bure can play on any team in the NHL right now... he's quick, real quick, small and very exciting. He may be the top player in this year's draft, but because he is from the Soviet Union, we don't analyze him the same way as a kid from the West... I don't <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go really early because it is still too much of a gamble to hope he will defect." ...|$|E
500|$|West regains his lyrical dexterity on [...] "Barry Bonds", a competitive, though {{friendly}} {{battle with}} Lil Wayne {{in which the}} two MCs exchange braggadocios rhymes. The song uses Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds as a metaphor for West's ability to create music hits. [...] "Drunk and Hot Girls" [...] is a first-person narrative that illustrates a man courting an attractive intoxicated woman in a club but gets more than what he bargained for. [...] "Everything I Am" [...] is a song of self-examination, in which West attempts to confront his fallacies by surveying the consequences of his outspokeness ruminating over various ways people <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> conduct himself. In the track, West addresses his indifference towards constructing a gangster persona, his refusal to dress and act like every other rapper, his inclination towards social commentary, and his lack of self-restraint. West comes to the conclusion that while he {{will never be able to}} live up to people's expectations and will always be disadvantageously flawed; it's all these imperfections and more that serve to make up who he is. When writing the song, West thought of a young girl in high school dealing with people coming down on her.|$|E
500|$|His captors <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{die in the}} camp, but to Ai's great surprise, Estraven—whom Ai still distrusts—goes {{to great}} lengths to save him. Estraven poses as a prison guard and breaks Ai out of the farm, using his {{training}} with the Handarrata to induce dothe, or berserker strength to aid him in the process. Estraven spends the last of his money on supplies, and then steals more, breaking his own moral code which would forbid stealing. [...] The pair begin an 80-day trek across the Gobrin ice sheet back to Karhide, because Estraven believes that the very appearance of Ai in Karhide will force its acceptance of the Ekumen treaty. Over the journey Ai and Estraven learn to trust and accept one another's differences. Ai is eventually successful in teaching Estraven mindspeech; Estraven hears Ai speaking in his mind with the voice of his dead sibling Arek, demonstrating the close connection that the two have developed. When they reach Karhide, Estraven tries to return to the land border with Orgoreyn, because he is still exiled from Karhide, but is killed by border guards, who capture Ai. Estraven's prediction is borne out when Ai's presence in Karhide, along with the fallout from Estraven's death, triggers the collapse of governments in both Karhide and Orgoreyn. Soon after, Karhide agrees to join the Ekumen, followed shortly by Orgoreyn, completing Ai's mission.|$|E
