5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E

500|$|... "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the classic episodes of South Park. Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News described Mr. Hankey himself as [...] "the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show". Charlie Patton of The Florida Times-Union said the episode was [...] "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive—also extremely funny". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, [...] "If you're {{the sort of person who}} didn't care for that scene in Trainspotting where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said, [...] "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, or <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> some serious psychological problems?" [...] Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode, [...] "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year." [...] Werts particularly praised the song [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of Taking South Park Seriously, said, [...] "This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one." [...] Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial.|$|E
500|$|From a gate inside Clock Tower, Link and Tatl enter Clock Town {{while its}} {{population}} prepares for the town's annual Carnival of Time also {{scheduled to take}} place in three days. Together they learn that the Skull Kid is waiting {{at the top of the}} tower, which is only accessible during the eve of the carnival. After conditions are met, Link and Tatl arrive at the top of the Clock Tower to witness Tael hurriedly speak a riddle to them: [...] "Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon... hurry, the four who are there... bring them here!" [...] Link is unable to fight the Skull Kid, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> any means to take the mask from him, but manages to get the Ocarina of Time back from his hands. After playing the [...] "Song of Time" [...] on the ocarina, Link and Tatl are brought backwards through time three days earlier — with the ocarina still in his possession and with both him and Tatl having complete memory of all that happened. Meeting with the Happy Mask Salesman again, he sees that Link has retrieved his ocarina, and hence teaches him the [...] "Song of Healing", which breaks the curse, returns Link to his human form and seals his Deku Scrub form into a mask which has the power to turn him back into a Deku Scrub if needed. After he finds out Link did not bring back the mask, he panics and explains that the mask conceals an evil, apocalyptic power that was once used by an ancient tribe in hexing rituals. The troubles caused by the mask were so great, that the ancient ones [...] "sealed the mask in shadow forever" [...] to prevent it from being misused. Link must then travel between the four cardinal regions of Termina: Woodfall, Snowhead, the Great Bay, and Ikana Canyon, for each region conceals one of the Four Giants who will be able, once reunited, to halt the moon's crashing. At the same time, each region has been struck with a terrible curse by the Skull Kid which plagues its inhabitants and seals away its giant. To lift the curse and free the giants, Link must enter a dungeon in each region and defeat its boss, after doing so, obtaining the power to summon the giant he has set free. To accomplish this, he uses the [...] "Song of Healing" [...] to create a mask that can turn him into a Goron from the spirit of a deceased Goron hero, and a mask that can turn him into a Zora from the spirit of a brave deceased Zora.|$|E

Patti LuPone starred as Eva, with Mandy Patinkin as Che, Bob Gunton as Perón, Mark Syers as Magaldi, and Jane Ohringer as Perón's mistress. Harold Prince directed with choreography by Larry Fuller. [...] During the run, six actresses alternated playing the title role, in addition to LuPone: Terri Klausner (matinees), Nancy Opel (matinees), Pamela Blake (matinees), Derin Altay, Loni Ackerman and Florence Lacey. [...] Patinkin was replaced by future Tony Award winner Anthony Crivello. New York Times critic Frank Rich stated: [...] "Loni Ackerman, the current Eva Perón, has no discernible Latin blood, but she sings the role {{better than any of}} the American Evitas, as well as acting and dancing it with nonstop energy. Anthony Crivello, a performer new to me, is easily the best Che I've seen in New York or London: not only <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> a supple voice, but he also moves with such grace that he lightens the heavy, moralizing tone his character must bear. He's so effective, in fact, that he almost convinces you that there's a sound reason for Che Guevara to be dragged into the Peron saga." [...] Tom Carter understudied Patinkin and performed as Che.|$|E
