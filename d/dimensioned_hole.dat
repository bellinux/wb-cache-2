40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{accomplish}} two goals: We construct a two dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), {{in the form}} of a Liouville theory, in the near horizon limit for three and four <b>dimensions</b> black <b>holes.</b> The near horizon CFT assumes the two dimensional black hole solutions that were first introduced by Christensen and Fulling (1977 Phys. Rev. D 15 2088 - 104) and later expanded to a greater class of black holes via Robinson and Wilczek (2005 Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 011303). The two <b>dimensions</b> black <b>holes</b> admit a Diff(S^ 1) or Witt subalgebra, which upon quantization in the horizon limit becomes Virasoro with calculable central charge. These charges and lowest Virasoro eigen-modes reproduce the correct Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the four and three <b>dimensions</b> black <b>holes</b> via the Cardy formula (Bl 2 ̆ 2 ote et al 1986 Phys. Rev. Lett. 56 742; Cardy 1986 Nucl. Phys. B 270 186). Furthermore, the two dimensions CFT 2 ̆ 7 s energy momentum tensor is anomalous, i. e. its trace is nonzero. However, In the horizon limit the energy momentum tensor becomes holomorphic equaling the Hawking flux of the four and three <b>dimensions</b> black <b>holes.</b> This encoding of both entropy and temperature provides a uniformity in the calculation of black hole thermodynamics and statistical quantities for the non local effective action approach. We also show that the near horizon regime of a Kerr-Newman-AdS (KNAdS) black hole, given by its two dimensional analogue a la Robinson and Wilczek, is asymptotically AdS_ 2 and dual to a one dimensional quantum conformal field theory (CFT). The s-wave contribution of the resulting CFT 2 ̆ 7 s energy-momentum-tensor together with the asymptotic symmetries, generate a centrally extended Virasoro algebra, whose central charge reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy via Cardy 2 ̆ 7 s Formula. Our derived central charge also agrees with the near extremal Kerr/CFT Correspondence in the appropriate limits. We also compute the Hawking temperature of the KNAdS black hole by coupling its Robinson and Wilczek two dimensional analogue (RW 2 DA) to conformal matter...|$|R

The physical properties such as the phase transition behavior, surface tension, density, viscosity, and conductivity of these ILs were also investigated. Temperature-dependent viscocity and conductivity of the ILs followed the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher equation, and the best-fit parameters had been estimated, together with the lienar fitting parameters for the density.

The results showed that the scour profiles at any bed slope follow shape similarity. However, the longitude evolution of scour profiles and the volume of eroded materials were increasing in accordance with slope of basin. A polynomial equation was derived to define the non-dimensional profiles under different slopes. The time evolution of scour <b>hole</b> <b>dimensions</b> and the equilibrium state were defined. It was found that under a specific condition of sediment grain size, approaching Froude number, the length and slope of adverse basin, the scour depth at the downstream of adverse basin, initially increases with tailwater depth, and after reaching its maximum value decreases to a constant value. It was also observed that the maximum depth of scour hole was decreased as the length and slope of stilling basin increased, whereas the longitudinal <b>dimensions</b> of the <b>hole</b> were increased.
