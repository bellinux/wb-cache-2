50|$|The Olympic Dam mine near Roxby Downs in {{northern}} South Australia {{is the largest}} <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> in the world, possessing {{more than a third}} of the world's low-cost recoverable reserves and 70% of Australia's. The mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton, presently accounts for 9% of global uranium production. The Olympic Dam mine is also the world's fourth-largest remaining copper deposit, and the world's fifth largest gold deposit. There was a proposal to vastly expand the operations of the mine, making it the largest open-cut mine in the world, but in 2012 the BHP Billiton board decided not to go ahead with it at that time due to then lower commodity prices.|$|E
50|$|The {{established}} {{nuclear industry}} in South Australia {{is focused on}} uranium mining, milling and the export of uranium oxide concentrate {{for use in the}} production of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants. The state is home to the world's largest known single <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> <b>uranium,</b> which is worked by BHP Billiton at the Olympic Dam mine. Contaminated legacy sites exist at Maralinga and Emu Field, where nuclear weapons tests were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s and at former uranium mines and milling sites. Nuclear waste is stored by CSIRO at Woomera and prospective future waste storage sites were earmarked during the deliberations of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission in 2016. The Commission has recommended that South Australia considers opportunities in nuclear waste storage (including developing a repository for spent nuclear fuel), the establishment of a nuclear fuel leasing scheme and the repeal of prohibitions which currently prevent future nuclear industrial development nationally.|$|E

40|$|Toxic metal {{contamination}} of the environment is a global issue. In this paper, we present a low-cost and rapid production of amalgam electrodes used for determination of Cd(II) and Pb(II) in environmental samples (soils and wastewaters) by on-site analysis using difference pulse voltammetry. Changes in the electrochemical signals were recorded with a miniaturized potentiostat (width: 80 mm, depth: 54 mm, height: 23 mm) and a portable computer. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated for the geometric surface of the working electrode 15 mm 2 that can be varied as required for analysis. The LODs were 80 ng·mL− 1 for Cd(II) and 50 ng·mL− 1 for Pb(II), relative standard deviation, RSD ≤ 8 % (n = 3). The area of interest (Dolni Rozinka, Czech Republic) was selected because there is a <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> ore and extreme anthropogenic activity. Environmental samples were taken directly on-site and immediately analysed. Duration of a single analysis was approximately two minutes. The average concentrations of Cd(II) and Pb(II) in this area were below the global average. The obtained values were verified (correlated) by standard electrochemical methods based on hanging drop electrodes and were in good agreement. The advantages of this method are its cost and time effectivity (approximately two minutes per one sample) with direct analysis of turbid samples (soil leach) in a 2 M HNO 3 environment. This type of sample cannot be analyzed using the classical analytical methods without pretreatment...|$|E
40|$|Beginnings {{of uranium}} mining in the Czech Republic {{date back to}} 1945. At that time uranium mining {{developed}} rapidly {{and the demand for}} uranium ore rose. There were two new uranium deposits discovered near Rožná and Olší during the summer and autumn 1956, and in 1957 the excavation of R 1 shaft near Rožná started. Since 1958 uranium ore has been mined from this deposit, located in the district of Žďár nad Sázavou in the Vysočina region. Nowadays it is the last exploited underground <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> in the Czech Republic. The end marketable product from the extraction and dressing process is uranium concentrate (so called yellow cake) in the form of ammonium diuranate and a by-product from the disposal of excess water from the dressing plant is marketable sodium sulphate. However, mining operations at the Rožná locality have affected the environment, caused changes in the relief, water regime, draining, vegetation and fauna. Moreover, this activity affected health and quality of life of miners, their families and all residents in this locality. Operations by GEAM Dolní Rožínka (a branch of the state enterprise DIAMO) and the impact on the environment is monitored in accordance with Section 18 of Act No 17 / 1992 on the environment. Annually, since 1990 s, monitoring is conducted in accordance with documented monitoring programmes which are approved and their results discussed by the competent administrative authorities, professional supervisory bodies (the State Office for Nuclear Safety), and are available to the general public. Based on an evaluation of the results recorded to date in the regular monitoring of the environment, it was proved that the mining and processing of uranium ore in the Dolní Rožínka locality does not result into serious pollution or harm to the environment. Local inhabitants differ in their views. It can be caused by unsufficient information supply about mining and processing of uranium ore due to low interest or even concealing in the past. This publication should be used as a source of information for both general public and study purposes...|$|E
