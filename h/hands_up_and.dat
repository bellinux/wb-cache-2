25|$|Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, 200 warriors {{demonstrated}} {{their faith in}} divine protection when they marched on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9km north-west of New Plymouth. The redoubt, on the crown of a hill, was defended by 75 imperial soldiers and two Coehorn mortars. Atiawa Māori viewed {{the construction of the}} outpost on their land as a challenge and formed a war party of the best fighting men from west coast iwi. When they came under fire at close range, they shielded themselves from the fusillade only by holding their right <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> chanting. As many as a fifth of the Māori force were killed in the assault.|$|E
25|$|In Olai's account, {{the battle}} was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|E

The story of the Earps' actions in Tombstone were published at the time by newspapers nationwide. Shortly after the shooting of Curly Bill, the Tucson Star wrote on March 21, 1882, in an editorial about the O.K. Corral gunfight, that the Cowboys had been ordered to put their <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> after they complied, were shot by the Earps, stating, [...] "The whole series of killings cannot be classed other than cold blooded murder." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{key element}} of Shakur's defense was medical {{testimony}} meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{that she would have}} been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A neurologist testified that the median nerve in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger. Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralyzed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon (as described in Trooper Harper's testimony) [...] "would be anatomically impossible".|$|E
500|$|Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic put Dance Again... The Hits {{into the}} {{category}} of a greatest hits album that [...] "you get facial brickbat of moderate-to-raw disappointment at the discovery of how thin and forced the artist's discography really is". He wrote that having another artist featured on nine of the thirteen tracks [...] "gives the impression that as a product, having Jennifer Lopez alone is simply not enough". He further criticized the decision to include the Murder remixes of [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] and [...] "I'm Real" [...] over the original studio versions, stating that it was almost like [...] "Sony Music held their <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> admitted that the initial cuts that they published simply weren't up to scratch". Tan concluded that for a greatest hits album, the track listing is [...] "simply all over the place", with no indication that the record executives or Lopez [...] "looked around for a logical start" [...] or an [...] "easy access ramp to her seven-album canon".|$|E

[...] Each class has a separate wildcat, and students caught [...] "pulling out," [...] or using the wildcat of a higher class, are often forced to do pushups as punishment. [...] Freshmen raise their hands above their heads and yell [...] "AAAA". [...] Sophomores, symbolically pushing back on the seniors, chant [...] "A!" [...] five times, waving their <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{down in front of the}} torso with their index fingers extended and thumbs perpendicular. [...] Juniors yell [...] "A! A! A! Whoop!" [...] wrapping their left hand over their right fist, with both index fingers extended and pointing towards the ground, [...] "shooting the ground" [...] once for each [...] "A" [...] and holding the position on the [...] "whoop!" [...] As a symbol of their expert marksmanship, seniors yell a single [...] "A!" [...] and then [...] "Whoop!" [...] while interlocking their fingers with their index fingers extended and pointed into the air. [...] At the same time, the left foot is raised and tucked behind the right knee. [...] The fingers are interlocked rather than covering the right hand so that the Aggie Ring is visible.|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of his}} stage act, Lewis {{pounded the}} keys with his heel, kicked the piano bench aside and played standing, raking his <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the {{keyboard}} for dramatic effect, sat on the keyboard and even stood {{on top of the}} instrument. Lewis told the Pop Chronicles that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favorable response, he kept it in the act. His first TV appearance, in which he demonstrated some of these moves, was on The Steve Allen Show on July 28, 1957, where he played [...] "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On".|$|E

2500|$|Cortez motioned {{the fighters}} back {{together}} {{to resume the}} fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was {{not looking at the}} fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather. After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was [...] "blindsided" [...] by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that [...] "In the ring, you have to protect yourself at all times".|$|E
2500|$|Harrison {{spent two}} years {{on and off the}} {{practice}} squad for the Steelers, being released three times, and also was briefly on the active roster {{towards the end of the}} 2002 season, playing only special teams. [...] Teammate and fellow linebacker, James Farrior, later told NFL Network that Harrison was so green early on in his career that he would simply [...] "give up" [...] on plays on which he was struggling and even would ask the coaches not to play him when he was struggling. Farrior said, [...] "He was a knucklehead that didn't know the plays. We'd be in practice, in training camp, and he might not know what he was doing so he'd just stop and throw his <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> tell (the coaches) to get him out of there.

These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." [...] The other reported, [...] "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with his <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> one behind him, he'd come out with a grenade." ...|$|E
