5|$|Fei {{sets out}} to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy {{released}} from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move {{it away from the}} planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>began,</b> when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E

25|$|According to the strikers, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>began</b> {{because of}} the price of pork chop dinner in the factory's canteen. On July 8, one worker noticed that {{overnight}} it had been increased by 80% - from 10.20 zlotys, to 18.10 zlotys. The workers, who for a long time had been complaining about prices and quality of food, decided that they had had enough. Following the inspiration of Miroslaw Kaczan who switched off the machines, Section W-340 was first, but after a few hours, the whole factory stopped working. On the same days, following Świdnik's example, workers of Lublin's branch of the state Polmozbyt auto parts and repairs service joined the strike. A Stoppage Committee was created in Świdnik, headed by Zofia Bartkiewicz, which demanded economic concessions. The workers did not use the irritating word strike on purpose.|$|E

25|$|Chavacano or Chabacano is a Spanish-based creole {{language}} and known in linguistics as Philippine Creole Spanish. Chabacano is originally spoken by {{majority of the}} Caviteños that lived in Cavite City and Ternate after {{the arrival of the}} Spaniards three centuries ago. The various dialects of Chabacano were formed out of necessity like all languages, though scholars and laypersons disagree about exactly when and where <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>began.</b> The various language groups working at the Cavite naval base needed a way to communicate with each other, and to the soldiers who were barking the orders in less-than-genteel Spanish. It was from this situation that Cavite Chabacano began as a simplified form of Spanish – a pidgin language that later developed into a mixed, or creole language. The fact that the first Chabacanos learned their Spanish from the coarse language of soldiers is probably why they were called Chabacanos in the first place.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{while at}} Juilliard, Kilmer co-authored {{and starred in}} the play How <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Began,</b> which was {{performed}} at the Public Theater at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Kilmer turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film The Outsiders, as he had prior theatre commitments. In 1983 he appeared off Broadway in The Slab Boys with Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) {{came in the form}} of an episode of ABC Afterschool Special called One Too Many, which was an educational drama on drinking and driving; it also starred a young Michelle Pfeiffer. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitled My Edens After Burns, that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. The book of poems is difficult to obtain, and expensive; even second-hand copies fetch $300 and up.|$|E

25|$|The launch {{was delayed}} until February 1985 {{due to a}} delay in the chat show Wogan, {{that was to be}} a part of the major revamp in BBC1's schedules. Smith was uneasy about the late start as EastEnders no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal {{following}} before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see the lot, and stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with ITV (who were launching their own market-based soap, Albion Market) and about the private lives of the cast. Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7p.m. on 19 February 1985. Both Holland and Smith could not watch; they both instead returned to the place where <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>began,</b> Albertine's Wine Bar on Wood Lane. The next day, viewing figures were confirmed at 17 million. The reviews were largely favourable, although, after three weeks on air, BBC1's early evening share had returned to the pre-EastEnders figure of seven million, though EastEnders then climbed to highs of up to 23 million later on in the year. Following the launch, both group discussions and telephone surveys were conducted to test audience reaction to early episodes. Detailed reactions were taken after six months and since then regular monitoring was conducted.|$|E

500|$|This {{resulted}} in a three-part comedic battle between the three faux-pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows on February 4, 2008. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>began</b> {{on the set of}} The Daily Show, when Colbert, to thunderous applause, interrupted the middle of a seemingly normal show to thank Stewart for settling the feud. [...] Stewart at first responded happily to this, but then grew visibly frightened once Colbert informed him of O'Brien's response from a few days before. Colbert then began taunting O'Brien, calling him [...] "cheap", [...] "stupid" [...] and [...] "lazy"—much to Stewart's chagrin, who begged Colbert to stop. It was too late, however, as O'Brien, accompanied by thunderous applause, quickly walked in and furiously scolded the two for keeping the feud going. [...] A seething Colbert, nonetheless, refused to back down, and even snarled at O'Brien: [...] "You want to tangle, Red?" [...] O'Brien agreed, but as the two prepared to take the fight outside, Stewart reminded them that he had to finish his show. O'Brien and Colbert agreed to wait outside, where they engaged in idle chit chat.|$|E

[...] Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. [...] The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. [...] Jarrow was motivated to write the script {{by what he saw}} as a shift in religious teachings – from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. [...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants {{to be taken care of}} and given answers. [...] And so <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>began</b> to make sense to me."

500|$|The season's finale Death And All His Friends {{was highly}} praised. Marsi gave the episode five stars, and {{expressed}} {{that it may}} have been the best episode of the series, adding: [...] "The writing and acting were absolutely stellar, and may lead to many Emmy nominations, but even more impressively, despite a killing spree, it remained distinctly Grey's. Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know where to begin now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding: [...] " [...] two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's Anatomy, and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours. It was emotional, expertly paced and had me in tears for most of the finale." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "At any rate, now you can at least see where <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>began.</b> And while you’re still pondering how Grey's can still be so damn good sometimes," ...|$|E

500|$|With the Queen's Birthday match {{marketed as}} the club's biggest match during the year, then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, {{promoted}} {{the debut of}} Watts by imploring fans to come along so they [...] "will look back {{at this time in}} three, four or five years to see where <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>began</b> {{and to be able to}} say I was there the day Jack Watts made his debut". His first touch saw him gang tackled by three Collingwood players, another contest saw him beaten by Martin Clarke, which led to a Collingwood goal; Collingwood captain, Nick Maxwell, gestured to Watts [...] "that's your goal, mate! Welcome to real footy". The team ultimately lost by sixty-six points with Watts recording just eight disposals, a mark and a behind, playing on the half-forward line. He retained his spot the next week for a forty-eight point loss against [...] at Etihad Stadium in which he kicked his first AFL goal. Recording nine disposals in his second match, the excitement surrounding Watts quickly turned to criticism with his school football coach and former AFL footballer, Robert Shaw, stating that he was not ready for AFL football. Premiership player and coach, Leigh Matthews, said he had not seen anything in Watts' first two matches to warrant him being the number one draft pick.

Another wicket fell to Boyle in the next over and MCC were 5–2 but, with Hornby and Arthur Ridley seemingly settling in, they pushed the total on to 27. Then there was a change of bowling and Spofforth came on instead of Allan. Spofforth's first spell at Lord's was [...] "truly demonic". Within another 11 overs, MCC were all out, Spofforth taking 6–4 in just 5.3 overs including a hat-trick with the wickets of George Hearne, Alfred Shaw and George Vernon. Shaw and Morley took five wickets apiece as they dismissed the Australians for 41 but Gregory decided to open his second innings attack with Spofforth and Boyle. The decisive moment was Spofforth's second ball to Grace, which clean bowled him for 0. The MCC innings lasted just 50 minutes, Boyle taking 6–3 and Spofforth 4–16. As news of the proceedings spread, the crowd grew in the afternoon sunshine and they [...] "mobbed the Australians {{as they left the}} field in a spirit of non-partisan enthusiasm". Around 500 had been present at the start but the number grew to 4,742 by the end; the receipts of £119 7s were given to the Australians and MCC paid the expenses.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon faced Archduke Charles's Austrian army at the Battle of Eckmühl, on 21–22 April 1809. On 22 April, {{the second}} day of the battle, Nansouty was at first sent to the Schierling plain, in support of Bavarian General Deroy, who, after several failed attempts, managed to take the town of Eckmühl from the enemy. Apart from the Schierling plain, the terrain at Eckmühl was very uneven and hilly, with dangerously steep slopes, which made cavalry action here improper. Yet, it was here that one of the most memorable cavalry actions of the entire Napoleonic Wars was to take place. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>began</b> on the slopes next to Eckmühl, where a first brief cavalry {{engagement}} occurred, as Bavarian and Württemberger cavalry encountered and charged Austrian cavalry. The Austrians won out and the Bavarians and Württembergers retreated and reformed in the vicinity of the two French heavy cavalry divisions present. These two divisions, the 1st under Nansouty (1st and 2nd Carabiniers-à-cheval, 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th Cuirassiers) and the 2nd under Saint-Sulpice (four regiments strong), were placed next to one another, forming five lines, with their regiments in column, one in front of the other. These men were ordered forward, up the slope and onto the plateau where the light cavalry had been repulsed moments earlier. Arriving on the plateau at a gallop, the cavalry overtook Marshal Lannes's infantry, who admiringly cheered [...] "Vive les cuirassiers" [...] ("Long live the cuirassiers") and applauded as the cavalry galloped past them,.
