5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference <b>in</b> <b>potential</b> energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference <b>in</b> <b>potential.</b> Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E

5|$|Because a Hurricane Watch {{existed for}} the New York City {{metropolitan}} area, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani urged citizens to take preparations. In addition, city officials {{set up a}} hurricane helpline, activated the city's Emergency Command Center at the Police Headquarters, and distributed leaflets to flood-prone areas. Near New Bedford, Massachusetts, where landfall was predicted to occur, schools were prepared as shelters {{in case of a}} direct hit. New Bedford Mayor issued a state of emergency for the city. However, few people stayed in shelters during the storm's passage. On Cape Cod, thousands of tourists and summer residents evacuated in preparation for the storm, resulting in an 18-mile (29km) traffic backup. As a result, many beach resorts lost millions <b>in</b> <b>potential</b> revenue. Of those who remained on Cape Cod, 900 stayed in emergency shelters when the storm passed the area. In Boston's Logan International Airport, numerous flights were cancelled or delayed to move planes to safety. Many sailors removed their boats from the water prior to the storm. At one time in Mattapoisett Harbor, workers removed boats at a rate of one every eight minutes. In Maine, the Red Cross opened several emergency shelters, though they were never used. Like in Massachusetts, sailors removed their boats, and due to media coverage, residents were well-prepared for the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness {{activated}} its Crisis Action Team on August 16 {{to monitor}} the storm and coordinate preparation. Governor of Louisiana Kathleen Blanco {{declared a state of}} emergency early on the evening of August 17, asking for a presidential emergency declaration to give Louisiana access to federal funds prior to any landfall. Texas Governor Rick Perry declared Dean to be an imminent threat to the state, and thus initiated a full-scale hurricane preparedness effort on August 17 when the storm was at least five days away. Prior to the storm, Texas suffered severe flooding from several June–July storms, and Tropical Storm Erin left the ground still saturated. Governor Perry feared that more rainfall from Dean would cause additional flash flooding, and had 250 Texas Parks and Wildlife Department crews on standby with boats to assist <b>in</b> <b>potential</b> evacuations. He was willing to deploy up to 10,000 Texas Military Forces soldiers, and did deploy several elements of the Texas State Guard who set up emergency shelters. The Texas fuel industry began surging fuel loads to coastal counties to ensure adequate fuel in the event of the hurricane causing a disruption to the fuel distribution system. In anticipation of evacuations, the Texas Department of Transportation began working on extra evacuation lanes and contraflow. NASA cut short the STS-118 mission as a precaution, in case Dean approached Mission Control at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. To that effect, mission managers cut the mission's final spacewalk short by two hours, allowing them to land a day earlier than originally planned.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1938, {{when there}} was a pending hearing and lawsuit alleging unfair labor {{practices}} by the studios against directors, Briskin was chosen to be one of three producers representing the studios, alongside Darryl Zanuck and E. J. Mannix. Sitting across the table were W. S. Van Dyke, Howard Hawks, and Briskin's friend, Frank Capra. In 1939, Briskin was once again involved <b>in</b> <b>potential</b> legal proceedings, being {{one of a number of}} producers who were called to testify before the National Labor Relations Board, regarding alleged infractions by the studios against the Screen Writers Guild (SWG). During the hearings, it was alleged that Briskin had opposed the proposed merger between the SWG and the Authors Guild. After the outbreak of hostilities in Europe and Asia at the beginning of World War II, AMPAS created the Motion Picture Defense Committee, which was a sub-committee of the organization's Research Council. Headed by the council's chairman, Darryl F. Zanuck, Briskin was one of several producers named to the committee. The group was formed to advise various arms of the U.S. government in the creation and production of training films. Shortly after the committee's formation, it was decided that the facilities of Hollywood film studios would be made available to the army to use for filming and production. In mid-November 1940 Briskin, along with the committee's chair Major Nathan Levinson, participated in interviews with members of the Screen Writers Guild, in order to select writers to go to Monmouth, New Jersey to work with army personnel on developing scripts for training films.|$|E

5|$|No. 82 Wing {{moved to}} its present {{location}} at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in 1946, {{where it came}} {{under the control of}} the RAAF's Eastern Area Command. In May that year, No.482 (Maintenance) Squadron was formed from No.4 Repair and Servicing Unit, to be responsible for repair and upkeep of the wing's aircraft. Its flying complement now included Nos.12 (formerly of No.85 Wing), 21, and 23 Squadrons, but these were renumbered Nos.1, 2 and 6 Squadrons respectively in February 1948. At the same time, the wartime Liberators were replaced by Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. During 1949–50, some of the Lincolns were specially modified with advanced radar and other instrumentation to participate in Operation Cumulative, a joint program with the Royal Air Force gathering long-range navigation and bombing data for use <b>in</b> <b>potential</b> air campaigns against the Soviet Union.|$|E

From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain.

5|$|The {{development}} of medicanes often {{results from the}} vertical shift of air in the troposphere as well, resulting in a decrease in its temperature coinciding {{with an increase in}} relative humidity, creating an environment more conducive for tropical cyclone formation. This, in turn, leads to in an increase <b>in</b> <b>potential</b> energy, producing heat-induced air-sea instability. Moist air prevents the occurrence of convective downdrafts—the vertically downward movement of air—which often hinder the inception of tropical cyclones, and in such a scenario, wind shear remains minimal; overall, cold-core cut-off lows serve well for the later formation of compact surface flux-influenced warm-core lows such as medicanes. The regular genesis of cold-core upper-level lows and the infrequency of Mediterranean tropical cyclones, however, indicate that additional unusual circumstances are involved the emergence of the latter. Elevated sea surface temperatures, contrasting with cold atmospheric air, encourage atmospheric instability, especially within the troposphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of operation of Bio-FET devices based on detecting changes <b>in</b> electrostatic <b>potential</b> due to binding of analyte.

Due to the small magnitude of the changes <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> upon binding of biomolecules or changing pH, glass electrodes require a high impedance amplifier which increases the size and cost of the device. In contrast, the advantage of Bio-FET devices is that they operate as an intrinsic amplifier, converting small changes <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> to large changes in current (through the transistor component) without the need for additional circuitry. This means BioFETs have the capability to be much smaller and more affordable than glass electrode-based biosensors. If the transistor is operated in the subthreshold region, then an exponential increase in current is expected for a unit change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the use of}} a vibrating Kelvin probe to monitor the change in the front surface potential of a silicon wafer while the rear surface is illuminated with monochromatic, visible light. Two tests were run to verify the change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential.</b> One test increased the intensity of the light and the other increased the wavelength while recording the front surface <b>potential.</b> The change <b>in</b> the surface <b>potential</b> for a range of intensities of incident light was recorded and analyzed. The results show that the change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> increased with increasing intensity. For each wafer, the smallest change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> occurred at the lowest intensity, 3. 77 mW. In the same respect, the largest change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> occurred at the highest intensity, 17. 8 mW. For all wafers, the change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> ranged from approximately 8 mV at 3. 77 mW to approximately 80 mV at 17. 8 mW. The change <b>in</b> the surface <b>potential</b> for a range of wavelengths of incident light was also recorded and analyzed. The results showed that the change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> formed a skewed bell curve with increasing wavelength of incident light. For each wafer, the largest change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> occurred at mid-range wavelengths, between 600 nm and 700 nm. The smallest change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> occurred at 450 nm, the shortest wavelength, and 800 nm, the longest wavelength. For all wafers, the change <b>in</b> surface <b>potential</b> ranged from approximately 8 mV at 800 nm to approximately 165 mV at 700 nm. A model based on excess electron diffusion within the silicon wafer was used to predict material properties. After curve fitting the model with experimental results, an excess electron lifetime of ôN = 17 µs and surface recombination rates of sFRONT = sREAR = 18, 000 cm/s were predicted. These values suggest poor silicon wafer quality relative to commercial silicon devices. Regardless of the quality, the results show that the front surface potential of a silicon wafer is affected by incident light on the rear surface. The quantitative effect of the light is dependent on the properties of the light and the material properties of the silicon wafer. M. S.

The {{effects of}} soil type of Shanghai and {{electrode}} potential from cathodic protection point on near-neutral pH {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SCC) behavior of pipeline steel X 60 has been investigated for structural integrity assessment.

40|$|A useful crude {{approximation}} for Abelian functions {{is developed}} {{and applied to}} orbits. The bound orbits <b>in</b> the power-law <b>potentials</b> A*r^{-alpha} take the simple form (l/r) ^k = 1 + e cos(m*phi), where k = 2 - alpha > 0 and 'l' and 'e' are generalisations of the semi-latus-rectum and the eccentricity. 'm' is given {{as a function of}} 'eccentricity'. For nearly circular orbits 'm' is sqrt{k}, while the above orbit becomes exact at the energy of escape where 'e' is one and 'm' is 'k'. Orbits <b>in</b> the logarithmic <b>potential</b> that gives rise to a constant circular velocity are derived via the limit of small alpha. For such orbits, r^ 2 vibrates almost harmonically whatever the 'eccentricity'. Unbound orbits <b>in</b> power-law <b>potentials</b> are given <b>in</b> an appendix. The transformation of orbits <b>in</b> one <b>potential</b> to give orbits <b>in</b> a different <b>potential</b> is used to determine orbits <b>in</b> <b>potentials</b> that are positive powers of r. These transformations are extended to form a group which associates orbits in sets of six potentials, e. g. there are corresponding orbits <b>in</b> the <b>potentials</b> proportional to r, r^{- 2 / 3 }, r^{- 3 }, r^{- 6 }, r^{ 4 / 3 } and r^{- 4 }. A degeneracy reduces this to three, which are r^{- 1 }, r^ 2 and r^{- 4 } for the Keplerian case. A generalisation of this group includes the isochrone with the Kepler set.
