As part of an ACARP funded project to develop a practical active <b>explosion</b> <b>barrier,</b> CFD is being used to simulate the explosion dynamics in simple mine roadways before examining the design requirements for an active <b>explosion</b> <b>barrier.</b> Results of these simulations will be used to develop the specifications for a prototype active <b>explosion</b> <b>barrier</b> with a reduced requirement for large scale testing. Results to-date are very encouraging with validation of the model behaviour against a range of explosion conditions in the Simtars Siwek 20 L chamber and the CSIR’s 200 m explosion tunnel in South Africa. This paper presents the results of a number of simulations with comparison against data obtained from the 200 m tunnel and preliminary modeling of an active barrier. This modeling provides an opportunity to examine explosion dynamics at a level not seen before...|$|E

40|$|Underground {{coal mines}} explosions {{generally}} {{arise from the}} inflammation of a methane/air mixture. This explosion can also generate a subsequent coal dust explosion. Traditionally such explosions have being fought eliminating one or several of the factors needed by the explosion to take place. Although several preventive measures are taken to prevent explosions, other measures should be considered to reduce the effects or even to extinguish the flame front. Unlike other protection methods that remove {{one or two of}} the explosion triangle elements, namely; the ignition source, the oxidizing agent and the fuel, <b>explosion</b> <b>barriers</b> removes all of them: reduces the quantity of coal in suspension, cools the flame front and the steam generated by vaporization removes the oxygen present in the flame. The present paper is essentially based on the comprehensive state-of–the-art of Protective Systems in underground coal mines, and particularly on the application of <b>Explosion</b> <b>Barriers</b> to improve safety level in Spanish coal mining industry. After an exhaustive study of series EN 14591 standards covering explosion prevention and protection in underground mines, authors have proven <b>explosion</b> <b>barriers</b> effectiveness in underground galleries by Full Scale Tests performed in Polish Barbara experimental mine, showing that the barriers can reduce the effects of methane and/or flammable coal dust explosions to a satisfactory safety level...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{installed}} passive water <b>explosion</b> <b>barriers</b> in two operating mines {{to determine their}} usefulness in U. S. coal mines.

Data were also obtained on the ability of the barriers to withstand the mine environment and on the effect of the barriers on belt operation, ventilation, worker travel, and rock dusting. Fifty barriers were installed at three separate beltway locations, and periodic inspections were made. A year after installation, no defects of the barriers or support hardware were detected, nor was any complaint as to the presence of the barriers made by the mine personnel. To date, 2 - 1 / 2 years after installation, the barriers have had no detrimental ef-fect on rock dusting, belt operation, or ventilation. Costs of material, fabrication, and installation are reported herein...|$|R
3000|$|Over {{the past}} century, the coal mining {{industry}} experienced {{a large number}} of explosions leading to a considerable loss of life. Research was directed at preventing the accumulation of methane through good ventilation practice, eliminating frictional sparking by the use of water, minimising dust generation and dispersal, and using stone dust to inert coal dusts to prevent coal dust from participating in mine explosions (Smith and du Plessis 1998). The final line of defence, however, is the use of barriers(du Plessis et al. 1995) to prevent a coal dust explosion from propagating. However, the design of passive <b>explosion</b> <b>barrier</b> systems has remained unchanged for many years. The traditional stone dust and water barriers were originally designed and developed as much as 50  years ago. In the 1990 ’s the CSIR of South Africa developed a new type of stone dust <b>explosion</b> <b>barrier,</b> which has been implemented in South Africa and Australia. This barrier is considered to be better suited to modern-day mining practice. It is based on an array of specially manufactured bags holding stone dust and suspended from the mine roof (du Plessis and Vassard 1995; du Plessis 2001).|$|E
30|$|The {{initiation}} of coal dust explosions {{for evaluating the}} active <b>explosion</b> <b>barrier</b> was achieved by igniting a methane/air mixture. A chamber with a methane/air volume of 75  m 3 was created by placing a plastic membrane 14  m from the closed end of the gallery and introducing pure methane into the chamber. The methane/air mixture is mixed and allowed to stabilise at a methane/air mixture of 9  % per volume. The methane explosion resulting from the ignited methane/air mixture is adequate to produce enough dynamic (wind) pressure to lift the coal dust particles {{into the air and}} to supply sufficient heat to the coal dust particles for flame propagation and the associated coal dust explosion to propagate.|$|E

Preventing the propagation of methane or coal dust explosions through the use of active explosion-suppression systems {{remains one of the most}} underutilised explosion controls in underground coal mines. As part of the effort to develop better technologies to safeguard mines, the use of active barrier systems was investigated at Kloppersbos in South Africa. The system is designed to meet the requirements of the European Standard (EN 14591 - 4 : 2007) (European Standard, 2007), as well as the Mine Safety Standardisation in the Ministry of Coal Industry, Coal Industrial Standard (MT 694 - 1997) of the People’s Republic of China. From the tests conducted, it can be concluded that the HS Suppression System was successful in stopping flame propagation for a methane explosion, as well preventing methane explosions from progressing into methane and coal dust hybrid explosions when ammonium phosphate powder was used as the suppression material. The use of this barrier can provide coal mine management with an additional explosion control close to the point of ignition and may find application within longwall faces, further protecting mines against the risk of an explosion propagating...|$|E
30|$|In {{the design}} of <b>explosion</b> <b>barriers,</b> the {{suppressant}} agent should be ideally dispersed as the flame front reaches the barrier (Zou 2001). If the suppressant agent is dispersed prematurely, the suppressant will be driven downstream and its concentration will be diluted by the explosion-induced wind force before being overtaken by the flame. When the suppressant agent is dispersed to late, the suppressant cloud is behind the flame where it has minimal effect in distinguishing the flame. With passive barriers, {{it is difficult to}} ensure optimal conditions (Zou 2001). Active barriers with triggering devices are therefore developed to try and meet this need.|$|R

The employees of HS Design Engineering undertook the set-up of the ExploSpot system in the 200  m tunnel while the CSIR employees prepared the tunnel and conducted testing. The suppressant material used to suppress a coal dust explosion in the test tunnel was ammonium phosphate powder.|$|R

Full scale tests have been carried out in Polish Barbara experimental mine at GIG Central Mining Institute in order to determine the requirements and the optimal installation conditions of these devices for small sections galleries which are very frequent in the Spanish coal mines. Full scale tests results have been analyzed to understand the explosion timing and development, in order to assess on the use of water barriers in the typical small crosssection Spanish galleries. Several arrangements of water barriers have been designed and tested to verify the effectiveness of the explosion suppression in each case. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the water barriers in stopping the flame front even with smaller amounts of water than those established by the European standard. According to the tests realized, water barriers activation times are between 0. 52 s and 0. 78 s and the flame propagation speed are between 75 m/s and 80 m/s. The maximum pressures (Pmax) obtained in the full scale tests have varied between 0. 2 bar and 1. 8 bar. Passive barriers protect effectively against the spread of the flame but cannot be used as a safeguard of the gallery between the ignition source and the first row of water troughs or bags, or even after them, as the pressure could remain high after them even if the flame front has been extinguished...|$|R
40|$|A {{project to}} {{evaluate}} the South African bagged stone dust <b>explosion</b> <b>barrier</b> was successfully completed at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (MOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory's (PRL), Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM) during the period November 1999 through May 2000. The tests were conducted in a three- entry section of the LLEM. Two types of explosions were used {{to evaluate the}} distributed and concentrated bagged barrier performance in a multi-entry mine section. The fuel zone of the first explosion type was only in the center B-drift. In the second explosion type, coal and stone dust mixtures were place in all three drifts. A total of six explosions, including two baseline and four barrier evaluation explosions, were conducted. Of the four barrier explosions, the distributed and concentrated barriers were each evaluated against the two explosion types. For these explosion tests, the distributed barrier extended from about 74 to 170 m and the concentrated barrier from about 74 to 104 m in B-drift. The distributed barrier successfully stopped flame propagation in both types of explosion tests. The flame extended further for the explosion tests where the dust was loaded in all three entries compared with dust loaded only in the center entry% but in both cases the flame was stopped within the barrier zone. The concentrated barrier was also successful in stopping flame propagation m both explosion tests. From the full-scale experimental mine test results, it can be concluded that both bagged barrier designs were effective in stopping coal dust explosions in the multiple entries of the LLEM...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{addition}} of stone (limestone) dust to roadway dust in an underground coal mine increases the Total Incombustible Content (TIC) {{to reduce the}} potential of the coal dust igniting and propagating an explosion. Coal dust explosions have been proven {{to be one of the}} most severe hazards in an underground coal mine hence as Queensland legislation requires the use of roadway stone dusting, the required levels of TIC are higher than other mining districts around the world which also employ other coal dust <b>explosion</b> <b>barriers.</b> Compliance testing currently involves Low Temperature Ashing (LTA) of representative samples with a turn around on results of up to two weeks. To minimise the time that the mine is potentially out of compliance and unsafe, the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM) has been tested at a Queensland underground coal mine to determine its effectiveness, through 11 different calibration methods, in rapidly measuring the TIC of roadway dust samples. The key focus of the calibration methods was to explore the effectiveness of the CDEM at its designed threshold of 80 % TIC, the use of an inbuilt methane content adjustment to replicate the Queensland legislative requirement of 85 % TIC and the use of actual 85 % TIC calibration samples.
