50|$|The water ways in Hamilton {{have not}} always been polluted. The north-end of the Harbour used to be a regular {{swimming}} spot for working-class families. The pollution of Hamilton Harbour water ways is caused by industrialization and, by proxy, urbanization, which came to be a major problem by 1917. Many working-class families were overcome by health hazards when dumping sewage into the inlets and the bay itself became a regular occurrence. Laurel Sefton MacDowell writes in her book An Environmental History of Canada that, “As early as the 1860s, a <b>fishery</b> <b>inspector</b> at Hamilton Harbour discovered that fish found along the shore tasted of coal oil and that dead ducks and muskrats were coated with oil from two refineries.” By the 1950s, city officials had deemed Hamilton Harbour unfit for any recreation use and shut down all beaches.|$|E
5000|$|In 1844 an act {{was passed}} authorising police {{protection}} for the rivers; and in 1845 another salmon act was passed, and Ffennell was appointed <b>fishery</b> <b>inspector</b> under the board of works. His office included the inspection of sea fisheries, and during the Potato Famine he visited Scotland, examined the process of fish-curing, and tried to introduce it among the starving population of {{the west coast of}} Ireland. In 1848 the act commonly called [...] "Ffennell's Act" [...] was passed. This is the initial act of modern salmon legislation, which provides funds and machinery for carrying the law into practice, by making the local administration of the salmon acts self-supporting. He now became a commissioner at the Office of Public Works for the superintendence of the newly formed fishery districts. In 1853 he exhibited working models of salmon passes at the Dublin exhibition of that year, which attracted general attention. His advice was frequently sought in England and Scotland; and in 1860 he was appointed one of the royal commissioners to examine the salmon fisheries of England and Wales. Their report led to an act passed in 1861, under which Ffennell was appointed inspector of salmon fisheries for England and Wales. In 1862 he was appointed commissioner of fisheries for Scotland.|$|E
40|$|Hidden {{within the}} seminal 1914 {{publication}} by Johan Hjort, we find what {{is probably one}} of the first comprehensive teleost time-series ever published. The series is liver size and fat content of northeast Arctic (NEA) cod measured during the traditional winter fishery in Lofoten, Northern Norway, in 1880 – 1912 and 1883 – 1913, respectively. The data were collected well before the advent of the great industrialized fisheries in the 1930 s. The raw data used by Hjort originate from annual reports of the Lofoten fishery, initiated by Member of Parliament and pioneer <b>fishery</b> <b>inspector</b> of Northern Norway, Ketil Motzfeldt, in 1859. Based on these reports and following various calibration exercises, we present robust estimates of the hepatosomatic index (HSI) from 1859 to 2012 (except 1863), i. e. over 153 years—extending Hjort's analysis both backwards (1859 – 1879) and forwards (1913 –present). This series of bulk HSI contained five major periods: 1859 – 1880, 1881 – 1919, 1920 – 1974, 1975 – 2003, and 2004 – 2012; the highest HSI was recorded 1920 – 1974, whereas the lowest was from the most recent period. Despite variability, total length was a significant predictor of HSI, 1932 – 2012. A weak but significant relationship existed with both total-stock biomass and ocean temperature, as well as with the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index under a 1 -year lag. The present exceptionally long HSI series will give an excellent opportunity for further research on the “quality of the cod” in a historic perspective...|$|E

40|$|Tobias Dahlkvist, Vad kan Borgs armband säga oss? Nietzsche och I havsbandet. (What Can Borg’s Bracelet Tell Us? Nietzsche and I havsbandet [By the Open Sea].) This {{essay is}} an attempt to reinterpret the Nietzschean element in August Strindberg’s novel I havsbandet (1890). Earlier {{commentators}} had considered this element to be a response of some kind to Nietzsche’s notion of der Übermensch. In the essay, I argue that since Strindberg probably did not read Also sprach Zarathustra, but did read several other works by Nietzsche where this theme is presented, a reinterpretation which focuses on themes unfolded in the books that he actually did read seems sensible. One such theme is decadence, a concept of great importance to Nietzsche’s criticism of modern culture. Nietzsche describes modern man as decadent, and his diagnosis is that Christianity in combination with Schopenhauerian pessimism has led him to a way of life where too little attention is paid to what is important in life: the strengthening of the body, for example, and a correct diet. Decadence can manifest itself as asceticism, but also as a love of luxury, as the need for sensual stimulation. Axel Borg, <b>fishery</b> <b>inspector</b> and protagonist in I havsbandet, combines asceticism and love of luxury in a peculiar way. His approach to morality is remarkably similar to that of Nietzsche — instead of passing judgment, he forms himself into a person who acts {{in such a way that}} no regrets are necessary. But this is not enough to save him: through luxury and asceticism he has lost the capacity for overcoming (Überwindung) which is so central to Nietzsche, and which is what distinguishes him from the decadents. Since Strindberg was familiar with the decadence theme in Nietzsche’s thinking, as well as with the French discussion of decadence that Nietzsche took as his starting-point, and since Axel Borg exhibits characteristics that are prominently decadent, I propose a reading of I havsbandet as a response to Nietzsche’s criticism of modern culture, and of Borg as a Nietzschean decadent...|$|E

40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} conservation and recovery of fish stocks {{are based on the}} implementation of minimum mesh sizes to guarantee a certain level of fishing gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing of netting for fishing nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate mesh size regulations. For example, the measurements made by <b>fishery</b> <b>inspectors</b> using the wedge gauge are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the cod-ends used by fishermen to satisfy the <b>fishery</b> <b>inspectors</b> will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of twines and netting materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method. A major step in the standardization of mesh measurement methodologies was {{the development of a new}} standard mesh gauge (2002 - 2005). In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines the different mesh measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective mesh gauge (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, <b>fisheries</b> <b>inspectors</b> and the netting industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|R
