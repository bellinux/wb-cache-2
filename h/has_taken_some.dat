Omi has previously supported increases in the national consumption tax, although Abe has distanced himself from this policy and seeks to achieve much of his budget balancing through spending cuts.|$|E

An Economic Crimes Investigation Department {{was established in}} the Ministry of Public Security to focus on illicit activities. The People's Bank of China (China's central bank) began several structural reforms such as the establishment of two new divisions, the Payment Trade Supervisory Division and the Money Laundering Working Division. The People's Bank of China also prepared guidelines for use by financial institutions to report suspicious transactions, and to sensitize the public about new regulations on money laundering and terrorist financing issues.|$|E
25|$|In the novel, Germany {{concentrates}} on the containment of the USSR. Hitler <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>some</b> steps to soften his image over the years, and now wears civilian clothes {{most of the time}} instead of Party uniform. Nonetheless, no substantive changes have taken place in the Nazi regime's basic character. The Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act of 1933, the legal bases for Hitler's dictatorship, remain in effect. The press, radio and television are tightly controlled. Dissenters are still sent to concentration camps. Conditions in the camps are reputed to be as harsh {{as they were in the}} 1930s and 1940s, though the International Red Cross is occasionally given staged inspections.|$|E
25|$|More monumental {{than the}} three panels that preceded it, the two figures {{dominate}} the foreground of Eight Bells, {{and the details}} of the ship are minimally rendered. Homer <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>some</b> artistic license, showing the figure at left using an octant to take a reading of the sun, the other apparently reading the altitude of a completed sight on his octant. In reality, both observers would have had their octants to their eyes, rocking them back and forth to determine the highest elevation reached by the sun, thereby establishing local apparent noon. The moment is prosaic, yet it is presented as a heroic image. In 1887 Homer produced an etching based on the painting, in which he further minimized the ship's rigging and diminished the area of sky, thereby focusing more on the figures.|$|E

25|$|Another problem (also {{compounded}} {{by the absence of}} implementing legislation) is the apparent lack of understanding by many judges in Mexico of the law of the Convention. Mexican judges frequently seem to ignore the fact that a case before them arises out of a return application under the Convention, and instead simply apply the procedural and substantive law that would govern a Mexican custody dispute. The result is almost always that those courts deny return without evaluating the merits of the application under the law of the Convention. U.S. Embassy officials report that the Mexican Central Authority <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>some</b> preliminary steps to address this problem. The Mexican Central Authority actively participated in June 2003 in a conference hosted by the U.S. Embassy to educate family law judges about the Hague Convention. The Mexican Central Authority has also started to contact judges it believes may be presiding over a Convention case {{for the first time to}} provide support and guidance, and, in particular, to emphasize the distinction between the court's role in Convention cases and its role in domestic custody determinations.|$|E
25|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{has played a}} moderate role in responding to corporate-community conflict arising from the mineral industry. In January 2012, the Humala administration established an international commission {{with the task of}} identifying ways to reduce the environmental effects of the Newmont Mining Corporation's Conga project. Newmont was forced to comply with the revised measures before resuming operations. When government officials presented the new terms to local community members in order to gain their consent, they were faced with considerable opposition and violent protests ensued. Thus, though the national government <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>some</b> steps towards addressing social protest, it is often unable to adequately address communities' expectations about corporate accountability and the regulation of environmental damage caused by mining activities. Another example concerns mining conflict in Peru's Piura region. Between 1998 and 2003, conflicts arose between the Canadian company Manhattan Minerals and members of the Tambogrande community. Following a local referendum in which 93% of the community voted against mining operations, Manhattan Minerals left the region. Similar conflicts ensued when another corporation, Monterrico Minerals, began conducting exploration work in Piura's highland provinces. This conflict led to the death of two farmers during violent protests and incited many national and international actors to intervene. A referendum took place once again and more than 90% of the population voted against mining. Despite such opposition, Monterrico Metals and the government of Peru insisted that the mining operations go forward. According to the Community Development Journal, such conflicts demonstrate that the government is largely absent in helping community members and corporations to reach mutual agreements. As a result, local community members often view the government as a biased mediator that favors corporate interests. With a lack of government intervention, community members resort to protest in attempt to resolve issues stemming from the mineral industry.|$|E

Sify praised the performance of Mohanlal and the humour of Siddique and Soubin Saheer but criticized the script, saying, [...] "Loham is about a topical subject, but it is far from engaging". Raj Vikram of Metromatinee said that technically the film is slick with well shot sequences.

500|$|Water {{rights of}} Native Americans in the Colorado River basin were largely ignored during the {{extensive}} water resources development {{carried out on}} the river and its tributaries in the 19th and 20thcenturies. The construction of dams has often had negative impacts on tribal peoples, such as the Chemehuevi when their riverside lands were flooded {{after the completion of}} Parker Dam in 1938. Ten Native American tribes in the basin now hold or continue to claim water rights to the Colorado River. The U.S. government <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>some</b> actions to help quantify and develop the water resources of Native American reservations. The first federally funded irrigation project in the U.S. was the construction of an irrigation canal on the Colorado River Indian Reservation in 1867. Other water projects include the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project, authorized in 1962 for the irrigation of lands in part of the Navajo Nation in north-central New Mexico. The Navajo continue to seek expansion of their water rights because of difficulties with the water supply on their reservation; about 40percent of its inhabitants must haul water by truck many miles to their homes. In the 21stcentury, they have filed legal claims against the governments of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah for increased water rights. Some of these claims have been successful for the Navajo, such as a 2004 settlement in which they received a [...] allotment from New Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Deprived of {{political}} power, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write {{and work on}} physics. He toured Europe and Japan, giving talks {{about the history of}} science, the role of science in society, {{and the nature of the}} universe. In September 1957, France made him an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and on May 3, 1962, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in Britain. At the urging of many of Oppenheimer's political friends who had ascended to power, President John F. Kennedy awarded Oppenheimer the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963 as a gesture {{of political}} rehabilitation. Edward Teller, the winner of the previous year's award, had also recommended Oppenheimer receive it, in the hope that it would heal the rift between them. A little over a week after Kennedy's assassination, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, presented Oppenheimer with the award, [...] "for contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, and for leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years". Oppenheimer told Johnson: [...] "I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that it <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>some</b> charity and some courage for you to make this award today." [...] The rehabilitation implied by the award was partly symbolic, as Oppenheimer still lacked a security clearance and could have no effect on official policy, but the award came with a $50,000 tax-free stipend, and its award outraged many prominent Republicans in Congress. The late President Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, still living in the White House, made it a point to meet with Oppenheimer to tell him how much her husband had wanted him to have the medal. While still a senator in 1959, Kennedy had been instrumental in voting to narrowly deny Oppenheimer's enemy Lewis Strauss a coveted government position as Secretary of Commerce, effectively ending Strauss' political career. This was partly due to lobbying by the scientific community on behalf of Oppenheimer.|$|E

2500|$|Deep {{within the}} forest, Ganja is {{cultivated}} in cleared areas. The wildlife is poached and {{disturbed by the}} fishermen at Patanangala.

In the absence of hand-weeding, which was practiced until the 1950s, the transformation of interior grasslands to scrub jungle is unavoidable.
