5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. <b>group</b> <b>members</b> are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the <b>group</b> <b>members</b> often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
