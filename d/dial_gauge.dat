A single-stage regulator will tend to allow a reduction in outlet pressure as the cylinder is emptied, requiring manual readjustment. For low-volume users, this is an acceptable simplification. Welding regulators, unlike simpler LPG heating regulators, retain their outlet (hose) pressure gauge and do not rely on the calibration of the adjustment knob.

40|$|Measurement and {{monitoring}} of structural components such as beams and columns under loading {{are important in}} structural analysis and design assessment. Presently, the assessment on structural components on deformation or displacement measurement is carried out through LVDTs or <b>dial</b> <b>gauges.</b> The LVDTs or <b>dial</b> <b>gauges</b> were installed {{in contact with the}} structural components, also known as contact method. However, present contact method is subjected to some limitations such as s displacement points of measurement are highly depend on the position of LVDTs available, reliability of LVDTs and <b>dial</b> <b>gauges</b> to measure during the experiments due to possibility of damage sensors and consumption of time on the installation the sensors. Due to the limitations of contact method, this study demonstrates the use of a noncontact method using digital close range photogrammetry technique to measure the deformational behaviour of full-scale structural beams and columns. In this study, a full-scale load tests on structural components were performed under laboratory conditions. A series of digital images of the structural beams and columns under various loads were captured using Nikon DSLR cameras. The digital images then processed and analyzed using digital close range photogrammetric technique to measure and extract the magnitude of the structural beam and column displacements. The deformation and displacement of beam and columns have been validated by comparing the photogrammetric outputs against the results obtained from the LVDTs. The statistical analysis shows the differences obtained between the photogrammetric technique and contact method used were not significant...|$|R

At this position, the top surface of the sine bar is inclined the same amount as the wedge. Using gauge blocks, the top surface is made horizontal.

30|$|The beam having simply {{supported}} boundary conditions {{was set up}} in the loading frame with sufficient care taken to ensure that the specimen was correctly positioned in the loading frame and the midpoint of the beam was in line with the centre line of the loading hydraulic jack. The specimen was heavily gauged, as shown in Fig.  2, in an attempt to identify a primary mode of failure, i.e. either buckling load for the web post, the formation of plastic hinges, or local buckling of the flange. Prior to application of load on the specimen, all the <b>dial</b> <b>gauges</b> were calibrated properly. Before the actual test, a small preload not exceeding 5  % of the expected ultimate load was applied slowly and removed to eliminate any slack in the support system so that the specimen would be properly seated on the supports. The loading and unloading process was repeated a few times and this procedure also helped to check whether the <b>dial</b> <b>gauges</b> functioned properly. Readings were initialised after ensuring that all instruments worked satisfactorily. The specimen was loaded first up to 20  % of the expected failure load and then unloaded to zero value. It was observed that the deflection readings reached the initial values when unloaded. The procedure was repeated up to 35  % of the expected failure load and the specimen was finally loaded to failure by increasing the load gradually by a predetermined increment. The five <b>dial</b> <b>gauges</b> were installed, three for measurement of vertical deflection placed at L/ 4, L/ 2 and 3 L/ 4, respectively, and two for measurement of lateral deflection of top and bottom flange, respectively, as shown in Fig.  2. The beam was then tested to failure. After the maximum load was attained and unloading occurred with increase in beam deflection, the load was then removed. The ultimate load and the mode of failure for each of the specimens were noted. The same test procedure was adopted for all the specimens.|$|R

50|$|The Geneva Lens Measure is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} curved surfaces.

The instrument can be used to help estimate the size of fossil eggshells by measuring their curved surfaces. Since most eggs aren't perfectly round measurements from multiple parts of the egg with varying shell curvatures may be needed to get a full idea of the egg's size. Ideally an eggshell fragment being used to estimate the full size of an egg should be more than 3 cm long. Smaller eggshell fragments are better suited to other methods of study, like the Obrig radius <b>dial</b> <b>gauge.</b> The Geneva Lens measure gives units in diopters which must be converted to the radius in millimeters. Use of the Geneva Lens Measure to estimate the size of a fossil egg was first done by Sauer on fossil ostrich eggs.|$|E
50|$|NACA Report 107 {{describes}} a pressure-measuring device that was adapted {{for use in}} mapping indicator diagrams of high-speed internal combustion engines. The cards are obtained by a point-to-point method giving the average {{of a large number}} of engine cycles. The principle involved is the balancing of the engine cylinder pressure against a measured pressure on opposite sides of a metal diaphragm of negligible stiffness. In its application as an engine indicator the phase of the engine cycle to which a pressure measurement corresponds is selected by a filming device. Thereport discusses errors to be avoided in the development of an indicator for light high-speed engines, where vibration is serious, and outlines the principles underlying the design of this instrument in order to be free of such errors. A description of the instrument and accessories follows, together with operating directions. Specimen indicator diagrams are appended.

The <b>dial</b> <b>gauge</b> and the universal testing machine were connected to a scanner (Kyowa Electronic Instruments Co., Ltd., USB- 21 A) and a data logger (Kyowa Electronic Instruments Co., Ltd., UCAM- 20 PC). In order to confirm that the pointer of the <b>dial</b> <b>gauge</b> remained parallel to the cross-head, steel sheet of 2.9 or 4.9  mm thick was inserted between the cross-head and the pointer.
