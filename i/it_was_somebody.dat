He injured his elbow in a game against the Boston Red Sox on May 27 after jamming it into the metal fence at Fenway Park. He remained in the game, and x-rays later turned up negative. Revere later said of the injury, [...] "Luckily, I've got strong enough bones. If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> else it may have been bad, but luckily it wasn't serious." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Americans' {{assessments}} of Diệm were varied. Some were unimpressed with him, some admired him. Diệm gained favor with some high standing officials, such as Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, Roman Catholic cardinal Francis Spellman, Representative Mike Mansfield of Montana, and Representative John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts along with numerous journalists, academics, and the legendary spy chief of CIA William J. Donovan. Although {{he did not}} succeed in winning an official support from the US, his personal interactions with American political leaders promised his prospect in gaining more support in the future. Mansfield remembered after the luncheon with Diệm held on May 8, 1953, he felt that [...] "if anyone could hold South Vietnam, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> like Ngô Đình Diệm".|$|E
6000|$|... “There’s a stone {{among the}} {{boulders}} {{at the tail}} of the pool that seems different from the rest. One could almost fancy <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody’s</b> head,” he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> settled;--and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> you know;--and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a d---- outsider; unless, indeed, {{he may be}} {{considered}} to be an outsider in reference to that branch of the service." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{seemed to}} imply a negative, {{and the old}} man turned to another hopeful, who was pulling the fur from a mangy bearskin on which he was lying, with an {{expression}} as though <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>somebody's</b> hair.|$|R
60|$|JACK. Well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> else's--it {{was all a}} joke--I did {{n't want}} the beastly thing.|$|E
60|$|Here the leather-legginged boy laughed very heartily, {{and then}} tried to look as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> else, whereat Mr. Winkle frowned majestically.|$|E
60|$|Again we fled, swearing, {{and made}} our way to a third theater. They were all {{children}} there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> or other's Children's Company performing an opera, or pantomime, or something of that sort.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh,' said Elfride, {{her heart}} sinking within her. 'Can <b>it</b> <b>be</b> from that man--a lecture for impertinence? And {{actually}} one for Mrs. Swancourt {{in the same}} hand-writing!' She feared to open hers. 'Yet how can he know my name? No; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> else.' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{this purpose}} <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> <b>somebody's</b> {{business}} to pursue and direct it incessantly.|$|R
5000|$|Examples {{of thought}} insertion: [...] "She said that {{sometimes}} <b>it</b> seemed to <b>be</b> her own thought 'but I don't {{get the feeling}} that it is'. She said her 'own thoughts might say the same thing', 'but the feeling isn't the same', 'the feeling <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> else's'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, pshaw! perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> who {{was trying}} to spy on us," [...] put in Fred. [...] "If we tell the captain we will only be exposing ourselves, and I guess you all know what that means." ...|$|E
60|$|But Hank Stiger {{was already}} retreating, {{carrying}} the lighted tinder in his hand. He {{could not make}} out who was there, but saw <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> with a gun, and the sight of the weapon was enough for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{curious about}} that light," [...] he admitted. [...] "I'd have said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> baiting a long-line or looking for lobsters, {{only that the}} fellow wouldn't have waited for high-water. Then, it was too {{brilliant}} for a lantern." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No--I don't mind waiting--I {{would rather}} stay here twelve months longer than run any risk with baby. But I don't like your {{vanishing}} {{so in the}} evenings. There's something on your mind--I know there is, Damon. You go about so gloomily, {{and look at the}} heath as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>somebody's</b> gaol instead of a nice wild place to walk in." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the first, Truman wrote: Something's {{going on}} and I don't know what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>Somebody</b> called up the President of Haiti {{and he said that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> I.... He said, 'We want you to vote for the Zionist program.' As a result the President of Haiti changed his vote to satisfy what he thought was me. I don't know who this fellow was that called him up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not me," [...] said Barker, with widely opened eyes. [...] "You see <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> whom we <b>are</b> {{familiar}} with. I can't imagine such a scoundrel." ...|$|R
60|$|An {{approaching}} motor-car {{brought a}} startled frown across her brow. Was it 'that person'? But {{though it was}} not Mr. Purcey and his A.i. Damyer, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> so like him as made no difference. Thyme uttered a little laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s {{just a bit}} of a joke, cook," [...] said Sam jovially. [...] "Dick ’ud be {{the first}} to laugh at it hisself if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> else’s clothes." [...] He spun a penny in the air, and {{covering}} it deftly, held it out to the cook.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] ses Emma. [...] "He's {{got a very}} jealous disposition, poor fellow; and me and Sophy {{have been}} telling 'im about a young man just to tease 'im.

6000|$|... "She told {{me as much}} herself. That is, when I {{asked her}} she would not deny it. Then I thought that perhaps <b>it</b> might <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> at Cheltenham." ...|$|R
5000|$|The traditionalists' Papal Oath, {{if indeed}} {{based on the}} text in the Liber Diurnus, is a serious mistranslation. Much of it has no basis {{whatever}} in the historical document, including the paragraphs [...] "I swear ... defined and declared" [...] and [...] "Accordingly, without exclusion ... blasphemous venture" [...] and the phrase [...] "I will put outside the Church whoever dares to go against this oath, may <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> else or I".|$|R

6000|$|THE GENERAL. Never, Lesbia, never. You {{have never}} {{given me a}} real reason for refusing me yet. I once thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> else.

60|$|It {{started on}} {{my very first}} night at the cottage. I had fallen asleep in the kitchen, tired out after all the {{excitement}} of the day and the long walks I had had, when something woke me with a start. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> scratching at the window, trying to get in.|$|E
6000|$|... "But no!" [...] said Tanny. [...] "It MUST <b>be</b> more individual. <b>It</b> must <b>be</b> <b>SOMEBODY</b> you love, not {{abstract}} love in itself. How can you sacrifice {{yourself to}} an abstraction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't tell. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> boys, maybe fishers. I {{must get}} out to them," [...] he replied.

I saw {{the opening of a}} path down the rock just now," [...] and he threw himself off his horse, and threw her the bridle. [...] "You ride to the first house; find where there is a Coast-guard station, or any {{fisherman}} to put out a boat. No time to be lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I'm {{not going}} to wear your things any more, Fanny. It's a case of conscience. I feel like a guilty creature, being courted in another's clothes; and I don't know but it's {{for a kind of}} {{punishment}} of my deceit that I can't realize this affair as I ought, or my part in it. I keep feeling, the whole time, as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>somebody</b> else, and I have an absurd kind of other person's interest in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’Three times I ’ve been woke up {{this night}} by {{something}} shouting in my ear, [...] "Steer nor’-nor’-west!"’ ses the cap’n very solemnly, ’"Steer nor’-nor’-west!"’ that’s all it says.

6000|$|... "A man of {{enormous}} wealth--a tobacco-merchant--West Indies; {{a fellow of}} no birth, however; and who, between ourselves, married a woman that is not much better than she should be.

Now it is with that Captain Dobble; last week <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> else--and it may be you next week, if--ha! ha! ha!--you are disposed to enter the lists.

6000|$|... "You {{looked so}} young," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{had always had}} the idea that it was up to the old people to put the world to rights--that all I had to do was to look after myself. It came to me {{suddenly}} while you were talking to me--I mean while I was reading you: that if you were worrying yourself about it, I'd got to come in, too--that it would be mean of me not to.

6000|$|The {{effort of}} it uprooted her from that spot where her little feet seemed dug {{deep into the}} thick luxurious carpet, and she retreated {{backwards}} to a distant part of the room, hearing herself repeat, [...] "You mustn't, you mustn't," [...] as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>somebody</b> else screaming. She came to a chair and flung herself into it. Thereupon the somebody else ceased screaming and she lolled, exhausted, sightless, in a silent room, as if indifferent to everything and without a single thought in her head.|$|R
