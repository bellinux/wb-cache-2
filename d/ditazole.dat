50|$|The {{reaction}} of 2-chloro-4,5-diphenyloxazole with DEA {{gave rise to}} <b>Ditazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Ditazole</b> is a {{platelet}} aggregation inhibitor. It is marketed in Spain and Portugal under the trade name Ageroplas.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) {{indometacin}} and <b>ditazole</b> on prostacyclin production from rabbit aortic rings were studied {{in comparison to}} their inhibiting activity on platelet aggregation. The result were expressed as the ratio between the drug dose inhibiting by 50 % prostacycline production and the minimum oral antiaggregating dose. The following ratios were found: 2. 4 for ASA, 7. 3 for indometacin and 20. 4 for ditazol...|$|E
40|$|Several antiaggregating {{agents were}} tested {{with regard to}} their effect on {{platelet}} malonylaldehyde (MDA) production which seems to be a good marker of prostaglandin metabolism. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory compounds, namely acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), <b>ditazole</b> and sulfinpyrazone, showed a sure, statistically significant, inhibitory effect on MDA production while theophylline, adenosine and alpha-blocking agent nycergoline did not. Dipyridamole on the contrary, was demonstrated to have a mild but still statistically significant effect on the inhibition of platelet MDA production...|$|E
