5|$|The {{civil parish}} of Frome has adopted {{the style of}} a town, and there is a Town Council of 17 members. Reduced from 20 Councillors in 2005. Councillors are split between eight wards: three each for the Berkley Down, College, Keyford, two each for Market, Oakfield and Park Wards, and once each for the Highpoint and <b>Innox</b> Wards. The most recent {{elections}} were in May 2015, following which the council is made up of 17 members of the Independents for Frome party (ifF).|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St John the Baptist, was built between the late 12th century and early 15th century {{replacing}} a 685 AD Saxon building. Major restoration work {{was carried out}} in the 1860s, including the construction of the Via Crucis, which is thought to be unique in an Anglican church. Outside the east end of the church is the tomb of Bishop Thomas Ken. The tower has eight bells, which bear inscriptions indicating that they were cast at various points between 1622 and 1792. A daughter church of St John's, Christ Church, was built in 1818 by George Allen Underwood, although considerable changes were made throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The third Anglican Church, Holy Trinity, was built in 1837–38 by Henry Goodridge in the style of Commissioners' Gothic. It is unusual in that the altar is at the west end due to the position in which the church was built. The stained glass windows are near-contemporary copies of windows designed by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. Finally, St Mary's at <b>Innox</b> Hill was built in 1863, by C.E. Giles, as another Chapel of Ease to St John's. It is small with a decorated sanctuary ceiling.|$|E

50|$|The site at <b>Innox</b> Mill, Trowbridge {{was bought}} by the Morrisons {{supermarket}} chain and cleared for redevelopment, except for the Grade II listed three-storey factory building of c. 1875. However the site was sold again in 2016.|$|E

50|$|In 1805, Abraham Bowyer {{set up a}} grocers shop in Trowbridge. He became {{well known}} for his meat products, and {{particularly}} his sausages. As his business developed, Bowyer began to specialise in meat products. Merged with Wiltshire Bacon in Chippenham and Calne, and Harris in Calne, Bowyers {{became part of the}} Marsh Bodiner Group. This allowed a capital injection which resulted in the company's move into <b>Innox</b> Mill, Trowbridge in 1954.|$|E

In early January 2015, the team moved into a gaming house in Corona, California. Unfortunately, due to Bodydrop's flight being delayed, the team needed to use a substitute support player in the ESL Pro Series Season XI, and took an upset loss against Monster Kittens.|$|E

50|$|There was one {{false start}} when Ross Comm tried {{to bite the}} tape as it went to rise. The runners were {{recalled}} and got away at the second attempt despite the calls from Conor O'Dwyer that his mount Native Upmanship was not ready, being left twenty lengths adrift at the start. Shotgun Willy led over the first fence which claimed Juveigneur, Whispered Secret, Tyneandthyneagain, last year's runner up Royal Auclair and the highly fancied <b>Innox,</b> while the fences leading to the sixth, Becher's Brook, also ended the hopes of Baron Windrush at the third, Ross Comm at the fourth and Ebony Light at the fifth, with Just in Debt failing to negotiate the famous sixth.|$|E
50|$|Clan Royal was the long-time ante-post {{favourite}} {{with the}} public {{on the back of}} finishing second in 2004 and being carried out while leading in 2005, as well as being partnered with champion jockey Tony McCoy. But significant money on race day went on the 2005 winner Hedgehunter who was again to be partnered by Ruby Walsh. The pair went off as joint-favourites while other popular choices among the public were Racing Post Chase winner <b>Innox</b> from France, Garvivonnian, the winner of the Becher Chase over one circuit of the National course five months earlier, 2005 Betfred Gold Cup winner Jack High, 2005 Irish Grand National winner Numbersixvalverde, and the grey Ross Comm, considered to have been underestimated in the handicap by 10 lbs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} obtain a three {{dimensional}} picture {{of the distribution of}} air pollutants in the Inn Valley in win-tertime, the field campaign <b>INNOX</b> (NOx-structure in the Inn Valley during High Air Pollution) was carried out in Jan-uary/February 2006. For this purpose continuous ground based measurements were performed. Additionally, vertical profiles of various air pollutants and meteorological parameters were measured throughout the whole valley atmosphere on six selected days. A tethered balloon was used for carrying meteorological devices and an inlet line attached to ground-level on-line instruments in order to cover the lowest atmospheric layers up to 150 m AGL (above ground level). At higher altitudes a research aircraft from MetAi...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} our {{investigation}} is the wintertime boundary {{layer of the}} lower Inn Valley (Austria) during episodes of high air pollution. We investigate physical processes which are responsible for transport and redistribution of pollutants. Our study illuminates the influence of thermally driven winds (valley and slope winds), dynamically driven flows (e. g., foehn winds, low level cold-air advection) and related mechanically and thermally induced turbulence on the spatial structure of air pollutants. Our analysis is based on airborne and ground-based measurements collected on four winter days in 2007 during the joint field experiment of the three research projects INNAP, <b>INNOX</b> and ALPNAP. The dataset consists of airborne aerosol backscatter lidar data as well as airborne and ground-based in situ measurements of chemical and meteorological parameters. Our study highlights the strong case-to-case variability {{of the distribution of}} pollutants due to different meteorological background conditions and different types of local winds...|$|E
40|$|Several Keggin heteropoly acids/salts were {{evaluated}} concerning their activities in adsorbing NOx fromgas stream. All experiments {{were conducted in}} a fixed-bed reactor. The candidate heteropolyacids/salts examined comprise H 4 PVMo 11 O 40, H 5 PV 2 Mo 10 O 40, H 6 PV 3 Mo 9 O 40, (NH 4) 3 PW 12 O 40,(NH 4) 3 PMo 12 O 40, K 3 PW 12 O 40, K 2 HPW 12 O 40, KH 2 PW 12 O 40. Results showed that substitution ofcoordination atom Mo in the [PMo 12 O 40] 3 - anion {{by one or more}} V atoms leads to only slight change <b>inNOx</b> adsorption activity; however, it is {{for the first time that}} nano (NH 4) 3 PW 12 O 40 was found to have anup to 10. 6 % enhancement in NOx adsorption efficiency in comparison with the same catalyst ofnormal particle size; substitution of H+ in H 3 PW 12 O 40 by metal cation tends to lower the adsorption activity,regardless of the metal cations introduced. By IR analysis, NO was found to be adsorbed via interactionwith the proton of HPW structure...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the spatial distribution of air pollutants in the Inn valley (Tyrol, Austria) during wintertime, a joint field campaign of the three research projects ALPNAP (Monitoring and Minimisation of Traffic-Induced Noise and Air Pollution Along Major Alpine Transport Routes), INNAP (Boundary Layer Structure in the Inn Valley during high Air Pollution) and <b>INNOX</b> (NO x -structure in the Inn Valley during High Air Pollution) {{was carried out in}} January/February 2006. In addition to continuous ground based measurements, vertical profiles of various air pollutants and meteorological parameters were obtained on six selected days. For in-situ investigations, a tethered balloon was used to analyse the lowest atmospheric layers, 0 – 500 m above the valley bottom (a. v. b.), and a research aircraft sampled at 150 – 2200 m a. v. b. An aircraft equipped with an aerosol backscatter lidar performed nadir measurements at 3000 m a. v. b. Combined results from a typical day show a strongly polluted layer up to about 125 m a. v. b. in the morning. Around midday concentrations on the valley floor decrease indicating some vertical air exchange despite thermally stable conditions. Strong vertical and horizontal gradients with enhanced pollution levels along the sunny side of the valley up to 1300 m a. v. b. were observed in the afternoon. This vertical mixing due to thermally or dynamically driven slope winds reduces the concentration of air pollutants {{at the bottom of the}} valley and causes the formation of elevated pollution layers...|$|E
