5000|$|<b>Port</b> States: The <b>inspection</b> <b>in</b> <b>ports</b> {{depends on}} whether a Certificate of Maritime Compliance is present (and thus a flag is flown of a country which has {{ratified}} the convention). If the Certificate is present, compliance is to be assumed in principle, and further investigations only take place if the certificate is not in order or there are indications of non-compliance. For ships that don't have the certificate, inspections are much more detailed and should ensure -according to a [...] "no more favorable treatment principle" [...] that the ship has complied with {{the provisions of the}} convention. The convention is thus -indirectly- also valid for ships of non-member countries if they plan to call to ports of a member state.|$|R

50|$|On 15 January 1984, the American {{task group}} turned east {{for the long}} voyage back to Hawaii. After stops in Singapore and Subic Bay, Benjamin Stoddert moored in Pearl Harbor on 22 February. Six days later, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a major {{equipment}} overhaul. During the ensuing 15-month shipyard period, the guided-missile destroyer received new radar and fire-control systems, the navy tactical data system (NTDS), the integrated automatic detection and tracking system (IADTS) and a modernized steam engineering plant. In addition to her combat systems' overhaul, she had her antiship capabilities enhanced by the installation of Harpoon missile launchers. Completing the overhaul on 9 July 1985, Stoddert occupied {{the rest of the}} year with a series of local operations and inspections. These ranged from a joint ASW exercise with Australian and New Zealand warships at sea to the more mundane propulsion plant and ordnance safety <b>inspections</b> while <b>in</b> <b>port.</b>|$|R
40|$|Security {{assurance}} across maritime trading {{systems is}} a critical factor for international business managers and {{in the evolution of}} international trade generally. A number of initiatives are currently underway focusing on security issues <b>in</b> <b>ports</b> and ships (International Ship & Port Security Code), customs <b>inspections</b> <b>in</b> international <b>ports</b> (Container Security Initiative) and whole-of-supply chain outcomes (Customs & Trade Partnership against Terrorism). The main purpose of the above initiatives is to reduce the likelihood of maritime-vectored terrorism; however inappropriate implementation of these programs could affect competitiveness. This paper suggests that the complexity of interaction between ports, maritime operations and supply chains create vulnerabilities that require analysis that extends beyond the structured requirements of these initiatives and creates significant management challenges. Also the paper highlights the need for enhanced crisis management capabilities within ports as part of a standard management repertoire and suggests a new classification scheme for mapping vulnerability within ports and across supply networks. The paper concludes {{that there is a need}} to examine the goodness-of-fit of these security initiatives against business efficiency and competitiveness, and to consider the training needs for crisis management capabilities that will allow private and public sector groups involved in global trade to effectively mitigate the threat of maritime terrorism and loss of competitiveness...|$|R

5000|$|The {{estimated}} {{likelihood of}} contracting gastroenteritis from any cause {{on an average}} 7-day cruise is less than 1%. In 2009, during which more than 13 million people took a cruise, there were nine reported norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships. Outbreak investigations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have shown that transmission among cruise ship passengers is primarily person-to-person; potable water supplies have not been implicated. In 2009, ships undergoing unannounced <b>inspections</b> <b>in</b> U.S. <b>ports</b> received an average CDC Vessel Sanitation Program score of approximately 97 {{out of a total}} possible 100 points. The minimum passing inspection score is 85. Collaboration with the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program and the development of Outbreak Prevention and Response Plans have helped to generally decrease the incidence of norovirus outbreaks on ships. [...] The CDC states that the reasons why noroviruses are associated with cruise ships is because [...] "(1) Health officials track illness on cruise ships. So outbreaks are found and reported more quickly on a cruise ship than on land; (2) Close living quarters may increase the amount of group contact; and (3) New passenger arrivals may bring the virus to other passengers and crew." [...] Data for the year 2015 shows that there were just 11 outbreaks of norovirus illnesses on cruise ships.' ...|$|R

The three exotic species are harmful insects to broadleaved plant species, and much attention is being paid to prevent further introductions and spread in the European Union. Severe phytosanitary measures are applied {{with the aim of}} eradicating outbreaks of the pests.

50|$|It {{does not}} share design and {{ergonomic}} commonalities with the striker-fired centerfire Ruger SR-Series pistols. Mechanically the SR22 significantly deviates from the other Ruger SR-Series pistols. In fact, it is more similar to something like a Walther P22 than a Ruger SR series pistol. The SR22 comes only in compact size, although recently a 4.5 inch barrel version was released. The SR22 is mainly targeted at plinking and competition shooting. The action of the SR22 is of the straight blowback type. It features a stainless steel barrel that is fixed to the frame. Furthermore, the SR22 features a double-action/single-action trigger system with a rounded-spur external hammer, and has a visual <b>inspection</b> <b>port</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of a}} hole {{in the top of the}} slide and the back of the barrel that functions as a loaded chamber indicator. The pistol is very lightweight thanks to its aluminum slide and polymer frame. The pistol also comes with interchangeable rubber grips for different-sized hands. The SR22 started to ship in January 2012 and is shipped with two single stack 10-round magazines and replaceable grips for small or large hands.|$|R
