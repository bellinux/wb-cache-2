25|$|Schwartz and Ballard were {{introduced}} to Keith Prater at the University of Texas chemistry department, and sold him {{on the idea of}} developing a new rechargeable lithium battery technology with them. Prater was able to quickly determine that no one knew what the product of the lithium-salt reactions in existing batteries were, and guessed that it was lithium <b>dithionite,</b> which he was able to synthesize. Working in a trailer, Ballard and Schwartz built a simple battery and Prater brought a sample of the lithium <b>dithionite,</b> and when they were placed together and charged, a weak current was produced. After further development the system was able to be recharged about a dozen times.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} sodium borohydride is {{the production of}} sodium <b>dithionite</b> from sulfur dioxide: Sodium <b>dithionite</b> {{is used as a}} bleaching agent for wood pulp and in the dyeing industry.|$|E
2500|$|Sickling of the {{red blood}} cells, on a blood film, can be induced by the {{addition}} of sodium metabisulfite.

2500|$|A {{second wave}} of {{environmental}} investments started in 1986. A treatment plant for the bark water was completed in 1986 and a central cleaning plant for debarking of the lumber the following year. In 1988 the sedimentary pool was rebuilt and a treatment plant for {{the smoke from the}} bark burning was completed. Bleaching with chlorine was replaced with hydrogen peroxide and sodium <b>dithionite</b> in 1989. This was largely done during a period when most customers demanded the removal of chlorine in products. This demand has since recessed. [...] These investments cost a combined NOK40 million.|$|E
50|$|Sodium <b>dithionite</b> (Na2S2O4), {{also known}} as sodium hydrosulfite, is the other main reagent used to {{brighten}} mechanical pulps. In contrast to hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes the chromophores, <b>dithionite</b> reduces these color-causing groups. <b>Dithionite</b> reacts with oxygen, so efficient use of <b>dithionite</b> requires that oxygen exposure be minimized during its use.|$|E
5000|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} and single-crystal X-ray diffraction {{studies of}} sodium <b>dithionite</b> in the solid state reveal that sodium <b>dithionite</b> exists in different forms.

5000|$|Sodium <b>dithionite</b> {{is often}} used in {{physiology}} experiments {{as a means of}} lowering solutions' redox potential (Eo' [...] -0.66 V vs SHE at pH 7).

In addition, sodium <b>dithionite</b> {{is often used}} in soil chemistry experiments to determine the amount of iron that is not incorporated in primary silicate minerals. Hence, iron extracted by sodium <b>dithionite</b> is also referred to as [...] "free iron." [...] The strong affinity of the <b>dithionite</b> ion for bi- and trivalent metal cations (M2+, M3+) allows it to enhance the solubility of iron, and therefore <b>dithionite</b> is a useful chelating agent.|$|E

In 1881 he published his discovery. Berkeley's formula contained pyrogallol, sulfite and citric acid. Ammonia was added just before use to make the formula alkaline. The new formula was sold by the Platinotype Company in London as Sulpho-Pyrogallol Developer.|$|E
