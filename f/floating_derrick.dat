50|$|USS Captain Dud (ID-3507), later USS YD-43, was a United States Navy <b>floating</b> <b>derrick</b> {{in service}} from 1918 to 1956.|$|E
50|$|Acushnet’s naval service {{continued}} into the summer. Between 11 and 24 June, in company with the tug East Hampton, she towed <b>Floating</b> <b>Derrick</b> No. 21 from Boston to the New York Navy Yard and the <b>floating</b> <b>derrick</b> Hercules thence to Boston. Subsequently, Acushnet proceeded to New London, where she was to assist in mooring and handling G-2 (Submarine No. 27) during depth charge and net experiments in nearby Niantic Bay. Tragically, on 30 July 1919, the submersible suddenly flooded and sank, drowning three of the six-man inspection team then on board.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{completion}} of the yard work, Acushnet sailed for Newport, R.I., to tow a <b>floating</b> <b>derrick</b> from Newport to Hampton Roads, departing the former port at 09:00 on 24 February. Bad weather forced the ship and her valuable tow to put into New York on 28 February until improved conditions permitted her to resume her voyage.|$|E
50|$|With {{the help}} of steam tugs and two <b>floating</b> <b>derricks,</b> Sweepstakes was brought to Brooklyn Navy Yard for {{inspection}} and repairs.|$|R
50|$|Forms of {{derricks}} {{are commonly}} found aboard ships and at docking facilities. Some large derricks are mounted on dedicated vessels, and known as <b>floating</b> <b>derricks</b> and sheerlegs.|$|R

5000|$|Captain Dud {{was built}} in 1914 as the {{commercial}} wooden, pontoon-hull, steel A-frame <b>floating</b> <b>derrick</b> Captain Dud S507 by S. Flory at Bangor, Pennsylvania; her design included a copper-sheathed house. In 1918 the U.S. Navy acquired her from her owner, the Thames Towboat Company of New London, Connecticut, for use during World War I, assigned her the naval registry identification number 3507, and placed her in service as USS Captain Dud (ID-3507).|$|E
50|$|Derrick Boat No. 8, {{also known}} as DB 8, is a {{historic}} <b>floating</b> <b>derrick</b> located at Oswego, Oswego County, New York. It was built in 1927, {{and it is one}} of the few surviving steam-powered floating derricks to have worked on the New York State Barge Canal. It has a 75 foot by 28 foot hull composed of both riveted and welded heavy steel plate. The site of the vessel’s caretaker is the H. Lee White Marine Museum.|$|E
5000|$|The Left Coast Lifter is a <b>floating</b> <b>derrick</b> barge or sheerleg {{which was}} built {{to assist in the}} eastern span {{replacement}} of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The barge carries a shear legs crane which is the largest barge crane ever used on the West Coast. The barge's name is taken from [...] "Left Coast", a slang term for the West Coast of the United States (which appears {{on the left side of}} a typical map and also refers to the region's liberal, or [...] "left leaning", political tradition).|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} execute the large and complex {{maritime}} projects which were its stock in trade, Steers possessed a sizable stock of heavy equipment and vehicles. In addition to numerous cranes, <b>floating</b> <b>derricks</b> and pile drivers, this included over 50 deck scows and a fleet of 10 tugboats led by the company's [...] "flagship" [...] vessel, the J. Rich Steers. At {{the time of the}} company's closure, most of the corporate equipment went to Weeks Marine in Cranford, New Jersey.|$|R
50|$|Two graving docks at Hunter's Point {{that could}} {{accommodate}} the largest ocean-going vessels, five floating drydocks, eight marine railways, four shearleg <b>derricks</b> and ten <b>floating</b> boom <b>derricks</b> were available.|$|R
25|$|Following the Morgan {{takeover}} in 1850, Quintard {{embarked on}} an extensive improvement program for the Works, installing steam hammers, a <b>floating</b> steam <b>derrick</b> and other heavy equipment, as well as building a new dockyard on the East River. Quintard also began diversifying the firm's products, manufacturing machinery for Cuban sugar mills and large pumps for a Chicago water company.|$|R
50|$|The Daresbury was {{constructed}} in 1772 by a boat builder named Samuel Edwards. By 1792-96 she was employed on the Weaver Navigation carrying coals. It is {{thought that she was}} lengthened in the early 1800s. At some time in the 19th century, possibly in 1864, she was converted into a <b>floating</b> <b>derrick.</b> Repairs were carried out on the vessel in 1926 and in 1934, and she was still afloat in 1956. She was moved to Sutton Locks on the River Weaver in 1985 and sunk. Plans were made to recover and restore her and to move her to the National Waterways Museum at Ellesmere Port, but these were found to be impractical and were abandoned.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1928, Acushnet cleared the sea lanes of two menaces to navigation. The first {{consisted}} of the wreckage of a wooden ship which she picked up some 5 {{miles south of the}} Northeast Light vessel at the entrance to Delaware Bay and towed inside the Delaware breakwater where the Lewes, Del., station crew beached it. The second was another mass of wreckage (possibly from the same vessel) in the same general area which she handled {{in the same manner as}} she had used with the first. The following November, the Coast Guard destroyer USCGD Henley (CG-12) spotted a derelict — the <b>floating</b> <b>derrick</b> Van Frank No. 2 and turned it over to Acushnet, which towed it into Sandy Hook Bay and secured it on 10 November 1928. Ironically, the same ships picked up the same derelict exactly one year later, on 10 November 1929, merely repeating the procedure.|$|E

50|$|When {{the work}} on bridges began beyond Knights Key, Coe {{outsourced}} {{the setting of the}} steel to various contractors. As this method proved unsuccessful, the operations were put exclusively in the hands of Coes own men. The deck girder spans were brought to the piers on barges, and were then lifted and set in place by <b>floating</b> <b>derricks.</b> The railway gangers completed their tasks in less than half the time taken by the contractors. On one occasion, six spans were placed in position within four hours, while on another the laborers erected a span in twenty minutes. The Bahia Honda bridge was built by means of temporary timber framework and an overhead travelling crane. The precautions taken to ensure the workers safety were such that not a life was lost during the erection of the 32,900 ft. of steel that went to the building of Knights Key and Bahia Honda bridges.|$|R
50|$|Designated {{for duty}} with Service Division 101 in the Pacific, ATA-187 {{completed}} shakedown early in January 1945, and departed New Orleans for Hawaii on the 18th with APL-10 in tow. She reached Pearl Harbor on 4 March; exchanged the barracks ship for two lighters; and continued across the Pacific. At Guam, she changed tows again and sailed for the Ryukyus pulling two <b>floating</b> <b>derricks.</b> On 22 April, she delivered her charges to the Hagushi anchorage, Okinawa; then, retraced her route back to Guam, whence {{she made a}} second run, with a power barge and a yard ferry, to Okinawa. She completed that run at Buckner Bay on 22 May; assisted in downing an enemy bomber the next day; and, {{at the end of}} the month, departed for Ulithi and the Philippines. From the former, she towed an oil barge and two lighters to the latter, arriving in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 27 June.|$|R
5000|$|The Port of New York {{was really}} eleven ports in one. It boasted a {{developed}} shoreline of over 650 mi comprising the waterfronts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island {{as well as}} the New Jersey shoreline from Perth Amboy to Elizabeth, Bayonne, Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken and Weehawken. The Port of New York included some 1,800 docks, piers, and wharves of every conceivable size, condition, and state of repair. Some 750 were classified as [...] "active" [...] and 200 were able to berth 425 ocean-going vessels simultaneously in addition to the 600 able to anchor in the harbor. These docks and piers gave access to 1,100 warehouses containing some 41000000 sq ft of inclosed storage space. In addition, the Port of New York had thirty-nine active shipyards, not including the huge New York Naval Shipyard on the Brooklyn side of the East River. These facilities included nine big ship repair yards, thirty-six large dry-docks, twenty-five small shipyards, thirty-three locomotive and gantry cranes of fifty ton lift capacity or greater, five <b>floating</b> <b>derricks,</b> and more than one hundred tractor cranes. Over 575 tugboats worked the Port of New York.|$|R
50|$|The Stiffleg derrick, {{also known}} as a Scotch derrick, is a derrick with a boom similar to a guy derrick, but instead of using guy wires to secure the top of the mast, it uses two or more stiff members, called stifflegs, which are capable of {{resisting}} either tensile or compressive forces. Sills may also be used to connect between the bottom ends of the stifflegs and the base of the mast. There may be a counterweight to place on the sills behind the stifflegs in heavy load lifting. Stiffleg derrick on a vessel is called a <b>floating</b> stiffleg <b>derrick.</b> Derricks are especially useful for high rise rigging, jobs that cover a long period of time, or jobs when the impact to the street/pedestrian traffic is a concern.|$|R
5000|$|In an A-frame derrick, {{the tower}} {{is set up}} from two poles or masts with their bottom ends spread {{from each other and}} their top ends joint together. There are {{crossbars}} to connect the two poles, forming a letter [...] "A" [...] shape tower. The tower is ground anchored to provide support. A boom is hinged from the lowest cross bar and extends outward and upward. The top end of the boom is connected to a pulley system which is connected {{to the top of the}} tower. Manipulating the pulley system will allow the boom to change the angle against the tower. There is another pulley system to connect to the top of the boom for load lifting. When an A-frame derrick is used in a vessel, it is called <b>floating</b> A-frame <b>derrick.</b>|$|R
