5|$|Winmark Corporation is an American <b>franchisor</b> of five retail {{businesses}} {{that specialize in}} buying and selling used goods. The company is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Winmark was founded in 1988 as Play It Again Sports Franchise Corporation by Ron Olson and Jeffrey Dahlberg after they purchased the Play It Again Sports franchise rights from Martha Morris. They renamed the company to Grow Biz International Inc. in June 1993. Grow Biz went public in August 1993. In 2000, John Morgan replaced Dahlberg as CEO and renamed the company to Winmark in 2001. Morgan rescued Winmark from the verge of bankruptcy by selling financially failing franchise concepts and stores and replacing the management team. The company's strategy was to move from owning stores itself to having franchisees own all the stores.|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{growth in}} {{business format franchising}} as an international business model is widely reported. This paper reviews the status of international franchising by Australian <b>franchisors.</b> A comprehensive study {{of the population of}} Australian <b>franchisors</b> was conducted to examine the motivational incentives and barriers to offshore expansion. In particular, data was gathered on preferred international locations, international franchising strategies and modes of entry, pre-internationalisation activities and factors impeding the overseas expansion. Consistent with previous research, results show that larger and more experienced <b>franchisors</b> seek to grow their organisations through expanding to host countries. Master franchising and joint ventures are preferred modes of entry, and many <b>franchisors</b> locally adapted systems and processes in transferring their business concepts to different cultural and regulatory environments. In opposition to recent research, Australian <b>franchisors</b> placed lesser emphasis on macroeconomic influences upon the decision to internationalise.

40|$|In this paper, we {{initially}} {{study the}} capital structure problem in franchising firms. The {{primary goal of}} this study is to examine what factors affect franchisee’s and <b>franchisor’s</b> capital structure decisions, and how these decisions are interrelated. On one hand, we examine whether and how outlet-specific characteristics influence franchisee’s capital structure; on the other hand we empirically tested the standard capital structure theories under the franchising setting. Finally, we study how <b>franchisor’s</b> capital structure is affected by the setting of franchisee’s capital structure. Our study also shed light on the capital structure literature focusing on SMEs since the franchising firms in our sample are mostly small and medium sized firms. We find that the outlet-specific factors like outlet size, hard type franchising and none-food retailing industry may significantly affect franchisee’s optimal leverage ratio. As for the <b>franchisor’s</b> capital structure, our study corroborates the predictions of standard capital structure theories. We find that firm-specific factors like tangibility, past growth and liquidity can significantly affect <b>franchisor’s</b> leverage and growth opportunity and none-debt tax shields have a strong influence on <b>franchisor’s</b> maturity. Finally, we find evidence supporting our primary prediction that <b>franchisor’s</b> capital structure is adjusted based on the franchisee’s capital structure decision.

40|$|A key {{decision}} for entrepreneurs in many retail and service firms is whether, and how much, to use franchising. If {{the decision is}} made to franchise, the actor may assume one of two "identities" or tactics: (1) the "chain builder," who uses a blend of company and franchised outlets, and (2) the "turnkey," who sells business opportunities but does not own any outlets.

We argue that <b>franchisors</b> use the chain building strategy {{to strike a balance}} between standardization and innovation by building resources that foster trust and encourage knowledge sharing with franchisees. In contrast, for turnkeys, a valuable set of operational routines is the critical strategic resource. To better appreciate how <b>franchisors</b> choose between the chain builder and turnkey strategies, we gathered survey information from 263 <b>franchisors.</b> Via this data, and as described herein, we learned that <b>franchisors</b> perform better when they invest in resources that best support their selected strategy.
