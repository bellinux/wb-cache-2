40|$|This study {{investigates the}} factors that lead to a {{diversity}} of profitability among <b>defense</b> <b>contractors,</b> a topic largely ignored by prior studies. We use regression analysis to test whether the profitability of <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> is significantly associated with factors that are hypothesized to cause the diversity of profitability among <b>defense</b> <b>contractors.</b> We find that <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> assuming higher risks, being more innovation-oriented, and being more influential could earn higher profitability from their defense business than other <b>defense</b> <b>contractors,</b> but <b>defense</b> business in general seems to be less profitable than commercial business. Our {{evidence suggests that the}} profitability of <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> is reasonable with respect to rewarding risk and innovation. This study provides new light on the reasonableness of defense contractors’ profitability and also provides useful evidence {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the Department of Defense in implementing its stated profit policy...|$|R
40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze the level of emphasis placed on the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) categories (health and safety, environment, diversity, human rights, discretionary, and corporate) between <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> and companies that receive the majority of their revenues from commercial sources. Five companies were selected from each of the following three groups: <b>defense</b> <b>contractors,</b> top CSR companies, and largest companies from a diverse industry base. The results indicate that <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> place less emphasis on the CSR categories than those companies that receive their revenues from commercial sources. Specifically, <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> were rated lower in the human rights and corporate categories.

EG was a <b>defense</b> <b>contractor</b> of the United States government and dealt with sensitive information and science. In 1975, this required Van den Berg to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. Van den Berg gathered years of research and management experience {{in the preparation of}} crystalline materials—in particular, the growth of single crystals of chemical compounds, and the investigation of associated defect chemistry and electronic properties. He became an international authority on vapor growth techniques with an emphasis on mercuric iodide crystals and its application in the nuclear industry as gamma ray detectors. During his work at EG, Van den Berg asked NASA for permission to conduct crystal growth experiments in space, which NASA approved.|$|E

The first level is that of the financial condition of the defense industry in the aggregate. The second level is that of the individual <b>defense</b> <b>contractors.</b> The major findings of this study are that: 1) the aggregate industry of <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> has experienced a declining financial condition from 1975 to 1990; 2) a positive relationship seems to exist between the financial condition of the defense industry and the amount of defense spending; 3) no consistent relationship between the financial condition of the individual <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> and the amount of defense spending is apparent.

The Army decided that Ruffing could serve in a non-combat role. Ruffing missed the 1943 and 1944 seasons due to his service during World War II. He served in the Sixth Ferrying Group of the Air Transport Command of the United States Army Air Forces at the rank of private. However, he did pitch for the Air Transport Command's baseball team, throwing a perfect game against Joe DiMaggio's team, and leading his team to the championship against Ted Lyons' team. In 1944, he played with an All-Star team for troops stationed in Hawaii.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWang and San Miguel report that U. S. <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> earn excessive profits {{relative to their}} industry peers. This work provides the first evidence that this phenomenon is not restricted to the United States. By applying Wang and San Miguel’s innovative industry-year-size match, we found that German <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> earn economically significant, excessive profits. The comparison between German and U. S. <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> revealed similar patterns in both countries. The statistical evidence for excessive profitability is stronger for the measurements return on assets (ROA) and return on common shareholder’s equity (ROCE), while the findings for profit margin ratio (PMR) and operating margin ratio (OMR) are statistically less significant. The comparison of the regulatory environment of the United States and Germany showed that the contracting rules of both countries emphasize competition among <b>defense</b> <b>contractors,</b> but the perspectives on and uses of profit and fees differ for cost-based contracts. In the United States, profit and fees are used to share the risk of rising costs between <b>defense</b> <b>contractors</b> and the government.
